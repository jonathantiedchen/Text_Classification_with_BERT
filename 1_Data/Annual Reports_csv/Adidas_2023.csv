Alternative performance measures 
adidas uses ‘Alternative Performance Measures’ (‘APM’) in its regulatory and mandatory publications that 
may represent so called non-GAAP-measures."
"An overview of these alternative performance measures 
can be found on our website."
"Bjørn, you have now completed your first full year at the helm of adidas."
I think it was a positive year in the sense that a lot of positive things happened vis-à-vis our consumer.
"At 
the beginning of the year, we had little success when it comes to the sell-through of our product."
"But then, 
during the year, we had a couple of franchises in the Lifestyle area starting to do very well."
"And they 
actually continue to develop very well in 2024."
"First it was the Terrace trend with Samba, Gazelle, and 
Spezial, but then also Campus accelerated at the back end of the year."
"We have been steadily increasing 
the supply to better please the demand of the consumer and, of course, to also give our retail partners 
good sell-throughs."
"In the Performance area, the launch of the Predator was fantastic."
"This football franchise is probably the 
best we have ever had."
"In Running, our athletes continued to win a lot of races and break records."
"With the 
Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 we have the shoe that set completely new standards in terms of performance."
"This will take a while, but it’s a positive start."
"Even in basketball, and I say even because 
that’s probably the area where we haven’t had the biggest success in the past, the Anthony Edwards 
signature shoe has been selling out every time we launch a new colorway."
"Improving the relationship with the retailers was one of your priorities for 
2023."
"Since we have better products in the market and consumer demand is higher, more and more retailers 
would like to buy more from us now, which is positive, of course."
"You have to remember that we started 
the year 2023 with a lot of inventory in our own warehouses, but also in the warehouses of our retail 
partners."
Sell-through was not good and discounts were high.
"It took a while to replace the bad inventory 
with good inventory."
And it’s probably fair to say that many of the retailers were skeptical at the beginning.
"But I have the feeling that during the course of the year, they have seen that the pipeline of our products 
works."
They have seen that they can make money with us.
"As a result, the trust in adidas has started to 
come back."
"I hope that the retailers see that we are a company that really wants to be a partner and that 
they see this all over the world."
"That’s a big change from being a DTC-led company, which we were twelve months ago."
"I would say that 
the relationship between the retailers and us is also improving in the way we talk and work with each 
other."
"More importantly, the results for the retailers are starting to show."
"When retailers sell more with a 
better margin of a brand, they like to do more."
I don’t know if I changed so much.
"I think if you look at the different categories, then in the Lifestyle area, 
it’s obvious that we have been very classic-driven."
"We have been very strong on the courtside, which is 
Terrace and now also Campus."
"What I tried to do is to scale that at the right speed at the right time to build 
and keep the heat."
"We continue to do collabs and limited editions on all the franchises, but at the same 
time we also make sure that we increase production and give the retailers more of the products that work."
And then we do takedowns of the trends that are happening on the more commercial side.
"We are doing 
this on the courtside, and now we have started to do the same in running lifestyle."
"SL72 and Country are 
two shoes coming out of our archive that we saw potential in."
"SL72 is also a Terrace shoe, but in an old 
running style."
"So far, it has done very well."
"And then on top of what we do on the classic side, because of 
the lack of newness in running lifestyle, we have initiated many projects when it gets to completely new 
silhouettes."
Many of those are seeded into the market as we speak.
"The goal is that we will have new 
running silhouettes in the Lifestyle area that the market has never seen before at the back end of this year 
to be scaled in 2025 and beyond."
Here we also looked at what kind of products do we have in the different categories that are ready to go.
And we have accelerated quite a few of them.
"In running, as I said, the whole Adizero range is very, very 
successful from a performance point of view."
"Now the goal is to scale running also into other price points and to focus more on 
the comfort and the value side of running."
"With the new Supernova, which we just launched, and a 
completely new UltraBoost and Adistar later in the year, the product pipeline looks very strong."
"And when 
it comes to distribution, it will be about having sales reps servicing running specialty again and being more 
ingrained in the running community where the action is happening."
"In football, we have what we need from a product, a player, and a team point of view."
"So here we will 
continue the strategy as is."
"In basketball, we’ve done a lot of work."
"I’m very, very convinced that all our 
signature shoes for players like Anthony Edwards, James Harden, and Damian Lillard are a lot better in 
2024 than they had been before."
And I mentioned it before: The first positive results are already coming in.
I am also very happy with the initial results of Fear of God.
"College teams in the NCAA now even play in 
Fear of God jerseys."
"In outdoor, we have the right product with Terrex."
"We have now started to 
commercialize it, also by taking it down to more commercial price points."
"Also here the task is more to get 
a better distribution."
"And last but not least, Sportswear: We refocused the business unit to make sure that the entire range is 
more commercial, that we work closer with the accounts, that we become more local."
"I am pleased to see 
that our teams have now connected much better with the market, both with retailers and with the 
consumer."
"When it comes to marketing, the strategy is to be visible in sports."
"Not only the big sports, but also the 
smaller sports, if you can even call them smaller because some of them are really meaningful in their 
region."
"We invested into cricket in India, we extended our partnership with the All Blacks in rugby."
"We are 
trying to sign partners across all sports again for the Olympics."
"Of course, we will not be able to sign 
everyone we want, but I think the attitude, again, is to be visible in many sports that adidas previously had 
left and to clearly show up as the best sports brand again."
"Many adidas athletes performed extremely well in 2023 and in the first months 
of 2024: Tigist Assefa, Jude Bellingham, Noah Lyles, Patrick Mahomes, Lionel 
Messi, Mikaela Shiffrin – just to mention a very few."
"First of all, we need athletes, teams, and federations that perform."
"Of course, you would like to be with 
winners."
"And then secondly, you would like to have people and teams and federations with the right adidas 
attitude."
I think the ones you mentioned have exactly that.
"Seeing Mahomes leading his team in the Super 
Bowl to victory again in our product is simply great."
"He’s a fantastic athlete with a great attitude and he fits 
our brand extremely well."
"It’s the same with the fastest man in the world, Noah Lyles."
"Or watching Shiffrin 
skiing down the mountains and breaking records."
"These are all examples of great performing athletes 
who also have a great personality that fits our brand so well."
I am proud that we can work with them.
"In my 
opinion, we have the best group of athletes and sports marketing partners that you can dream about."
Consumers see the changes particularly in the Lifestyle area.
"Here we are currently trending in a way 
adidas hasn’t done for a long time."
"At many retailers, we have the best sell-through in years, which means 
that more consumers are buying our products again."
"As a consequence, consumer sentiment towards 
adidas is turning positive in almost every market."
So brand desire has clearly increased.
"I always repeat 
the same thing: I don’t think the consumer ever had anything against adidas."
"I just think we were not 
visible and maybe not commercial enough in the way that we went to market."
"And we’re reversing a lot of 
that as we speak."
"This year will be a year of sports, with the UEFA EURO 2024 and the Copa 
América in football, the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris all taking 
place this summer."
"They all play a little bit of a different role, but what they have in common is that after years of covid and 
difficult circumstances for big events with no spectators or limited access, it’s the first year again where 
everything is largely back to normal."
"I think both athletes and spectators are looking forward to 
participating in big events and to celebrating sports and being together again."
"The summer of sport starts 
with the UEFA EURO in our home market Germany, which, of course, is very special."
"We all remember the 
fantastic atmosphere of the football World Cup 2006 in Germany and I think we will see the same again 
this year."
"It will be a very important event, not only for sports, but for people's mindset in general."
"But the Olympics and Paralympics both create global and 
local heroes."
And they make sport play a bigger role in people's life all over the world.
"That’s why in 
general they have a positive impact on sports companies and especially adidas which is the Olympic brand 
when you look back at our history."
"It is really good for us that these sports events all happen in 2024, 
because that fits perfectly with our plan to be the best sports brand again."
"It is also perfect timing with the 
product pipeline and the plans we have for 2024 and beyond."
I LOVE TO SEE AND DO SPORTS.
You are a big sports fan.
I look forward to all sports events.
It doesn’t matter what it is.
"If it’s a Bundesliga game or if it’s a national 
championship, a college tournament or the Olympics, I don’t really separate between the events."
"I love to 
see and do sports."
"So there’s enough to look 
forward to and it would be kind of unfair to only pick one."
"adidas will have an extra moment to celebrate this year as it is also the 
company’s 75th anniversary."
"For me personally, the 75 as a number doesn’t mean so much because it doesn’t matter if you’re 75 or 76 
or 80."
The most important thing is which legacy these 75 years have created for the company.
"We have 
such a great sports history, both with products and athletes."
"Everything you see today is built on this 
foundation."
There is no company in the world that has such a heritage in sports.
"When you visit our archive 
and see what we have in there, then you know what I am talking about."
"Therefore, the 75th anniversary 
gives us an enormous knowledge and product base to build on."
That’s very unique for our company.
The success in Lifestyle maybe came quicker than we had expected.
"And the consumer reacted positively 
to our brand, quicker than I thought."
"I think I said it when I started at adidas last year: The product pipeline 
that everybody complained about was much better than people said it was."
"And adidas had already all the 
ingredients to be successful."
"It was just that they were not put together in a way that they were visible 
enough."
"In general, although we need time to also get the financial results back to former strength, there 
are so many good things happening in this company – clearly many more than any negative things."
"All in 
all, I think we were a little bit further at the end of 2023 than what I expected when we started."
"Well, there’s always challenges."
"I think that the negativity around the company at the beginning was quite 
tough to manage."
"But I think we are in much better territory today and can now focus on the many positive 
things."
One thing we clearly need to continue to tackle is our internal complexity.
"Although we increased 
our agility, it still takes us too long to make decisions."
"But we’re on that and I feel that the attitude and the 
adidas DNA to do stuff is starting to come through again."
The pipeline of products that is going out to the market will continue to improve quarter by quarter.
"Therefore, the size of the poor performing inventory, not so much in terms of age, but in terms of overall 
product strength, that we still have in the trade will actually become less and less compared to good 
inventory."
"As a result, sales growth should accelerate quarter by quarter."
"The external factors are, of 
course, something nobody can control."
"When we started a year ago, we didn’t have a crisis in the Middle 
East, we didn’t have the Red Sea issue."
We all had hoped that the war in the Ukraine would end.
"Now we 
know that this is unfortunately not the case."
So we are still living in a very uncertain world.
"But I think the 
companies that are agile and flexible in a volatile world will win."
"And that’s part of our strategy to be agile 
and flexible."
"One year ago, we described where we were and where we should go."
"By now, I think we confirmed that we 
have the ingredients to start turning things around in 2023, be a better company in 2024, be a good 
company in 2025, and then be a good and profitable company in 2026."
"From where we are today, 
everything else being equal in the external world, I am confident that this will happen."
"As a management 
team, it is our goal to do things short term that are also right long term."
"We are not trying to impress 
anybody short-term by doing something stupid in one quarter to look good that has a negative impact 
maybe in a year’s time."
"Our goal is to build adidas back again to be the best sports brand and the best 
sports company in the world, step by step."
"A company where people are happy to work, that retailers see 
as a partner, and where consumers like our product."
"With everything we know today, that means we can 
be a company that grows double digits each year and has a double-digit operating margin."
"It’s doable 
within the timeline that we talked about."
WE HAVE A VERY GLOBAL AND DIVERSE WORKFORCE WITH PEOPLE THAT CAN BRING THIS COMPANY TO THE TOP AGAIN.
They are the reason that we can have the plan.
"You have to remember that adidas is the brand and the 
people."
I am 100% sure that we have the talents we need.
"We have a very global and diverse workforce 
with people that can bring this company to the top again."
"I think we need to make sure that we find the 
right structure and the right processes so that our talented people are able to do their job."
"And that’s what 
we are in the process of doing."
"But, again, people are the most important factor that our company has and 
always will be."
You cannot replace people with machines or computers.

* Employee representative.
"10 Since November 28, 2023."
* Employee representative.
"The appointment of Bjørn Gulden as new CEO effective January 1 
paved the way for a successful restart of the company."
"The overall business environment continued to be 
characterized by geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic challenges, and elevated inventory levels."
"Against 
this backdrop, the company performed significantly better than initially expected as it put the focus back 
on its core: people, product, consumers, retail partners, and athletes."
"This started to pay off as brand 
momentum began to re-accelerate driven by the Terrace trend in Lifestyle and game-changing innovation 
in Performance."
"The company improved the relationship to its retailers and invested into broadening its 
portfolio of sports partners."
"In addition, adidas successfully reduced high inventory levels by limiting the 
sell-in to the wholesale channel and clearing excess stock."
"This was essential to be able to return to a 
healthier business mix going forward."
"In addition, adidas was able to conduct two drops of the remaining 
Yeezy products."
"As a result, the write-off and destruction of the products could be avoided, and the 
company made significant donations from the proceeds."
"Consequently, despite the challenging market 
environment, adidas was able to upgrade its full year guidance twice in the course of 2023 and ultimately 
posted top- and bottom-line results significantly above the increasing expectations."
"This reflects the 
operational and financial progress made during the year and provides a stronger foundation for further 
improvements in 2024 and a successful 2025 and 2026."
"Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board 
In the year under review, we performed all of our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of Association, the 
German Corporate Governance Code (‘Code’), and the Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously, as 
in previous years."
"We regularly advised the Executive Board on the management of the company, as well 
as diligently and continuously supervised its management activities."
"The Executive Board involved us 
directly and in a timely and comprehensive manner in all of the company’s fundamental decisions."
The Executive Board informed us extensively and regularly through written and oral reports.
"This 
information covered all relevant aspects of the company’s strategic direction, business planning (including 
finance, investment, and personnel planning), the business development, and the company’s financial 
position and profitability."
"We were also kept up to date on matters relating to accounting processes, the 
risk situation, the adequacy and further development of the internal Control and Risk Management 
Systems, and compliance, as well as all major decisions and business transactions."
"Furthermore, the 
Executive Board always reported immediately and thoroughly on any deviations in business performance 
from the plans."
"In the year under review, such deviations were attributable, in particular, to the handling of 
the existing Yeezy inventory, the reduction of elevated inventory levels, the impact of foreign exchange 
developments, and the negative business development in North America."
"Furthermore, we received regular comprehensive written reports from the Executive Board for the 
preparation of our meetings."
"We thus always had the opportunity to critically analyze the Executive Board’s 
reports and resolution proposals within the committees and the entire Supervisory Board and to put 
forward suggestions before passing resolutions based on in-depth examination and thorough consultation."
"At the Supervisory Board meetings, the Executive Board was available for discussions and for answering 
our questions."
"In the periods between our meetings, the Executive Board also provided us with extensive 
monthly reports on the current business situation."
"We critically examined and scrutinized the information 
provided by the Executive Board."
"Members who were unable to participate in the meetings took part in the resolutions by submitting their 
votes in writing."
"In the year under review, the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees took 
place both as physical and virtual meetings."
"The latest videoconferencing technology was used to ensure 
an open and appropriate discussion between the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board within the 
virtual meetings."
"Furthermore, PwC attended all 
meetings of the Audit Committee."
"In addition, the Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board and, as applicable, the entire Supervisory Board, were informed about events of

In the year under review, there were no conflicts of interest among the members of either the Supervisory 
Board or the Executive Board."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the brand ambassador agreement 
between adidas and the Supervisory Board member Jackie Joyner-Kersee does not constitute a conflict of 
interest with regard to her role on the Supervisory Board."
"Examination of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements  
Following the Supervisory Board’s proposal, which was based on the Audit Committee’s recommendation, 
the 2022 Annual General Meeting appointed PwC as auditor and Group auditor for the 2023 financial year."
"Prior to this, PwC had confirmed to both the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee that there are no 
circumstances which could prejudice their independence as auditor or cast doubt on their independence."
"In this respect, PwC also declared the extent to which non-audit services were rendered for the company 
in the previous financial year or are contractually agreed for the following year."
"This also applies to the 2023 annual financial statements of 
adidas AG, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the German Commercial Code, and the 
combined Management Report of adidas AG and the adidas Group."
"The financial statements, the proposal on 
the appropriation of retained earnings, and the reports of the auditor of the annual financial statements 
and consolidated financial statements were distributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board 
members in a timely manner."
"At both meetings, the auditor reported on the material results of the audit, 
inter alia with regard to the audit focus points agreed and key audit matters, and was available for 
questions, providing additional information."
"The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses of the 
Internal Control and Risk Management Systems with regard to the accounting process."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board 
thoroughly discussed and approved the Executive Board’s proposal concerning the appropriation of 
retained earnings for the 2023 financial year."
"Based on our own examinations of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements 
(including the non-financial statement), we came to the conclusion that there are no objections to be 
raised."
"Therefore, following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board agreed 
with the auditor’s audit results and approved the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board, 
including the non-financial statement, for the 2023 financial year."
"The annual financial statements were 
thus adopted."
"PwC has been acting as auditor and Group auditor for adidas AG since the year under 
review."
"As the responsible audit partners since the 2023 financial year, the auditors Rainer Kroker and 
Christian Landau have signed the financial statements."
"Expression of thanks 
On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I wish to thank the current Executive Board and all our 
employees around the world for their great personal dedication and ongoing commitment."
"I would also 
like to express my gratitude for the enduring trust and cooperation between the employee and 
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"Moreover, I would like to thank Roland Auschel and Brian Grevy, who resigned from the Executive Board at 
the end of March 2023, and Amanda Rajkumar, who resigned from the Executive Board in July 2023, for 
their numerous important contributions and their commitment to adidas."
"We are convinced that good corporate governance is an essential 
basis for sustainable corporate success and strengthens the trust placed in our company by our 
shareholders, business partners, and employees, as well as the financial markets."
"The following 
declaration refers to the recommendations of the ‘Government Commission on the German Corporate 
Governance Code’ in the version of April 28, 2022, published in the Federal Gazette on June 27, 2022 
(‘Code’)."
"Ian Gallienne 
is Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (‘GBL’)."
"GBL is a holding company that is regularly 
represented in the supervisory bodies of portfolio companies as an institutional investor, inter alia, by its 
Chief Executive Officer."
"All companies (apart from adidas AG) in which Ian Gallienne is a member of the 
supervisory body are portfolio companies or subsidiaries of GBL or are under joint control of GBL and 
therefore belong to the same group of companies."
"They have to be attributed to his main occupation as 
Chief Executive Officer of GBL."
"We are of the opinion that in accordance with its rationale, recommendation C.5 alternative 1 of the Code 
is thus not applicable to Ian Gallienne."
"For precautionary reasons, however, a deviation is declared."
"The 
Supervisory Board has also assured itself that Ian Gallienne has sufficient time to duly perform his duties 
as a member of the Supervisory Board of adidas AG."
"Recommendation C.5  
As already declared in July 2023, the former mandate of Chief Executive Officer Bjørn Gulden at Essity 
Aktiebolag (publ.), a listed stock corporation under the laws of the Kingdom of Sweden, has ended in the 
meantime."
"Consequently, there is no longer any deviation from recommendation C.5 of the Code due to 
non-group mandates held by Bjørn Gulden."
"Recommendation C.5 Alternative 2  
The Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Thomas Rabe, is also Chief Executive Officer of the listed 
company RTL Group S.A., Luxembourg."
"In this respect, the company deviates from recommendation C.5 
alternative 2 of the Code."
"However, the Supervisory Board is convinced that Thomas Rabe’s mandate at 
RTL Group S.A."
does not affect the due performance of his duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
"Rajkumar is not obliged to invest the amount attributable 
to the long-term variable compensation into adidas AG shares."
"Furthermore, the lock-up period for adidas 
AG shares from the 2021 tranche of the long-term variable compensation was terminated early."

Dual board system 
As a globally operating stock corporation with its registered seat in Herzogenaurach, Germany, adidas AG 
is subject to, inter alia, the provisions of German stock corporation law."
"A dual board system, which 
assigns the management of the company to the Executive Board and advice and supervision of the 
Executive Board to the Supervisory Board, is one of the fundamental principles of German stock 
corporation law."
These two boards are strictly separated in terms of both members and competencies.
"However, both boards cooperate closely in the interest of the company."
"Composition and working methods of the Executive Board 
The composition of our Executive Board reflects the international structure of our company."
"Due to Amanda Rajkumar’s departure upon expiry of July 15, 2023, the Executive Board temporarily 
consisted of four members."
"With effect from January 1, 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Michelle 
Robertson as Executive Board member responsible for Global Human Resources, People and Culture."
"She 
had previously already led this area as interim Head of Global HR."
"Thus, the Executive Board once again 
consists of five members."
"The Executive Board is responsible for independently managing the company with the aim of sustainable 
value creation in the best interests of the company, developing the company’s strategic orientation, 
coordinating it with the Supervisory Board, and ensuring its implementation."
"Furthermore, it determines 
business objectives, the company’s policy, and the organization of the Group."
"In this respect, the Executive 
Board also systemically assesses risks and opportunities for the company linked with social and 
environmental factors as well as the environmental and social impact of its business activities."
"Moreover, 
the Executive Board is responsible for preparing the quarterly statements, the half-year report, and the 
annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, as well as the combined Management 
Report of adidas AG and the Group."
"It also prepares a combined non-financial statement for the company 
and the Group."
"The Executive Board also provides employees with the opportunity 
to report, in an appropriate and protected manner, suspected legal infringements within the company."
"The 
Executive Board is tied to the company’s interests and obligated to strive for a sustainable increase in the 
value of the company."
"Notwithstanding the Executive Board’s joint responsibility for managing the company, the Executive Board 
members are individually responsible for managing their respective operations in accordance with the 
Business Allocation Plan for the Executive Board."
There are no Executive Board committees.
"The Executive Board members continually report to the Chief Executive 
Officer and to each other about all significant developments in their respective business areas and 
coordinate with each other on all cross-functional measures."
"Collaboration within the Executive Board is 
further governed by the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the Business Allocation Plan."
"These documents specifically stipulate requirements for meetings and resolutions as well as for 
cooperation with the Supervisory Board."
"The Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and trustfully for the benefit of the 
company."
"The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, extensively, and in a timely 
manner on all matters relevant to the company’s strategy, planning, business development, financial 
position, and compliance, as well as on material business risks."
"Fundamental questions related to the 
corporate strategy and its implementation are thoroughly discussed and aligned with the Supervisory 
Board."
The composition of the Executive Board is determined by the Supervisory Board.
"The Supervisory Board is 
committed to promoting a culture of diversity and inclusion at adidas."
"Diversity is understood in the 
broadest sense, including age, gender, cultural origin, nationality, educational background, professional 
qualifications, and experience."
"Greater diversity on the Executive Board will help secure the long-term success of adidas by taking 
diverse perspectives into account."
"For this reason, the Supervisory Board has adopted a diversity concept."
"In addition, an age limit of 65 years applies for Executive Board members."
"The General Committee of the Supervisory Board already takes the diversity concept into account when 
selecting candidates for Executive Board positions."
"Every decision by the Supervisory Board on the 
composition of the Executive Board is made in the best interests of the company and with due 
consideration of all circumstances in each individual case."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the 
current composition of the Executive Board meets the diversity concept mentioned above."
"As at the balance sheet date, no member of the Executive Board has accepted a Supervisory Board chair 
or more than two Supervisory Board mandates in non-group listed companies or in supervisory bodies of 
non-group companies with comparable requirements."
"It comprises eight shareholder representatives and eight 
employee representatives in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – 
MitbestG)."
"The shareholder representatives are elected by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting and the employee representatives by the employees."
"► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The last regular Supervisory Board elections were held in the 2019 financial year."
"In the subsequent 2020

due to Igor Landau’s resignation, and Thomas Rabe was elected as the new Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board."
"Due to Herbert Kauffmann’s departure, Jackie Joyner-Kersee was elected to the Supervisory 
Board as a new shareholder representative in the 2021 financial year."
"At the end of 2021, Roswitha 
Hermann resigned from the Supervisory Board as an employee representative, and Bastian Knobloch was 
appointed by court to succeed her."
"Most recently, Roland Nosko resigned from the Supervisory Board with 
effect from the end of August 31, 2022."
"He was also an employee representative (trade union 
representative) and was succeeded by Birgit Biermann, who was appointed by court."
"The terms of office of 
the current members of the Supervisory Board will expire at the end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"While the Supervisory Board prepares nomination proposals for the eight shareholder representatives 
who will be newly elected by the shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting as scheduled, the eight 
new employee representatives are already elected prior to the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"In order to increase the efficiency of its work and to deal with complex matters, the Supervisory Board has 
formed five permanent committees from among its members, which, inter alia, prepare its resolutions 
and, in certain cases, pass resolutions on its behalf."
"The Chairmen of the committees regularly report to the 
Supervisory Board on the results of the committee work."
Further information on the committees can be found on the company’s website.
"Accordingly, non-financial reporting and 
its audit are part of accounting and the annual audit which fall within the Audit Committee’s sphere of 
responsibility."
"Further information on the competency profile for the entire Supervisory Board and the 
expertise of the individual Supervisory Board members in sustainability issues relevant to the company are 
outlined in the qualification matrix below."
"The objectives are published on our 
website."
"According to these objectives, the Supervisory Board should be composed in such a way that 
qualified supervision of and advice to the Executive Board are ensured."
"Its members as a whole are 
expected to have the knowledge, skills, and professional experience required to properly perform the 
tasks of a supervisory board in a capital market-oriented international company in the sporting goods 
industry."
"Therefore, it is ensured that the Supervisory Board as a whole possesses the competencies 
considered essential in view of adidas’ activities."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board is expected to possess knowledge and experience in the 
markets relevant for adidas, in particular the Asian and US markets, and in the management of a large 
international company."
"At least one member 
of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of accounting, and at least one further member 
of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of auditing."
"Accounting and auditing also include 
non-financial reporting and its audit and assurance."
"The Supervisory Board members as a whole must be 
familiar with the sporting goods industry."
"If we 
consider shareholder representatives and employee representatives separately, more than half of the 
Supervisory Board members in each of these groups should be independent."
"More than two thirds of the shareholder representatives should be free of any potential conflicts of 
interest."
"This applies, in particular, to potential conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of an 
advisory or governing body function among customers, suppliers, lenders, or other third parties."
"As a rule, 
members of the Supervisory Board should not have a governing body or advisory function with any key 
competitor and should not have a personal relationship with any key competitor."
"An 
adequate number of the shareholder representatives should have long-standing international experience."
"In addition, each Supervisory Board member must ensure that they have sufficient time to properly 
perform the tasks associated with the mandate."

members should be 72 years at the time of their appointment."
"As a rule, the length of membership of the 
Supervisory Board should not exceed twelve years or three terms of office."
"In the Supervisory Board’s assessment, the Supervisory Board as a whole fulfills the objectives stated and 
the competency profile in its current composition."
"With Thomas Rabe, Chairman of the Supervisory Board, 
Bodo Uebber, Chairman of the Audit Committee, Christian Klein, and Kathrin Menges, at least four 
members of the Supervisory Board have proven expertise in the fields of accounting and auditing."
"They 
have expert knowledge and experience both in accounting and in the application of accounting principles 
as well as in internal control systems and risk management systems and in non-financial reporting and its 
audit and assurance."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, all shareholder representatives qualified as independent in the 
year under review."
"The names of the independent shareholder representatives are set out in the overview 
of all Supervisory Board members in this Annual Report."
"► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
The Supervisory Board’s proposals for the Supervisory Board elections to the Annual General Meeting are 
prepared by the Nomination Committee."
"The committee takes into account the objectives regarding the 
Supervisory Board’s composition resolved by the Supervisory Board and also particularly aims at fulfilling 
the competency profile developed by the Supervisory Board for the Board as a whole."
"Therefore, the 
Supervisory Board pays attention to a balanced composition to ensure that the know-how sought after is 
represented on as broad a scale as possible."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board will ascertain that each 
proposed candidate has sufficient time to perform their mandates."

"Tasks of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board on questions relating to the 
management of the company."
The supervision and advice also include sustainability issues in particular.
"Additionally, it resolves on the Supervisory 
Board’s resolution proposals to be presented to the Annual General Meeting."
"Moreover, the Supervisory 
Board examines the combined non-financial statement for the company and the Group and/or any 
separate non-financial reports."
"Certain business transactions and measures of the Executive Board with 
fundamental significance are subject to approval by the Supervisory Board or by a Supervisory Board 
committee."
"The respective details are set out in § 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board of 
adidas AG."
"Furthermore, the requirement of prior Supervisory Board approval is stipulated in some 
resolutions by the Annual General Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board is also responsible for the appointment and dismissal of the Executive Board 
members as well as for the allocation of their areas of responsibility."
"The respective proposals are 
prepared by the General Committee."
"When appointing new Executive Board members, the Supervisory 
Board provides for the best possible, diverse, and mutually complementary Executive Board composition 
for the company and, together with the Executive Board, ensures long-term succession planning."
"The 
Supervisory Board takes a structural approach in its succession planning for the Executive Board."
"This is 
based on multiple planning horizons."
"Accordingly, the company has established a number of management 
groups (Core Leadership Group [CLG], Extended Leadership Group [ELG], and High Potentials)."
"This 
ensures a sustainable approach to identifying and evaluating successor candidates for Executive Board 
positions, while also accommodating the company’s diversity concept."
"The Supervisory Board discusses 
succession planning on a regular basis."
"The 
Supervisory Board, together with the Executive Board, annually prepares a clear and comprehensible 
report on the compensation granted and due in the previous financial year in accordance with § 162 AktG."
"Further information on Executive Board compensation, the current compensation system, the 
Compensation Report, and the auditor’s report in accordance with § 162 AktG can be found on the 
company’s website."
These Rules of Procedure are available on our website.
"The Supervisory Board Report 
provides information on the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the year under 
review."
"► SEE SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT ► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/BODIES 
The members of the Supervisory Board are individually responsible for undertaking any necessary training 
and professional development measures required for their tasks and are supported by adidas AG in this 
regard."
"The company informs the Supervisory Board regularly about current legislative changes as well as 
opportunities for external training and provides the Supervisory Board with relevant specialist literature."
"In this regard, the Supervisory Board has also examined the sustainability issues relevant to adidas and 
the associated reporting obligations as well as the potential of and the challenges posed by the company’s 
use of artificial intelligence (‘AI’)."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board as well as the Audit Committee, General Committee, and Nomination 
Committee regularly assess the efficiency of their work."
The compensation of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the Compensation Report.
"► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/COMPENSATION 
Commitment to the promotion of equal participation of women and men in leadership positions  
When filling leadership positions in the company, the Executive Board takes diversity into account and 
aims for an appropriate participation of women in particular."
"The Supervisory Board is also convinced that 
an increase in the number of women in leadership positions within the company is necessary to ensure 
that, in the future, a larger number of suitable female candidates is available for Executive Board 
positions."
"On the first management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 
35.5% at the balance sheet date."
The target figure of 39% was thus not achieved.
"In this respect, it must be 
noted that adidas AG has only a small number of leadership positions on this management level; 
therefore, minor changes already result in considerable changes in percentage numbers."
"The missing of 
the defined target figure is particularly attributable to unplanned departures from the company in the year 
under review and partly also to replacements and changes that only take effect in the following year."
"On the second management level below the Executive Board, the percentage share of women amounted to 
37.4% at the balance sheet date."
The target figure of 31% was thus significantly exceeded.
"Against this backdrop, the Executive Board has set the new target of 40% as the share of female 
representation for the first and the second management level below the Executive Board of adidas AG."
"The 
Executive Board set December 31, 2025, as the deadline for achieving these two targets."
"Moreover, the 
new gender balance ambition of the Executive Board is to increase the global share of women in 
leadership positions (director level and above) to 50% by 2033, after the previous target of 40% was nearly 
met at the end of 2023, with 39.6%."
"In accordance with § 96 section 2 sentence 1 AktG, at least 30% of the members of the Supervisory Board 
must be female and at least 30% must be male."
"This means 
that the Supervisory Board of adidas AG must be composed of at least five women and five men."
"These 
minimum quotas were achieved."
"As at December 31, 2023, six of the company’s 16 Supervisory Board 
mandates were held by women."
"The company will continue to intensify its efforts for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in order to remain an 
attractive employer in the future."
"There will be a particular focus on a long-term approach to equity in 
leadership positions – both through hiring and through appropriate succession planning."
"► SEE OUR PEOPLE 
Avoiding conflicts of interest 
The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are obligated to disclose any conflicts of 
interest to the Supervisory Board without delay."
"Substantial transactions between the company and 
members of the Executive Board or related parties of the Executive Board require Supervisory Board 
approval."
"Contracts between the company and members of the Supervisory Board also require 
Supervisory Board approval."
"The Supervisory Board reports any conflicts of interest, as well as the 
handling thereof, to the Annual General Meeting."
"In the year under review, the members of the Executive 
Board and the members of the Supervisory Board did not face any conflicts of interest."
"A brand 
ambassador agreement exists between adidas and Jackie Joyner-Kersee."
"In particular, the brand ambassador agreement 
does not represent a material business relationship for either adidas or Jackie Joyner-Kersee."
"The 
Supervisory Board passed a unanimous resolution approving the extension of this agreement without the 
participation of Jackie Joyner-Kersee."

Accounting and annual audit 
adidas AG prepares the annual financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the German 
Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB) and the AktG."
"The annual consolidated financial statements 
are prepared in accordance with the principles of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
as adopted by the European Union (EU)."
"PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was 
appointed as auditor for the 2023 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements by the 
Annual General Meeting of May 12, 2022."
"The Supervisory Board had previously assured itself of the 
auditor’s independence."
"The 
DAX increased by 20%, the EURO STOXX 50 by 19%, and the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel and Luxury 
Goods Index by 11% as investor concerns over rising interest rates, economic resilience, and high 
inflation slowly began to subside."
"In this market environment, the adidas AG share significantly 
outperformed the broader stock market and ended 2023 with an increase of 44% compared to the prior 
year."
"adidas AG share rises and outperforms broader stock market in 2023 
In 2023, easing of inflationary pressures, a corresponding halt in interest rate increases by global central 
banks, and a comparatively resilient economy led to a sturdy rebound of global stock markets."
"At the same 
time, geopolitical tensions, the war in Ukraine as well as the conflict in the Middle East weighed on 
financial markets throughout the year."
"During the second half of the year, markets benefited from the 
prospect of interest rate cuts by global central banks in 2024."
"Against this backdrop, the DAX gained 20% 
and the EURO STOXX 50 increased by 19%, while the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel and Luxury Goods Index 
was up 11% in 2023."
"Meanwhile, the adidas AG share outperformed the broader stock market and ended 
2023 with a 44% increase compared to the prior year."
"The development reflects the operational and 
financial progress the company has made in the course of the transition year 2023."
"This provides a 
stronger foundation for further improvements in 2024 and a successful 2025 and 2026."

Our Level 1 ADR closed 2023 at US $ 101.65, representing an increase of 50% versus the prior-year level

"The more pronounced increase of the Level 1 ADR price compared to the ordinary 
share price was due to the valuation of the US dollar versus the euro in 2023."

Focus Areas 
2023 was a transition year for adidas."
"The appointment of Bjørn Gulden as new CEO in January paved the 
way for a successful restart of the company."
"We used 2023 to significantly reduce our inventories, 
leverage existing franchises, work on future products, improve the way we work, build stronger 
partnerships, and lay the foundation for a better 2024 and a successful 2025 and 2026."
"To achieve this goal, we have started to optimize our business model:  
─ Speed and agility: Fast-changing trends and consumer demands require flexibility and agility."
"We 
empowered our people to accelerate decision-making and eliminated complicated processes to react 
quickly."
The rapid scaling of our Terrace range is a standout example.
"We will continue to prioritize 
speed and agility to react faster to the needs of our consumers and the feedback from our retail 
partners."
"─ DTC and wholesale: We have been transitioning away from a narrow focus on our direct-to-consumer 
business to a service-oriented model toward our retail partners."
"By listening closely to their feedback 
and acting on it, we want to be a trusted partner for them."
"Improving the sell-through of our product 
will be key to regaining shelf space."
"And while wholesale is crucial for our future success, we will of 
course keep investing in our own retail and our e-commerce presence."
"It is all about maintaining a 
healthy balance between our channels to win with the consumer."
"─ Global, regional, local: We need to be where our consumers are."
"With more local trends emerging, the 
need for local relevance is ever increasing."
"Instead of a centrally defined one-size-fits-all approach, we 
are empowering our markets to create the product, storytelling and business models they need to be 
successful."
"Only by providing our markets with decision-making autonomy can we meet the 
expectations of our customers and the needs of the consumer."
"─ Brand heat: We are proud to produce groundbreaking innovation in sports and some of the most 
sought-after product in lifestyle."
This outstanding product is amplified by brand heat – and vice versa.
Brand heat is the sum of everything we do.
"It comprises athletes, teams, federations, celebrities, street 
culture and more."
"To drive brand desire, we need to be as close as possible to the consumer in the 
markets and ensure that we invest where we generate the most brand heat."
"In 2023, adidas created 
new brand narratives and will evolve these messages in 2024 and beyond."
"By putting the joy of sport 
and its power as a great unifier at the center, we want to counter an atmosphere of pressure and 
stress, especially for our younger consumers."
"In addition, we have been focusing on five pillars to build the foundation for a stronger adidas:   
─ People: We believe that our people are the key to the company’s success."
"We focus on creating a 
culture that strengthens their performance, well-being, and personal development, as this will have a 
significant impact on brand desire, consumer and customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, financial 
performance."
─ Product: Product is king and adidas has an unrivaled archive of Performance and Lifestyle product.
"We 
innovate in materials, designs, and technologies to constantly bring exciting new products and 
groundbreaking innovations to the market."
"This allows us to create trends and quickly build on existing 
ones."
"As part of this, we leverage our partnerships with athletes, designers and celebrities."

It is born from sport and worn for style.
"Sportswear 
provides everyday products that redefine comfort, versatility, and aesthetics."

was released in 2022, followed by the launch of a full product range across footwear, apparel, and 
accessories in February 2023."
"Franchises as lighthouses for our brand  
Footwear has the potential to drive consumer desire across product categories, the key lever for growing 
market share."
"Our archive, which is unrivaled in the industry, as well as cutting-edge technological 
breakthroughs and access to fundamental athlete insights provide plenty of opportunities to create 
newness in footwear and push industry boundaries."
"We set a priority on footwear franchises, which are our 
most iconic symbols of sport and culture and act as lighthouses for our brand."
"They represent the very 
best of adidas, influencing not only sport but the culture born from it, reimagining the notions of 
Performance and Lifestyle footwear while contributing to building our brand equity."
"Through 
uncompromised functionality, iconic design, and unique stories they are clearly targeted toward the 
consumer and have the potential to be iterated over time to preserve desirability."
"Their lifecycles are 
diligently managed to maintain consumer relevance and commercial longevity."
"Our footwear franchises 
include perennial bestsellers such as the Samba, Gazelle, Campus, Superstar, and Stan Smith."
"On the 
apparel side, adidas manages a portfolio of franchises including the Tiro Pant, MyShelter Jacket, and the 
Z.N.E."
"Above all, 2023 was the year of our Terrace range (Gazelle, Samba, and Spezial) with the 
Samba franchise declared ‘Shoe of the Year 2023’ by ‘Footwear News,’ one of the leading global footwear 
trade magazines."
"The halo effect of these models and other classics such as Campus, together with our 
latest Originals brand campaign, significantly increased our brand heat globally."
"We are 
applying an innovative mindset to all aspects of our business in order to create tangible proof points of our 
credibility, elevate experiences, and push the boundaries in sustainability."
"In addition to leveraging product 
franchises, creating innovative concepts to meet the needs of athletes and consumers is a prerequisite to

governments and research organizations."
"We invest in manufacturing techniques and new technologies 
aiming to address deeply understood athlete challenges."
The launch of the Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 is a testament to this approach.
"Throughout the development 
process, we gathered insights from elite athletes such as Peres Jepchirchir, Benson Kipruto, Tigist 
Assefa, and Amanal Petros."
"As a result, in September 2023, we were able to present the lightest racing 
shoe in our running footwear range to date: The Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 is 40% lighter than any other 
adidas racing shoe."
"The biggest success achieved with the shoe to date was winning the 2023 Berlin 
Marathon, where Tigist Assefa beat the world record by over two minutes and Amanal Petros set a new 
German record."
"Innovative technologies and products  
We believe developing industry-leading technologies, materials, and consumer experiences is an 
important aspect of being an innovative leader."
"We have a long heritage of innovation and strive to provide 
athletes with the best by creating high-performance, competitive products."
"In 2023, we continued to serve 
consumers with innovative technologies, materials, and sustainable concepts built into our products: 
− Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1: With a weight of 138 grams, this revolutionary road racer is 40% lighter than 
any other racing shoe adidas has ever created."
"Inspired by the same technology as the race-winning 
Adizero Adios Pro 3, the shoe also features a new forefoot rocker that has been lab-tested to improve 
running economy."
"With two major marathon victories and several new records since its launch, the 
Adizero Adios Pro Evo 1 is not only adidas’ lightest, but also fastest shoe ever."
− Adizero Prime x Strung: Our first ever Adizero running shoe with a ’Strung’ upper.
"Strung is a textile 
innovation that transforms athlete data into a dynamic material tuned to the athlete's needs."
"It enables 
mapping and programming of different fiber properties thread by thread."
"With a flexible and 
lightweight seamless cocoon feel around the foot, Strung helps optimize comfort and supports the 
athlete on long-distance runs."
"With every stride, the new adidas 4DFWD 2 midsole compresses forward, reducing 
braking forces and transforming the impact energy into forward motion."
"The result is a smooth ride 
with less stop-and-go pounding."
"With the 4DFWD 2, we have introduced a new Continental outsole that 
provides extra grip for runs in any weather condition."
"The shoe contains a new Primeknit+ and 
engineered mesh upper construction for an extra supportive and snug fit."
"Complemented by an 
integrated heel counter, Primeknit+ offers a sock-like fit, while areas of engineered mesh provide 
support exactly where runners need it most."
"− Agravic Speed Ultra: The Agravic Speed Ultra is a testament to pushing boundaries in the fast-
growing, community-driven sport of trail running."
"Created alongside adidas Terrex professional trail 
runners over a two-year period, the innovation-packed silhouette is built to provide runners with 
ultimate speed in ultra-distance races."
"A prototype of the Agravic Speed Ultra has already proven itself 
on podiums, with the latest record being broken at the 2023 Western States 100-mile Endurance Run 
when Tom Evans won in 14 hours and 40 minutes."
"For consumers, the shoe will be available in spring 
2024."
"− FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023 federation away kits: Partner to ten teams, including World Champion 
Spain, competing at the FIFA Women’s World Cup Australia   New Zealand 2023, adidas unveiled 
federation away kits inspired by nature."
"While the designs celebrated each country’s scenery and 
diverse natural landscape, the jerseys are made from recycled polyester and feature the latest adidas 
fabric innovations, including HEAT.RDY and AEROREADY."
− adidas by Stella McCartney x Arsenal Collection: adidas and Arsenal F.C.
"launched the next chapter of 
their collaboration with Stella McCartney with the revealing of the first away kit and travel range for 
Arsenal Women."
"The limited-edition range includes a gender-neutral game-day match jersey as well 
as off-pitch pieces for pre- and post-match travel."
"The away kit marks the first time the women’s team 
have worn a separate kit from the men’s team, while the latter competed in the gender-neutral jersey 
for their pre-match warm-up."
"− X Crazyfast Strung: The first football shoe to feature ‘Strung,’ a technology born from running and 
redefined for football."
"With each thread individually selected and data-mapped for a seamless 
lightweight cocoon around the foot, the Strung upper combines with the Speedframe and Aeroplate 
inlay from X Crazyfast to enable dynamic movement and touch at top speed."
"− Fussballliebe: Revealed in November 2023, ‘Fussballliebe’ is the name of the official match ball 
for UEFA EURO 2024."
"Meaning ‘love of football,’ it brings ‘Connected Ball Technology’ to 
the tournament for the first time."
"The ball features a 20-piece ‘Precisionshell’ panel shape, deboss 
grooves on the outer shell, as well as a ‘CTR-Core’ inside, which is designed for accuracy and supports 
fast, precise play with maximum shape and air retention."
"Beyond innovative technologies, key products and collaborations of the 2023 business year include: 
− Fear of God Athletics: Together with Jerry Lorenzo and Fear of God, we officially launched ‘Fear of God 
Athletics’ at the end of 2023."
"The collection provides uncompromised inspiration authentically rooted in 
performance and the culture of sport."
"It offers a fresh perspective on luxury sportswear with strong 
influences from basketball culture – a modern wardrobe for the contemporary athlete."
"− adidas x Bugatti: Bugatti and adidas have come together to create a limited-edition football boot: the 
adidas X Crazyfast Bugatti."
"Produced in a run of only 99 pairs, the boots are engineered for speed and 
lightness, and finished with bespoke Bugatti design flourishes."
"The collection draws on the 
characteristics that have come to define Bugatti: not only engineered for speed but created with a 
‘Form follows Performance’ design philosophy."
"− adidas x Wales Bonner: 2023 saw the continuation of our collaboration with British designer Grace 
Wales Bonner."
"Embracing a fusion of European and African influences, it seamlessly blends the rich 
heritage of adidas and Wales Bonner to create collections that celebrate the convergence of 
sportswear and tailoring."
"The collaboration has been especially instrumental during the incubation and 
activation phases of the Samba franchise."
"− adidas x Les Mills: In February 2023, adidas and Les Mills, an international leader in the fitness 
content and training industry, announced their partnership."
"With women making up the majority of the 
trainers and participants in the workouts around the world, the partnership is also designed to help us 
build credibility with women."
"Impactful and effective marketing investments 
Our marketing investments are an additional important building block for creating brand desirability and 
winning the consumer."
"adidas is focused on creating inspirational and innovative concepts that drive 
consumer advocacy, build brand equity, and drive demand for our products."
"The company historically 
spends almost half of its marketing investment on partners, with the remainder spent on brand marketing 
activities such as digital, advertising, point-of-sale, and grassroots activations."
"The ambition is to have a fully 
connected marketing funnel, from grabbing consumer attention at the top to driving consideration in the 
middle of the funnel when consumers are in the buying phase, down to conversion at the point of sale at 
the bottom of the funnel."
"− Brand moments: deliver a strong brand point of view through targeted sport and culture moments to 
amplify brand attitude and reinforce our purpose."
"− Category activation: strengthen sport and culture credibility by sharpening label and category 
propositions through product story, sport/culture moments, partner activation, hype drops, and 
commercial activation."
"− Commercial conversion: drive conversion and consistency at the point of sale (in-store and online) to 
support cross-category commercial partnerships and ‘evergreen’ key items through delivery of 
seasonal, modular toolkits."
"In 2023, adidas 
Originals paid homage to those that have continued to transport the brand to the forefront of culture 
with a new global campaign: ‘We Gave the World an Original."
"You Gave Us a Thousand Back.’ Headlined 
by three films and a selection of stills, each focusing on one of three timeless silhouettes from our 
archive – the Superstar, the Gazelle, and the Samba – the campaign tells the narrative of the Trefoil’s 
past, present, and future."
"The campaign was amplified globally through a major media strategy, 
representing the largest single investment for adidas Originals in 2023."
"The campaign was dedicated to next-generation icons Alessia Russo, Lena 
Oberdorf, and Mary Fowler and looked to drive more global attention for the game and inspire young 
women and girls to follow in their role models’ footsteps."
"− Move for the Planet (‘MFTP’): ‘Move for the Planet’ builds on the foundation adidas created with ‘Run 
for the Oceans’ and is our most inclusive and impactful sustainability initiative to date."
"Its goal is to 
encourage the global sporting community to take action on sustainability by turning their sports and 
workouts into tangible impact for communities in need."
"As a result, over 173 million minutes of activity 
were tracked across countries in the adidas Running app, with adidas pledging to donate € 1 to its 
partner organization ‘Common Goal’ for every ten minutes of activity logged – up to € 1.5 million."
"− ’Running Needs Nothing But You’: The first brand campaign in 2023 celebrated how personal running 
is, showcasing that athletes run for all kinds of motivations and that they face different pressures and 
obstacles along the way."
"adidas wanted to remind runners that, whether they are a seasoned 
competitor or someone who needs a little encouragement to take their first step in running, it is not 
about living up to someone else’s expectations."
"As part of the campaign, adidas also launched ‘The 
Ridiculous Run,’ a campaign calling attention to the reality that many female runners face, such as 
safety concerns while running."
It also highlighted the need for male education and allyship.
"− adidas Sportswear: In 2023, adidas revealed ‘Sportswear.’ The new line aims to elevate the wearer’s 
everyday look with a range of fits that use the latest performance technology to bring the same comfort 
and confidence to everyday wear as the Performance collections."
"In terms of partners and athletes, while being conscious of overall marketing spend, we will continue to 
bring our products to the biggest stages in the world through: 
─ Events with global reach: FIFA World Cup (men’s and women’s) and UEFA Champions League (men’s 
and women’s)."
"Major marathons such as Beijing, Berlin, Boston, Mexico City, and Seoul."
"─ High-profile teams: National teams of Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, 
Mexico, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Sweden."

"We aim to deliver the best service to our retail 
partners and the best shopping experience for our consumers across all touchpoints."
"Our goal is to 
establish scalable business solutions that deliver premium experiences, thereby meeting and 
surpassing consumer expectations with an integrated brand offering."
"⌐ In 2023, we enhanced our relationships and brand spaces with key retailers to win consumers at every 
touchpoint, sustained a strong global presence by maintaining a consistent global framework with around 
1,860 own retail stores, and amplified our own e-commerce."
"¬ 
Navigating a challenging market environment 
The challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions in 2023 continued to impact our business, with 
some markets affected more than others."
"To address these challenges, we focused on strongly reducing 
our inventory levels by significantly reducing our buying volumes and tactically repurposing existing 
inventory as well as reducing discounting activity to lay the foundation for a better 2024."
"In Wholesale, we 
focused on building better partnerships with our customers and executed our conservative sell-in 
strategy."
"In own retail, we strategically reduced our store portfolio."
"Aiming at improving the overall 
profitability, we have been prioritizing strategic locations to offer consumers the opportunity to experience 
the brand’s pinnacle offerings."
"Within our e-commerce platform, we focused on drastically reducing 
promotional activity, driving full-price sales and building brand desire through relevant storytelling around 
key products and events."
"We continued to provide premium, connected, and personalized shopping 
experiences through exclusive products and engaging member offerings in 67 countries."
"2023 channel mix 
⌐ Wholesale remained our largest channel, accounting for 59% of total net sales in 2023 (2022: 61%)."
"The 
share of DTC business, consisting of own retail and e-commerce sales, was 41% in 2023 (2022: 39%)."
"Our 
‘adiClub’ membership program is now established in around 50 countries, enabling us to build direct 
relationships with our consumers."
"Through meticulous planning and strategic 
foresight, we executed transition plans with the explicit aim of regaining trust and achieving a significantly 
improved business set-up by year-end."
"Employing a conservative sell-in strategy, we vigilantly tracked 
customer sell-out and inventory levels."
"Additionally, we actively supported initiatives to reduce inventory 
levels in the market by assessing the customer’s performance and agreeing on a transition plan."
"We 
created specific action plans for each key account to ensure we had cleaner inventory levels, a more 
focused sell-in, and better in-store presentation."
Our goal was to reset the marketplace and invest in future growth with our partners.
"Progress was made 
with our branded space initiative, which involved rolling out enhanced footwear walls globally with 
improved visual merchandising."
"The initiative also supports us to elevate our brand and ensure we present 
ourselves in a strong way toward our consumers."
"In the fourth quarter, we saw early signs that our 
approach to selling more customer-exclusive products is beginning to have a positive business impact."
"This is also attributed to our enhanced collaboration with our customers to build more relevant product 
differentiation."
"By sharing and scaling these programs across other markets and channels, we were able 
to start unlocking additional sales opportunities in 2023."
"As part of our sharpened focus on Wholesale, we ramped up our interaction with our major customers 
across the markets."
We hosted more customers at our various campuses around the world.
"For example, 
we held a partner camp at our Herzogenaurach campus in 2023, which brought together our top key 
partners from markets worldwide."
"This event served as a platform to showcase our strategic future brand 
direction, accentuating the strength and potential of our brand."
"We took our digital sell-in tools ‘CLICK’ 
and ‘Digital Showroom’ to the next level by enhancing the sell-in and order placement experience for our 
accounts and sales teams."
"We continued to focus on our digital capability to team up with our accounts 
and win online together."
"This allowed us to deliver an enhanced and consistent shopping experience in 
digital wholesale by integrating our product images and descriptions into customer systems to power their 
website and app experiences."
"Own retail 
Our own retail stores allow our consumers to directly interact with our brand, product, and teams, and to 
touch and try our products, feel inspired by our stories, and experience what we stand for as a brand."
"Through premium experiences and the human connection with our teams and communities, we aim to 
build brand loyalty and increase consumer lifetime value."
"In 2023, the total number of stores decreased to 1,863 (2022: 1,990) as part of our portfolio strategy and as 
a result of the company’s decision to wind down its business in Russia."
"Despite the overall goal of reducing 
the number of stores in 2023, we continued to invest in creating a more profitable business."
"Consequently, 
Emerging Markets for example, grew their store base by taking over a number of franchise stores in Saudi 
Arabia with the goal of optimizing the fleet and increasing sales through improved operations."
"We continued to 
elevate our presence in strategic locations through additional flagship stores and brand centers."
"For 
example, we opened a brand flagship store in Seoul Myeongdong, the first in Korea."
"It was awarded with 
the Gold LEED certification, recognizing the effort to turn this store into a sustainable space."
"We also 
upsized one of the existing brand centers in Bangkok, doubling its size and making it the largest brand 
center in Asia-Pacific."
A new brand center in Sydney marks the first halo store in Pacific.
"The space 
features works by several artists who have used their creativity to pay homage to Sydney’s famous 
landscapes, giving it a local touch."
"The store spans two floors and covers Sportswear and Performance 
categories as well as Stella McCartney products and is home to our iconic Originals range."
"In addition, we 
remodeled the brand center in Hong Kong in line with the ‘Home of Sport’ store design concept, adding 
new features such as artwork by local artists, a locally designed women’s zone, an adiClub members 
space and, at 26 meters, the longest footwear wall."
"Moreover, we undertook a remodeling of the brand 
center in Tel Aviv and opened the first Originals flagship store in Beijing."
"Stores by concept type 
 
E-commerce 
Recognizing the changing dynamics of the marketplace, we redefined the role of e-commerce within the 
broader ecosystem as we leveraged our capabilities and experiences to improve profitability and focus on 
premiumization."
"In 2023, we continued to expand ‘Digital’ across all of our channels and touchpoints in 67 countries."
"Our 
adiClub membership program remained a cornerstone of our membership interactions."
"Building on its 
successful launch in 2022, we expanded the redemption feature to 19 new countries, allowing members to 
use their accumulated points across all our digital and retail touchpoints for new capabilities."
"These 
included points for raffles, ‘Money-can’t-buy’ products, vouchers, partner offers, so-called ‘Golden 
Tickets,’ and donations."
"In 2023, we introduced ‘Points x Premium Subscription’ and launched our 
partnership with Les Mills, solidifying our dedication to empowering members through unique 
experiences."
"This positioned adiClub as one of the only membership programs where members can level 
up through physical activity, not just purchases."
The 2023 marathon season was a success.
"We trialed new ways of member engagement across all our 
touchpoints and activated major races on the adidas app, our sports app, adidas.com, and social media."
"Embracing inclusivity, we 
democratized these races by introducing immersive digital race experiences on our sports app, enabling 
members worldwide to partake in events like the Dubai Marathon, ‘Road2Records’ in Herzogenaurach, 
and the Berlin Marathon."
"More than 450,000 members participated in virtual races ranging from five to 21 
kilometers, allowing them to celebrate their own victories alongside our athletes."
"Looking ahead to 2024, 
we will elevate these experiences and extend our digital race offerings to include all major events on the 
running calendar."
"The app 
continued to deliver coveted and premium products to adidas consumers, offering best-in-class 
experiences and further solidifying our status as a trendsetter in the global lifestyle world."
"The function strives to increase efficiency throughout the company’s supply chain 
and ensures the highest standards in product quality, availability, and delivery."
"With the consumer in 
mind, we deliver competitively priced products that drive our sustainability ambitions and are available 
when and where the consumer wants them."
"¬ 
Global Operations delivers on our mission to be the best sports brand in the world."
"The function aims to 
create the best products by establishing state-of-the-art infrastructure, processes, and systems that 
enable us to focus on innovative and sustainable materials and manufacturing capabilities."
"Moreover, 
Global Operations is focused on delivering the best services through flexible and agile distribution 
capabilities, enabling product availability through an omni-channel approach."
"Thereby, Global Operations 
contributes to delivering the best experience to our customers and consumers."
"We improved market order efficiency, increased 
China-for-China production, and shortened manufacturing and supply lead times for the Fall/Winter 
season 2023."
"We continue our efforts to drive responsiveness in our supply chain as we plan to draw on 
lessons learned and roll out the concept to additional markets from 2024 onward."
"Production through independent manufacturing partners 
⌐ To keep our production costs competitive, we outsource almost 100% of our production to independent 
manufacturing partners."
"While we provide our manufacturing partners with detailed specifications for 
production and delivery, they possess excellent expertise in cost-efficient, high-volume production of 
footwear, apparel, and accessories and gear."
"Overall, our independent manufacturing partners produced 
756 million pieces of apparel, footwear, and accessories and gear in 2023 (2022: 1,018 million pieces)."
"The 
decrease in production volume was driven by reduced market demand for new buys to manage down 
inventory levels."
"In 2023, we worked with 104 independent manufacturing partners (2022: 117) that were producing in 
237 manufacturing facilities (2022: 259)."
"The majority (78%) of our independent manufacturing partners 
are located in Asia (2022: 71%)."
"We value long-term relationships: 74% of our independent manufacturing 
partners have worked with adidas for at least ten years, and 38% have a tenure of more than 20 years."
"Relationships > 20 years 
38% 
 
All our manufacturing partners are subject to specific performance criteria, which are regularly measured 
and reviewed by Global Operations."
"To ensure the high quality that consumers expect from our products, 
we enforce strict control and inspection procedures of our manufacturing partners and in our own 
factories."
"Effectiveness of product-related standards is constantly measured through quality and material 
claim procedures."
"In addition, we track the delivery and efficiency performance of our partners."
"Adherence 
to social and environmental standards is also promoted throughout our supply chain."

"This diverse combination of distribution centers allows us to be agile and 
efficient in distributing our products to our customers and consumers around the world."
"Therefore, we track two KPIs: ‘On-Time Available’ (‘OTA’) and ‘On-Time In-Full’ (‘OTIF’)."
"OTA measures on-
time-available products at the distribution center for both our wholesale customers and our own retail 
stores."
"OTIF represents the in-full delivery of our products by the requested date to our own retail stores 
and e-commerce consumers."
"Continuing the journey toward the 2025 OTIF ambition of 90%, in 2023 we have 
included e-commerce together with own retail as an aligned global metric (previous years: OTIF = own retail 
only)."
"In 2023, we reached an OTA level of 92% (2022: 82%), driven by all markets already performing above target 
level in the first quarter of the year, with the exception of market Europe, which, however, recovered during 
the second quarter."

External recognition 
⌐ adidas continuously receives positive recognition from international institutions, rating agencies, NGOs, 
and socially responsible investment analysts for its holistic approach to managing sustainability."
"In 2023, 
adidas was again subject to comprehensive corporate ESG assessments and took part in focused thematic 
disclosure benchmarks for environmental or social performance."
"As a result, adidas was represented in a 
number of high-profile sustainability indices, ratings, and disclosure benchmark evaluations."
"During 2023, we continued to 
increase the number of articles we define as sustainable, aiming at 90% of our articles to be sustainable 
by 2025, and to work toward achieving climate neutrality (CO2e) across our entire value chain."
"We also 
assessed selected key materials potentially contributing to biodiversity risks and committed to a 
deforestation-free leather supply chain latest by 2030."
"We further evolved our approach to circularity to 
support the creation of an ecosystem that is necessary to scale circular solutions in our industry."
"This 
included focused engagement in cross-industry projects aimed at unlocking circularity, such as ‘T-REX’ 
and ‘Sorting for Circularity.’ We also continued to address water efficiency and quality in our supply chain, 
with an advanced chemical management program and ambitious targets in place."
"We empower our employees to become sustainability ambassadors, just as we invite consumers globally 
to engage and connect with us on the topic of sustainability."
"Our established running movement ‘Run for 
the Oceans’ has evolved into ‘Move for the Planet,’ an initiative aiming to raise consumer awareness for 
climate change by supporting selected grassroots sports organizations."
"adidas has partnered up with not-
for-profit organization ‘Common Goal’ to help communities in need engage in climate action through 
sport."
"This includes initiatives such as renewing a community’s sports field using recycled materials and 
providing training on how to reduce plastic waste at sports facilities."
"We believe that moving toward achieving the targets we have defined for 2025 and beyond will set us up for 
future success."
Engaging closely with our suppliers remains critical to achieving our targets.
"We are 
therefore leveraging our long-term relationships with suppliers to ensure they can help us achieve our 
decarbonization targets and we are also working closely with partners to scale innovative materials, 
recycling technologies, and circular business practices across the value chain."
We will re-submit these targets to SBTi for approval throughout 2024.
2 Subject to reasonable assurance engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft.
"The table provides an overview of the targets we have set ourselves that will help us reduce our 
environmental impacts."
"For that reason, 
adidas has set targets that will help us limit emissions aligned with the 1.5°C benchmark and contribute to 
a net-zero future."
"Our emission reduction targets by 2025 and 2030 have been approved by the ‘Science Based Targets 
initiative’ (‘SBTi’).15 Within the 2025 target, we commit to reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
by 90% 16 from a baseline of 2017."
"This target is consistent with the reduction pathways needed to prevent 
a rise in average temperatures of more than 1.5°C – the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement."
"Our 
GHG reduction target for value chain emissions (Scope 1, 2, 3) of 30% by 2030 (baseline 2017) meets the 
SBTi’s criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning they are in line with current best practices."
"When it comes to decarbonization, we believe that data quality is critical."
"Therefore, in addition to 
developing a tool that enables us to quantify, monitor, and be transparent about our carbon footprint along 
our entire value chain, we have put considerable effort in gathering more primary data from our suppliers 
over the last few years."
"This has allowed us to gain more precise insights into carbon emissions, energy 
consumption, and the impact of our decarbonization initiatives."
"As both the quality and availability of data improved significantly in 2023, we were able to update our 
methodology for measuring carbon footprint across our value chain."
"Consequently, we recalculated the 
2022 data to ensure year-over-year comparability."
"This updated methodology continues to be fully aligned 
with international methodology standards, provided by e.g."
"the GHG Protocol and SBTi, and reduces the 
dependance on assumptions and generalizations typically presented by secondary data."
"As in the previous year, the 2023 results show that our environmental impacts are distributed unequally 
across the value chain, with the most significant impacts generated in the supply chain, particularly in raw 
materials production and processing."
The following table shows the total annual GHG emissions across our value chain.
"The average Scope 1, 2, 
and 3 annual GHG emissions per product for 2023 decreased by 3% compared to the previous year."
"This 
reduction has been driven by the work done with our suppliers, such as continuing with the phase-out of 
coal in our manufacturing facilities and the increased use of renewable energy."
"Our innovation effort, that 
has also enabled us to use low-carbon manufacturing methods and materials, as well as decreased 
production volumes due to high inventory levels in the market translated into a 24% reduction in total 
absolute GHG emissions17 compared to the previous year."
14 The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.
15 We will resubmit these targets to SBTi for approval during 2024.
"16 In line with SBTi requirements, we allow ourselves, if needed, a reduction of a maximum of 10% of all emissions in the target year, to be achieved through 
offsetting."
17 Calculation excludes emissions resulting from ‘Use of sold products’ in alignment with the guidance provided by the ‘Science Based Targets initiative’.
"Within Scope 3, ‘Purchased goods and services’ considers the production and processing of raw 
materials for which impacts are estimated based on quantities of materials and life-cycle analysis data."
All key production processes are considered.
"Primary, 
secondary, and tertiary packaging material quantities are included."
"The quantities are estimated based on sales volumes, using composition and weight 
assumptions from the ‘Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules’ (‘PEFCR’)."
"Furthermore, ‘Purchased goods and services’ also considers the assembly 
phase, for which impacts are estimated by applying emission factors to reported energy consumption from Tier 1 strategic suppliers."
"Sourcing volume data is 
used to estimate the impact of non-strategic suppliers (<20%)."
"‘Upstream transportation and distribution’: Quantities of goods for specified distribution routes 
are combined with transport emissions factors."
‘Business travel’: Calculations are based on the business travel data system.
"‘Use of sold products’: Emissions 
caused by washing, drying, and ironing of sold products throughout their lifetime based on data on average care cycles from PEFCR and life-cycle analysis 
datasets."
"‘End-of-life treatment of old products’: Emissions caused by disposal of sold products are estimated based on sales volumes and typical waste 
disposal routes (e.g., landfill and incineration)."
"Scope 1 and 2: Impacts are calculated based on 79% of reported environmental quantities (primary data) in the 
Health and Safety, Environment, and Energy (HSEE) own operations data collection systems and 21% by estimations."
"The estimations are calculated by scaling 
up the primary data collected at the facility or site level to a company-wide level on the basis of gross lease area (in square meters)."
"2 Intensity factor to calculate emissions per product excludes emissions resulting from ‘Use of sold products’ to align with our GHG reduction target for 2030 as 
approved by the SBTi."
3 Figures for Scope 3 emissions in 2022 were revised following a methodology update.
"Scope 3 emissions in 2022 applying the previous methodology totaled 
7,523,545 tons CO2e."
"During 2023, some of our suppliers purchased Energy Attribute Certificates (‘EACs’)."
"The reduction of 
emissions resulting from these EACs were not factored into our footprint calculation, due to the current 
lack of consensus on concepts on the operationalization and accounting approach."
"Instead, we continued 
to collaborate with the industry to find more robust solutions that allow for Scope 3 interventions that 
further incentivize investments and overall long-term decarbonization of the industry."
"¬ 
Reducing land-related emissions (‘FLAG’)  
⌐ adidas recognizes the importance of reducing land-related emissions."
"Therefore, in 2023, we started to 
quantify our emissions resulting from Forest, Land, and Agriculture (‘FLAG’) operations according to the 
SBTi FLAG Guidance."
"The results of our calculations (based on 2022 data) show that FLAG emissions 
represent only a minor proportion of adidas’ total GHG emissions, with the main impacts stemming from 
sourcing cow leather, cotton, and natural rubber."
"The result of 7% FLAG emissions18 falls below the SBTi 
 
18 The result of 7% FLAG emissions was not part of an assurance engagement by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft."
"¬ 
Measuring our product footprint  
⌐ adidas recognizes the pivotal role of data and transparency as catalysts for increasing awareness and 
informed decision-making to mitigate the environmental impact of our products."
"This impact, largely 
resulting from decisions made during the design phase, underlines the importance of strategic 
interventions."
"In 2023, we achieved a critical milestone with the development of an in-house, state-of-the-
art tool that allows us to measure the environmental footprint of any footwear or apparel product within 
our portfolio."
"Aligned with international standards, the methodology adheres to ISO 14067:2018 and has 
undergone rigorous third-party verification."
"This tool is seamlessly integrated into our existing creation 
systems, connecting and leveraging available life cycle assessment (LCA) data, ultimately speeding up the 
calculation process and enhancing accuracy."
This tool enables us to create higher transparency about product carbon footprints for consumers.
"In 
2023, we managed to disclose the carbon footprint for selected articles and will continue to do so for an 
increasing number of articles in 2024."
"Identifying ways we can make lower-impact products requires a detailed and thorough approach that 
includes not only optimizing our own operations but also the manufacturing of each of our products."
"As 
most of our carbon emissions occur outside our direct control, we collaborate with our suppliers located 
across the globe, helping them improve their carbon footprint during production processes."
"¬ 
Supply chain 
⌐ Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy use during manufacturing of products at our supplier 
factories are one of the major contributors to the carbon footprint of our entire value chain."
"Consequently, 
working with our suppliers and helping them reduce their emissions is critical for achieving our 
decarbonization targets."
"As our supply chain is large and diverse, we benefit from setting and 
communicating clear ambitions and tangible goals for suppliers, while supporting them with expert know-
how and training, and ultimately also measuring and rewarding them for progress made."
"In 2022, we set clear expectations for developing a holistic approach to decarbonization in our ‘adidas 
Decarbonization Manifesto’ for our strategic suppliers at Tier 1 and Tier 2: 
− 
Environmental stewardship: Suppliers should set targets that get approved by the SBTi by 2024."
"− 
Materials: 100% of new material offered to adidas must be of sustainable content and produced 
using low-carbon-intensive processes."
"− 
Product: Suppliers should aim for an aggressive adoption of more sustainable and low-carbon 
materials spanning from creation to manufacturing."
"− 
Transparency: Suppliers should build in-house capacity to provide full transparency and 
traceability, from raw material to finished product, and connect to the adidas sustainable 
material tracing tool that is used to trace the source of origin."
"− 
Energy sources: Suppliers should adopt clean energy, including rooftop solar energy, energy 
sourced through renewable energy purchase power agreements (PPAs), and other renewable 
alternatives, and also achieve a phase-out of coal by or before 2025."
"− 
Manufacturing processes: Suppliers should adopt low-carbon technologies selected from the 
adidas low-carbon technology portfolio."
"During 2023, we translated the high-level direction of our Manifesto into actionable goals and revised the 
framework we use to track performance of suppliers, helping us monitor how each supplier is contributing 
to our decarbonization efforts."
"We incentivize suppliers for their performance, including product allocation priority, opportunity for 
existing, high-performing partners to gain market share, entry opportunity for new, disruptive supplier 
partners, as well as first-mover advantage and sustainability leadership position."
"By the end of 2023, 
more than 48 boilers have been modified or replaced (2022:18) to use 100% low-carbon fuel such 
as biomass or natural gas."
"Furthermore, six of our suppliers have now completely phased out the 
use of coal in their production."
"− 
Increasing adoption of on-site renewable energy for electricity generation: We have been 
asking our suppliers to install on-site renewable energy sources, such as rooftop solar projects, 
for the last few years, and we are seeing steady progress."
"The total capacity of rooftop solar 
projects at our key suppliers increased by 44% compared to the previous year to 267 MWp in 
2023."
"We supported our suppliers by conducting upskilling sessions on PPAs, Green Tariffs, 
and Energy Attribute Certificates (‘EACs’) or Renewable Energy Certificates (‘RECs’) and 
connecting them with providers of these solutions."
"As a result, 35 supplier factories are now 
using more than 50% of their electricity from RE."
"Overall, our suppliers sourced more than 
447,268 MWh from off-site renewable energy projects in 2023, reflecting an increase of 38% 
compared to the previous year."
"We connected with various 
industry experts such as World Resources Institute (WRI), CDP, World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and 
Indonesia Business Council for Sustainable Development (IBCSD) to help them establish their 
SBTi targets."
"Through the program, our suppliers identified and quantified their Scope 1, 2, and 3 
GHG emissions and built roadmaps on how to reduce emissions."
"¬ 
 
Own operations 
⌐ We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions in our own operations, i.e., our administrative offices, 
distribution centers, and own retail stores."
"In 2023, this equaled to a coverage of 3,491,966 m2 of gross 
leased area."
"We are working on measures such as improving energy efficiency, 
implementing on-site RE production, and sourcing renewable electricity."
"We continued to invest in our own 
operations and offered ‘Green Funds’ to subsidize local energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy 
projects."
"One such measure in 2023 was an on-site solar project combined with electrification of gas 
infrastructure used for heating at our distribution center in Caspe, Spain."
We further improved our coverage of energy data collection within our own operations.
"During 2023, we 
managed to increase our primary data coverage for our own retail sites by a further five percentage points 
compared to the previous year to 41% globally."
"Data coverage for administrative offices and distribution 
centers is at 100%, while data for showrooms and smaller offices was mostly estimated."
"In 2023, our total energy consumption across own operations globally was 494,489 MWh (2022: 510,539 
MWh), equivalent to total emissions of 164,236 tCO2e (2022: 164,149 tCO2e)."
"As a result, 
we saw no significant change in reported Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions despite an overall decrease in 
energy consumption compared to 2022."
"In 2023, we signed a virtual PPA for Europe: For a period of ten 
years, adidas will be supplied with approximately 50,000 MWh of renewable electricity per year produced 
by a new solar project in Spain, starting in 2025."
"This will contribute to the long-term reduction of 
emissions from our European operations."
"Our IMS helps us to secure all relevant ISO management systems certifications for key locations, such as 
environmental management (ISO 14001), health and safety management (ISO 45001), and energy 
management (ISO 50001)."
"We aim to further expand these certifications to more key sites through 
implementation of the standards as well as internal and external audits, as they support our efforts to 
achieve our energy, water, waste, and health and safety targets."
"As of 2023, 70 sites (2022: 64) were 
certified for ISO 14001, 140 sites (2022: 112) for ISO 45001, and 324 sites (2022: 322) for ISO 50001 (applies 
to locations with more than 50 employees or space exceeding 4,500m2)."
"While we aim to obtain these external certifications for strategically relevant projects, we 
also apply a set of internal eco-efficiency standards that mirror the priorities of the LEED certification for 
all other projects."
"¬ 
Water efficiency 
⌐ adidas has been running water reduction programs for years and has built a strong awareness of the 
importance of this topic among its Tier 1 suppliers."
"Since 2021, we have been using a self-governance 
model that requires suppliers to take responsibility for their reduction efforts, while adidas continues to 
track and monitor their consumption."
"We continued to expand and focus our water reduction efforts by 
including additional Tier 2 suppliers with high water use in our environmental program."
"In 2023, Tier 2 
suppliers achieved a 33% reduction in water intensity (m3/total product output value in US $), compared to 
the 2017 baseline."
"By 2025, we aim to achieve an overall reduction in water intensity of 40% against the 
2017 baseline."
"This will be accomplished with the aid of new technologies and through continued support 
for our suppliers."
"At our own operations globally, we aim to strengthen water efficiency and wastewater projects in the 
coming years."
"By the end of 2023, our water intensity at administrative offices and distribution centers 
totaled 0.138 m3/m2 (2022: 0.145m3/m2)."
"Overall, we 
achieved an accumulative reduction of 28% (2022: 25%) compared to the 2019 baseline (0.193 m3/m2), and, 
with that, exceeded the target we set ourselves for 2025."
"¬ 
Chemical management
⌐ We are dedicated to leading our supply chain to implement more sustainable chemical management 
practices using globally recognized guidelines throughout our production processes."
"We apply an end-to-
end approach that includes using safe chemicals, eliminating potentially harmful substances, and 
ensuring proper discharge of treated wastewater that meets the highest standards."
"As a founding member and signatory contributor, we maintained our strong collaboration with the Zero 
Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals (ZDHC) Foundation and supported them by actively participating in 
various task teams dedicated to the development of guidelines and trainings."
"Formulators successfully completed the transition to the revised ZDHC MRSL version and 
introduced approximately 1,000 new ‘Level 3’-certified formulations that are predominantly used in the 
footwear production and printing process in our supply chain."
"Through this program, in 2023, 67% of 
chemical formulation used by our suppliers achieved the highest level of conformance with ZDHC 
MRSL (‘Level 3’) (2025 target: 80%19)."
"Going forward, we remain dedicated to further enhancing this 
program to drive exceptional performance in 2024."
adidas is committed to being more than 99% PFAS-free.
"In 2023, an industry-wide supplier informed 
us that paint containing PFAS was incorrectly used for individual components of zippers in our PFAS-
free apparel range."
"Upon learning this, we have taken appropriate steps to ensure that we will return 
to being 99% PFAS-free as of Fall/Winter 2024."
"− Upgrading targets for cleaner wastewater discharge: Ensuring clean wastewater discharge is of 
paramount importance to us."
"We consistently surpassed our 2025 targets, with 84% of our supplier 
facilities meeting the ZDHC wastewater foundational level in 2023, resulting from our proactive 
approach to evaluating effluent treatment plants and implementing corrective measures."
"Following a 
continuous overperformance, we increased our target from initially 80% to now aiming for 90% of 
facilities that should meet this level by 2025."
"We have done so despite the fact that we anticipate 
revisions of the ZDHC wastewater guideline next year, for which we do not yet have full visibility of the 
new parameters to report on."
"We will continue to guide our suppliers through capacity building and 
best practice sharing to ensure a smooth transition to the application of the new guidelines."
"¬  
 
 
 
 
19 Target was revised for clarity in 2023."
Progress toward target as previously defined was that 69% of suppliers used at least 60% ‘Level 3’ chemicals.
"We have developed 
waste management guidelines to help our suppliers improve waste segregation in manufacturing, 
prioritizing recycling and reuse of non-hazardous waste."
"These guidelines specify that the non-recyclable 
waste materials should not be directly landfilled."
"We developed a waste diversion program to use non-
recyclable manufacturing waste in energy production in collaboration with co-processing partners in our 
major sourcing countries."
"Co-processing is a proven and sustainable solution that can reduce pollution, 
reduce consumption of natural resources, reduce landfill space, and ultimately contribute to a smaller 
carbon footprint."
"To further optimize waste diversion, we have scaled up this solution across the globe, 
especially in sourcing countries with immature co-processing infrastructure."
"Globally, the suppliers 
enrolled in our environmental program collectively achieved a 96% landfill diversion in 2023."
"At own operations, during 2023, we continued to focus on improving the quality of waste-related data from 
our administrative offices and distribution centers by upskilling team members on the data collection 
process of waste streams."
"This resulted in a higher data quality, but also a lower diversion rate."
"As of 
2023, 98% (2022: 89%) of our own operations by square meters are monitoring and tracking waste."
"By the 
end of 2023, a total of 26,382 tons (2022: 32,246 tons) of waste was generated, and we achieved an 
accumulated diversion rate of 89% (2022: 88%) for administrative offices and distribution centers."
"¬ 
Transportation 
⌐ We regularly track the environmental impact related to the transport of our goods."
"Compared to the 
previous year, performance remained relatively stable."
"While the use of air freight decreased to 1% in 
2023 as part of our efforts to counterbalance covid-related supply chain challenges, the vast majority of 
our transportation continued to take place via sea freight and truck."
"¬ 
Materials 
[ Our sustainable article offering has steadily increased over the last years."
"Our ambition is that 90% of 
our articles will be sustainable by 2025."
"We define articles as sustainable when they show environmental 
benefits versus conventional articles due to the materials used, meaning that they are – to a significant 
degree – made with environmentally preferred materials."
"The majority of the environmentally preferred 
materials currently used are recycled materials or more sustainable cotton."
"To qualify as a sustainable article, environmentally preferred materials have to exceed a certain 
predefined percentage of the article weight."
"In 2023, almost eight out of ten of our articles were sustainable according to this definition, and 
consequently exceeded our planned annual milestone set for this year."
"This achievement was supported 
by progress across all categories."
"More than 90% of all apparel and accessories and gear articles were 
already sustainable."
"Our sustainable footwear offering nearly doubled compared to the previous year, 
despite the technical difficulty to develop sustainable solutions at scale."
"On top, we experienced 
challenges with regard to the availability of more sustainable, high-performing, and economically scalable 
materials in 2023."
20 This standard has been applied from 2022 onward.
"Percentage of sustainable articles (by count) offered at the points of sale (average of Fall/Winter season 
of the current financial year and Spring/Summer season of the following financial year)."
"When calculating the article weight, trims are excluded for apparel, 
footwear, and accessories and gear."
Only articles with verified environmentally preferred material contents are included.
Licensed articles are excluded.
"This required investments into our IT 
infrastructure and now enables automated measurement of sustainable components for each of our 
articles."
"Progress toward this target was successfully verified by a third party for the second consecutive 
year under the most reliable form of auditing (‘reasonable assurance’), increasing awareness across the 
entire company and supporting our system readiness for future requirements."
"] 
⌐ The most commonly used materials are listed in the following table."
− Recycled polyester: Polyester is the most widely used material in adidas products.
"In 2017, we set 
ourselves the ambitious target to replace all virgin polyester with recycled polyester in all products 
where a solution exists by the end of 2024."
"We set clear internal milestones for our product creation 
teams and have seen progress throughout the last several seasons."
"In 2023, 99% (2022: 96%) of all the 
polyester we used was recycled."
"This includes ‘Parley Ocean Plastic,’ which is plastic waste collected 
from remote islands, beaches, coastal communities, and shorelines, preventing it from polluting the 
oceans, as a replacement for virgin polyester."
"With that, we are on track to use only recycled polyester 
by the end of 2024."
"While recycled polyester has been in use for a long time, it is still not the standard 
in the textile industry, with only 15% of polyester produced worldwide being recycled polyester."
"Share of recycled polyester in 2023 
99% 
 
− More sustainable cotton: Since the end of 2018, 100% of the cotton we use has come from more 
sustainable sources, including organic, recycled, and other third-party certified cotton."
"During the 
2022/23 cotton season, adidas participated in the ‘Organic Cotton Accelerator’s Farm Program’ and 
sourced organic cotton from smallholder farmers in India."
"As a member of the Leather Working Group (‘LWG’) since 2006, 
adidas has defined standards for our leather suppliers, including LWG certification, compliance with 
our Restricted Substances List ‘A-01,’ exclusion of hides from India and China, and exclusion of all 
exotic leathers and furs."
"Currently, more than 99% of our leather volume is audited in accordance with 
the LWG protocol, with most of our hides being sourced from tanneries with the highest possible rating 
(‘Gold’)."
"LWG is currently working on enhancing this audit protocol to create an industry-first 
traceability standard for leather."
"In 2023, adidas committed to a deforestation and conversion-free 
(‘DCF’) leather supply chain latest by 2030."
"− Innovative materials: In 2023, adidas launched products with a material using new technology 
(‘LanzaTech’) that turns greenhouse gases into feedstock for polyester."
"Waste gases are sourced from 
industrial emissions and fermented to ethanol, which is one of the elements needed to make 
polyester."
These elements substitute the conventional building blocks made with fossil fuel feedstock.
"The 2023 Australian Open tennis collection and a total of around 380,000 pieces of apparel and 
footwear, were produced with material using this technology across several business units including 
running and training."
"In the fall, we successfully launched a small collection of Gazelle shoes with 
‘Mylo,’ a material made on the basis of mycelium, through a collaboration drop with Sean 
Wotherspoon."
"We are aware that textile products release microfibers during manufacturing processes and also during 
product use, due to washing or UV exposure."
"These microfibers can have a negative environmental impact 
on soil, air, and water."
"There still is, however, little research done to understand the root causes."
"We 
acknowledge that fiber fragmentation is a complex challenge for our industry, but it is one we are 
proactively addressing."
"adidas is a co-founder of ‘The Microfibre Consortium’ (‘TMC’), which has developed 
a test method for assessing microfiber release and, in the future, aims to advise the textile industry on 
mitigating the impact of fiber fragmentation."
"In 2023, TMC published position papers on microfibers in 
wastewater as well as a study on fiber fragmentation of recycled polyester in fabrics."
"Both contribute to 
better understanding the complexity of this topic and, as a result, will help define our approach going 
forward."
"¬ 
Circularity 
⌐ adidas has been a pioneer in creating products with a circular end-of-life solution, known as ‘made to 
be remade’ (‘MTBR’)."
"This journey began with the introduction of the Futurecraft.Loop shoe in 2019, a 
100% mono-material performance running shoe that was made according to circular design principles."
"We successfully scaled this concept from a prototype back in 2019 to a fully commercial MTBR apparel 
and footwear collection across multiple categories through 2023."
The program will expire in 2024.
"During 
the last few years, we learned that the implementation of circular services requires tight collaboration 
with partners along the entire value chain including collection, sorting, and recycling of waste."
"In addition to circular products, adidas also carried out several pilots on circular services in previous 
years, such as sneaker cleaning in stores globally, rental, and take-back programs."
"In 2023, we focused on 
the topic of repair to extend the lifespan of our products."
"We maintained a repair service at our Terrex 
store in Munich and launched a rental program pilot in our new concept store in Berlin."
"This includes direct and indirect value chain partners, ranging from 
collectors and sorters to pre-processing partners and recyclers, as well as suppliers and innovators."
"Using 
frameworks established by industry organizations, and anticipating upcoming regulatory requirements, we 
identified actions to be implemented across our entire value chain operations."
"We aim to support the 
creation of an ecosystem necessary to bring closed loops to scale in our industry and we will be sharing 
our knowledge and reviewing lessons learned from past circular service pilots and the MTBR product 
design criteria."
"The key objective is to transform end-of-use textiles from waste into a desired feedstock and a 
commodity for new business models, thus proving the economic viability of a scalable circular 
economy for textiles in Europe."
"─ ‘New Cotton Project’: adidas has been a partner in this EU-funded project which is an industry and 
multi-stakeholder effort to scale the chemical recycling technology of Infinited Fiber Company with the 
ambition to expand circularity of cotton textile waste."
"The project will be completed in 2024 and has 
been impactful in scaling closed-loop textile sorting and recycling."
"─ Projects with ‘Fashion for Good’: In addition to EU-funded projects, we were actively involved in 
several projects with Fashion for Good in 2023."
"adidas is the lead sponsor of the ‘Sorting For 
Circularity’ project in the US, an initiative of Fashion for Good and the Circle Economy."
"Going beyond, 
through a series of projects, adidas has continuously collaborated with other organizations to develop 
a ‘Sorting for Circularity’ framework, a comprehensive guide to mapping the garment life cycle, 
capturing textile waste, and unlocking its recycling potential."
"We believe that this guide can be a 
valuable tool for the fashion industry to transition toward circularity."
"─ ‘FastFeetGrinded’: adidas also partnered with FastFeetGrinded to test shoe recycling processes with 
the aim of developing a scalable solution for the footwear industry."
"The pilot involves deconstructing 
shoes into macro components for repurposing and reuse."
"We actively engage with circular economy experts and organizations to stay up to date on the latest 
developments and incorporate innovative approaches into our circularity initiatives."
"We have launched 
initiatives in various markets to educate consumers about circularity and encourage them to wear 
products longer."
"We published a series of blog articles to upskill consumers on proper cleaning of shoes 
in the US, and in Germany we partnered with one of our online retailers to create trainings for consumers 
on how to best care for their shoes."
"These activities demonstrate our commitment to circularity and 
driving change within the fashion industry aiming to move forward on the circular journey with our value 
chain partners."
"¬  
Biodiversity 
⌐ adidas is aware of the potential impacts and dependencies its business operations can have on 
ecosystem services and nature assets."
"In our industry, preserving and restoring biodiversity is a complex 
challenge that requires strong collaboration between multiple actors, including direct and indirect 
suppliers, certifiers, and innovators."
"Particular focus was given 
to the potential risk of deforestation because it represents the greatest lever for reducing the loss of 
biodiversity."
"In our value chain, a potential risk of deforestation is linked to the sourcing of nature-derived 
commodities used in our products and packaging, such as leather, natural rubber, and timber."
"In 2023, we prioritized leather and have already set a target."
"Roadmaps for natural rubber and timber-
derived materials are under development."
"─ Leather: In 2023, we committed to source all bovine leather from DCF supply chains by 2030 or earlier."
"This commitment is based on the ‘Deforestation-Free Call to Action for Leather’ by Textile Exchange 
and the LWG, which aims to catalyze change within the entire bovine leather value chain through 
collective action."
"To achieve the 2030 target, we will follow a two-phase roadmap."
"The first phase 
encompasses mapping the leather supply chain beyond the tannery to the origin of the hide at the 
slaughterhouse."
"This additional transparency will allow a risk assessment and, in a second phase, lead 
to articulating more specific requirements that will be set for the earlier production stages to ensure 
that the leather we source is not linked to deforestation."
"Consequently, in 2023, we started a 
comprehensive mapping of our entire leather supply ecosystem down to the slaughterhouse and, 
where possible, to the farm level."
"This assessment has been carried out with the support of an external 
party and is currently under evaluation."
This mapping will form the basis for our next steps.
"In addition, we have also been working with the WWF on their ‘Deforestation Toolkit,’ a project that 
brought together relevant actors in the leather supply chain, from the slaughterhouse owners to the 
buying companies."
"This toolkit will provide guidance to all actors on an aligned deforestation-free 
strategy and ensure robust commitments."
"Finally, as part of LWG in 2023, we also focused on 
traceability, with adidas sponsoring the first phase of the LWG ‘Traceability Roadmap.’ This roadmap 
has three pillars: traceability assessment, deforestation due diligence, and chain of custody."
"adidas 
experts actively participated in working groups with other brands and diverse stakeholders from the 
leather supply industry."
"In addition, adidas piloted a traceability blueprint using blockchain technology 
with the UN Economic Commission for Europe."
"─ Natural rubber: We also initiated a supply chain mapping exercise for natural rubber to identify the 
countries of origin of this feedstock."
"The gaps identified in this analysis will be addressed over the next 
years to ensure we have complete visibility of our supply chain and to enable us to work with our 
suppliers toward our goal of sourcing DCF natural rubber."
"─ Timber-related commodities and alternatives: In alignment with our DCF commitment, we have 
worked with Canopy Planet to structure our commitments on timber-related materials."
"This includes 
supporting the conservation of forests and ecosystems, further assessing our sourcing of man-made 
cellulosic fibers and paper packaging, and working toward eliminating sourcing from ancient and 
endangered forests."
We continue to prioritize recycled or DCF-certified paper packaging.
"Through the 
‘Fashion for Good’ innovator platform, we are collaborating with various innovators to explore 
alternatives to virgin materials, such as from agricultural waste."
"Our involvement in such innovation 
pilots supports the fashion industry in finding solutions to avoid increasing pressure on forest-derived 
materials."
"We do not source or 
process raw materials from endangered or threatened species as defined by the International Union 
for Conservation of Nature (‘IUCN’) in its Red List."
"All down used in our products is either virgin down 
certified by the Textile Exchange’s Responsible Down Standard (‘RDS’) or recycled down."
"Regarding 
the sourcing of wool, we are committed to increase the share of wool that is certified by Textile 
Exchange’s Responsible Wool Standard (‘RWS’) to 100% by the end of 2024."
"In 2023, we continued our work on biodiversity at our headquarters in Germany and completed a campus-
wide inventory, created a master plan, and implemented initial measures to improve biodiversity on 
campus."
"Results will be used to develop new plans to reflect observations and implement science-based 
biodiversity actions."
"We also raised employee awareness of biodiversity, regenerative agriculture, and 
deforestation and conversion through several internal upskilling sessions, collaborative workshops, and 
employee activations around the globe."
"¬ 
Packaging 
⌐ We are committed to using more sustainable packaging materials and reducing the impact of 
packaging by optimizing box sizes and number of shipments, although this only accounts for a small 
proportion of total emissions, around 1%."
"Most of our paper-based packaging, such as shoe boxes and shipping boxes, is made with recycled 
content."
"Practically all plastic packaging (polybags) used to protect finished products during shipping is 
made from 100% recycled LDPE (low-density polyethylene)."
"The only current exceptions are the DCs 
where e-commerce returns are repackaged, and no local vendor of recycled LDPE polybags is available 
yet (less than 1% of polybags)."
"For many years already, all carrier bags handed out in adidas retail stores 
have been made with recycled paper."

Product safety  
⌐ Product safety is an imperative."
"As a company we have to manage the risk of selling defective products 
that may result in injury to consumers."
"To mitigate this risk, we have company-wide product safety policies 
in place that ensure we consistently apply physical and chemical product safety and conformity standards."
"The creation of respective adidas standards and policies is a collaborative, cross-functional approach 
involving experts from both our Legal and Global Operations departments to ensure all aspects of a 
specific product are covered."
This includes subsequent updates and training activities.
"Application and 
monitoring of compliance with our policies are ensured through Global Operations."
One of these policies is the Restricted Substances Policy (‘A-01’ Policy) we pioneered in 1998.
"It covers the 
strictest applicable local requirements and includes best practice standards as recommended by 
consumer organizations."
"The policy is updated and published internally and externally at least once a year 
based on findings in our ongoing dialogue with scientific organizations and is mandatory for all business 
partners."
"Both our own quality laboratories and external institutes are used to constantly monitor material 
samples for compliance with our requirements."
"Materials that do not meet our standards and 
specifications are rejected."
"As a result of our ongoing efforts, we did not record any product recalls in 
2023."
"In addition, a PFAS phase-out guidance 
supported by an online webinar for suppliers has been published."
"All these tools will be issued to the 
public and made available to other companies from the textile and sporting goods industry and their 
suppliers."
"We also continued to participate in several major public stakeholder consultation processes 
initiated by the European Commission (e.g., European Chemicals Agency) and US state legislative 
initiatives to inform governmental entities on implications and opportunities of drafted legislation."
"¬ 
Human rights 
⌐ In 2023, we took further steps to advance our Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence 
(‘HREDD’) efforts in support of our ambition to have a system in place to identify and manage high-risk 
human rights issues across the entirety of our value chain by 2025."
"This included expanding the scope of 
our human rights and environmental risk management system to encompass other business areas such 
as Global Brands, Procurement, and Human Resources, in addition to our product sourcing activities."
"As 
part of this expanded risk management system, we have further developed our governance framework to 
assign accountability for human rights and environmental risk management at a functional level and 
established internal risk assessment and reporting procedures."
"Our cross-functional internal ESG 
Regulation Board oversees compliance with current and emerging regulations, and we have conducted 
upskilling training sessions on a range of topics, including the company-wide application of the German 
Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains."
"The Act, which went into effect on January 1, 2023, regulates the responsibility of German companies to 
respect human rights in their global supply chains and calls on companies to identify, assess, and 
prioritize risks and address them by taking steps to minimize or eliminate adverse impacts."
"In the first 
half of 2024, adidas will submit a Human Rights and Environmental Due Diligence Report to the German 
authorities and publish it on its corporate website to fulfill its annual public reporting obligation."
"In 2023, to strengthen this approach and complement our due diligence processes, we updated our ‘Third 
Party Complaint Procedure for Human Rights and Environmental Impacts’ to address both actual and 
potential adverse human rights and environmental impacts in our direct and indirect supply chain."
"In 2023, we introduced additional tools and systems to enhance our assessment of high-risk issues such 
as forced labor and child labor in upstream supply chains and other human rights risks arising from 
business activities undertaken in conflict-affected countries."
"This included the introduction of a US 
regulatory compliance database, which allows individual business entities and production locations to be 
screened against trade sanctions and forced labor risk data."
"We automated this process by linking our in-
house sustainable material traceability system to this platform, enabling us to track the risk of forced 
labor in our supply chain."
"We also continued to roll out an internal reporting tool to identify and evaluate 
the potential presence of ILO forced labor indicators."
None of the suppliers assessed showed evidence of forced labor.
"This tool is now being applied globally to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance across the entire supply 
chain."
"In response to the ongoing war in Ukraine and continued political instability in post-coup Myanmar, we 
continue to carry out a heightened version of human rights due diligence."
"In Ukraine, while physical access 
to conduct on-site audits remains restricted, we have actively engaged with our supplier to conduct 
remote worker interviews and monitor the human rights situation."
"In Myanmar, we continuously engage 
with international and local stakeholders to monitor the evolving human rights situation."
"An enhanced human rights due diligence was also conducted in the context of adidas’ business wind-down 
in Russia, a country that has faced a wide range of international sanctions."
"The assessment considered the 
impact on employees and retail staff affected by the winding down of business operations and store 
closures."
"This engagement also included reaching out to FIFA 
regarding their tracking of human rights impacts in the lead-up to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup and 
the development of a human rights framework for cities hosting the 2026 FIFA Men's World Cup in the 
Americas."
We continue to implement responsible recruitment practices in the supply chain.
"In 2023, we updated our 
Responsible Recruitment Policy to reflect the renewed industry commitment to the ‘Employer Pays’ 
principle to ensure that workers receive a timely refund in the event they have paid fees and incurred costs 
to obtain and maintain their job."
"As part of our ongoing engagement with Tier 2 manufacturers in our 
supply chain in Asia on the responsible recruitment and employment of foreign migrant workers, we 
piloted a digital worker voice tool with ten material suppliers in Taiwan."
"The pilot sought to amplify worker 
feedback and monitor and remedy grievances and complaints."
"We are also committed to maintaining our achieved 100% response rate in the Business and 
Human Rights Resource Centre (‘BHRRC’) company response mechanism, which encourages companies 
to publicly address human rights issues raised by civil society."
"We continue to receive external recognition 
for our transparent approach to managing human rights."
"For example, we are ranked among the top ten 
apparel and footwear companies in the Corporate Human Rights benchmark of the World Benchmarking 
Alliance (‘WBA’) and maintain a leadership position in third place in the KnowTheChain benchmark on 
forced labor."
"In addition, they follow ILO and UN conventions relating to human rights and to 
fundamental principles and rights at work, as well as the model code of conduct of the World Federation of 
the Sporting Goods Industry (‘WFSGI’)."
"We seek to extend our reach by cascading responsibilities to our contractual partners to capture and 
address potential and actual risks related to possible labor rights violations upstream and downstream of 
our supply chain."
"Specific reference to the code provisions of the ILO core labor conventions is provided in 
the adidas Guidelines on Employment Standards."
"The Social and Environmental Affairs (‘SEA’) senior 
management team reviews and approves all policies and implementation processes of the labor rights 
program."
"Based on this feedback, we have continued 
our efforts to improve our purchasing practices."
"In addition, in partnership with Better Buying, we 
expanded the use of our e-learning training on responsible purchasing practices to more than 
4,000 employees in Global Operations."
"In 2023, the training was also shared with the majority of adidas 
licensee partners to further improve their understanding of effective responsible purchasing policies."
"Due to positive progress in our 
suppliers’ overall performance in 2022, we have upgraded our 2025 target for the number of suppliers expected to achieve a ‘4S’ rating."
"The overall target seeks 
to achieve 100% adherence to or 90% overachievement against these foundational social impact measures, with ‘3S’ being the minimum expected supplier 
performance."
"2 The fair wage benchmarks include industry wages, minimum wages, and living wages."
"These benchmarks are set and tracked through the ‘FLA Fair 
Compensation Tool,’ a factory self-reporting tool that has been widely adopted by the industry and is being rolled out progressively to strategic Tier 1 suppliers."
"4 In conducting due diligence we seek to identify, prevent, or mitigate potential adverse human rights or environmental impacts, with priority given to 
addressing the most severe impacts."
"Measuring supplier social impact performance 
In 2022, we launched our social impact KPI (‘S-KPI’) tool to measure suppliers’ social impact performance 
through a set of social indicators, such as accident rates, worker satisfaction, and worker empowerment."
"By 2025, we aim to have 90% of strategic Tier 1 suppliers achieve a minimum of ‘4S,’ (on a scale of 1-5, 
with 5 being the best) and 100% of strategic Tier 1 suppliers achieve ‘3S’ or better."
"¬ 
Improving fair wages and gender equality at our suppliers’ factories  
⌐ We are committed to upholding responsible sourcing practices, increasing gender equality, and 
creating pay equity, with the goal of providing fair compensation to workers in our supply chain, regardless 
of their gender."
"By 2025, we aim to see a progressive improvement in compensation, measured by fair 
wage benchmarks, and achieve gender wage parity for workers and their supervisors at our strategic Tier 
1 suppliers."
"The data reported for the 2020 benchmark year 
data was collected from 2021-2023, the 2023 mid-term year data will be collected in 2024, and the 
2025 data will be collected in 2026."
"Results of our entire benchmarking period 2020 show that the wages paid by the suppliers in scope for this 
exercise (representing around 80% of all strategic suppliers) exceed all of the aforementioned 
benchmarks."
"In line with the FLA Fair Compensation formula, all wages reported below include regular 
wages, paid leave, applicable and eligible incentives, benefits in kind and cash benefits, and exclude all 
legally required taxes and social insurance contributions."
"─ 
Cambodia (ten factories): In our major sourcing country for apparel, wages paid by adidas 
suppliers surpassed the legal gross minimum wage by 56% and the applicable net FLA Country 
Average by 33%."
"In the case of Cambodia, 90% of the factories assessed are unionized, while 10% 
have a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in place."
"─ 
China (14 factories): The factories assessed in China are located within ten different gross 
minimum wage groups."
"Across all minimum wage groups, factories’ net wages surpassed their 
applicable minimum wage requirement by between 13% and 159%."
"Currently, two of our data 
collection in-scope factories with an available and applicable GLWC benchmark surpassed their 
GLWC benchmark by 2% and 34%, respectively."
"In China, 79% of these factories have a state-
backed trade union, and 43% a CBA in place."
"─ 
Indonesia (13 factories): The factories assessed in Indonesia are located within ten different legal 
gross minimum wage groups, which vary widely in terms of minimum wage requirements."
"Across 
all minimum wage groups, wages paid surpassed the legal minimum wage by between 9% and 
66%; 92% of factories are unionized and have a CBA in place."
"─ 
Pakistan (two factories): The data shows that wages paid by adidas suppliers surpassed the legal 
gross minimum wage by 42% and the applicable net FLA Country Average by 16%."
"Currently, 
none of the factories in scope in Pakistan are unionized."
"─ 
Thailand (four factories): The factories assessed in Thailand are located within three different 
gross minimum wage groups."
"Across all minimum wage groups, wages paid surpassed the legal 
gross minimum wage by between 36% and 44%."
"Currently, none of the factories are unionized."
21 Strategic suppliers as of January 2020.
"22 Data as reported in the 2022 Annual Report included 2020 benchmarking results from wage data collected in 2021 in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam 
(approximately 65% of our selected factories are located in these three countries)."
"A small number of factories in four different countries were initially 
considered for data collection and reporting."
"Due to the minor production volume they represent in their country and to protect their confidentiality, they have 
been subsequently removed from the scope."
"The wages paid by factories in these zones surpass the minimum wage by between 72% and 78% 
and the GLWC benchmark by 18%, where applicable (zone 1 only)."
"100% of the factories have a 
state-backed trade union and a CBA in place."
"We remain on track to complete our benchmarking process and, by the end of 2024, will be able to 
compare our 2020 wage data against the 2023 results."
"This will allow us to assess wage progress over 
time."
"We will continue our efforts to support the levers we have identified as being most influential in 
driving the wage-setting process."
"These are: legal obligations, responsible purchasing practices, 
productivity, industrial relations, and government engagement."
"We will also deploy a Gender Pay Parity 
Capacity Building Program across our supply chain in collaboration with other companies."
"This program 
will focus on raising our suppliers’ awareness and understanding of the gender pay gap, in particular 
equal pay for equal work."
"─ Gender equality: We continue to implement measures that advance gender equality in our supply 
chain and meet our objectives to bring a gender lens to our strategic suppliers’ operations to ensure 
that all workers will have equal opportunities and rights."
"In 2023, such measures included the launch 
of the ‘Gender Equality Worker’ survey, data verification of supplier self-assessment responses, and 
conducting the second annual supplier self-assessment."
"All strategic suppliers have also 
submitted initial improvement plans to address gaps identified in the gender equality self-assessment 
tool and will continue to update their roadmaps for improvement."
"¬ 
Monitoring and assessing performance 
⌐ We regularly assess our manufacturing partners on their ability to provide fair, healthy, and 
environmentally sound workplace conditions by conducting announced and unannounced audits by our 
own team and by accredited external auditors."
"Any cases of non-compliance identified during audits are 
given a clear time frame for remediation."
"Potential new manufacturing facilities are assessed in a similar 
way, and orders can only be placed if approved by the SEA team."
"Based on the audit results, the Sourcing 
and SEA teams jointly decide on the course of action, ranging from training to enforcement actions, such 
as sending warning letters or hiring external consultants to help improve workplace systems or practices."
"We also operate several grievance channels allowing workers or third parties to submit complaints about 
violations of the adidas Workplace Standards and human rights generally."
"All third-party complaints 
received through our grievance channels are reviewed and investigated, and the outcome is reported on 
our corporate website."
"In addition to supply chain 
engagement, Better Work actively works to promote a constructive dialogue between the invested multi-
stakeholders in those countries concerning buyer practices and workers’ rights e.g., civil society 
organizations, governments, worker representatives, and union groups."
"Manufacturing facilities’ conditions are also inspected by independent auditors through our participation in 
the FLA, demonstrating our commitment to independent manufacturing facility inspections and external 
verification of our programs."
"Our program has been accredited three times by the FLA and, in 2023, 
remains accredited based on FLA’s annual evaluations, in which adidas was rated as a top performer."
"The reduction in the number of facilities reflects the 
consolidation of sourcing operations in line with our strategy to form long-term relationships with our core 
manufacturing partners."
"63% of our manufacturing partners’ facilities (2022: 63%) are located in the Asia-
Pacific region."
"In 2023, we worked with 37 licensees (2022: 39) manufacturing products in 251 factories 
(2022: 287) across 33 countries (2022: 34)."
"¬ 
Onboarding of new suppliers 
⌐ In 2023, our primary focus was on maintaining partnerships with our existing manufacturing partners 
rather than onboarding new ones."
"Consequently, the number of initial assessments – the first approval 
stage for a new entry into our supply chain – in prospective supplier factories remained with 66 at a similar 
level to the previous year (2022: 58)."
"The vast majority (64%) of all initial 
assessments were undertaken in Asia (2022: 71%), with China accounting for 20% (2022: 26%)."
"Overall, at the end of 2023, the first-time rejection rate of new factories visited was 29% and thus lower 
than in the previous year (2022: 34%)."
"Manufacturing partners with threshold issues are typically given 
three months to remediate them before being re-audited for final acceptance."
"Through active support and 
capacity building, all initially rejected factories successfully closed their non-compliance issues and were 
onboarded."
Facilities that work with our licensees are reported separately.
"Some of 
these facilities may produce both for adidas directly and for licensees."
"2 Factories that were directly rejected after the first visit, i.e., with no chance of being visited a second time, and factories that were rejected after being visited a 
second time."
3 Total number of audits includes audits done in licensee factories.
"Performance audits conducted in approved factories that have passed the initial assessment 
(this includes on-site and desktop assessments)."
As of 2023 this includes audits under the SLCP and Better Work programs.
"A third and final warning 
results in a recommended termination."
"Worker empowerment 
Over the past few years, we have developed efficient feedback channels, tools to measure worker 
satisfaction, and training tailored to empower workers."
"─ Feedback options: A robust grievance mechanism is the fulcrum on which workers can raise their 
concerns and secure remedies."
"Since 2017, we have reduced our reliance on local worker hotlines as a 
complaint mechanism by building an application-based ‘Workers Voice’ platform: a bespoke, 
manufacturing-facility-based digital grievance channel for workers."
"We have progressively improved 
and expanded the use of this grievance mechanism, and in 2023, more than 359,000 workers employed 
in 108 manufacturing facilities across 16 countries had access, reflecting 100% coverage of our 
strategic manufacturing partners."
"Access to a digital complaint mechanism has proven invaluable 
during covid-19."
"Close to 42,000 human and labor rights complaints (2022: around 48,000) were filed 
through the Workers Voice platform in 2023, with 99% of these complaints being closed by the end of 
2023."
"The top complaints received in 2023 were related to concerns over benefits (more than 11,000), 
general facilities (more than 7,200), and internal communication (more than 7,100)."
"Input received through the Workers Voice platform is tracked by adidas using KPIs and dashboard 
reviews, case satisfaction ratings, and on-site worker interviews."
"It also helps us understand the main challenges and labor rights issues in a manufacturing 
facility and track how the facility’s management and their HR teams resolve cases and communicate 
their findings."
Our evaluation contributes to the facility's overall social impact rating (S-KPI).
"adidas 
provides ongoing capacity building to enhance the facility teams’ capability to improve the effectiveness 
of the grievance mechanism."
"The case satisfaction rate, which allows workers to input their level of 
satisfaction with the resolution of complaints, has almost doubled from 39% in 2019 to 77% in 2023."
"The increase in satisfaction is partly related to a significant improvement in the response time of 
factory management to address workers’ grievances, which decreased from 49 hours in 2020 to less 
than twelve hours in 2023 due to improvements in communication and transparency in the workplace."
"The management teams in the manufacturing facilities have continuously engaged with the facility’s 
workers through newsletters and broadcast messages, which has improved the workers’ engagement 
and encouraged feedback."
"─ Worker satisfaction: Complementing the various grievance channels, we expanded the ‘Worker Pulse’ 
project, a digitalized short survey to capture workers’ perception and awareness of their labor rights 
on focused areas such as communication, harassment, and abuse, as well as grievance systems."
"It 
builds on what we learned from a previous survey process we initiated in 2016."
"In 2023, we undertook 
these digital surveys in 109 manufacturing facilities (2022: 133) across 16 countries (2022: 17), with 
more than 71,000 workers participating (2022: 85,000) through a mobile-phone-based application."
"At 
its core, the survey presented six statements against which the level of agreement or disagreement 
was assessed."
"Topics included the willingness to speak up, to recommend the factory to work at to 
friends, or the comfort level when raising a suggestion or complaint or when talking to supervisors."
"The results show a steady increase in the number of favorable respondents across all questions since 
2020, from roughly 78% to an average of 90% in 2023."
"This shows that when workers’ voices 
are being heard and acted upon by the facility’s management, it can have an impact in improving the 
overall working conditions within a manufacturing facility."
"Manufacturing partners are required to 
develop and track workplace improvement plans based on feedback from the Worker Pulse."
"─ Women leadership: Alongside facility-led training, we also offered tailored training under our ‘Women 
Leadership Program.’ Building on our team’s learnings, we modified the training approach in 2022, 
adopting a hybrid model of in-person and online training."
"We continued with this model in 2023 with 
more than 1,500 supervisors participating in factories in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, 
and Vietnam."
"We closely track the progress of workers graduating from this training initiative, and 
since 2016, approximately 170 female supervisors have been promoted to higher positions as a result 
of their participation in the program."
"─ Labor rights: In 2023, we also saw a continuation of our mobile-phone-based ‘Digital Training’ project, 
which had been successfully rolled out at 133 manufacturing facilities in 17 countries in 2022."
"The 
digital tool assesses workers’ awareness of their labor rights and remedies, e.g., fire safety, 
harassment and abuse, and use of grievance channels."
"More than 50,000, workers took part in 2023 
(2022: 82,000) and averaged a score higher than 92 out of 100 in the post-test questions, thereby 
demonstrating very high levels of awareness of their core rights and available remedies."
"In total, we completed 644 individual facility engagements 
in 2023 (2022: 657) and 179 training sessions for manufacturing partners, licensees, workers and adidas 
employees (2022: 187), reaching a total of around 4,222 people."
"The training sessions continued to cover a 
broad range of topics, from our Workplace Standards, guidelines, and supporting policies, through to 
targeted training on specific labor, health and safety, and environmental topics."
"We continued to work with our licensee partners in 2023 to ensure they are implementing adidas 
Workplace Standards into their manufacturing partners’ operations in a consistent manner."
"Our licensees 
continue to have access to the FLA e-learning materials, which include training courses covering topics 
such as human rights, forced labor, responsible manufacturing, and worker engagement."
"In 2023, we 
expanded this training by facilitating access to the Better Buying Institute’s e-learning course on 
responsible purchasing practices."
"In addition to the training, Better Buying worked with a selected group 
of licensees’ suppliers to complete the Better Buying Partnership Index survey, which helped evaluate the 
impact of the licensees’ purchasing practices on suppliers and their workers and identify any improvement 
areas."
"¬ 
Audits 
⌐ We regularly audit our manufacturing partners against the adidas Workplace Standards, utilizing a 
range of audit tools."
"In 2023, in addition to our own audits, we began to incorporate assessments 
conducted by the ILO’s Better Work program, a collaboration between the United Nations’ ILO and the 
International Finance Corporation to improve working conditions within the apparel and footwear industry."
"adidas also continued to use ‘Social and Labor Convergence Program’ (SLCP) assessments (2023: 79, 
2022: 133) in its monitoring activities to avoid repetitive social audits in shared facilities."
"A total of 499 social compliance audits (initial assessments and performance audits) were conducted in 
2023 (2022: 709), six of which were conducted remotely (2022: 15)."
"Of the 329 on-site performance audits 
conducted, 82% were carried out on an unannounced basis, whereby the manufacturing facility is not 
informed in advance of the exact date of assessment."
"The number of audits in factories manufacturing 
goods for licensees was reduced from 295 in 2022 to 267 in 2023, reflecting a reduction in the number of 
licensee suppliers."
"The 
data shown includes both initial assessments and initial assessment follow-ups, and includes on-site and desktop assessments."
2 Audits conducted in approved factories that have passed the initial assessment (including on-site and desktop assessments).
"As of 2023, audits under the 
SLCP and Better Work programs are included."
"3 Includes environmental assessments and wastewater test assessments according to the ‘ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines.’ 
4 Includes audits done in licensee factories."
"To complement our broader sustainability efforts, we monitor our suppliers to ensure compliance with our 
environmental standards and guidelines and to validate their performance against annual environmental 
targets."
"In addition, a total of 400 wastewater test 
assessments were conducted according to the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines."
"‘High-risk’ locations in 
Asia, which is the most significant sourcing region for adidas, were the subject of extensive monitoring in 
2023, with an audit coverage of 89% (2022: 84%)."
"We also continue our efforts to cascade HREDD processes within our supply chain by holding our key 
Tier 1 manufacturing partners accountable for implementing their own due diligence processes."
"This 
includes measuring our suppliers’ ability and performance in conducting their own internal compliance 
monitoring, as well as their commissioning of social compliance audits in their subcontractor facilities, 
with implementation tracked via our S-KPI tool."
"This is complemented by ongoing steps to extend audit 
coverage to our nominated Tier 2 material suppliers and targeted Tier 3 spinning mills in China."
"¬ 
Audit results and S-KPI performance 
⌐ 2023 marks the second year of measuring our supplier performance using the S-KPI tool."
"The S-KPI 
assesses a factory’s performance in delivering a safe and fair workplace by measuring effective due 
diligence processes, as well as the ability to deliver positive social impact."
"In total, the S-KPI has 15 units 
of measures (‘UOM’)."
"The S-KPI assesses a factory’s 
performance in each of the UOMs based on the information gathered and, where applicable, validated 
during social compliance audits which are uploaded to a dashboard for each supplier."
"The result is a final 
score (in %) which is converted to S-rating levels from 1-5, with 5S being the best."
"The thresholds are set 
as follows: 1S: 0-29%, 2S: 30-59%, 3S: 60-79%, 4S: 80-89%, 5S: 90-100%."
"For suppliers that have achieved 
a S-KPI of 5S, we reserve the possibility to exclude them from selected S-KPI compliance measurements 
for one year due to their low risk profile."
"In 2023, almost 84% of our 108 key manufacturing facilities achieved a rating of 4S or better, which is a 
significant improvement compared to 2022 (75%)."
"We see a positive trend, with almost all of the higher-
performing manufacturing facilities (4S or 5S in 2022) maintaining or improving their S-KPI rating in 2023."
"With this performance, we are confident that we will meet the 2025 target for the upper performance band 
for our suppliers and now expect 90% of our strategic Tier 1 suppliers to achieve a minimum of 4S or 
better by 2025."
"24 Including social and environmental assessments, excluding ZDHC wastewater assessments (400)."
"This rating reflects that these licensees have successfully demonstrated that they have embedded 
strong governance systems, supply chain management, and purchasing practices compliance 
requirements into their business practices."
"Licensees are also assessed on the existence of policies and 
systems to address stakeholder engagement, as well as levels of public reporting and communication."
"¬ 
Non-compliances identified in active factories 
⌐ Our manufacturing partners’ facilities are evaluated against a number of critical compliance issues."
"During the course of each year, we 
continuously track non-compliances identified through manufacturing partners’ performance audits, 
collaboration audits, self-governance assessments, and, since 2020, SLCP assessments."
"We follow up on 
all non-compliance and require our manufacturing partners to remediate these findings within a specified 
timeframe."
The identified issues in 2023 remained largely the same as those reported in 2022.
"As a result, the percentages shown indicate the systemic shortcomings 
of active facilities, where corrective action is required to reduce potential risks, rather than the 
confirmed presence of a specific case of non-compliance or breach, which requires remediation."
"2 ‘No standardized filing’ indicates a factory does not keep relevant information/documents and records that demonstrate compliance with laws and 
regulations."
"─ Health and safety: Fire, electrical, as well as machine and ladder safety are critical areas for existing 
manufacturing facilities, and together they accounted for almost 40% of the non-compliance identified 
in 2023."
"The way chemicals were stored and used, including the handling of hazardous chemicals, 
accounted for 5% of non-compliance findings reported."
"A further 9% of the findings related to 
management systems, policies, and procedures, and specifically a lack of compliance with our 
Workplace Standards and expectation for effective occupational health and safety systems, including 
the recruitment and retention of qualified safety staff."
"Shortcomings in the area of health and safety identified during audits in 2023 
 
1 ‘Other’ includes, for example, material storage, housekeeping, or waste management."
"Remediation of shortcomings 
We follow up on all cases of non-compliance and require our manufacturing partners to remediate open 
issues within a specified timeframe."
"While in many cases the actual issues will have been resolved, our 
approach is to only ‘close’ these in our systems when we have verified evidence of completion and 
established that corrective actions taken are sustainable and sufficient to avoid reoccurrence."
"For instance, in 2023, we launched an occupational health 
and safety program to improve electrical safety for workers and factory maintenance staff, including 
written guidelines and supplier training."
"¬ 
Independent FLA audits 
⌐ Each year, the FLA independently assesses the supply chain of its member brands."
"It does this using a 
variety of monitoring models (e.g., in-person, virtual, or a hybrid approach of both in-person/virtual) that 
result in tailored ‘Sustainable Compliance Initiative’ (‘SCI’) assessments."
"adidas received three such FLA 
assessments in 2023."
"¬  
Enforcement 
⌐ Warning letters are an essential part of our enforcement efforts and are triggered when we find 
ongoing serious non-compliance issues that need to be addressed by our manufacturing partners’ 
facilities."
We work closely with our manufacturing partners to help them improve their performance.
"However, where we face situations of severe or repeated non-compliance that cannot be resolved, we 
terminate business relationships with facilities."
"When making such a decision, we always seek to balance 
the adverse impacts arising from the unresolved non-compliance against the wider effects that a business 
termination can have on the rights and interests of the workers, especially if this triggers layoffs."
"In such 
circumstances, we may extend timelines to ensure a responsible exit is achieved."
"─ Warning letters: In 2023, our close engagement with our manufacturing partners’ facilities helped 
limit the need to issue warning letters, with a total of nine (2022: six) across seven countries."
"Compared to the previous year, the overall number of active first warning letters remained at a similar 
level, from six in 2022 to eight in 2023; the total number of second warnings was one in 2023 (2022: 0)."
"Manufacturing facilities that receive a second warning letter are only one step away from being notified 
of possible termination of the manufacturing agreement and are subject to focused monitoring by our 
team."
"No third warning letters (which result in termination of the contract) were issued to our 
manufacturing partners in 2023 (2022: 0)."
"─ Advisory letter: For suppliers to whom we do not have a direct contractual relationship, we rely on 
advisory letters as an enforcement measure: In 2023, two advisory letters were issued to Tier 2 
facilities after their management failed to commit to complying with our environmental requirements."
"─ Terminations: In 2023, there were no instances in which a supplier agreement was terminated for 
social compliance reasons (2022: 0)."
"¬  
Sustainable Finance 
The challenges posed by the impact of climate change and social developments in our societies and 
supply chains are huge."
Responding to these will require dedicated funding of sustainability initiatives.
"In this section, we provide an overview on our sustainability bond as well as on our approach to 
complying with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy, the objective of which is to channel investments 
in the direction of sustainable economic activities."
"We will also report about responsibility regarding 
tax."
"Through taxes, governments have the monetary ability to pursue their objectives and take on the 
responsibility of further developing their countries."
"Proceeds from the offering are used in 
accordance with the Sustainability Bond Framework we created."
"adidas has committed to providing annual 
updates on the allocation of the proceeds and the impact KPIs driven by the proceeds until fully allocated."
"As of September 2023, adidas had realized full allocation of the net proceeds."
"► SEE TREASURY 
The following summary outlines selected environmental and social impact KPIs in accordance with 
chapter 7 ‘Reporting’ of the ‘adidas Sustainability Bond Framework.’ The proceeds listed in the Allocation 
Report have contributed to these impact KPIs."
"3 Grants distribution for Black-owned small businesses as part of ‘BeyGOOD,’ which is managed by a third party, postponed from 2021 to 2022."
"EU Taxonomy 
⌐ In 2020, the EU introduced Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to establish the EU Taxonomy framework 
(‘Taxonomy’)."
"The purpose of the Taxonomy is to provide a common language and a clear definition of what 
is considered ‘sustainable’ to direct investments toward sustainable economic activities."
"The Taxonomy 
will thereby support the EU’s climate, energy, and ‘European Green Deal’ targets."
"─ Do no significant harm (‘DNSH’): By fulfilling further criteria, it can be demonstrated that the activity 
does not do significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives."
"─ Minimum safeguards: The company performing the activity must have implemented and adhere to 
minimum safeguards relating to human rights, including labor rights, bribery/corruption, taxation, and 
fair competition."
"Furthermore, in 2023, the EU enacted the 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 establishing the Taxonomy eligibility and alignment criteria of 
economic activities for the remaining four environmental objectives mentioned above."
"For the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate 
change adaptation, as in the prior year, it is necessary to provide information on the degree to which 
Taxonomy-eligible economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned and to disclose the corresponding financial 
KPIs."
"In addition, as per Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, we are required to provide specific 
disclosures on economic activities related to the fossil gas and nuclear energy sectors."
"We carried out 
related activities in 2023 due to the operation of a district heating plant in Germany, although, similar to 
2022, not to a material extent."
"Thus, the detailed disclosure requirements as per Annex XII of the 
Delegated Regulation do not apply to adidas."
"Determination of Taxonomy-eligible activities 
The core team reviewed the new delegated acts to the Taxonomy Regulation as they became available and 
analyzed the impact on the disclosure requirements compared to 2022 to ensure accuracy and 
completeness of our reporting."
"As mentioned above, while the reporting requirement covers all six 
environmental objectives since the beginning of 2024, the main economic activities of our business model 
remain out of scope, and we consequently have no turnover-generating Taxonomy-eligible activities to 
report on."
"Hence, the Taxonomy-eligible activities have been assessed according to the substantial 
contribution and ‘DNSH’ criteria as laid out in Annex I to the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139."
"Since 
the identified Taxonomy-eligible activities relate to the purchase of output from potentially Taxonomy-
aligned activities, performing the Taxonomy assessment was dependent on the input of the relevant 
information from the respective third-party suppliers."
"Eligible building leases relate to warehouses/distribution centers, own retail stores, and corporate offices."
"The applicable substantial contribution and DNSH criteria as set out in section 7.7 of Annex I of the 
Delegated Regulation predominantly relate to primary energy demand and climate-related risks and 
adaptation solutions, respectively, in connection with the leased buildings."
"The substantial contribution 
criterion evidence which is most relevant for adidas in this regard is the existence of an Energy 
Performance Certificate (EPC) class A."
"Many of the eligible building leases are located outside of the EU, 
where this EU-centric energy performance certification is not common practice and other standards and 
frameworks, which are not mentioned in the Regulation, are typically used (e.g., LEED certification)."
"In 
addition, certain eligible retail lease locations are heritage sites for which it is not possible to obtain EPC 
class A certification."
"However, we have certain eligible lease contracts in connection with smaller 
warehouse (Dubai), retail (Poland), and corporate office locations (Sweden and the Netherlands), that fulfill 
the substantial contribution criterion."
"This reflects our commitment to decarbonize our own operations as 
well as our more pronounced ability to influence the design and development of major real estate 
investments related to our operational infrastructure."
"► SEE OWN OPERATIONS 
The relevant applicable ‘DNSH’ criterion for building leases relates to the environmental objective of 
climate change adaptation and refers to the performance of a robust climate risk and vulnerability 
assessment as per Appendix A to Annex I of the Delegated Regulation."
"In the assessment, we prioritized 
the most relevant eligible activities for this DNSH criterion."
"As a result, for the majority of the 
assessed building leases, not all information was available for a complete and conclusive assessment 
exactly as per the methodology and scope prescribed by the Regulation."
"However, one of the eligible 
building leases that fulfills the substantial contribution criterion also complies with the DNSH criterion 
and is therefore reported as Taxonomy-aligned."
Eligible company car leases relate to the car fleet at multiple adidas locations.
"As per the applicable 
technical screening criteria mentioned in section 6.5 of Annex I, a vehicle that emits a maximum of 50g of 
CO2e/km is considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation."
"For adidas, this 
applies to all leased electric vehicles and most plug-in hybrid vehicles."
"Assessing compliance with all these criteria requires the involvement 
and input of various suppliers."
"As a result, not all information was available for a complete and conclusive 
assessment as required by the Regulation."
"We therefore assessed the eligible car leases as not 
Taxonomy-aligned."
"For the remaining eligible activities under section 7.3, an assessment of the Taxonomy alignment against 
the respective criteria laid out in Annex I of the Delegated Regulation was conducted in a structured 
manner as far as this was possible with reasonable effort."
"While the eligible activities fulfill the substantial 
contribution criterion, none of them are considered to be Taxonomy-aligned as a result of the non-
compliance with the DNSH assessment."
"¬ 
Minimum safeguards 
⌐ The minimum safeguards form part of the Taxonomy alignment criteria."
"Their purpose is to clarify that 
eligible economic activities can only be environmentally sustainable when performed in circumstances 
which are compliant with social norms and certain minimum governance standards."
"In this context, 
companies must implement appropriate processes and procedures to avoid negative influences on or 
violations of the following four specific topics: human rights (incl."
"labor rights), taxation, corruption/ 
bribery, and fair competition."
"In order to assess adidas’ adherence to the minimum safeguards, we 
reviewed the Platform on Sustainable Finance’s final report to the European Commission on this matter as 
well as the European Commission’s clarifying FAQ document of June 2023."
"Taxation: 
− Lack of tax governance and compliance as well as adequate risk management strategies and 
processes, and/or 
− evidence of tax law violation."
"Corruption/bribery: 
− Lack of anti-corruption processes, and/or 
− cases of court conviction for corruption."
"Fair competition: 
− Lack of promotion of employee awareness of the importance of complying with all applicable 
competition laws and regulations, and/or 
− cases of court conviction for violating competition laws."
"In 2023, similar to the previous year, our subject-matter experts from the Social and Environmental 
Affairs, Tax, and Legal areas assessed the details of the respective criteria."
"As in 2022, our assessment for the fiscal year 2023 confirmed that the Taxonomy-eligible activities were 
performed in a manner that is fully compliant with the minimum safeguards."
"We maintain rigorous 
internal policies and oversight mechanisms to ensure ongoing adherence to these standards."
"In 2023, the 
turnover amounts to € 21,427 million (2022: € 22,511 million)."
"The identified eligible activities at 
adidas were not turnover generating, resulting in a numerator value of ’0’ and, accordingly, a 
turnover KPI of 0% eligible and 100% non-eligible turnover."
"► SEE INCOME STATEMENT 
─ 
CapEx KPI: In comparison to the disclosed CapEx value of € 504 million in this report, the 
Taxonomy definition of CapEx results in a total value of € 838 million (denominator of the CapEx 
KPI) at adidas (2022: € 1,587 million)."
"In this process, we conducted several control measures, such as plausibility 
checks and reconciliations, to avoid double-counting of additions."
"In total, the corresponding 
numerator of the eligible CapEx KPI amounts to € 344 million (2022: € 867 million), resulting in a 
CapEx KPI of 41% eligible and 59% non-eligible CapEx."
"While a total of € 44 million of 
eligible CapEx complies with the substantial contribution criteria, € 7 million of eligible CapEx are 
Taxonomy-aligned."
"In summary, the corresponding numerator of the aligned CapEx KPI amounts 
to € 7 million, resulting in a CapEx KPI of 1% aligned and 40% non-aligned CapEx (2022: 0% 
aligned and 55% non-aligned CapEx)."
"► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
─ 
OpEx KPI: The Taxonomy definition of ‘OpEx’ refers to expenditure for research and development, 
short-term leases, maintenance and repair, as well as certain other expenditure."
"In 2023, this 
amounts to € 969 million (denominator of the OpEx KPI) at adidas (2022: € 862 million), which 
compares to € 21,427 million of net sales and € 10,087 million of OpEx as per the consolidated 
financial statements for adidas disclosed in this report."
"In the context of our business model, 
which is the design, development, production, and marketing of a broad range of performance 
and sports lifestyle products, we consider the Taxonomy OpEx KPI denominator value to be 
insignificant."
"Consequently, and in line with Annex I of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, 
we report the numerator value of our Taxonomy-eligible OpEx KPI as € 0 (2022: € 0)."
"As a result, 
no further information on the alignment of eligible OpEx can be provided in this Annual Report."
"Full information on the Taxonomy KPIs according to Annex II of the Delegated Regulation can be found in 
this Annual Report."

Approach to tax 
⌐ We are committed to being compliant with all tax regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate."
"We consider the interests of our stakeholders in the business decisions we make in order to ensure the 
lasting success of our company."
"We do not operate through artificial structures or structure our business in ways that are intended to 
result in tax avoidance."
"Where we have a presence in so-called low-tax jurisdictions, this is related to our 
business activities in those jurisdictions and is not created for the purpose of minimizing our tax burden."
"While tax is among the many considerations in making business decisions, it is not the main driver in our 
decision-making process."
"The approach to tax is defined by the Vice President Corporate Tax and is reflected in the tax strategy, 
objectives, policies, and internal controls."
"Economic and social impacts are considered in developing and 
executing our tax strategy."
"The Corporate Tax team reviews our tax strategy on an annual basis, with 
significant changes being approved by our Chief Financial Officer (CFO)."
"The CFO is ultimately accountable 
for compliance with our tax strategy."
"Pursuant to our tax policies, the local Directors and Management of each legal entity are responsible for 
ensuring compliance with tax regulations."
"The local teams are supported by the company’s Corporate Tax 
team and tax advisers."
"The Corporate Tax team exercises global governance and is accountable for our 
approach to tax."
"Its main responsibility is to provide global tax advisory, to identify and manage 
opportunities and risks, and to ensure tax compliance worldwide."
"Through partnering with business 
functions, the Corporate Tax team aims to understand the needs and perspectives of various stakeholders 
internally and externally and to support business objectives while ensuring continued compliance with tax 
regulations."
"Our CFO and/or the Executive Board, 
advised by the Corporate Tax team, is ultimately responsible for decisions on topics such as entering into 
significant or one-off transactions that may give rise to an increase in tax risk (e.g., mergers and 
acquisitions)."
"Our ‘Fair Play Code of Conduct’ sets out the options available to employees who detect unlawful or

"Internal management system designed to drive shareholder value 
In order to drive and steer value creation, the company’s Management focuses on a set of major financial 
key performance indicators (KPIs)."
"Sales and operating profit growth, paired with a focus on management 
of operating working capital, are the main contributors to operating cash flow improvements."
"At the same 
time, value-enhancing capital expenditure benefits future operating profit and cash flow development."

strong focus on value creation is reflected in the fact that our Management’s short- and long-term 
variable compensation is closely linked to the company’s growth in sales and profitability."

Net sales and operating profit growth 
Net sales growth is the reflection of the attractiveness of our product offering driven by innovation and our 
ability to create, identify and respond to latest consumer trends."
"To ensure that we have the most relevant 
information to assess our respective performance, we exclude foreign currency effects and use currency-
neutral net sales growth as one of our major KPIs."
Operating profit as another major KPI helps to drive and improve our company’s operational performance.
"The primary drivers to enhance operating profit are as follows: 
─ Sales and gross margin development: Management focuses on identifying and exploiting growth 
opportunities that not only provide for future top-line improvements but also have potential to increase 
our gross margin."
"Major levers include reducing promotional activity and driving full price sales, 
optimizing our pricing, product and market mix as well as managing product and supply chain costs."
"─ Operating expense control: Management puts high emphasis on tightly controlling operating 
expenses."
"This requires a particular focus on ensuring flexibility in the company’s cost base, especially 
in marketing and operating overhead expenses."
"More broadly, marketing expenditure is one of our 
largest operating expenses, and at the same time, one of the most important mechanisms for driving 
brand desirability and top-line growth."
"Therefore, we are committed to both increasing investments 
into our brand and products as well as ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing 
activities."
"We also aim at improving our operational efficiency by actively managing our operating 
overhead expenses."
"In addition to leveraging our top-line growth, we regularly review our operational 
structure to simplify business processes and eliminate redundancies."
"Generally, due to a comparatively low level of fixed 
assets required in our business, the efficiency of the balance sheet depends to a large degree on our 
operating working capital management."
"Operating working capital comprises accounts receivable plus 
inventories minus accounts payable."
"► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
In this context, the major KPI we use is average operating working capital as a percentage of net sales."
"Monitoring the development of this metric facilitates the measurement of our progress in improving the 
efficiency of our business cycle."
"We strive to proactively manage our inventory levels to meet market demand and ensure fast 
replenishment."
"Inventory aging is controlled carefully to reduce inventory obsolescence and to minimize 
clearance activities."
"As a result, ‘Inventory Days Lasting’ (‘IDL’) is monitored and assessed regularly as it 
measures the average number of days goods remain in inventory before being sold, highlighting the 
efficiency of capital locked up in products."
"To optimize capital tied up in accounts receivable and accounts 
payable, we focus on managing collection efforts and payment terms."
"Capital expenditure targeted to maximize future returns 
Improving the effectiveness of capital expenditure is another major lever to drive our cash flow generation."
"We control capital expenditure with a top-down, bottom-up approach."
"In a first step, Management defines 
focus areas and an overall investment budget based on investment requests from various functions within 
the organization."
"Then, in a second step, our operating segments align their initiatives within the scope of 
assigned priorities and available budget."
"We evaluate potential return on planned investments utilizing the 
net present value method."
"Risk is accounted for by adding a risk premium to the cost of capital, and thus 
reducing our estimated future earnings streams where appropriate."
"By means of scenario planning, the 
sensitivity of investment returns is tested against changes in initial assumptions."
"For large investment 
projects, timelines and deviations versus budget are monitored on a monthly basis throughout the course 
of the project."
"In addition to optimizing return on investments, we evaluate larger projects upon 
completion and document learnings for future capital expenditure decisions."
"Other key performance indicators 
In addition to the major financial KPIs to assess the performance and operational success of our company, 
as outlined above, we have identified a set of KPIs that help us track our progress in areas that are 
important for our success as well."
"These KPIs are assessed on a regular basis and managed by the 
respective business functions."
"These other KPIs we are monitoring include, among others, employee 
engagement, the share of female leadership, our sustainable article offering, and our carbon emissions."
"Employee engagement and experience 
⌐ We are convinced that listening to employees plays a crucial role in our pursuit of creating a best-in-
class employee experience and continuing to attract and retain top talent."

Global economy shows resilience in 202325 
The global economy remained resilient in 2023 despite facing elevated, albeit slowing, inflation and rising 
geopolitical conflicts."
"In this context, the global gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.6% in 2023."
"While the surge in energy and commodity prices due to the ongoing war in Ukraine has moderated 
somewhat, inflation remained elevated and continued to weigh on household incomes and consumer 
sentiment throughout the year."
"During the first half of the year, global central banks further tightened 
monetary policy, resulting in higher interest rates."
"During the second half of the year, however, most 
central banks halted interest rate increases."
"This challenging macroeconomic environment impacted 
global economic activity, as growth in advanced economies slowed to 1.5% in 2023."
"Meanwhile, developing 
economies proved relatively resilient as growth slightly accelerated to 4.0% in 2023."
"Nevertheless, 
restrictive monetary policy and the conflict in the Middle East, in addition to the ongoing war in Ukraine, 
left their mark on both advanced and developing economies."
"Globally, the risks of further escalation of 
geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, climate-related disasters and financial stress amid 
elevated borrowing costs remain."
"Sporting goods industry grows moderately in 2023 
Despite facing persisting challenges, the global sporting goods industry proved its resilience in 2023."
"The 
overall market expanded amid continued pressure on input costs and supply chains as well as subdued 
demand due to lower discretionary spending in a high inflation environment."
"Additionally, the industry 
faced particularly high inventory levels globally in 2023, which were countered by increased promotional 
activity across the sector."
"While most markets returned to healthier inventory levels toward the end of 
2023, the marketplace in North America, in particular, continued to face excess stock."
"Despite these 
challenges, demand globally benefited from major sports events such as the FIFA Women’s World Cup 
Australia & New Zealand and the Rugby World Cup France."
"In addition, recurring tournaments such as the 
UEFA Champions League and major US sports leagues drove consumer excitement."
"Furthermore, the 
sporting goods industry continues to profit from a casualization trend, as well as increased participation in 
sports and healthier lifestyle choices around the world."
"Comfort, quality, durability, and sustainability 
continued to influence consumer purchasing decisions."
"At the same time, the sporting goods industry is 
also subject to risks of lower consumer demand due to pressure on discretionary spending power amid 
economic downturns, as well as further geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions."

─ The Treasury Committee consists of members of the Executive Board and other senior executives who 
decide on the Treasury Policy and provide strategic guidance for managing treasury-related topics."
Major changes to our Treasury Policy are subject to the prior approval of the Treasury Committee.
"─ The Treasury department is responsible for specific centralized treasury transactions and for the 
global implementation of our Treasury Policy."
"─ On a subsidiary level, where applicable and economically reasonable, local managing directors and 
finance directors are responsible for managing treasury matters in their respective subsidiaries."
"Controlling functions on a corporate level ensure that the transactions of the individual business units 
are in compliance with our Treasury Policy."
"Centralized Treasury function 
In accordance with our Treasury Policy, all worldwide credit lines are directly or indirectly managed by the 
central Treasury department."
"Portions of those lines are allocated to our subsidiaries and sometimes 
backed by adidas AG guarantees."
"As a result of this centralized liquidity management, the company is well 
positioned to allocate resources efficiently throughout the organization."
"The company’s debt is generally 
unsecured and may include standard covenants."
"We maintain good relations with numerous partner 
banks, thereby avoiding a high dependency on any single financial institution."
"Banking partners of the 
company and our subsidiaries are required to have at least a BBB- long-term investment grade rating by 
Standard   Poor’s or an equivalent rating by another leading rating agency."
"We authorize our companies 
to work with banks with a lower rating only in very exceptional cases."
"To ensure optimal allocation of the 
company’s liquid financial resources, subsidiaries transfer excess cash to our headquarters in all 
instances where it is legally and economically feasible."
"In this regard, the standardization and 
consolidation of our global cash management and payment processes, including automated domestic and 
cross-border cash pools, are a key priority for our centrally managed Treasury department."
"In addition, 
the department is responsible for effective management of our currency exposure and interest rate risks."

covenants may include limits on the disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens, cross-
default provisions, and change of control."

financial covenants."

"Credit ratings 
adidas received strong first-time investment-grade ratings by both Standard   Poor’s and Moody’s in 
August 2020."
"Standard   Poor’s gave adidas an ‘A+’ rating, and Moody’s granted the company an ‘A2’ 
rating."
"The initial outlook for both ratings was ‘stable’ as both rating agencies recognized the company’s 
strong credit metrics, robust liquidity profile, and conservative financial policies."
"In November 2022, both 
Standard   Poor’s and Moody’s revised their outlook for adidas to ‘negative’ due to a deterioration in credit 
metrics amid pressure on the company’s operating performance from economic as well as company-
specific challenges."
"In February 2023, Standard   Poor’s lowered its rating on adidas to ‘A-’, while 
Moody’s downgraded the company to ‘A3’, both with a ‘negative’ outlook."
"These downgrades reflected a 
further downward revision of credit metrics following the release of the company’s financial guidance for 
2023."
"In December 2023 and January 2024, Standard   Poor’s and Moody’s issued reports affirming their 
‘A-’ rating with a ‘negative’ outlook and an ‘A3’ rating with a ‘negative’ outlook, respectively."

and restated credit facility with then eleven partner banks had a size of € 2,000 million and runs until

resulting from a positive cash flow from operating activities and both lower long-term borrowings as well 
as lower current and non-current lease liabilities in 2023."

"In 2020, the definition of net borrowings was adapted to adjusted net borrowings in order to reflect 
changes in the company’s Financial Policy."
"The most significant difference between the previous net 
borrowings definition and the adjusted net borrowings definition was the inclusion of the present value of 
future lease and pension liabilities."
"In 2022, the methodology for calculating adjusted net borrowings was 
revised to align with broader market practice and the approach of rating agencies."
"The main change of the 
methodology revision was the elimination of income tax adjustments from net borrowings."
"This development was mainly due to the issuance of two new € 500 million bonds with coupons of 
3.00% and 3.125% respectively in November 2022."
"Fixed-rate financing represented 99% of total gross 
borrowings at the end of 2023 (2022: 100%)."

"Effective foreign exchange management is a key priority 
As a globally operating company, adidas is exposed to currency risks."
"Therefore, effective currency 
management is a key focus of our Treasury department, with the aim of reducing the impact of currency 
fluctuations on non-euro-denominated net future cash flows."
"In this regard, hedging US dollars is a 
central part of our hedging program."
"This is a direct result of our Asian-dominated sourcing, which is 
largely denominated in US dollars."
"In 2023, our Treasury department managed a net deficit of around 
US $ 4,100 million related to business activities (2022: US $ 7,500 million)."
"Thereof, around 
US $ 3,000 million was against the euro (2022: US $ 6,100 million)."
"As governed by our Treasury Policy, we 
have established a hedging program on a rolling basis up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast 
majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is secured approximately six months prior to the start 
of a season."
"In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-month horizon."
"At the same time, we have already 
started hedging our exposure for 2025."
"The use or combination of different hedging instruments, such as 
foreign exchange contracts, currency options, and swaps, protect us against unfavorable currency 
movements."
"It includes operating business functions, primarily 
for the German market, as well as corporate headquarter functions such as Marketing, IT, Treasury, 
Taxes, Legal, and Finance."
adidas AG also administers the company’s shareholdings.
"Operating activities and capital structure of adidas AG 
The majority of the operating business of adidas AG consists of the sale of merchandise to wholesale 
partners and own retail activities."
"In addition to its own trading activities, the results of adidas AG are significantly influenced by its holding 
function for the adidas Group."
"This is reflected primarily in currency effects, transfer of costs for services 
provided, interest result, and income from investments in related companies."
"The opportunities and risks as well as the future development of adidas AG largely reflect those of the 
adidas Group."
"► SEE OUTLOOK ► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
The asset and capital structure of adidas AG is significantly impacted by its holding and financing function 
for the adidas Group."
"For example, 48% of total assets as of December 31, 2023, related to financial assets 
(2022: 42%), which primarily consist of shares in affiliated companies."
"Intercompany accounts, through 
which transactions between affiliated companies are settled, represent another 28% of total assets (2022: 
42%) and 28% of total equity and liabilities as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 28%)."
"Revenues of adidas AG also include royalty and 
commission income, mainly from affiliated companies, revenues from central distribution, and other 
revenues."
"From March 2022 until May 2023, the commission income for the Reebok sales is shown in 
other revenues."
"In 2023, adidas AG net sales decreased 6% to € 4,510 million compared to € 4,814 million 
in the prior year."
"This 
development was primarily due to lower positive currency effects."
"Other operating expenses down 18% 
In 2023, other operating expenses for adidas AG decreased 18% to € 2,801 million (2022: € 3,415 million)."
This was largely attributable to lower currency losses.
"Depreciation and amortization slightly down  
Depreciation and amortization for adidas AG relating to intangible and tangible fixed assets decreased 
slightly to € 139 million in 2023 (2022: € 140 million)."
"Operating result below prior year level 
In 2023, adidas AG generated an operating loss of € 243 million (2022: € 117 million)."
"The decrease is 
mainly due to lower sales."
"Significant decrease of the financial result 
The financial result of adidas AG decreased 95% to € 103 million in 2023 (2022: € 2,237 million)."
"The 
decrease was attributable to lower income from dividends."
"Net loss in 2023 
Net loss, after taxes of € 49 million (2022: € 63 million), amounted to € 189 million in 2023 and was thus 
109% below the prior year net income of € 2,057 million."
This development was mainly a result of the decrease in receivables and other assets.
"Shareholders’ equity down 11% 
Shareholders’ equity decreased 11% to € 2,455 million at the end of 2023 (2022: € 2,767 million)."
"The 
equity ratio increased to 26.5% (2022: 26.4%)."
"Provisions decrease 2% 
Provisions were down 2% to € 813 million at the end of 2023 (2022: € 833 million)."
"Liabilities and other items down 13% 
At the end of December 2023, liabilities and other items decreased 13% to € 5,997 million (2022: 
€ 6,875 million)."
This is mainly due to the repayment of a bond in 2023.
"In addition, the company has a multi-currency commercial paper program in an amount of 
€ 2,000 million."
"► SEE TREASURY
In 2023, operating activities of adidas AG resulted in a cash inflow of € 212 million (2022: cash outflow of 
€ 1,699 million)."
The change versus the prior year was mainly a result of lower receivables.
"Net cash 
inflow from investment activities was € 104 million (2022: € 2,518 million)."
"This was primarily attributable 
to lower dividend income."
"Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of € 323 million 
(2022: € 2,223 million)."
"The net cash outflow from financing activities mainly relates to the dividend 
payment and interest payments."
"As a result of these developments, cash and cash equivalents of adidas 
AG decreased to € 189 million at the end of December 2023 compared to € 195 million at the end of the 
prior year."

"► SEE EXECUTIVE BOARD 
The Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment as a member of the Executive Board or CEO for good 
cause such as gross negligence of duties or a vote of no confidence by the Annual General Meeting."
"As adidas AG is subject to the regulations of the German Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz –

least two thirds of the Supervisory Board members (§ 31 MitbestG)."
"If such a majority is not established in 
the first vote by the Supervisory Board, the Mediation Committee has to present a proposal which, 
however, does not exclude other proposals."

"The shares 
may, in particular, be used as follows: 
─ They may be sold on the stock exchange or through a public offer to all shareholders in relation to their 
shareholding quota; in case of an offer to all shareholders, subscription rights for residual amounts

"On a currency-neutral basis, this development was

"Operating profit in Asia-Pacific decreased 3% to 
€ 472 million from € 486 million in 2022."
"Operating margin was down 0.7 percentage points to 20.9% 
versus 21.7% in 2022, as the gross margin increase was more than offset by higher operating expenses as 
a percentage of sales."
"In euro terms, sales in Latin 
America improved 9% to € 2,291 million from € 2,104 million in 2022."
"On a currency-neutral basis, this 
improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in both Performance and Lifestyle."
"Almost all 
categories grew at strong double-digit rates."
"Net sales in Latin America 
+22% 
C.N."
Gross margin in Latin America decreased 1.8 percentage points to 45.6% (2022: 47.4%).
"While improved 
pricing had a significant positive impact on the margin development, significant negative currency 
developments, higher discounting, and increased supply chain costs weighed on the gross margin 
development in the region."
Operating expenses were up 6% to € 564 million from € 534 million in 2022.
This development reflects increases in both marketing expenditures and operating overhead costs.
"However, operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased 0.8 percentage points to 24.6% (2022: 
25.4%)."
Operating profit in Latin America increased 2% to € 482 million versus € 473 million in 2022.
"As a 
result of the lower gross margin, the operating margin decreased 1.5 percentage points to 21.0% from 
22.5% in 2022."
"While this may 
negatively affect consumer sentiment and discretionary spending power, the global sporting goods 
industry is set to benefit from major sports events in 2024."
"Against this backdrop, we plan to return to 
top-line growth this year and expect currency-neutral sales to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in 
2024."
"This top-line guidance assumes that we will sell the remaining Yeezy inventory at cost, which 
would result in sales of around € 250 million in 2024 and no operating profit contribution."
"This compares 
to Yeezy revenues of around € 750 million and profits of around € 300 million in 2023."
"Unfavorable 
currency effects are also projected to weigh significantly on the company’s profitability in 2024, as we 
expect them to continue to adversely impact both reported revenues and the gross margin 
development."
"Taking all of this into account – the expected translational and transactional FX 
headwinds as well as the current Yeezy assumptions – we expect to generate an operating profit of 
around € 500 million in 2024."

"► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
Global economic growth to further decelerate in 202426 
Global gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to further decelerate to 2.4% in 2024 considering 
the effects of tight monetary policy, restrictive financial conditions, and weak global trade."
"Despite 
declining rates, inflation remains above target in most advanced economies."
"Hence, monetary policy is 
forecast to stay restrictive in the short term."
"Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East on top of the 
ongoing war in Ukraine is set to continue to impact the global economy."
"While advanced economies are 
forecast to see growth of only 1.2%, conditions for developing economies are slightly improving, with 
growth projected at 3.9% in 2024."
"However, downside risks persist in the form of weaker-than-expected 
momentum in major economies in Greater China, North America, and Europe."
"In addition, a potential 
escalation of geopolitical conflicts can lead to a resurgence in energy prices and further dampen 
consumer demand."
"Ultimately, potential supply-chain disruptions and climate-related disasters remain a 
concern for the global economy."
26 Source: World Bank Global Economic Prospects.
"At the same time, existing global trends such as ‘athleisure,’ increasing sports 
participation rates, and rising health and fitness awareness continue to support industry growth."
"Innovative Performance and Lifestyle product newness excites consumers in physical and digital channels 
alike."
"Hence, the sporting goods industry is expected to remain fundamentally attractive in the long term."
"On the other hand, the sector continues to face several challenges in 2024."
"Even though most markets 
globally returned to healthier inventory levels, North America is expected to continue facing excess stock, 
especially in the first half of 2024."
"Furthermore, elevated inflation and interest rates are set to negatively 
affect household savings and limit discretionary spending power."
"Additionally, escalating geopolitical 
conflicts may lead to global trade disruptions, despite the increased resilience of supply chains in recent 
years."
2 Excluding acquisitions and leases.
"Currency-neutral sales to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in 2024 
In 2024, macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions are projected to persist."
"Against this 
backdrop, we plan to return to top-line growth by scaling successful franchises, introducing new ones, and 
leveraging our significantly better, broader, and deeper product range."
"Improved retailer relationships, 
more impactful marketing initiatives, and the company’s activities around major sports events will also 
contribute to the sales increase."
"As a result, we expect currency-neutral sales to grow at a mid-single-
digit rate in 2024."
"This top-line guidance assumes that we will sell the remaining Yeezy inventory at cost, which would result 
in sales of around € 250 million in 2024."
This compares to Yeezy revenues of around € 750 million in 2023.
"Excluding the Yeezy revenues in both years, the top-line guidance reflects currency-neutral growth at a 
high-single-digit rate in the underlying adidas business."
"We expect the sales development to accelerate 
throughout the year, as growth in the first half will still be negatively impacted by our initiatives to bring 
down elevated inventories in the North American market."
"In the second half of the year, we project the 
underlying adidas business to grow at a double-digit rate."
"In this market, currency-neutral net sales are expected to decline at a 
mid-single-digit rate in 2024."
"This is mainly the result of our continued disciplined sell-in to the wholesale 
channel during the first half of the year as part of our initiatives to reduce high inventory levels in this 
particular market."
"In contrast, we expect the underlying adidas sales in Greater China and Latin America 
to grow at a double-digit rate in 2024."
"Currency-neutral revenues in Europe, the Emerging Markets, and 
Japan/South Korea are expected to grow at a high-single-digit rate versus the prior-year level."
"Expected operating profit of around € 500 million  
Unfavorable currency effects are projected to weigh significantly on the company’s profitability in 2024, as 
we expect them to continue to adversely impact both reported revenues and the gross margin 
development."
"Taking the expected translational and transactional FX headwinds into account, we expect to 
generate an operating profit of around € 500 million in 2024."
"While we will continue to increase our 
marketing and sales investments, the top-line growth and an improving gross margin are projected to 
drive the bottom-line development in 2024."
"As we currently expect the sale of the remaining Yeezy 
inventory to occur at cost, the planned sale of the product is assumed to have no effect on the company’s 
operating profit this year."
"Average operating working capital as a percentage of sales to decrease  
During 2023, average operating working capital as a percentage of sales increased, reflecting the slight 
increase in average operating working capital against the background of lower net sales in 2023 compared 
to 2022."
"Our focus in 2024 will be on improving our average operating working capital position and 
returning to top-line growth."
"Based on this, we forecast average operating working capital as a percentage 
of sales to decrease to a level of between 23% and 24% in 2024."
"Capital expenditure of around € 600 million 
We will continue to invest into our business, but at the same time adjust our spending to the financial and 
operational situation of the company."
"Consequently, capital expenditure is expected to reach a level of 
around € 600 million in 2024."
"Management proposes dividend payment of € 0.70 per share 
The adidas AG Executive and Supervisory Boards will recommend paying a stable dividend of € 0.70 per 
dividend-entitled share to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2024 (2023: € 0.70)."
"This 
corresponds to a total payout of € 125 million in line with the prior-year level (2023: € 125 million)."
"The 
proposal reflects the company’s better-than-expected performance in the transition year 2023 and its 
robust financial profile, as well as Management’s confident outlook for the current year."
"Going forward, 
the company plans to return to its dividend policy of paying an annual dividend to shareholders in the 
range of 30% to 50% of net income from continuing operations."
"Our risk and opportunity management principles and 
system provide the framework for our company to conduct business in a well-controlled environment."
"Risk and opportunity management principles 
The key objective of the risk and opportunity management is to support business success and protect the 
company as a going concern through an opportunity-focused but risk-aware decision-making framework."
"Our Enterprise Risk Management Policy outlines the principles, processes, tools, risk areas, key 
responsibilities, reporting requirements, and communication timelines within our company."
"Risk and 
opportunity management is a company-wide activity that utilizes key insights from the members of the 
Executive Board as well as from global and local business units and functions."
"We define risk as the 
potential occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that may negatively impact our 
ability to achieve the company’s business objectives or financial goals."
"Opportunity is defined as the 
potential occurrence of an external or internal event (or series of events) that can positively impact the 
company’s ability to achieve its business objectives or financial goals."
"Risk and opportunity management system 
The Executive Board has overall responsibility for establishing a risk and opportunity management system 
that ensures comprehensive and consistent management of all relevant risks and opportunities."
"The 
Enterprise Risk Management department governs, operates, and develops the company’s risk and 
opportunity management system and is the owner of the centrally managed risk and opportunity 
management process on behalf of the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for 
monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management system."
"These duties are undertaken by the 
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee."
"Working independently of all other functions of the organization, the 
Internal Audit department provides objective assurance to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee 
regarding the adequacy and effectiveness of the company’s risk and opportunity management system on a 
regular basis."
"In addition, the Internal Audit department includes an assessment of the effectiveness of 
risk management processes and compliance with the company’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy as 
part of its regular auditing activities with selected adidas subsidiaries or functions each year."
"Our risk and opportunity management system is based on frameworks for enterprise risk management 
and internal controls developed and published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (COSO)."
"Additionally, we have adapted our risk and opportunity management 
system to more appropriately reflect the structure as well as the culture of the company."
"This system 
focuses on the identification, evaluation, handling, systematic reporting, and monitoring of risks and 
opportunities."
"Furthermore, we use a quantitative concept for risk capacity and risk appetite."
"Risk capacity 
is a liquidity-based measure and represents the maximum level of risk adidas AG can take before being 
threatened with insolvency."
"Risk appetite refers to the maximum level of risk the company is willing to 
take and is linked to the company's liquidity targets."
"On a semi-annual basis, the Enterprise Risk Management 
department conducts a survey among senior management and selected middle management to ensure 
an effective bottom-up identification of risks and opportunities."
"Enterprise Risk Management has also 
defined 25 categories to help identify risks and opportunities in a systematic way."
"In addition, adidas 
uses various instruments in the risk and opportunity identification process, such as primary qualitative 
and quantitative research including trend scouting and consumer surveys as well as feedback from our 
business partners."
These efforts are supported by global market research and competitor analysis.
"Through this process, we seek to identify the markets, categories, consumer target groups, and 
product styles that show the most potential for future growth at a local and global level."
"Equally, our 
analysis focuses on those areas that are at risk of saturation or exposed to increased competition or 
changing consumer tastes."
"Furthermore, we consider topics related to environmental, social, and 
governance aspects in our overall identification process as well as in the following process steps."
"Our 
risk and opportunity identification process is however not only limited to external risk factors or 
opportunities; it also includes an internal perspective that considers company culture, processes, 
projects, human resources, and compliance aspects."
"─ Risk and opportunity evaluation: We assess identified risks and opportunities individually according to 
a systematic evaluation methodology, which allows adequate prioritization as well as allocation of 
resources."
"Risk and opportunity evaluation is part of the responsibility of the Enterprise Risk 
Management department supported by subject matter experts as well as internal and external data."
"The Enterprise Risk Management department also conducts assessments with the Executive Board 
members and senior leaders to validate the evaluation of most relevant risks and opportunities."
"According to our methodology, risks and opportunities are evaluated by looking at two dimensions: the 
potential impact and the likelihood that this impact materializes."
"Based on this evaluation, we classify 
risks and opportunities into three categories: minor, moderate, and major."
These categories represent financial or equivalent non-financial measurements.
"The financial 
measurements are based on the potential effect on the company’s net income and cash flow."
"Non-
financial measurements used are the degree to which the company’s reputation, brand image, and 
employer value proposition are affected."
"Moreover, the degree of damage to people’s health and safety 
and the degree of legal and judicial consequences at a corporate and personal level can be considered."
"Likelihood represents the possibility that a given risk or opportunity may materialize with the specific 
impact."
"The likelihood of individual risks and opportunities is evaluated on a percentage scale divided 
into five categories."
"Risk evaluation categories 
 
1 Based on net income and cash flow."
"In 
this respect, we differentiate in which financial year risks and opportunities could occur."
"We consider 
both gross and net risk in our risk assessments."
"While the gross risk reflects the inherent risk before 
any mitigating action, the net risk reflects the residual risk after all mitigating action."
"On the one hand, 
this approach allows for a good understanding of the impact of mitigating action taken; on the other 
hand, it provides the basis for scenario analysis."
"Our assessment of risks presented in this report only 
reflects the net risk perspective."
"We measure the actual financial impact of selected risks and 
opportunities that materialized against the original assessment on a yearly basis (‘back-testing’)."
"In 
this way, we ensure continuous monitoring of the accuracy of risk and opportunity evaluations across 
the company, which enables us to continuously improve evaluation methodology based on our findings."
"In assessing the potential effect from opportunities, each opportunity is appraised with respect to 
viability, commerciality, and potential risks."
"This approach is not only applied to longer-term strategic 
prospects but also to shorter-term tactical and opportunistic initiatives at the corporate level as well 
as at the market and brand level."
"In contrast to the risk evaluation, only the net perspective exists for 
assessing opportunities."
"We aggregate risks and opportunities using a stochastic simulation (Monte Carlo simulation) to 
determine the company’s risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the company’s aggregated risk position), 
considering interdependencies of individual risks and opportunities."
"─ Risk and opportunity handling: Risks and opportunities are treated in accordance with the company’s 
risk and opportunity management principles as described in the Enterprise Risk Management Policy."
"Risk Owners are in charge of developing and implementing appropriate risk-mitigating action within 
their area of responsibility."
"In addition, the Risk Owners need to determine a general risk-handling 
strategy for the identified risks, which is either risk avoidance, risk reduction with the objective to 
lower impact or likelihood, risk transfer to a third party or risk acceptance."
"The decision on the 
implementation of the respective risk-handling strategy also takes into account the costs in relation to 
the benefit of any planned mitigating action if applicable."
"The Enterprise Risk Management department 
works closely with the Risk Owners to monitor the continuous progress of planned mitigating action 
and assess the viability of already implemented mitigating action."
"Depending on the risk class 
determined by the risk and opportunity evaluation, the authority to make decisions to accept risks 
resides with the Executive Board, leaders reporting directly to an Executive Board member and the 
operational management on the next hierarchical level."
"The decision to accept major risks without 
taking additional mitigating action can only be made by the entire Executive Board."
"In its decision-
making process, the Executive Board takes into account the risk profile, i.e., the relationship between 
risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the company’s aggregated risk position) and risk appetite, as well as 
risk capacity."
"To support the Executive Board, the Enterprise Risk Management department defined 
clear thresholds for the likelihood that the company’s aggregated risk exceeds the defined risk 
appetite and risk capacity."
"The company’s risk appetite must not be exceeded with a likelihood of at 
least 95%; the company’s risk capacity must not be exceeded with a likelihood of at least 99%."
"─ Risk and opportunity monitoring and reporting: Our risk and opportunity management system aims to 
increase the transparency of risks and opportunities."
"As both risks and opportunities are subject to 
constant change, Risk Owners not only monitor developments but also the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the current risk-handling strategy on an ongoing basis."
"Enterprise Risk Management evaluates, consolidates, and aggregates 
the identified risks and opportunities (‘bottom-up assessment’)."
"─ Enterprise Risk Management discusses the assessment of most relevant risks and opportunities with 
the members of the Executive Board and leaders directly reporting to them."
"The Executive Board 
members and senior leaders validate the assessment of risks and opportunities in their respective 
area of responsibility (‘top-down assessment’)."
"─ Enterprise Risk Management provides a consolidated report to the Executive Board summarizing the 
results of both bottom-up and top-down assessment as well as the risk and opportunity profile to 
highlight a potential threat to the company’s rating and going concern."
"The Executive Board reviews 
the report, jointly agrees on a company assessment of risks and opportunities and decides if Risk 
Owners are required to take further action."
"─ Based on the Executive Board’s decision, Enterprise Risk Management creates the final risk and 
opportunity report that is also shared with the Core Leadership Group’ (‘CLG’)."
"─ The Executive Board presents in collaboration with Enterprise Risk Management the final risk and 
opportunity assessment results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Material changes in previously reported risks and opportunities or newly identified substantial risks and 
opportunities are also reported outside the regular half-yearly reporting stream on an ad hoc basis to the 
Executive Board."
"To further improve the risk culture at adidas, we are also offering a risk management 
training to all our employees through our company intranet."
"Compliance management system (adidas Fair Play) 
⌐ We consider compliance with the law as well as with external and internal regulations to be imperative."
"The Executive Board sets the tone from the top, and every employee is required to act ethically and in 
compliance with the law as well as with internal and other external regulations while executing the 
company’s business."
We believe adidas Fair Play will prevent a majority of potential compliance issues.
"For that reason, we have specific measures to detect and respond to any concerns."
"We realize, however, 
that no compliance system can eliminate all violations."
The adidas Chief Compliance Officer oversees the company’s Compliance Management System (CMS).
"We 
see compliance as all-encompassing, spanning all business functions throughout the entire value chain."
"Our central Compliance team works closely with Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance 
Officers to conduct a systematic assessment of key compliance risks on a yearly basis."

ANNUAL R EPORT 2023  
The company’s CMS is based on the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance."
"The adidas Fair Play Code of Conduct is accessible on our website, includes guidelines for employee 
behavior in everyday work, and is applicable globally for all business areas."
"¬ 
► ADIDAS-GROUP.COM/S/CODE-OF-CONDUCT 
⌐ The Fair Play Code of Conduct and our CMS are organized around three pillars: prevent, detect, and 
respond."
─ Prevention: The Compliance team regularly reviews and updates the CMS as necessary.
"In addition to 
the revised Fair Play Code of Conduct mentioned above, we also support all initiatives to prevent and 
fight harassment and discrimination in the workplace."
"Management also shares compliance-related 
communication, and the Compliance department provides mandatory training to all employees globally 
during onboarding and in regular, repeated cycles."
"We also focused on further enhancing cooperation between the Compliance team and the 
Internal Audit, the Group Policies and Internal Controls, and the Enterprise Risk Management 
department."
"─ Detection: adidas has whistleblowing procedures in place to ensure timely detection of potential 
infringements of statutory regulations or internal guidelines."
"Employees can report compliance 
concerns internally to their supervisor, the Chief Compliance Officer, Regional Compliance Managers 
or Local Compliance Officers, the relevant HR Manager, or, where applicable, the Works Council."
"Employees can also report externally via the independent, confidential Fair Play hotline and website, 
which also allow for anonymous complaints."
"The Fair Play hotline and website are available at all times 
worldwide, including the services of interpreters, if required."
"They are promoted digitally and with 
posters to reach all our locations around the world."
"The company’s work to identify potential 
compliance violations continued in 2023."
─ Response: Appropriate and timely response to compliance violations is essential.
"The Chief 
Compliance Officer leads all investigations in cooperation with an established team of Regional 
Compliance Managers and a global network of Local Compliance Officers."
"We track, monitor, and 
report potential incidents of non-compliance worldwide."
"In 2023, we recorded 590 potential compliance 
violations (2022: 521)."
"Most importantly, insights gained from the investigation of past violations are 
used to continuously improve the CMS."
"Where necessary, we react promptly to confirmed compliance 
violations, through appropriate and effective sanctions ranging from warnings to termination of 
employment contracts."
"In 2023, the Compliance team further strengthened its relationship with the 
Employee Relations (ER) organization, a key partner in many compliance matters, especially those 
related to harassment and discrimination."
"In addition, the Chief 
Compliance Officer reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis."
"In 2023, the Chief Compliance 
Officer attended four meetings of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board to report on the further 
development of the compliance program, major compliance cases, and other relevant compliance topics."
"The Compliance department has revised its process for detecting compliance risks and included new 
risks, as well as captured some risk areas (e.g., e-commerce) more clearly."
"In addition, the description of 
the CMS has been sharpened."
Clearly defined responsibilities are assigned to each distinct sub-process.
"In a 
first step, the internal control and risk management system serves to identify, assess, limit, and control 
risks identified in the consolidated financial reporting process that might result in the consolidated 
financial statements not being compliant with internal and external regulations."
"Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICoFR) serves to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 
reliability of financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations."
"To monitor the 
effectiveness of ICoFR, the Corporate Internal Audit department, which includes both the Internal Audit 
and Global Internal Controls functions, regularly reviews accounting-related processes."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board also monitors the effectiveness of 
ICoFR."
"All adidas companies are required to comply with the consolidated financial reporting policies (Finance 
Manual), which are available to all employees involved in the financial reporting process through the 
company-wide intranet."
"We update the Finance Manual on a regular basis, dependent on regulatory 
changes and internal developments."
"Changes to the Finance Manual are promptly communicated to all 
adidas companies."
"Clear policies serve to limit employees’ scope of discretion with regard to recognition 
and valuation of assets and liabilities, thus reducing the risk of inconsistent accounting practices within 
the company."
"We aim to ensure compliance with the Finance Manual through continuous adherence to the 
four-eyes principle in accounting-related processes."
"In addition, the local manager responsible for the 
accounting-related process within the respective company and the respective local Managing Director 
confirm adherence to the Finance Manual and to IFRS in a signed representation letter to the Accounting 
department semi-annually."
The accounting for adidas companies is conducted either locally or by our Global Business Services.
"Virtually all the IT Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used are based on a company-wide 
standardized SAP system."
"Following approval by the Finance Director of the respective adidas company, 
the local financial statements are transferred to a central consolidation system based on SAP Group 
Reporting."
"At the corporate level, the regularity and reliability of the financial statements prepared by 
adidas companies are reviewed by the Accounting and Controlling departments."
"These reviews include 
automated validations in the system as well as the creation of reports and analyses to ensure data 
integrity and adherence to the reporting logic."
"In addition, differences between current-year and prior-
year financial data as well as budget figures are analyzed on a market level."
"If necessary, adidas seeks the 
opinion of independent experts to review business transactions that occur infrequently and on a non-
routine basis."
"After ensuring data plausibility, the centrally coordinated and monitored consolidation 
process begins, running automatically on SAP Group Reporting."
"Controls within the individual 
consolidation steps, such as those relating to the consolidation of debt or of income and expenses, are 
conducted both manually and system-based, using automatically created consolidation logs."
"Any 
inadequacies are remedied manually by systematically processing the individual errors as well as 
differences and are reported back to the adidas companies."
"After finalization of all consolidation steps, all 
items in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of financial position are 
analyzed with respect to trends and variances."
"Unless already otherwise clarified, the adidas companies 
are asked to explain any identified material deviations."
"All financial systems used are protected against malpractice by means of appropriate authorization 
concepts, approval concepts, and access restrictions."
"Access authorizations are reviewed on a regular 
basis and updated if required."
"The risk of data loss or outage of accounting-related IT systems is 
minimized through central control and monitoring of virtually all IT systems, centralized management of 
change processes, and regular data backups."
"The 
internal control and risk management system regarding the non-accounting-related activities focuses also 
on the identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and reporting of relevant risks."
"It is as well 
embedded within the company-wide corporate governance system and encompasses various sub-
processes in the areas of Brands, Operations (including Procurement and IT), Sales, or Human Resources."
"The effectiveness of the non-accounting-related controls is also regularly monitored by the Corporate 
Internal Audit department and the Global and Market Internal Controls teams."
"The reporting of internal 
control testing results to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board includes the effectiveness of non-
accounting-related controls as well."
"Nothing came to our attention that would cause us to doubt the adequacy and effectiveness of the entire 
internal control and risk management system."
"The corporate risks overview table illustrates the assessment 
of all risks described below."
"Currency risks are a direct result of multi-
currency cash flows within the company, in particular the mismatch of the currencies required for 
sourcing our products versus the denominations of our sales."
"Furthermore, translation impacts from the 
conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead 
to a material negative impact on our company’s financial performance."
"► SEE NOTE 28 
To mitigate these macroeconomic, sociopolitical, and regulatory risks, adidas strives to balance sales 
across key regions and also between developed and emerging markets."
"We continuously monitor the 
macroeconomic, political, and regulatory landscape in all our key markets to anticipate potential problem 
areas, so that we can quickly adjust our business activities accordingly upon any change in conditions."
"To mitigate the risk related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we utilize a centralized currency 
risk management system and hedge currency needs for projected sourcing requirements on a rolling 
basis up to 24 months in advance."
"In rare instances, hedges are contracted beyond the 24-months horizon."
"Risks related to consumer demand and product offering 
Our success largely depends on our ability to continuously create new, innovative, and sustainable 
products."
"Consumer demand changes can be sudden and unexpected, particularly when it comes to the 
more fashion-related part of our business."
"Therefore, we face a risk of short-term revenue loss in cases 
where we are unable to anticipate consumer demand or respond quickly to changes."
"In addition, creating 
and offering products that do not resonate with consumers and our retail partners is a critical risk to the 
success of our brands, especially considering our focus on key product franchises."
"This risk could be 
exacerbated if our marketing activities and brand campaigns fail to generate consumer excitement."
"Even 
more critical in the long term, however, are the risks of continuously overlooking new trends and failing to 
continuously introduce and successfully commercialize new product innovation."
"To mitigate these risks, identifying and responding to shifts in consumer demand as early as possible is a 
key responsibility of our brand and sales organizations and, in particular, of the respective Risk Owners."
"Therefore, we utilize extensive primary and secondary research tools as outlined in our risk and 
opportunity identification process."
"By putting the consumer at the center of our decision-making, we 
intend to create higher brand advocacy and attract new consumers."
"We continuously expand our consumer 
analytics efforts to read and quickly react to changes in demand or trend shifts."
"By leveraging our promotion partnerships and by carefully orchestrating launch events 
across markets and channels, we intend to maintain brand desire and consumer demand at a constantly 
high level."
"Utilizing external insights and capabilities in product creation helps us strengthen our product 
offering and drive consumer demand, brand desire, market share, and profitability."
"Risks related to the competitive and retail environment 
Changes in the competitive landscape and the retail environment could impact the company’s success."
"Strategic alliances among competitors or retailers, the increase in retailers’ own private-label businesses 
and intense competition for consumers, production capacity, and promotion partnerships between well-
established industry peers and new market entrants pose a substantial risk to adidas."
"This could lead to 
harmful competitive behavior, such as sustained periods of discounting in the marketplace or intense 
bidding for promotion partnerships."
"Failure to recognize and respond to consolidation in the retail industry 
could lead to increased dependency on particular retail partners, reduced bargaining power, and, 
consequently, considerable margin erosion."
"Sustained pricing pressure in key markets, amplified by 
elevated inventory levels (still relevant for the US marketplace), could threaten the company’s financial 
performance and the competitiveness of our brands."
"Aggressive competitive practices could also drive 
increases in marketing costs and market share losses, thus hurting the company’s profitability and 
market position."
"A decline in the attractiveness of particular shopping locations such as shopping malls 
could lead to sales shortfalls in our customers’ and our own stores, higher inventory in the marketplace, 
increased clearance activity, and margin pressure."
"To mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor and analyze information on our competitors and markets 
in order to be able to anticipate unfavorable changes in the competitive environment rather than merely 
reacting to such changes."
"This enables us to proactively adjust our marketing and sales activities (e.g., 
product launches or selective pricing adjustments) when needed."
"We constantly adjust our 
segmentation strategies to ensure that the right product is sold at the right point of sale at an appropriate 
price."
"Continuous investment in research and development ensures that we remain innovative and distinct 
from competitors."
"We also pursue a strategy of entering into long-term agreements with key promotion 
partners."
"In addition, our product and communication initiatives are designed to increase brand desire, 
drive market share growth, and strengthen our brand’s market position."
"Risks related to tax and customs regulations 
Numerous laws and regulations regarding customs and taxes as well as changes in such laws and 
regulations affect the company’s business practices worldwide."
"Changes in regulations regarding customs and taxes may 
also have a substantial impact on the company’s sourcing costs or income taxes."
"Therefore, we also create 
provisions in accordance with the relevant accounting regulations to account for potential disputes with 
customs or tax authorities."
"Due to the current geopolitical situation, we assume in individual cases 
increasingly aggressive positions taken by tax and customs authorities in audits, which could increase the 
potential impact of such risks and the likelihood that they materialize."
"Pillar 2, which includes the introduction of global 
minimum tax, could lead to higher-than-planned income tax expenses from 2024 onwards."
"We seek to manage tax and customs risks in a balanced way that bears an appropriate relationship to the 
operating structure, commercial and economic substance, and other business risks."
"To proactively 
manage such risks, we constantly seek expert advice from specialized independent law and tax advisory 
firms in areas such as process design, transaction advisory, compliance, and tax or customs audits."
"Processes are in place requiring that attention is regularly directed to potential areas of tax or customs 
risk (e.g., a quarterly tax risk questionnaire) and the corporate tax and customs teams are involved in 
critical business transactions."
"Compliance with global tax and customs policies and controls is monitored 
by the Corporate Tax and Customs teams, internal controls experts and the Internal Audit department."
"In 
addition, our internal legal, customs, and tax teams advise our operational management teams to ensure 
appropriate and compliant business practices."
"Our specialized staff receive adequate training for their role 
and non-tax, or non-customs staff are made aware of potential tax and customs matters relevant to their 
roles."
"Furthermore, we work closely with customs authorities and governments worldwide to make sure 
we adhere to customs and trade regulations at import and export to ensure the availability and obtain the 
required clearance of products to fulfill sales demand."
"► SEE SUSTAINABILITY 
Risks related to impairment of goodwill 
Our balance sheet carries book values in goodwill."
"Deterioration in the business performance, and 
particularly in future business prospects, as well as significant exchange rate fluctuations could require 
corrections of the book values by incurring impairment charges."
"In addition, increases in market interest 
rates could trigger increases in discount rates used in our impairment test for goodwill and require 
impairment charges."
"An impairment charge would be a purely accounting, non-cash effect impacting the 
company’s operating result."
"► SEE NOTE 11 
Personnel risks 
Achieving the company’s strategic and financial objectives is highly dependent on our employees and their 
talents."
"In this respect, strong leadership and a performance-enhancing culture are critical to the 
company’s success."
"Therefore, ineffective leadership as well as the failure to install and maintain a 
performance-oriented culture that fosters ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ (‘DEI’) and strong employee 
engagement amongst our workforce could substantially impede our ability to achieve our goals."
"In addition, global competition for highly qualified personnel remains fierce."
"As a result, the 
loss of key personnel in strategic positions and the inability to identify, recruit, and retain highly qualified 
and skilled talent who best meet the specific needs of our company pose risks to our business 
performance."
"We are taking various measures to ensure that we maintain a culture that fosters ‘DEI.’ Through several 
specialized programs, ‘DEI’ is embedded into our recruitment processes."
"Our ‘Global DEI Council’ drives 
the increase of representation, retention, and advancement of diverse talents within our global workforce."
"Furthermore, our workforce takes part in ‘DEI’ learning programs."
"To ensure effective leadership across 
the company we offer a portfolio of leadership development experiences designed for every level of 
management across all markets and functions."
"Organizational transformations and reorganizations are supported 
by change activations with our leadership teams and organizational design consultancy."
"We continuously 
invest in improving employer branding activities, and our global recruiting organization constantly 
enhances our internal and external recruiting services and capabilities."
"Our global succession 
management helps create internal talent pipelines for critical leadership positions and therefore reduces 
succession risk."
"IT and cybersecurity risks 
Theft, leakage, corruption, or unavailability of critical information (e.g., consumer data, employee data, 
product data) and systems could lead to reputational damage, regulatory penalties, or the inability to 
perform key business processes."
"Key business processes, including product marketing, order 
management, warehouse management, invoice processing, customer support, and financial reporting, are 
all dependent on IT systems."
"Significant outages, application failures, or cybersecurity threats to our 
infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could therefore result in reputational damage, regulatory 
penalties, or cause considerable business disruption or impact to business-critical data."
"Information security architecture design, application security, 
governance, data security, employee awareness programs, and a 24x7 incident response help us to 
adequately protect the company."
"We have also secured limited insurance coverage for damage resulting 
from cybersecurity incidents."
"Similarly, certain activities on the part of key stakeholders (e.g., 
non-governmental organizations, governmental institutions) could cause reputational damage, distract top 
management, and disrupt business activities."
"Despite the termination of the adidas Yeezy partnership in 
2022, due to its former size and relevance, related stakeholder reactions and negative media coverage 
could still be possible."
"To mitigate these risks, we pursue proactive, open communication and engagement with key stakeholders 
(e.g., consumers, media, the financial community, non-governmental organizations, governmental 
institutions) on a continuous basis."
"In addition, we have established clear crisis communication processes 
to ensure a quick and effective response to adverse developments."
"We have also strengthened social 
media capabilities and created various digital newsrooms around the globe that enable continuous 
monitoring of social media content related to the company’s products and activities and allow early 
management of potentially damaging social media discussion."
"On a case-by-case basis, we seek external 
advice from experts in communication and stakeholder management."
"Business partner risks 
adidas interacts and enters into partnerships with various third parties, such as athletes, creative 
partners, innovation partners, retail partners, or suppliers of goods or services."
"As a result, the company 
is exposed to a multitude of business partner risks."
"Similarly, failure to maintain strong relationships with our partners could 
negatively impact the company’s sales and profitability."
"Risks may also arise from a dependency on 
particular partners."
"For example, the overdependency on a supplier or customer increases the company’s 
vulnerability to delivery and sales shortfalls, respectively, and could lead to significant margin pressure."
"Business partner default (including insolvency) or other disruptive events such as strikes may negatively 
affect the company’s business activities and result in additional costs and liabilities as well as lower sales 
for the company."
"Unethical business practices or improper behavior on the part of business partners could 
have a negative spillover effect on the company’s reputation, lead to higher costs or liabilities or even 
disrupt business activities."
"To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures."
"For example, we generally 
include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our 
partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct."
"In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of 
promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners."
"We utilize a broad distribution strategy, which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer 
business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers."
"Specifically, no single customer accounted 
for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2023."
"To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with 
suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality, and innovation."
"Furthermore, in order to minimize any 
potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we 
enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and 
environmental standards throughout our supply chain."
"In addition, we have selectively bought insurance 
coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises."
"To 
reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification."
"In this context, adidas 
works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, 
does not have a single-sourcing model."
"Compliance risks 
As a globally operating company, adidas is subject to various laws and regulations."
"Non-compliance with 
such laws and regulations could lead to penalties and fines and cause reputational damage."
"For example, 
non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, such as the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), may result in substantial fines."
"In addition, publication of failure to 
comply with data protection and privacy regulations could cause reputational damage and result in a loss 
of consumer trust in our brands."
"We also face the risk that members of top management as well as our 
employees breach rules and standards that guide appropriate and responsible business behavior."
"This 
includes the risks of fraud, financial misstatements or manipulation, anti-competitive business practices, 
bribery, corruption, discrimination, and harassment in the workplace."
"Our Compliance Management System (CMS) helps us to prevent, detect, and adequately respond to these 
risks."
"In 
addition, our Regional Compliance Managers and Local Compliance Officers guide and advise our 
operating managers regarding fraud and corruption topics."
"Furthermore, we utilize controls such as 
segregation of duties in IT systems and data analytics technology to prevent or detect fraudulent activities."
"We are also working with external partners and law firms to ensure we are informed about legal 
requirements across the globe, and we take appropriate action to ensure compliance."
"To mitigate the risk 
of non-compliance with laws and regulations concerning data protection and privacy, we developed a 
global privacy management framework that introduces the company’s privacy principles and provides 
guidance for the use and deletion of personal information."
"Our Global Privacy Officer and the Global Privacy department drive 
the operational establishment of the framework and monitoring capabilities to track and report its 
implementation."
"During the implementation, they are continuously providing further implementation 
guidance and training."
"Hazard risks 
As climate change intensifies, the likelihood and intensity of natural disasters such as storms, floods, 
droughts, pandemics, or heat waves increases, and so does adidas’ potential risk."
"In addition, our business 
activities could be impacted by port congestions, strikes, riots, armed conflicts, or terrorist attacks."
"All of 
the above could damage our offices, stores, or distribution centers or disrupt our operational processes 
(e.g., sourcing, logistics) leading to loss of sales, higher cost, and a decrease in profitability."
"To manage and mitigate these risks, we continuously monitor potential threats and have implemented 
business continuity plans including but not limited to fallback solutions for transportation, dynamic 
capacity management of containers and carriers, and reallocation of production."
"We also maintain high 
safety standards in all our locations and have secured insurance coverage for property damage and 
business interruptions."
"Litigation risks 
adidas may be involved in legal disputes and proceedings in different jurisdictions."
"For example, despite a 
rigid internal clearance process, legal steps may be taken against adidas due to the company’s use of 
certain technologies or trademarks that are protected by a third party’s intellectual property rights."
"These 
actions may result in, among others, the company having to stop using certain technologies or designs, 
imposed royalty payment obligations, the withdrawal of products from certain markets, legal costs, 
or reputational damage."
"In particular, in commercial disputes involving the company, third parties may 
also claim financial damages, including lost profits, as a result of an alleged breach of contract by the 
company."
"Our Legal team actively defends adidas’ intellectual property rights and regularly communicates with all 
relevant internal business partners to ensure that our products, including our designs and other 
innovations, are cleared and adequately protected prior to use."
"We retain specialized external counsel (and 
other advisors, if needed) in case legal action is taken against the company."
"Project risks 
To effectively support further business growth and improve efficiency, adidas continuously invests in new 
projects such as the creation, implementation, expansion, harmonization, or modernization of IT systems, 
distribution centers, or office buildings."
"Ineffective project management could delay the execution of 
critical projects and lead to higher expenditures."
"Inadequate project planning and controlling as well as 
executional mistakes or ineffective change management could cause inefficiencies, delays, or business 
disruption, resulting in higher costs and sales shortfalls."
"Inappropriate project governance, prioritization, 
and oversight of the project portfolio may lead to suboptimal resource allocation and undesired project 
results."
"We manage projects utilizing reviews by project teams as well as project steering committees to evaluate 
the progress, quality, and costs of those projects on a regular basis."
"This approach allows early detection 
of project risks and quick implementation of corrective action or timely cancelation of projects with a low 
chance of success."
"To ensure true end-to-end management of key projects we have established a network 
of program and project management departments across all main functions (i.e., Sales, Marketing, 
Operations, Finance, IT, and Human Resources)."
"We also work with external partners for project 
management support in areas where we do not have the required expertise or experience in-house."
"The 
assessment is illustrated in the corporate opportunities overview table."
"In the event of a better-than-anticipated sale of the existing product, the 
company’s top- and bottom-line development could be positively impacted by higher-than-planned sales 
and margins."
"Opportunities related to consumer demand and product offering 
Well-executed campaigns and marketing initiatives could increase brand desire and consumer appeal, 
which may drive full-price sell-through and result in higher-than-expected sales and profit."
"In addition, 
outstanding competitive performance of promotion partners such as individual athletes, club teams, or 
national teams may further increase their popularity among consumers."
"As a result, adidas may generate 
higher sales of signature footwear or licensed apparel and accessories."
"In that respect, we see untapped potential 
particularly for our Lifestyle key franchises as well as our basketball, running, and training business."
"Macroeconomic, sociopolitical, regulatory, and currency opportunities 
Positive macroeconomic developments could strengthen consumer sentiment and purchasing power, for 
example, if inflation rates declined at a faster pace than anticipated."
"Favorable exchange rate 
developments can potentially have a positive impact on the company’s financial results."
"Translation effects 
from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into our company’s functional currency, the euro, 
might also positively impact our company’s financial performance."
"Legislative and regulatory changes 
such as the elimination of trade barriers due to free trade agreements can create cost savings or 
potentially open up new channels of distribution and, as a result, positively impact profitability in the mid- 
to long term."
"This 
could be achieved by reducing initial order sizes while ensuring continuous reproduction and 
replenishment of products."
"In this context, data and analytics play a crucial role in enabling fact-based 
decision-making."
"Therefore, we have a dedicated Data and Analytics team to support business decision-
making by leveraging the power of data."
"Expanded nearshoring capabilities could further reduce lead 
times to ensure that product demand can be fulfilled at all times and to respond more quickly to the latest 
trends in our industry."
"Opportunities related to the distribution strategy 
Our wholesale channel, where we clearly focus on partners that provide consumers with the best shopping 
experience and customer service, could generate higher-than-expected sales and profit."
"In addition, 
organic growth of our business in Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Emerging Markets could provide further 
upside potential in terms of sales and profit."
"This may 
positively impact the company’s financial performance."
"Opportunities related to product engineering and manufacturing processes 
We constantly monitor which of our product features are perceived as most relevant by our consumers."
"By working 
closely with our suppliers, we also see respective potential for more efficient manufacturing processes."
"Litigation opportunities 
Our Legal department is constantly monitoring the market for potential infringements of our own rights by 
third parties, e.g., related to trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights."
"In the event that a 
third party breaches our contracts or infringes our rights, we try to enforce and protect our legal positions 
and, to the extent required, retain specialized external counsel."
"This may result in, among others, the 
company demanding contractual penalties or other financial damages payments from third parties."
"Opportunities related to tax and customs regulations 
The potential release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets or the release of tax risk reserves 
(e.g., relating to transactions or internal reorganizations in prior years) could positively impact income tax 
expense."
"In addition, changes in local tax regulations may offer the company the option to realize benefits 
that could result in a reduction of tax expenses and higher net income."
"Furthermore, we see potential in 
reducing the total amount of customs duties in the long term by increasing our sourcing from 
manufacturing partners in countries with more favorable customs treaties."
"Climate scenario analysis confirmed our previous findings that the overall global greenhouse gas emission 
levels will be an important factor influencing the magnitude of risks and opportunities."
"Moreover, these 
risks and opportunities will gain relevance for our business, especially in the medium to long term."
"We have categorized climate-related risks and opportunities following the ‘Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures’ (‘TCFD’) framework."
"Given the different time horizons and complexity of climate-
related risks and opportunities, the overview is presented separately from the illustration of risks and 
opportunities in this Risk and Opportunity Report."
"We do not expect this to result in any additional major 
risks and opportunities for the forecast for the 2024 fiscal year compared to the explanations given in the 
Risk and Opportunity Report."
"In turn, these could result in lower revenues 
and higher insurance and operating costs."
"─ Changing cost and availability of materials: Changes in weather patterns could negatively affect 
availability of materials, leading to higher operating costs."
"─ Harm to and lower productivity of our own and business partners’ workforce and decreased 
participation in sports: An increase in average temperatures and heat waves could lead to harm and 
reduced productivity of our own and our business partners’ workforce."
"Changes in weather patterns 
could negatively influence consumers’ participation in sports, which could lead to decreased consumer 
demand."
"Transition risks (policy and legal, technology, market and reputation risks)  
─ Energy- and carbon-related prices: Higher prices for energy as well as direct and indirect taxation 
linked to greenhouse gas emissions could negatively impact our business partners and lead to higher 
operating costs."
"─ Exposure to carbon-related regulation and litigation: An increase in regulation (especially product-
related), could lead to increased reporting requirements, as well as the inability to market certain 
products in specific markets."
"An increase in regulation could also lead to a higher exposure to 
litigation for non-compliance."
"─ Cost of low-carbon technologies: High costs for low-carbon technologies could impact our business 
partners’ ability to lower their emissions, resulting in higher operating costs and potential non-
compliance with regulation limiting greenhouse gas emissions."
"─ Stakeholder scrutiny: A change in stakeholders’ expectations could lead to reduced capital availability 
and market valuation due to concerns about our resilience to climate change impacts."
"─ Improved stakeholder perception: A strong environmental performance, with lower greenhouse gas 
emissions and improved climate change resilience, could lead to increased capital availability (green 
financing) and market evaluation, as well as increased employer attractiveness."
"We also provide updates throughout the year as 
appropriate."
"In the transition year 2023, adidas made operational and financial progress and performed 
significantly better than initially expected."
"The overall business environment continued to be characterized 
by geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic challenges, and high inventory levels."
"As a result of our decisive 
actions, we were able to significantly reduce inventory levels during the year."
"Our successful initiatives 
included limiting the sell-in to the wholesale channel, which negatively impacted our top-line 
development."
"At the same time, the underlying business performed above our expectations."
"In addition, 
the company also benefited from the sale of parts of the remaining Yeezy inventory."
"Consequently, we 
were able to upgrade our guidance twice in the course of the year."
"Ultimately, our 2023 financial results 
significantly exceeded our latest guidance from October on both the top and bottom line."
"For average working capital and capital expenditure as of March 8, 2023."
"2 As published on July 24, 2023."
"3 As published on October 17, 2023."
4 Excluding acquisitions and leases.
"In 2023, revenues were flat on a currency-neutral basis."
"This was significantly better than our initial 
expectations (February 2023: high-single-digit decline) and also ahead of our latest guidance (October 
2023: low-single-digit decline)."
The development reflects strong double-digit growth in Latin America.
Revenues in both Greater China and Asia-Pacific grew at high-single-digit rates.
"Currency-neutral sales in 
EMEA were flat."
"North America recorded a double-digit decline as this market was particularly impacted 
by the company’s conservative sell-in strategy to reduce high inventory levels."
"The discontinuation of the 
Yeezy business represented a drag of around € 500 million on the year-over-year comparison during 2023."
"The sale of parts of the remaining Yeezy product positively impacted net sales in the amount of around 
€ 750 million."
"This compares to a total of more than € 1,200 million of Yeezy revenues in 2022."
"Our operating profit reached € 268 million in 2023, ahead of our latest guidance, provided in October, of an 
operating loss of € 100 million."
"Compared to our initial guidance provided at the beginning of 2023 
(operating loss of € 700 million), the reported operating profit of € 268 million is around € 1,000 million 
higher than initially expected."
This outperformance was partly driven by a better operational business.
"In 
addition, the company’s decision to only write off a small portion of its remaining Yeezy inventory and sell a 
significant part of it in 2023 also drove the better-than-expected operating profit development last year."
"This was in line 
with the guided level of between 25% and 26% and represents a year-over-year increase of 1.6 percentage 
points."
"This reflects the slight increase in average operating working capital against the backdrop of lower 
net sales in 2023 compared to 2022."
"Capital expenditure decreased 27% to € 504 million in 2023, below 
our guidance of a level of around € 600 million."
"More than 75% of these investments were spent on 
controlled space initiatives and IT activities."
"Controlled space initiatives comprise investments in new or 
remodeled own retail or franchise stores as well as shop-in-shop presentations of our products in our 
customers’ stores."
"► SEE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
Beyond our financial performance, we also actively monitor other KPIs."
"These other KPIs include, among 
others, ⌐ our sustainable article offering and the share of women in management positions."
"In 2023, with 
almost eight out of ten of our articles being sustainable, meaning that they are – to a significant degree – 
made with environmentally preferred materials, we exceeded the planned annual milestone for 2023."
"With 
40% female representation in management positions in 2023, we decided to establish a new goal and 
committed to achieving a level of 50% by 2033 (previously: to increase to more than 40% by 2025)."
"Results from this process are analyzed and reported to the Executive 
Board accordingly."
"The Executive Board discusses and assesses risks and opportunities on a regular basis 
and takes into account the relationship between the risk and opportunity portfolio (i.e., the company’s 
aggregated risk position) and risk appetite as well as risk capacity in its decision-making."
"Compared to the 
prior year, our assessment of certain risks and opportunities has changed in terms of likelihood of 
occurrence and/or potential financial impact."
"Our risk and opportunity aggregation using a Monte Carlo 
simulation determined that the company’s aggregated risk position does not exceed the company’s risk 
capacity threshold with a likelihood of at least 99%."
"Therefore, we do not foresee any material jeopardy to 
the viability of the company as a going concern."
"► SEE RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT 
Assessment of financial outlook 
In 2024, we expect macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical tensions to persist."
"This may negatively 
affect consumer sentiment and discretionary spending power."
"In North America, we will continue our 
initiatives to reduce high inventory levels, which will weigh on our sales and profitability during the first 
half of the year."
"In addition, unfavorable currency effects are projected to adversely impact both reported 
revenues and the gross margin development in 2024."
"The assumed sale of the remaining Yeezy inventory 
at cost with no operating profit contribution is also expected to weigh on the company’s operational and 
financial performance versus the prior year."
"At the same time, the global sporting goods industry is set to 
benefit from major sports events in 2024."
"Against this backdrop, we plan to return to top-line growth by scaling successful franchises, introducing 
new ones, and leveraging our significantly better, broader, and deeper product range."
"Improved retailer 
relationships, more impactful marketing initiatives, and our activities around the major sports events will 
also contribute to the sales increase."
"As a result, we expect currency-neutral sales to grow at a mid-
single-digit rate in 2024."
"While we will continue to increase our marketing and sales investments, the top-line growth and 
an improving gross margin are projected to drive the bottom-line development in 2024."
"► SEE OUTLOOK 
We believe our outlook for 2024 realistically describes the underlying development of the company."
"However, the outlook for 2024 as outlined in this report is subject to change."
"Ongoing uncertainties 
regarding macroeconomic challenges, the impact from geopolitical conflicts, and the development of 
consumer sentiment as well as potential supply-chain disruptions represent risks to the achievement of 
our stated financial goals and aspirations."
"No other material event between the end of 2023 and the 
publication of this report has altered our view."

"The amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and 
changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors."
"Also, they clarify how entities use 
measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates."

requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current."
"The amendments clarify what is 
meant by a right to defer settlement, that such a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting 
period, and that the classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral 
right."
"In October 2022, the IASB issued further amendments to IAS 1, in which it clarifies that only

"IAS 21 sets out the requirements for determining the exchange 
rate to be used for recording a foreign currency transaction into the functional currency and

"adidas has the right 
to, and is exposed to, the returns from its contractual business relations with Agron, Inc., which are 
dependent on the level of its net sales and overall profitability."
"As a result of the extended power, adidas 
has the ability to directly influence the amount of these variable returns and consequently obtained control 
over Agron, Inc."
"As adidas holds no equity interests of Agron, Inc., both net assets as well as income and 
expenses are attributable entirely to the non-controlling interest."
"adidas has not transferred any 
consideration to the owners of Agron, Inc."
in relation to the amendment of the contractual arrangements.
"A schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is shown in Attachment I to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"This schedule comprises information about the name and domicile of all consolidated 
subsidiaries, as well as the respective share held in the capital of these subsidiaries."
"Furthermore, a 
schedule of the shareholdings of adidas AG is published on the German Company Register."

SHAREHOLDINGS 
The financial effects of intercompany transactions as well as any unrealized gains and losses arising from 
intercompany business relations are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements."
"Principles of measurement 
The following table includes an overview of selected subsequent measurement principles used in the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements."
"All purchases and sales of financial 
assets, with the exception of trade receivables, are recognized on the trade date and initially measured at 
fair value."
"At initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are 
measured at their transaction price."
"Subsequently, a financial asset is measured at amortized cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income (debt instrument), fair value through other comprehensive 
income (equity instrument), or fair value through profit or loss."
"This election is 
made on an investment-by-investment basis."
"All financial assets, which are not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other 
comprehensive income as described above, are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Financial assets are only reclassified when the business model for managing financial assets is changed, 
in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified."
"Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognized in profit or loss."
"Fair value through 
profit or loss 
Amortized cost 
 
These assets are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method."
"The amortized 
cost is reduced by impairment losses."
"Interest income, 
foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment losses 
are recognized in profit or loss."
"Any gain or loss on 
derecognition is recognized in profit or loss."
"Amortized cost 
Fair value through 
other comprehensive 
income 
(debt instrument) 
 
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value."
"Interest income calculated using the effective interest 
method, foreign exchange gains and losses and 
impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss."
"Other net gains and losses are recognized in other 
comprehensive income."
"On derecognition, accumulated 
gains and losses are reclassified to profit or loss."
"Fair value through 
other comprehensive 
income 
Fair value through 
other comprehensive 
income 
(equity instrument) 
 
These assets are subsequently measured at fair value."
"Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss 
unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of 
part of the cost of the investment."
"Other gains and 
losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
and are never reclassified to profit or loss."
"Fair value through 
other comprehensive 
income 
 
Financial liabilities are recognized when adidas becomes a party to the contractual provisions that gives 
rise to the financial liability."
All financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value.
"For subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified either as financial liabilities measured at 
fair value through profit or loss, or as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost."
"Financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss include, in particular, derivative financial instruments not designated as 
hedging instruments in hedging relationships in accordance with IFRS 9."
"Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of financial liabilities that are not measured at 
fair value through profit or loss reduce the fair value of the financial liability on initial recognition."
"For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency."
"Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the respective functional currency by applying 
the spot exchange rate valid at the transaction date to the foreign currency amount."
"In the individual financial statements of subsidiaries, monetary items denominated in non-functional 
currencies of the subsidiaries are generally translated into the functional currency at closing exchange 
rates at the balance sheet date."
"The resulting currency gains and losses are recognized directly in profit or 
loss."
"This excludes monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group’s net investment in a 
foreign operation."
"These are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) until the net investment is 
disposed of, at which time the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss."
"Taxes resulting from 
these exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income in accordance 
with IAS 12."
"Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions."
"Non-monetary items measured at fair 
value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value is 
determined."
"The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is 
treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item."
"Assets and liabilities of the company’s non-euro functional currency subsidiaries that are included in the 
consolidated financial statements are translated using closing exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
into the presentation currency, the euro."
"For practical reasons, revenues and expenses are translated at 
average rates for the period, which approximate the exchange rates on the transaction dates."
"The 
resulting exchange differences arising on consolidation are recognized in OCI."
"A summary of exchange rates to the euro for major currencies in which the Group operates is as follows: 
Exchange rates 
 
  
  
  
  
€ 1 equals 
 
Average rates for the year 
ending Dec."
"31, 
 
Spot rates at Dec."
"► SEE NOTE 33 
Gains and losses on the net monetary position are included in the financial result."
"Non-monetary assets that have been restated following the guidance in IAS 29 are still subject to 
impairment assessment in accordance with the guidance in the relevant IFRS."
"Derivative financial instruments 
adidas uses derivative financial instruments, such as currency options, forward exchange contracts and 
currency swaps, to hedge its exposure to foreign-exchange risks."
"In accordance with its Treasury Policy, 
the company does not enter into transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes."
"Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized in the statement of financial position at fair value 
and are subsequently also measured at their fair value."
"The method of recognizing the resulting gains or 
losses is dependent on the nature of the hedge."
"On the date a derivative contract is entered into, adidas 
designates derivatives as either a hedge of a forecast transaction (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net 
investment in a foreign operation."
"In applying cash flow hedge accounting, adidas designates the spot 
element of forward exchange contracts and the intrinsic value of currency options to hedge its currency 
risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1 (spot-to-spot designation)."
"The forward element of forward exchange 
contracts and the time value component of currency options are excluded from the designation of the 
hedging instrument."
"Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or net 
investments that are effective as defined in IFRS 9 are recognized in equity."
adidas applies the ‘cost of hedging’ approach for dedicated cash flow hedges.
"Changes in the fair value of 
the time value component of currency options, as well as the forward element in forward exchange 
contracts, are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging and are recognized separately in equity as a 
cost of hedging reserve."
"When the effectiveness is not 100%, the ineffective portion of the change in the 
fair value is recognized in the consolidated income statement."
"Accumulated gains and losses in equity are 
transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same periods, during which the hedged forecast 
transaction affects the consolidated income statement."
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges.
"The 
effective currency gains and losses in the derivative and all gains and losses arising on the translation of 
the borrowing are recognized in equity with the exception of the cross-currency basis spread."
"Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the company’s risk-
management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules of IFRS 9."
"adidas documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedge objects as well as the risk 
management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions at transaction 
inception."
"This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedge to specific firm commitments 
and forecast transactions."
"The economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is 
qualitatively and quantitatively ascertainable, and adidas judges the effectiveness of the hedging 
relationship by using generally accepted methods such as the hypothetical derivative method or the ‘Dollar 
Offset Method’."
"The main sources of expected ineffectiveness are due to changes in the credit risk and in 
the timing of the hedged transactions."
"The fair value of a currency option is determined using generally 
accepted models."
"The fair value of an option is influenced not only by the remaining term of the option but 
also by additional factors, such as the actual foreign exchange rate and the volatility of the underlying 
foreign currency base."
"The company determines fair values taking the counterparty risk into 
consideration."
"Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash at banks, cash on hand, and short-term deposits with 
maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition, such as commercial papers and 
investments in money market funds."
"Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts 
of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value."
Cash equivalents can partly include investments in money market funds.
"Classification and measurement 
under IFRS 9 are performed based on the company’s business model for managing these financial assets 
and the contractual cash flow characteristics."
"Investments in money market funds contain cash flows 
other than those of principal and interest on principal."
"As a result, those investments are measured at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"Accounts receivable 
A receivable is recognized if an amount of consideration that is unconditional is due from the customer 
(i.e., if only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due)."
"Subsequently, these are measured at amortized cost."
"Other financial assets 
Other financial assets are classified and measured under IFRS 9, based on the company’s business model 
for managing these assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics."
"Those other financial assets that 
give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and that are assigned to the 
business model ‘Hold to collect’ are measured at amortized cost."
"adidas mainly has security deposits and 
receivables from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces that fall under this category."
"Other financial assets that give rise to cash flows consisting only of payments of principal and interest and 
that are assigned to the business model ‘Hold to collect and sell’ are measured at fair value through OCI."
"This category mainly includes other investments and securities to hedge long-term variable compensation 
components."
"Other financial assets, which are neither within the business model ‘Hold to collect’ nor within ‘Hold to 
collect and sell,’ are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"This category mainly includes secured 
promissory notes and earn-out components."
"Only financial assets that are held within the business model ‘Hold 
to collect’ with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows, which represent solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding on a specific date, are measured at amortized 
cost."
adidas classifies certain loans within this category.
"All other financial assets which do not fulfill one 
of these criteria are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"adidas has no long-term financial assets 
in the category fair value through comprehensive income (debt instrument) and shows loans which do not 
fulfill the contractual cash flow characteristics in the category fair value through profit or loss."
"The designation of certain equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity) is 
based on a strategic management decision."
"Inventories 
Finished goods and merchandise are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale."
"Costs are determined using a standard valuation method, the 
‘average cost method.’ Costs of finished goods include the cost of direct materials and labor and the 
components of the manufacturing overheads that can be reasonably attributed to finished goods."
"The 
allocation of overheads is based on the planned average utilization."
"The net realizable value allowances 
are computed consistently throughout the company based on the age and expected future sales of the 
items on hand."
"Discontinued operations are excluded from the net income/loss from continuing operations and are 
presented as a single amount as gain/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the consolidated 
income statement."
"When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative 
consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows are restated and presented as if 
the operation had been classified as such from the start of the comparative year."
"► SEE NOTE 03 
Property, plant, and equipment 
Property, plant, and equipment are measured at amortized cost."
"Depreciation is recognized for those assets, with the exception of land and construction in progress, over 
the estimated useful life utilizing the ‘straight-line method’ and taking into account any potential residual 
value."
"Parts of an item of property, plant, and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the 
total cost of the item are depreciated separately."
"Renewals and improvements are 
capitalized and depreciated separately, if the recognition criteria are met."
"Impairment losses on non-financial assets 
If facts and circumstances indicate that non-current assets (e.g., property, plant, and equipment as well as 
intangible assets including goodwill and contract assets) might be impaired, the recoverable amount is 
determined."
"This is measured at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal (net disposal price) and 
value in use."
"Recoverable amount is determined on an individual asset level, unless the asset does not 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets."
"If this is 
the case, recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs."
"The 
fair value is measured at Level 3 according to IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement.’ 
An impairment loss is recognized in other operating expenses or reported in goodwill impairment losses if 
the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount."
"The impairment test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units, which represent 
the lowest level within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
"If 
there is an impairment loss for a group of cash-generating units, then, first, the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the group of cash-generating units is reduced."
"Subsequently, provided that the 
recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the other non-current assets of the group of cash-
generating units are reduced pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the group of 
cash-generating units."
"In allocating an impairment loss, the carrying amount of an individual asset is not 
reduced below its fair value."
"The amount of the impairment loss that would otherwise have been allocated 
to the asset is allocated pro rata to the other assets of the cash-generating unit and groups of cash-
generating units."
"Irrespective of whether there is an impairment indication, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, 
intangible assets not yet available for use and goodwill acquired in business combinations are tested 
annually on December 31 for impairment."
"In the case that indicators for impairment are present at any 
point in time other than on December 31, these assets are also tested for impairment at this point in time."
An impairment loss recognized in goodwill is not reversible.
"With respect to all other impaired assets, an 
impairment loss recognized in prior periods is only reversed such as it affects the consolidated income 
statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount."
"adidas consistently applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all 
accounts receivable."
"In order to calculate a collective loss allowance, all accounts receivable sharing 
similar credit risk characteristics are allocated into several portfolios based on geographical regions and 
macroeconomic indicators."
"The adjusted probability of default is then applied in combination with a 
loss given default and exposure at default as a percentage rate to calculate the expected credit loss for 
each portfolio and aging bucket."
"The percentage rates are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that they 
reflect the latest data on credit risk."
"In case objective evidence of credit impairment is observed for 
accounts receivable from a specific customer, a detailed analysis of the credit risk is performed, and an 
appropriate individual loss allowance is recognized for this customer."
"Accounts receivables are considered 
to be in default when it is expected that the debtor will not fulfill its credit obligations toward adidas."
"Cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost are subject to a general impairment approach 
under IFRS 9."
"adidas applies the low credit risk exemption for the majority of such instruments due to the 
low credit risk for these investments, which is based on the investment grade of their counterparties 
(defined by the company as equivalent of BBB+ or higher)."
"A significant increase of credit risk is assumed 
for cash and cash equivalents when the instruments are more than 30 days past due."
"adidas monitors the 
credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents taking into consideration the economic environment, 
external credit ratings, and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions, and using established 
exposure limits."
"Expected credit loss of cash and cash equivalents is calculated based on the probability of 
default and recovery rates derived from CDS spreads or external credit ratings of the counterparties."
"Cash 
and cash equivalents are considered to be in default when they are more than 90 days past due."
"Other financial assets within the scope of IFRS 9 impairment analysis include mainly security deposits as 
well as accounts receivable from credit card companies and electronic marketplaces."
"The credit risk 
associated with such financial assets is determined based on the economic environment, external credit 
ratings, and/or CDS spreads of counterparty financial institutions."
"Other financial assets are considered to 
be in default when they are more than 90 days past due."
"Objective evidence that credit impairment of financial assets has occurred includes, for instance, 
significant financial difficulty of the debtor/issuer, indications of their potential bankruptcy, the 
deterioration of the market for their products, and general macroeconomic problems."
"The gross carrying 
amount of financial assets is written off when adidas, based on a case-by-case assessment, assumes that 
their recovery is no longer possible."
"Impairment losses on accounts receivable are presented in the line item ‘Impairment losses (net) on 
accounts receivable and contract assets’."
"IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration."
"In its role as a lessee, adidas leases various types of assets, particularly buildings (retail stores, offices, 
warehouses, etc.), land, technical equipment and machinery (warehouse equipment, production machines, 
etc.), motor vehicles, and computer hardware, as well as furniture and fixtures."
"Lease contracts are 
typically negotiated for fixed periods of up to 99 years but may include extension or termination options."
Lease terms are negotiated individually and may contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.
"Lease payments for low-value leases are recognized as expenses as they are incurred over the 
lease term."
"Furthermore, adidas exercises the option for lessees to combine lease payments with payments for non-
lease components in the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset for all lease asset classes 
except for corporate real estate."
"adidas recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement 
date."
"At the commencement date, adidas initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the 
lease payments that are not paid at that date."
"Other variable lease 
payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability."
"The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease."
"If this rate cannot be readily determined, adidas uses its 
incremental borrowing rate."
"Generally, adidas uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate."
"It 
is adjusted to reflect the country-specific risk, the credit risk of adidas, collateral from the change in value 
of the leased asset, the contract currency-specific risk, and the lease term."
"► SEE NOTE 10 ► SEE NOTE 19 
After the commencement date, lease payments are split into redemption payments and interest payments."
"The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest cost on 
the lease liability using the effective interest rate and reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease 
payments made."
"The carrying amount of the lease liability is remeasured provided any 
reassessments/lease modifications occur (including changes in the assessment of whether an extension 
or termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised)."
"The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability."
"adidas applies judgment in determining the lease term for lease contracts including extension or 
termination options."
"The assessment of whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised has an 
impact on the lease term and therefore may significantly affect the measurement of lease liabilities and 
right-of-use assets, respectively."
"Lease contract renegotiations that result in changes to the original contractual conditions, e.g., changes in 
scope, consideration (including discounts and concessions), or lease term are treated as lease 
modifications."
"Depending on the circumstances of the renegotiation, either lease modifications are 
accounted for as a new separate contract, or they trigger a remeasurement of the lease liability using the 
discounted future lease payments."
"In the latter case, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-
use asset with, in some instances, a difference recognized in profit or loss."
"Lease reassessments are the result of changes in assumptions or judgments, such as changes in lease 
term due to amended estimates surrounding existing extension and termination options."
"It is necessary to 
remeasure the lease liability using the discounted or existing future lease payments and make a 
corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset."
"Goodwill  
Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business 
combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized."
"This results when the purchase 
cost exceeds the fair value of acquired identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities."
"Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses (impairment-only approach)."
"► SEE NOTE 11 
Goodwill is carried in the functional currency of the acquired foreign entity."
"Intangible assets (except goodwill) 
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are valued at amortized cost."
"Amortization is calculated on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, taking into account any potential residual value."
"The capitalized development costs are amortized on a 
systematic basis from the day the intangible assets are available for use."
"In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortized cost using the ‘effective interest 
method.’ Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is 
recognized in the consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowing."
"Compound financial instruments (e.g., convertible bonds) are divided into a liability component shown 
under borrowings and into an equity component resulting from conversion rights."
"The equity component is 
included in the capital reserve."
"The fair value of the liability component is determined by discounting the 
interest and principal payments of a comparable liability without conversion rights, applying risk-adjusted 
interest rates."
There is no subsequent measurement of the equity component.
"At initial recognition, directly attributable 
transaction costs are assigned to the equity and liability component pro rata on the basis of the respective 
carrying amounts."
"In general, all provisions are uncertain 
as to their maturity or amount."
"The expense relating to a provision is presented in the consolidated income 
statement."
"Non-current provisions are discounted if the effect of the time value of money is material, with 
the interest expense being reported as financial expenses."
"► SEE NOTE 18 
Accrued liabilities are liabilities to pay for goods or services that have been received or supplied but have 
not been paid, invoiced, or formally agreed with the supplier, including amounts due to employees."
"The 
uncertainty regarding amount or timing of accrued liabilities is generally much less than for provisions."
"► SEE NOTE 20 
Pensions and similar obligations  
Provisions and expenses for pensions and similar obligations relate to the company’s obligations for 
defined benefit and defined contribution plans."
"The obligations under defined benefit plans are determined 
separately for each plan by valuing the employee benefits accrued in return for their service during the 
current and prior periods."
"The discount rate is set on 
the basis of yields of high-quality fixed-rate corporate bonds at the balance sheet date provided there is a 
deep market for such corporate bonds in a given currency."
"Otherwise, government bond yields are used as 
a reference."
"Calculations are performed by qualified actuaries using the ‘projected unit credit method’ in 
accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits."
"Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are 
recognized as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred."
"► SEE NOTE 23 
Contingent liabilities  
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be 
confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of 
adidas."
"Contingent 
liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position but are disclosed and 
explained in the Notes."
"► SEE NOTE 38 
Treasury shares 
When adidas AG shares are repurchased and recognized as treasury shares, the amount of the 
consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any tax effects, is recognized as a 
deduction from equity."
The nominal value of € 1 per treasury share is debited to share capital.
"Any 
premium or discount to the nominal value is shown as an adjustment to the retained earnings."
"If treasury 
shares are sold or reissued, the nominal value of the shares will be credited to share capital and the 
amount exceeding the nominal value will be added to the retained earnings."
"Revenue 
Revenue derived from the sale of goods is recognized when adidas has satisfied the respective 
performance obligation by transferring the promised goods to the customer."
"The goods are transferred at 
the point in time when the customer obtains control of the respective goods."
"The timing of the transfer of 
control depends on the individual terms of the sales agreement (terms of delivery)."
"The amount of revenue to be recognized is determined based on the consideration adidas expects to be 
entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to the customer, taking into 
account returns, discounts, and rebates."
"Under certain conditions and in accordance with contractual agreements, the company’s customers have 
the right to return products and to either exchange them for similar or other products or to return the 
products against the issuance of a credit note."
"Amounts for estimated returns related to revenues are 
accrued based on past experience of average return rates and average actual return periods by means of a 
refund liability."
"The return assets are measured at the carrying amount of the inventories/products, less 
any handling costs and any potential impairment."
"Provided that the customers meet certain predefined conditions, adidas grants its customers different 
types of globally aligned performance-based rebates."
"Examples include rebates for customers’ increasing 
adidas product sales, for customer loyalty, and for sell-out support, e.g., through retail space/franchise 
store management."
"As soon as it is assumed that the customer fulfills the requirements for being granted 
the rebate, this amount is recognized as a sales deduction via an accrued liability for marketing and sales."
"In addition, adidas generates revenue from the licensing-out of the right to use the brands to third parties."
"The resulting sales-based royalty and commission income is recognized based on the contract terms on 
an accrual basis, i.e., revenue is already realized even though the payment takes place at a later point in 
time."
"The performance obligation related 
to these contract assets and liabilities is satisfied over the life of the contract, i.e., the guaranteed 
minimum income per year is evenly distributed over twelve months, whereby payments are recorded as 
arranged in the contract with the customer."
"Advertising and promotional expenditure 
Advance payments for media campaigns are included in prepaid expenses within other current and non-
current assets until the services are received, and upon receipt are expensed in full."
"Significant costs for 
media campaigns are expensed on a straight-line basis over the intended duration of the media campaign."
"Promotional expenses including one-time up-front payments for promotion contracts are principally 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement."
"Interest  
Interest is recognized as income or expense as incurred using the ‘effective interest method’ with the 
exception of interest that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a 
qualifying asset."
This interest is capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset.
Interest paid is presented within the net cash used in financing activities.
"Government grants 
adidas receives government grants in the form of subsidies, subventions, or premiums from local, 
national, or international government authorities such as those of the Free State of Bavaria, the Federal 
Republic of Germany, and the European Union."
"Government grants are recognized if there is adequate certainty that the grants will be received and that 
the company satisfies the conditions attached."
"Government grants are reported in the consolidated income statement as a deduction from the related 
expenses."
"Income taxes  
Current income taxes are computed in accordance with the applicable taxation rules established in the 
countries in which adidas operates."
"adidas computes deferred taxes for all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax 
base of its assets and liabilities as well as for tax loss carry-forwards."
"As it is not permitted to recognize a 
deferred tax liability for the initial recognition of goodwill, adidas does not compute any deferred taxes 
thereon."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year 
when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date."
"Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards that exceed 
taxable temporary differences are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that the entity 
concerned will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the associated benefit."
"The carrying amount of 
deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be 
utilized."
"Deferred tax relating to items recognized outside 
profit or loss is recognized outside profit or loss."
"Deferred tax items are recognized in correlation to the 
underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity."
"When there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, adidas recognizes and measures current or 
deferred tax assets or liabilities applying the requirements of IAS 12 and IFRIC 23."
"On a case-by-case 
basis, adidas determines whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with 
one or more other uncertain tax treatments, depending on which approach better predicts the resolution 
of the uncertainty."

The cost of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with employees is determined by the fair 
value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model."
"That cost is recognized in personnel 
expenses, together with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings), over the period in which 
the service and, where applicable, the performance conditions are fulfilled (the vesting period)."
"The 
cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date 
reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the company’s best estimate of the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest."
"If the estimate is changed, even a credit in the consolidated income statement for the period can be 
possible as it reflects the movement in cumulative expenses from the beginning to the end of that period."
"No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest if non-market performance and/or service 
conditions have not been met."
"For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services acquired, and the liability 
incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability."
"Until the liability is settled, the fair value of the 
liability is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with all changes in 
fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period."
"Although such estimates are based on the 
best of our knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may ultimately differ from these 
estimates."
"In 2023, assumptions and estimates continued to be significantly impacted especially by the 
increased macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges."

Discontinued operations 
The position of discontinued operations mainly includes the Reebok business, which was sold on February 
28, 2022 with effect from March 1, 2022."
"The majority of the purchase price was paid at closing, with the 
remainder comprising deferred and contingent consideration."
"The fair value of earn-out components was 
determined using the discounted cash flow method, considering Monte Carlo Simulations."
"The profit from discontinued operations for 2023 in the amount of € 44 million (2022: € 384 million) is fully 
attributable to the shareholders of adidas AG."
"In the event the operations of the Reebok business achieve certain performance criteria during the period 
March 1, 2022, to December 31, 2031, specified as earn-out components in the sale agreement, additional 
cash consideration of up to € 500 million will be due."
"At the time of the sale, the fair value of the 
consideration was determined to be € 247 million."
"It has been recognized as a financial asset at fair value 
through profit and loss."
"At year-end 2023, the fair value was reestimated to be € 301 million (2022: € 227 million)."
"The gain of 
€ 74 million compared with the fair value at year-end 2022 is presented in discontinued operations net of 
related income tax."
"Additionally, as contemplated in the sale agreement relating to the Reebok business, the sale was subject 
to deferred considerations for inventory and contractually specified items, which were settled by the end of 
the first half year 2023 (2022: € 274 million)."
"Short-term deposits are only shown as cash and cash equivalents if they are readily convertible to a known 
amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value."
"The credit risk of cash and cash equivalents measured at amortized cost is insignificant due to their short-
term maturity, counterparties’ investment grade credit ratings, and established exposure limits."
"Therefore, adidas does not recognize any credit impairment losses for these financial assets."
"As of December 31, 2023 cash and cash equivalents includes cash in banks and cash on hand amounting to 
€ 596 million (2022: € 726 million) and money market funds amounting to € 835 million (2022: 
€ 72 million)."
"In addition, cash and cash equivalents includes € 211 million and € 155 million as of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, held by subsidiaries that were subject to foreign exchange 
control (e.g."
"Russia, Argentina) or other legal restriction and hence were not at anytime available for 
general use by adidas AG or other subsidiaries."
Further information about cash and cash equivalents is presented in these Notes.
There are no material balances of accounts receivable written off but subject to enforcement activity.
"Accounts receivable are derecognized when substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to the 
financial asset are transferred to a third party under factoring arrangements."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
accounts receivable amounting to € 70 million (2022: € 112 million) were derecognized in connection with 
factoring agreements in Japan."
"discounts) granted by adidas to the debtor 
and less the factoring fee and interest."
"The factoring fee amounts to 0.08% of the nominal amount of the 
purchased receivables."
"Interest on the disbursed purchase price is based on an interest rate composed of 
the ‘Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate‘ (reference interest rate) plus a margin of 0.19% to 1.33% p.a."
"and is 
paid for the period from the disbursement of the purchase price portion to the settlement of the receivable 
by the debtor."

adidas determines whether goodwill impairment is necessary at least on an annual basis."
"The impairment 
test for goodwill is performed based on groups of cash-generating units that represent the lowest level 
within the company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
"This requires an 
estimation of the recoverable amount of the groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is 
allocated."
"The recoverable amount of a group of cash-generating units is determined based on its value in 
use."
"Estimating the value in use requires adidas to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows 
from the groups of cash-generating units and to choose a suitable discount rate to calculate the present 
value of those cash flows."
"This calculation uses cash flow projections based on the financial planning covering a four-year period in 
total."
"The planning is based on long-term expectations of the company and reflects an average annual 
high-single-digit sales increase with varying forecast growth prospects for the different groups of cash-
generating units."
"Furthermore, adidas expects the operating margin to improve to a level of low double-
digit profitability for the company by 2027, primarily driven by an improvement in gross margin, as well as 
lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales."
"The planning for capital expenditure and working 
capital is primarily based on past experience."
"The planning for future tax payments is based on current 
statutory corporate tax rates of the individual groups of cash-generating units."
"Cash flows beyond this 
four-year period are extrapolated using steady growth rates between 1.5% and 2.2% (2022: 1.7%)."
"According to the company’s expectations, these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth 
rate of the business sector in which the respective group of cash-generating units operates."
"Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital calculation considering a five-year average 
market-weighted debt/equity structure and financing costs referencing major competitors for the 
respective group of cash-generating units."
"The discount rates used reflect the specific equity and country 
risk of the respective group of cash-generating units."
"The regional markets are Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), North 
America, Greater China, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America."
"The number of groups of cash-generating units 
amounted to a total of five at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"The goodwill impairment tests revealed no need for goodwill impairment for the years ending 
December 31, 2023 and 2022."
"The carrying amounts of acquired goodwill allocated to the respective groups of cash-generating units and 
the respective discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are as follows: 
Allocation of goodwill

Dec."
"Among the remaining cash generating units, neither a change in the discount rate by up to approximately 
5.8 percentage points, nor a reduction of planned free cash inflows by up to approximately 36.9% would 
result in any impairment requirement."
"Future changes in expected cash flows and discount rates may lead to impairments of the reported 
goodwill in the future."
The majority of goodwill is denominated in US dollars.
"This investment is classified as fair value through profit or loss and is 
recorded at fair value."
This equity security does not have a quoted market price in an active market.
"Therefore, existing contractual arrangements are used in order to calculate the fair value as at 
December 31, 2023 and 2022."
Other equity investments include minority shareholdings.
"There is currently no intention to sell these 
shares."
"Other minority shareholdings include a decrease of the fair value in an amount of € 5 million in 
2023 (2022: € 1 million increase)."
"The line item ‘Other investments’ comprises investments that are mainly invested in insurance products,

"In addition, as at December 31, 2023, adidas had separate lines for the issuance of 
letters of credit and guarantees in an amount of approximately € 0.4 billion (2022: € 0.5 billion)."
"In November 2020, adidas entered into a new syndicated credit facility agreement with twelve banks

Pensions and similar obligations  
adidas has recognized post-employment benefit obligations arising from defined benefit plans."

"Defined contribution pension plans  
The total expense for defined contribution pension plans amounted to € 82 million in 2023 
(2022: € 91 million)."
"Defined benefit pension plans  
Given the company’s diverse subsidiary structure, different defined benefit pension plans exist, comprising 
a variety of post-employment benefit arrangements."
"The company’s major defined benefit pension plans 
relate to adidas AG and its subsidiary in the UK."
"The defined benefit pension plans generally provide 
payments in case of death, disability, or retirement to former employees and their survivors."
"The 
obligations arising from defined benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets."
"In addition, there 
are significant obligations from a plan to cover the medical costs of pensioners in the USA."
"In Germany, adidas AG grants its employees contribution-based and final-salary-defined benefit pension 
schemes, which provide employees with entitlements in the event of retirement, disability, and death."
"Active existing employees and new 
entrants are entitled to benefits in accordance with the general company agreement ‘Core Benefits: adidas 
company pension plan.’ This is a pension plan with a basic employer contribution, possible salary 
sacrifices, and additional matching contribution."
"Thus, the contributions to this pension plan are partly 
paid by the employee and partly paid by the employer."
"The contributions are transferred into benefit 
components."
"The benefits are paid out in the form of a pension, a lump sum, or installments."
"The pension 
plans in Germany are financed using book reserves, a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) and, for certain 
former members of the Executive Board of adidas AG, a pension fund (‘Pensionsfonds’) in combination 
with a reinsured provident fund (‘Unterstützungskasse’)."
The final salary defined benefit pension scheme in the UK is closed to new entrants and to future accrual.
The benefits are mainly paid out in the form of pensions.
"The scheme operates under UK trust law as well 
as under the jurisdiction of the UK Pensions Regulator and therefore is subject to a minimum funding 
requirement."
"The Trustee Board is responsible for setting the scheme’s funding objective, agreeing the 
contributions with the company, and determining the investment strategy of the scheme."
"The legal framework for employer-provided benefits to cover healthcare costs for retirees in the United 
States is primarily governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and the Internal 
Revenue Code (IRC)."
"These laws establish the rules and regulations that employers must follow when 
providing these benefits to their employees."
"The fully unfunded medical plan is open to new participants 
who have, at the end of their employment, completed at least 10 years of service, are at least 55 years of 
age, and are entitled to subsidized medical care."
"The plan provides medical, pharmaceutical, dental and 
ophthalmologic services from retirement until maximum the age of 65 (or without age limit until death for 
a closed group of retirees)."
"At age 65 they are expected to receive state medical benefits from US 
Medicare."

to a decline of the funded status."
"The following tables analyze the defined benefit plans, plan assets, present values of the defined benefit 
pension plans, expenses recognized in the consolidated income statement, actuarial assumptions, and 
further information."
"In 
particular, the present value of the defined benefit obligation is driven by financial variables (such as the 
discount rates or future increases in salaries) and demographic variables (such as mortality and employee 
turnover)."

"The 
mortality tables in the UK and in the US were modified to account for future changes in life expectancy."

"Due to the fact that with the introduction of the Core Benefits arrangement, German 
pension plans are mainly paid as lump sums, the pension increase rate and the mortality assumption have 
significantly less impact than the discount rate when calculating the pension obligations."
"Part of the plan assets in Germany is held by a trustee under a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) for 
the purpose of funding the pension obligations of adidas AG and insolvency insurance with regard to part of 
the pension obligations of adidas AG."
The trustee is the registered association adidas Pension Trust e.V.
"The investment committee of the adidas Pension Trust determines the investment strategy with the goal to 
match the pension liabilities as far as possible and to generate a sustainable return."
"In 2023, no additional 
employer funding contribution was transferred to the trustee."
"The plan assets in the registered 
association are mainly invested in fixed income funds, equity funds and real estate."
"Another substantial 
part of the plan assets in Germany is invested in insurance contracts via a pension fund and a provident 
fund."
"For this portion, an insurance entity is responsible for the determination and the implementation of 
the investment strategy."
"In the UK, the plan assets are held in an external trust."
"In principle the investment strategy is aligned with 
the structure of the pension obligations in these countries."
"In the rest of the world, the plan assets consist 
predominantly of insurance contracts."
The expected total employer contributions for the 2024 financial year amount to € 31 million.
"Thereof, 
€ 25 million relates to benefits directly paid to pensioners by the subsidiaries and € 6 million to employer 
contributions paid into the plan assets."

adidas AG held 1,450,916 treasury shares, corresponding to a notional amount of € 1,450,916 in the 
nominal capital and consequently to 0.81% of the nominal capital."
"Authorized capital 2021/I and 2021/II 
The Executive Board of adidas AG did not utilize the existing amount of authorized capital of up to 
€ 70 million in the reporting period."
"The previous 
sentence does not apply to the exclusion of subscription rights for residual amounts."
"The Authorized 
Capital 2021/II must not be used to issue shares within the scope of compensation or participation 
programs for Executive Board members or employees or for members of the management bodies or 
employees of affiliated companies."
"Contingent capital 2022 
The following overview of the contingent capital is based on § 4 section 4 of the Articles of Association of 
adidas AG as well as on the underlying resolution of the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2022."
"The nominal capital is conditionally increased by up to € 12.5 million divided into not more than 12,500,000 
no-par-value shares (Contingent Capital 2022)."
"The new 
shares will be issued at the respective option or conversion price to be established in accordance with the 
aforementioned authorization resolution."
"The new shares carry dividend rights from 
the commencement of the financial year in which the shares are issued."
"Furthermore, the Executive Board is authorized to stipulate additional details concerning the 
implementation of the contingent capital increase."
"Shares which are issued or sold in accordance with § 186 section 3 sentence 4 AktG during the term of this 
authorization until its utilization shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%."
"Furthermore, 
shares that are to be issued or granted during the term of this authorization on the basis of a bond issued 
with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with this provision utilizing another authorization 
shall be attributed to the aforementioned limit of 10%."
"In the period up until the balance sheet date, the Executive Board of adidas AG did not issue any bonds 
based on the authorization granted on May 12, 2022, and consequently did not issue any shares from the 
Contingent Capital 2022."
"Repurchase and use of treasury shares 
The Annual General Meeting on May 11, 2023, granted the Executive Board an authorization to repurchase 
adidas AG shares up to an amount totaling 10% of the nominal capital until May 10, 2028."
"The authorization 
may be used by adidas AG but also by its subordinated Group companies or by third parties on account of 
adidas AG or its subordinated Group companies or third parties assigned by adidas AG or one of its 
subordinated Group companies."
"The Executive Board of adidas AG did not make use of this authorization in 
the reporting period."
"In the 2023 financial year, adidas AG transferred 11,886 treasury shares to the Chief Executive Officer 
Bjørn Gulden as reimbursement for the variable compensation forfeited at his former employer."
"Based on 
the share price at the time, the 11,886 treasury shares transferred had a value of € 2,040,826 
corresponding to a notional amount of € 11,886 in the nominal capital and consequently to approx."
"0.01% 
of the nominal capital."
"Therefore, taking into account the 1,462,802 shares held by adidas AG as at December 31, 2022, and the

"Capital management 
The company’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to uphold investor, creditor, and market 
confidence and to sustain future development of the business."
"adidas seeks to maintain a balance between a higher return on equity that might be possible with higher 
levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position."
"The company 
further aims to maintain adjusted net borrowings below two times EBITDA (Earnings before interests, 
taxes, depreciation and amortization and impairment losses and reversals) over the long term."
"adidas 
received strong first-time investment-grade ratings by both Standard   Poor’s and Moody’s in August 
2020."
"Standard   Poor’s gave adidas an ‘A+’ rating, and Moody’s granted the company an ‘A2’ rating."
"The 
initial outlook for both ratings was ‘stable’ as both rating agencies recognized the company’s strong credit 
metrics, robust liquidity profile, and conservative financial policies."
"In November 2022, both Standard & 
Poor’s and Moody’s revised their outlook for adidas to ‘negative’ due to a deterioration in credit metrics 
amid pressure on the company’s operating performance from economic as well as company specific 
challenges."
"In February 2023, Standard   Poor’s lowered its rating on adidas to ‘A-‘, while Moody’s 
downgraded the company to ‘A3’, both with a ‘negative’ outlook."
"In 
December 2023 and January 2024 Standard   Poor’s and Moody’s issued reports affirming ‘A-‘ rating with 
‘negative’ outlook and ‘A3’ rating with ‘negative’ outlook respectively."
"Overall, adidas' investment grade 
credit ratings continue to ensure an efficient access to capital markets."
"Financial leverage amounts to 98.6% (2022: 121.2%) and is defined as the ratio between adjusted net 
borrowings in an amount of € 4.518 billion (2022: € 6.047 billion) and shareholders’ equity in an amount of 
€ 4.580 billion (2022: € 4.991 billion)."
"EBITDA amounted to € 1.358 billion for the financial year ending 
December 31, 2023 (2022: € 1.874 billion)."
"The ratio between adjusted net borrowings and EBITDA 
amounted to 3.3 for the 2023 financial year (2022: 3.2)."
"It mainly complements the net 
borrowings reported up to that point by the present value of future payment obligations from leasing and 
pension commitments."
"The method of calculating adjusted net borrowings was revised in 2022 to align it 
with general market practice and the approach of the rating agencies."
"The composition of the adjusted net borrowings is presented below:

"─ Cumulative currency translation differences: comprises all foreign currency differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations."
"─ Cost of hedging reserve – options: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the 
fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of options (time value and premium)."
"─ Cost of hedging reserve – forward contracts: comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net 
change in the fair value of cash flow hedges reflecting cost of hedging of forward contracts (forward 
component)."
"─ Retained earnings: comprises both amounts that are required by the Articles of Association and 
voluntary amounts that have been set aside by adidas."
"The reserve includes the unappropriated 
accumulated profits less dividends paid, and consideration paid for the repurchase of adidas AG shares 
exceeding the nominal value."
"In addition, the item includes the effects of the employee stock purchase 
plan and the transition effects of the implementation of new IFRSs."
The capital reserve includes restricted capital in an amount of € 4 million (2022: € 4 million).
"Furthermore, 
other reserves include additional restricted capital in an amount of € 136 million (2022: € 98 million)."
"Distributable profits and dividends 
Profits distributable to shareholders are determined by reference to the retained earnings of adidas AG 
and calculated under German commercial law."
"Based on the resolution of the 2023 Annual General Meeting, the dividend for 2022 was € 0.70 per share 
(total amount: approx."
"The Executive Board of adidas AG will propose to use retained earnings of adidas AG in an amount of 
€ 411 million as reported in the 2023 financial statements of adidas AG for a dividend payment of € 0.70 
per share and to carry forward the subsequent remaining amount."
"As at February 20, 2024, 178,549,084 dividend-entitled shares exist."
"This would result in a dividend 
payment of € 125 million."
"The plan is operated on a quarterly basis, with each calendar quarter referred to as an ‘investment 
quarter.’ 
The plan enables employees to purchase adidas AG shares with a 15% discount (‘investment shares’) and 
to benefit from free matching shares."
"Currently, eligible employees of adidas AG and 17 other subsidiaries 
can participate in the plan."
"Up to two weeks before the start of an investment quarter, each eligible 
employee can enroll for the plan."
"The company accepts enrollment requests on the first day of the relevant 
investment quarter."
This is the grant date for the investment and matching shares.
"The fair value at the 
vesting date is equivalent to the fair value of the granted equity instruments at this date."
"The employees 
invest an amount up to 10% of their gross base salary per quarter in the plan."
"A few days after the end of 
the investment quarter, the shares are purchased on the market at fair market value and transferred to 
the employees."
Thereby the amount invested during the quarter plus the top-up from adidas is used.
These shares can be sold at any time by the employee.
"If the shares are held for a period of one year after 
the last day of an investment quarter, employees will receive, as a one-off, free matching shares (one 
matching share for every six adidas AG shares acquired)."
"This plan currently constitutes an equity-settled 
share-based payment for both elements."
"For the component of the matching shares relating to the 
specific period of service an appropriate discount is taken into account."

in the stock purchase plan and was not yet transferred into shares by the end of December 2023."
"► SEE NOTE 25 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties 
In 2023, adidas entered into a promotion and advertising contract that includes a share-based payment 
transaction with third parties."
The contract has a term of up to five years.
"The agreement grants a transfer 
of shares, which correspond up to a value of US $ 26 million."
"In 2023, no transfer of shares took place."
The expenses for shares are recognized over the vesting period of five years.
"In 2023, this amounts to a 
provision of € 7 million."
"Equity-settled share-based payment for Executive Board members 
In 2018, adidas established a ‘Long-Term Incentive Plan’ (‘LTIP’) for Executive Board members."
"The LTIP 2021/2025 pursues the goal of aligning the long-term performance-based variable remuneration 
of the Executive Board with the performance of the company and thus with the interests of the 
shareholders."
"Against this background, the LTIP 2021/2025 is share-based."
"It consists of five annual 
tranches (2021 to 2025), each with a term of five years."
"Each of the five annual tranches consists of a 
performance year and a subsequent four-year holding period."
"For the 2021/2025 LTIP, the Supervisory 
Board has set financial and ESG-related performance criteria for each of the five performance years."
"The annual LTIP tranche (‘Grant Amount’) is paid to the Executive Board members after approval of the 
consolidated financial statements and is to be fully invested by the Executive Board members in the 
acquisition of adidas AG shares."
"The shares acquired are subject to a holding period, which ends at the end 
of the fourth financial year following the performance year."
"Only after the end of the holding period can the 
Executive Board members dispose of the shares."
"As of December 31, 2023, the total number of adidas AG shares acquired since 2019 as part of the variable 
performance-based compensation and subject to a holding period amounts to 57,247 no-par-value shares 
(2022: 78,698 no-par-value shares acquired since 2018)."

Cash-settled share-based payment transactions with employees 
In 2017, adidas implemented a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration 
scheme with cash settlement."
"‘RSUs’ (‘Restricted Stock Units’) are granted on the condition that the 
beneficiary is employed for three or four years by adidas AG or one of its subsidiaries in a position where 
they are not under notice during that period."
"This minimum period of employment pertains to the calendar 
year in which the RSUs are granted and the three subsequent calendar years."
"As an exception in 2022 and 
2023, RSUs were granted with a minimum term of employment of one and two years, respectively."
"Furthermore, social security contributions are considered in the calculation of the fair 
value, if appropriate for the respective country regulations and the seniority of the participants."
"All 
changes to the subsequent measurement of this provision are reported under personnel expenses."
"Once a year, one tranche with a three-year term and another with a four-year term are issued."
"The 
number of RSUs granted depends on the seniority of the beneficiaries."
"In addition, for the four-year plan, 
the number of RSUs also depends on the achievement of a financial and ESG-related target."
"In addition, in 
2022 and 2023, the option to issue two additional tranches with a two-year and a one-year maturity was 
exercised."
"The value of one RSU is the average price of the adidas AG share as quoted for the first 20 stock exchange 
trading days in January of the respective financial year."
"In 2023, this resulted in an expense of € 59 million (2022: € 36 million)."
"The corresponding provision 
amounted to € 80 million (2022: € 57 million)."

Financial risks 
Currency risks 
Currency risks, to which adidas is particularly exposed, are a direct result of multi-currency cash flows 
within the company."
"The vast majority of the transactional risk arises from product sourcing in US dollars, 
while sales are typically denominated in the functional currency of the respective companies."
"The 
currencies in which these transactions are mainly denominated are the US dollar, British pound, Japanese 
yen, and Chinese renminbi."
"As governed by the company’s Treasury Policy, adidas has established a hedging system on a rolling basis 
up to 24 months in advance, under which the vast majority of the anticipated seasonal hedging volume is 
secured approximately six months prior to the start of a season."
"In rare instances, hedges are contracted 
beyond the 24-month horizon."
"These contracts 
are generally designated as cash flow hedges."
"Furthermore, translation impacts from the conversion of non-euro-denominated results into the 
company’s functional currency, the euro, might lead to a material negative impact on the company’s 
financial performance."
Further information about the accounting and hedge accounting treatment is included in these Notes.
"In line with IFRS 7 requirements, the company has calculated the impact on net income and shareholders’ 
equity based on changes in the most important currency exchange rates."
"The calculated impacts mainly 
result from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments."
"The analysis does not include effects that 
arise from the translation of the company’s foreign entities’ financial statements into the company’s 
reporting currency, the euro."
"The sensitivity analysis is based on the net balance sheet exposure, including 
intercompany balances from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies."
"Moreover, 
all outstanding currency derivatives were re-evaluated using hypothetical foreign exchange rates to 
determine the effects on net income and equity."
"Based on this analysis, a 10% increase in the euro versus the US dollar at December 31, 2023, would have 
led to a € 17 million increase in net income."
"A 10% weaker euro at December 31, 2023, would have led to a € 20 million decrease in net 
income."
Shareholders’ equity would have increased by € 263 million.
"The impacts of fluctuations of the 
euro against the British pound, the Japanese yen, and the Chinese renminbi on net income and 
shareholders’ equity are also included in accordance with IFRS requirements."
"However, many other financial and operational variables that could potentially reduce the effect of 
currency fluctuations are excluded from the analysis."
"For instance: 
─ Interest rates, commodity prices, and all other exchange rates are assumed constant."
"─ Exchange rates are assumed at a year-end value instead of the more relevant sales-weighted average 
figure, which the company utilizes internally to better reflect both the seasonality of its business and 
intra-year currency fluctuations."
"─ The underlying forecast cash flow exposure (which the hedge instrument mainly relates to) is not 
required to be revalued in this analysis."
"─ Operational aspects, such as potential discounts for key accounts, which have high transparency 
regarding the impacts of currency on our sourcing activities (due to their own private label sourcing 
efforts), are also excluded from this analysis."
─ The credit risk is not considered as part of this analysis.
The company also largely hedges balance sheet risks.
"Due to its strong global position, adidas is able to 
partly minimize the currency risk by utilizing natural hedges."
"The company’s gross US dollar cash flow 
exposure calculated for 2023 was around € 4.1 billion at year-end 2023, which was hedged using forward 
exchange contracts, currency options, and currency swaps."
"adidas is exposed to credit risks from its operating activities and from certain 
financing activities."
"Credit risks arise principally from accounts receivable and, to a lesser extent, from 
other third-party contractual financial obligations such as other financial assets, short-term bank 
deposits, and derivative financial instruments."
"Without taking into account any collateral or other credit 
enhancements, the carrying amount of financial assets and accounts receivable represents the maximum 
exposure to credit risk."
"At the end of 2023, there was no relevant concentration of credit risk by type of customer or geography."
The company’s credit risk exposure is mainly influenced by individual customer characteristics.
"Under the 
company’s credit policy, new customers are analyzed for creditworthiness before standard payment and 
delivery terms and conditions are offered."
"Tolerance limits for accounts receivable are also established for 
each customer."
Both creditworthiness and accounts receivable limits are monitored on an ongoing basis.
"Customers that fail to meet the company’s minimum creditworthiness are, in general, allowed to purchase 
products only on a prepayment basis."
"Other activities to mitigate credit risks include retention of title clauses as well as, on a selective basis, 
credit insurance, the sale of accounts receivable without recourse, and bank guarantees."
"Further 
quantitative information on the extent to which credit enhancements mitigate the credit risk of accounts 
receivable is included in these Notes."
"► SEE NOTE 05 
At the end of 2023, no customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable."
"The Treasury department arranges currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity hedges, and invests 
cash with major banks of a high credit standing throughout the world."
"adidas subsidiaries are authorized 
to work with banks rated BBB+ or higher."
"Only in exceptional cases are subsidiaries authorized to work 
with banks rated lower than BBB+."
"To limit risk in these cases, restrictions are clearly stipulated, such as 
maximum cash deposit levels."
"In addition, the credit default swap premiums of the company’s partner 
banks are monitored on a monthly basis."
"In the event that the defined threshold is exceeded, credit 
balances are shifted to banks compliant with the limit."
"adidas furthermore believes that the risk concentration is limited due to the broad distribution of the 
investment business of the company with a high number of globally operating banks."
"At December 31, 
2023, no bank accounted for more than 10% of the investments of adidas."
"Including subsidiaries’ short-
term deposits in local banks, the average concentration was 2%."
"This leads to a maximum exposure of 
€ 91 million in the event of default of any single bank."
"The investment exposure was further diversified by 
investing into AAA-rated money market funds."
"In addition, in 2023, adidas held derivatives of foreign exchange with a positive fair market value in the 
amount of € 90 million."
"The maximum exposure to any single bank resulting from these assets amounted 
to € 28 million and the average concentration was 8%."
"In accordance with IFRS 7, the following table includes further information about set-off possibilities of 
derivative financial assets and liabilities."
"The majority of agreements between financial institutions and 
adidas include a mutual right to set off."
"However, these agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting 
in the statement of financial position, because the right to set off is enforceable only in the event of 
counterparty defaults."
"As 
adidas does not have material variable-interest liabilities, even a significant increase in interest rates 
should have only slight adverse effects on the company’s profitability, liquidity, and financial position."
"To reduce interest rate risks and maintain financial flexibility, a core tenet of the company’s financial 
strategy is to continue to use surplus cash flow from operations to reduce short-term gross borrowings."
"Beyond that, adidas may consider adequate hedging strategies through interest rate derivatives in order to 
mitigate interest rate risks."
"Share price risks 
Share price risks arise due to the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which is a share-based remuneration 
scheme with cash settlement."
"In order to mitigate share price risks, it is company strategy to hedge 
against share price fluctuations."
"Swaps are used to hedge the Long-Term Incentive Plan and are classified 
as cash flow hedges."
"In line with IFRS 7 requirements, adidas has calculated the impact on net income based on changes in the 
company’s share price."
"In addition, the company faces the risk of having to 
accept unfavorable financing terms due to liquidity restraints."
"The Treasury department uses an efficient 
cash management system in order to make best use of the operating cash flow."
"A twelve-month rolling 
cash flow forecast on a monthly basis is established to manage liquidity risk."
"In line with the Financial 
Policy, adidas aims to maintain a target leverage ratio and a target twelve months liquidity coverage."
Committed and uncommitted credit lines ensure further financial flexibility.
"Overall, adidas’ investment 
grade credit ratings ensure an efficient access to capital markets."
"At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents together with marketable securities amounted to 
€ 1.465 billion (2022: € 0.798 billion)."
"Moreover, the company maintains € 3.648 billion 
(2022: € 4.090 billion) in bilateral credit lines, which are designed to ensure sufficient liquidity at all times."
"Thereof, € 1.864 billion has been firmly committed since December 2023 as part of a syndicated credit 
facility with our core banks."
"Future cash outflows arising from financial liabilities that are recognized in the consolidated statement of 
financial position are presented in the table."
"This includes payments to settle obligations from borrowings as well as cash outflows from cash-settled 
derivatives with negative market values."
"Financial liabilities that may be settled in advance without penalty 
are included on the basis of the earliest date of potential repayment."
"Cash flows for variable-interest 
liabilities are determined with reference to the conditions at the balance sheet date."
2 Accrued interest excluded.
adidas ended the year 2023 with an adjusted net borrowings of € 4.518 billion (2022: € 6.047 billion).
Further information in the methodology for calculating adjusted net borrowings is provided in these Notes.
"In accordance with IFRS 9, hedge accounting was immediately 
discontinued for hedging instruments that were no longer covered by a purchase or sales transaction, and, 
at the time the over-hedged status was determined, the fair value was transferred from the hedging 
reserve to the income statement."
"In 2023, a gain of € 9 million was reclassified into the net sales and a 
loss of € 7 million was reclassified into the cost of sales."
"In addition, hedging instruments not designated as hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 were 
canceled to minimize the economic risk."

The municipal trade tax is approximately 11.4% of taxable income.
"For non-German subsidiaries, deferred taxes are calculated based on tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the closing date."

"adidas does not recognize deferred tax liabilities for unremitted earnings of non-German subsidiaries to 
the extent that they are expected to be permanently invested in international operations."

The group is within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules (Global Minimum Tax).
"Pillar Two 
legislation was enacted in Germany, the jurisdiction in which the company is incorporated, and will come 
into effect from January 1, 2024."
"Since the Pillar Two legislation was not effective at the reporting date, the 
group has no related current tax exposure."
"The group applies the exception to recognizing and disclosing 
information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes, as provided in the 
amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023."
"Under the legislation, the group is liable to pay a top-up tax for the difference between its Global Anti-Base 
Erosion (GloBE) effective tax rate per jurisdiction and the 15% minimum rate."
"The vast majority of entities 
within the group have an effective tax rate that exceeds 15%, with material exceptions for subsidiaries in 
the United Arab Emirates, Hongkong and Switzerland."
The group is in the process of assessing the impact of the Pillar Two legislation.
"Based on prior years and 
the accounting profit for the financial year 2023, this assessment process results in an additional expected 
tax exposure in a low two digit € million range."
"The group might not be exposed to paying Pillar Two 
income taxes in relation to most jurisdictions."
"This is due to the impact of specific adjustments envisaged 
in the Pillar Two legislation which give rise to different effective tax rates compared to those calculated in 
accordance with paragraph 86 of IAS 12."
"Due to the complexities in applying the legislation and calculating GloBE income, the quantitative impact of 
the enacted or substantively enacted legislation is not yet reasonably estimable."

believes that the complaint will not have any material influence on the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the company."

Supervisory Board 
Pursuant to the Articles of Association of adidas AG, the Supervisory Board members’ total annual

Members of the Supervisory Board were not granted any loans or advance payments in 2023.
"► SEE NOTE 39 
Executive Board 
In 2023, the total compensation of the members of the Executive Board amounted to € 40.3 million 
(2022:  € 22.0 million), € 12.3 million thereof related to short-term benefits (2022: € 6.5 million)."
"The short-
term benefits comprise the one-year Performance Bonus, the performance criteria of which include 
currency neutral sales growth, operating margin and individual performance criteria."
"For share-based 
payments, expenses amounting to € 11.3 million (2022: € 4.7 million) were recognized in the 2023 financial 
year."
"Of the total compensation, an overall amount of € 15.5 million is attributable to severance payments, 
settlement payments and amounts for non-competition clauses."
"In the previous year, no share-based 
payments were granted."
"Post-employment benefits (costs for accrued pension entitlements for members

present value of the pension commitments for members of the Executive Board in office during the

"As of December 31, 2023, there are provisions for short-term variable compensation components for 
members of the Executive Board amounting to € 4.5 million."
"There were no provisions in the 2022 financial 
year."
The current members of the Executive Board were not granted any loans or advance payments in 2023.
"Total compensation of the members of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board pursuant to §314 (1) in conjunction 
with §315e HGB 
The total compensation of the members of the Executive Board in the 2023 financial year amounted to 
€ 23.8 million (2022: € 6.5 million)."
"Thereof, € 10.9 million (2022: € 6.5 million) related to short-term 
benefits."
"Moreover, Executive Board members appointed after January 1, 2021, are not granted benefits 
under the company pension scheme."
"Instead, they receive a so-called pension allowance in the form of an 
adequate lump-sum amount, which is directly paid out to the Executive Board members annually."
"In this 
context, Bjørn Gulden received € 1.1 million and Arthur Hoeld € 0.3 million in the 2023 financial year."
"For 
the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board was granted an LTIP bonus amounting to € 7.6 million."
"In 2022 
no LTIP bonus was granted."
"Any LTIP Bonus granted must be invested in full in the acquisition of adidas 
AG shares after deduction of taxes and social security contributions."
"These shares are subject to a lock-up 
period which ends upon expiry of the fourth financial year after the performance year."
"The LTIP payout 
amount is considered earned only after expiry of the lock-up period and only then can the Executive Board 
members dispose of the shares at their own discretion."
"By contrast, the amount deducted for income tax 
and social security contributions is already fully earned at the time of payout following the adoption of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Supervisory Board."
"Moreover, Bjørn Gulden was granted 11,886 
adidas AG shares as reimbursement for the variable compensation forfeited at his former employer which 
are subject to a four-year lock-up period."
"The gross amount to be matched by the company in this regard 
was € 3.9 million."
"The increase of total compensation in comparison to the previous year is mainly 
attributable to the fact that the Executive Board members were neither granted a Performance Bonus nor 
an LTIP Bonus in 2022."
"The total annual compensation to be paid to the members of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the 
Articles of Association of adidas AG, including attendance fees, totaled € 2.8 million (2022: € 2.8 million)."
"Former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents received a total of € 21.9 million 
in benefits in the 2023 financial year (2022: € 16.7 million)."
"There are pension commitments towards former Executive Board 
members who resigned after December 31, 2005, which are covered by a pension fund or a pension fund in 
combination with a reinsured pension trust fund."
"From this, indirect obligations amounting to 
€ 38.1 million (prior year: € 35.0 million) arise for which no provisions were created due to financing 
through the pension fund and pension trust fund."
"Provisions for pension entitlements have been created 
for two former members of the Executive Board who resigned on or after December 31, 2019, in an 
amount of € 3.4 million (2022: 3.1 million)."

Events after the balance sheet date 
At the start of the 2024 financial year, the Group's internal reporting structure was adjusted for 
management purposes."
"Since January 1, 2024, the EMEA market has been divided into two separate markets, Europe and 
Emerging Markets."
"Russia is allocated to the ‘other businesses’ as it is no longer monitored separately by 
the chief operating decision-makers due to the discontinuation of business activities."
"In addition, the Asia-
Pacific market has been split into two separate markets, Japan and South Korea, and Southeast Asia and 
Pacific have been merged with the new Emerging Markets market."
"The North America, Latin America and 
China markets remain unchanged."
"Due to the small size of the two operating segments Japan and South Korea, they are 
combined for external segment reporting as Japan/South Korea."
"Due to the change in the operating segments and the associated groups of cash-generating units, both a 
reallocation of goodwill and an impairment test of goodwill were carried out as at January 1, 2024."
"There 
was no need for impairment in this context."
"No other company-specific subsequent events are known that might have a material influence on the 
assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of the company."

the consolidated financial statements and give their approval."

"In addition, we have audited the group management report of 
adidas AG, which is combined with the Company’s management report, for the financial year from  
1 January to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited 
the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the “Other Information” section of our 
auditor’s report."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
─ the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 
315e Abs."
"In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion on the group management report 
does not cover the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the “Other 
Information” section of our auditor’s report."
Pursuant to § [Article] 322 Abs.
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code], 
we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as  
“EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and 
standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report."
"We are 
independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German 
commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit 
Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the 
EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these 
matters."
"In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows: 
1."
"Recoverability of inventories 
2."
"Recognition of revenue, taking into account expected returns 
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows: 
1."
"Audit approach and findings  
3."
"Reference to further information 
Hereinafter we present the key audit matters: 
1."
"Recoverability of inventories 
1."
"In the Company's consolidated statement of financial position, inventories amounting to  
EUR 4,525 million (25% of total assets) are reported."
"Inventories are initially recognized at cost, taking into account directly attributable incidental acquisition 
costs and cost reductions."
"The carrying amount of recognized inventories must be reduced if the 
inventories are damaged or (partially) obsolete and the expected net realizable values are less than the 
costs."
"At the balance sheet date, the costs are compared against the net realizable values, which are 
determined by deducting the directly attributable selling costs to be incurred prior to sale of the 
inventories from the sales proceeds expected to be generated."
"In particular, the age (seasonality) of the inventories and the 
selected sales channel to be used in future sales are significant."
"The impairment test resulted in a 
write-down on inventories as of the balance sheet date amounting to EUR 317 million in total."
"The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive 
directors with respect to the inputs for the future net realizable values and other factors having an 
influence on value, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty."
"Against this background and 
due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of 
our audit."
"As part of our audit, we analyzed among other things the impairment testing process and assessed 
identified controls with respect to implementation, appropriateness and operating effectiveness."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the key inputs used to calculate net realizable values based on historical 
data and our understanding of the business."
"We verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation 
logic used in the impairment test."
"We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors 
in connection with the appropriate measurement of inventories were sufficiently substantiated and 
documented."
"The Company’s disclosures relating to the accounting policies applied with respect to the ""inventories"" 
line item are contained in section 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements ""Summary of 
significant accounting policies""."
"In addition, the disclosures on ""inventories"" are contained in section 7, 
""Inventories""."
"Recognition of revenue, taking into account expected returns 
1."
"In the Company's consolidated financial statements, revenues amounting to EUR 21,427 million are 
reported."
"Revenue is recognized from the sale of goods in the ""Wholesale"", ""E-commerce"" and ""Own retail"" sales 
channels if the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a specified asset to a 
customer."
An asset is deemed to have been transferred if the customer obtains control of that asset.
"Revenue is recognized in the amount to which the Company has a claim when the power to control an 
asset is transferred."
"Customers of the Company have the option, subject to certain conditions, of exchanging or returning 
goods in exchange for a credit."
"The amounts regarding expected returns are estimated by the executive 
directors based on experiences with regard to historic return rates and accrued for a return provision 
against revenues."
"The asset embodying the right to receive goods returned by the customer is measured at the carrying 
amount of the respective inventories less settlement costs."
"The revenues have a significant influence on the Group's net profit or loss for the year and represent 
one of the most significant performance indicators for adidas."
"In addition, we examined the presentation of revenue recognition in the Group-wide 
accounting policy to assess whether it complied with IFRS 15."
"In addition, we evaluated the mathematical correctness of the executive directors' 
calculation of expected returns."
"We compared the expected returns against historical, sales channel-
specific return rates and the returned merchandise recorded in the financial accounting records."
"We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors 
in connection with the appropriate accounting treatment of the revenue were sufficiently substantiated 
and documented."

"1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, 
and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based 
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."

management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."

business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
"─ Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, 
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"─ Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the 
group management report."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the 
assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ 
materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal 
control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters."

performed for the reasonable assurance engagement part, and accordingly a substantially lower level of 
assurance is obtained."
"The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgement
