"Over the past 
year, no one has been immune to inflation’s corrosive effects on 
savings and the affordability of goods."
"The monetary policies that 
were taken to mitigate inflation now appear to have arrested its 
trajectory, but present manifold challenges both for businesses and 
consumers."
"Throughout a period in which our customers and partners experienced 
significant increases in their cost of living and challenges in sustaining 
their businesses, we maintained our focus on delivering the greatest 
possible value to them through our customer service and product 
offerings."
"For our shareholders, we steered our business model and 
managed our capital position to overcome inflationary challenges, 
ultimately contributing to a record performance."
"Our ability to 
manage inflation in all its forms is proving to be a distinct competitive 
advantage for Allianz."
"We have successfully consolidated our leading position as one of the 
largest global insurers and active asset managers, one that is able to 
leverage its scale, global reach, and diversified business model to 
address the financial and protection needs of more people around the 
world."
"At the end of the 2023, our share price reached a 20-year high, 
our total business volume increased by 5.5 % to € 162 bn, and our 
operating profit reached another record level, rising by 6.7 % to 
€ 14.7 bn."
"Our Property-Casualty segment grew strongly by 8.4 % to almost 
€ 77 bn in total business volume."
"The operating profit topped € 6.9 bn 
for the first time, despite another year that was marked by increased 
claims resulting from more frequent and severe natural catastrophes."
"This clearly confirms our healthy underlying profitability and 
underwriting expertise."
"Our Life/Health segment demonstrated robust growth, with the value 
of new business increasing by 2.2 % to € 4.0 bn as we developed 
attractive solutions to protect our customers from the effects of 
inflation on their savings."
"The operating profit of € 5.2 bn was strong, 
making the Life/Health segment a resilient contributor to our earnings 
power."
"Our Asset Management segment proved resilient managing through 
a volatile environment to deliver an operating profit of € 3.1 bn."
"We 
recorded third-party net inflows of € 21.5 bn – a signal of active 
investors’ readiness to invest in the market through us – and we 
achieved growth in third-party assets under management to € 1.7 tn."
"Together with our continued strong investment outperformance, this 
bodes well for further improvements in growth and profitability."
"Our shareholders benefited from an outstanding total return of 27 % 
for the year, outperforming the European insurance sector, our direct 
peers, and the broader European stock market."
"This performance is 
backed by our financial strength and affirmed by the leading financial 
rating agencies which place Allianz in the top of our category, at 
AA (S&P Global), Aa2 (Moody’s) and A+ (AM Best) respectively, and 
fully in line with our ratings objectives."
"Looking ahead, we will focus on 
unlocking the benefits of our scale, further increasing our productivity, 
and translating excellent customer experience into profitable 
customer growth."
"Allianz is the world’s 
leading insurance and asset management brand for the fifth time in a 
row according to Interbrand’s 2023 Best Global Brands ranking, with 
our brand value exceeding USD 20 bn for the first time."
"In addition, in 
an increasingly polarized world, Allianz remains the most trusted 
insurance brand among our peer set across all stakeholder groups, 
according to Edelman Trust Intelligence data."
"We embrace our 
societal responsibility and leverage our strength, stability, and skills to 
address the root causes of polarization and secure the future of those 
who put their trust in us."
"Our customers value the care and service we provide in their moments 
of greatest need."
"We evaluate our business performance based on the 
experience of our customers, as their satisfaction and loyalty are 
among the most important drivers of our growth."
"Our latest Net 
Promoter Score® results, which measure our customers’ loyalty through 
customers’ willingness to recommend Allianz, show that three-quarters 
of our operating entities outperformed their peers, a remarkable jump 
of 11 percentage points from last year."
"And we are also proud that 
59 % of our operating entities have achieved the distinction of Loyalty 
Leadership status, which is a leading indicator for our future market 
expansion."
"Our success would be impossible without our engaged and healthy 
workforce."
"In addition, our 
employee share ownership reached 70 %, which is a remarkable 
expression of our people’s confidence in our organization."
"Our industry 
leadership in diversity reflects the strength of our workforce and its 
preparedness for the future, and this talent advantage is recognized 
by the global Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index 2023, which ranked 
Allianz first in the insurance category for the 5th consecutive year."
"However, our efforts to ensure resilience and to protect what is most 
valuable to our customers exceed our organization and touch on 
society at large."
"As we look ahead, our corporate health and resilience are 
foundational to our ability to deliver strong results and returns amid 
even the most challenging environments – especially in the 
increasingly polarized world we live in today."
"We are well-prepared to 
lead in this context, drawing on the principles of sustainability, 
strength, and inclusion at which Allianz has excelled since our founding 
134 years ago."
"Our company and our purpose are as relevant and 
important today as they have ever been, and we will not shy away 
from this calling."
"On behalf of our management team and our employees, I thank you 
for your trust in the Allianz Group and look forward to earning your 
continued support in the year ahead."

"Pursuant to § 17 (2) SEAG, the share of women and men among 
the members of the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE has to be at least 
30 % each."
"The Supervisory Board fulfills this requirement as it includes 
five women (41.7 %) and seven men (58.3 %)."
"Pursuant to § 16 (2) SEAG, it has to be ensured that the Board of 
Management includes at least one female and at least one male 
member when appointing members to the Board of Management."
"This statutory requirement is met by the current Board of Management 
of Allianz SE."
"As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women on 
the Board of Management was 33.3 %."
"Since 1 January 2024, the 
proportion of women on the Board of Management has been 44.4 %."
"With regard to the proportion of women on the first and second 
management levels below the Board of Management, the Board of 
Management has set targets of 30 % for each, to be met by 
31 December 2024."
"As at 31 December 2023, this target was already 
met for the first management level with a percentage of women of 
34.2 %, but was not yet met for the second level with a percentage of 
28.6 %."
"Eight of the eleven subsidiaries 
reached this target ahead of the due date as at 31 December 2023."
"The target quotas for the respective Boards of Management of 
the subsidiaries concerned were between 25 % and 50 % (35.7 % on 
average) for 31 December 2024 and were already met by eight of the 
eleven companies as of 31 December 2023."
"Due to internal restructurings, one of the eleven 
subsidiaries no longer has any employees below the level of the Board 
of Management."
"Therefore, reference will only be made to ten 
subsidiaries in the following paragraph."
"As at 31 December 2023, the targets were met by four of the ten 
subsidiaries concerned for the first management level, while two of the 
ten companies met the target set for the second management level 
ahead of the due date."
"Despite increased efforts to promote women 
in the Allianz Group and in the individual subsidiaries, it was not 
possible to reach the targets ahead of the due date in the other cases 
as it was not always possible to identify suitable female candidates for 
all vacant positions."
Allianz continues to work to achieve these targets.

Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
The Remuneration Report describes the structure and arrangements 
of the remuneration system for the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board of Allianz SE."
"It explains the application of the 
remuneration system in the 2023 financial year, using detailed and 
individualized specifications on the remuneration of current and 
former members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board."
"The report was jointly created by the Board of Management and 
the Supervisory Board, taking into consideration the requirements of 
§ 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), and the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in its 
currently valid version."
"It was also decided to allow the auditor to carry out a 
comprehensive, content audit of the Remuneration Report going 
above and beyond the legal requirements of § 162 (3) AktG."
"The remuneration year of 2023 at a 
glance 
The economic and geopolitical environment  
In the first half of the year in particular, 2023 was characterized by 
the continued dynamic inflation trend in many leading economies."
"Only in the second half of the year was a slow normalization of 
inflation rates achieved thanks to rapid interest rate hikes by central 
banks."
"The economic impact of high inflation and restrictive 
monetary policy was also evident on the international capital 
markets."
"In addition to high claims inflation, the insurance industry 
and asset management therefore also had to successfully navigate a 
very volatile investment environment."
"Natural disasters, such as the 
earthquake in Türkiye and Syria as well as thunderstorms in Germany, 
also posed major challenges for our industry in 2023."
"The ongoing 
war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East contributed to the 
challenging geopolitical and economic environment."
"The Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee closely monitored 
business developments, particularly with regard to potential target 
achievement at Group level and individual remuneration targets at 
the half-year and year-end 2023."
"In addition to the financial targets, 
the non-financial targets and target achievement for 2023 were also 
discussed intensively, and changes to the Management Board were 
prepared and implemented."
"Group financial targets 
The annual bonus and the long-term incentive (LTI) allocation are 
based on two Group financial targets for the relevant financial year: 
operating profit and net income attributable to shareholders, each at 
50 %."
"The operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was exceeded to 
€ 14.75 bn, as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Corporate and 
Other business segments achieved growth in operating profit and 
more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset 
Management business segment."
"This resulted in a target 
achievement of 107.69 % for the operating profit."
"The transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share 
of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance 
sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus 
significantly higher volatility of the net income in combination with 
fewer steering options."
"For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in 
order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of 
Management cannot control in either direction."
"For this purpose, 
100 % target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward 
or downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn."
"Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn 
in the past financial year and was therefore within the target range 
of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target achievement of 100.00 %."
"Overall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group's 
financial targets of 103.85 %."

Board of Management performance in 2023 
In the financial year under review, the Board of Management faced 
unprecedented challenges requiring a team effort."
"In addition to the 
geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges, the Board of 
Management had to meet supervisory requirements and adopt 
decisions to implement the digital future."
"These topics had to be 
jointly addressed by the entire Board of Management across the 
divisional areas of responsibility."
"The members of the Board of 
Management also successfully handled the additional tasks arising 
from the streamlining effected in the financial year under review."
"This 
applies in particular to the business activities in Spain, Portugal and 
Latin America, Allianz X, and the implementation of IT verticalization 
and business model transformation."
"As a result, the Board of Management achieved a record result 
in terms of operating profit and net income, despite a massive 
adverse impact resulting from natural disasters, high inflation, and 
rapidly rising interest rates."
"This strong overall performance was 
achieved on a sustainable basis: Customer satisfaction at Allianz 
once again reached top scores."
"The proportion of local business 
segments considered as market leaders in terms of customer 
satisfaction as measured by the digital Net Promoter Score (dNPS), 
for example, grew to 59 %."
"Employee testimonials were also very 
positive."
"The Inclusive Meritocracy Index and Work Well Index Plus, 
which are used to measure employee satisfaction, rose to new record 
levels of 81 % and 76 %, respectively, bucking a negative trend in the 
industry."
"In addition, the Board of Management also met its 
ambitious environmental targets."
"Examples include CO2 emissions 
per employee, which were reduced by 62 % versus the baseline year 
2019 and were thus further reduced compared to the previous year  
(-57 %) despite a normalization of travel behavior after the end of the 
COVID-19 pandemic."
"Individual performance by the individual members of the Board of 
Management is described in detail below."
"Potential application of malus and clawback 
In the financial year, there was no reason to reduce the payment of 
variable remuneration (malus) or to reclaim variable remuneration 
already paid out (clawback)."
"Approval of remuneration system and 
Remuneration Report 
The system for the remuneration of members of the Board of 
Management was approved by the Annual General Meeting on 
5 May 2021 with a majority vote of 87.14 %."
"The remuneration system 
applies to all members of the Board of Management who were in 
office in the 2023 financial year."
"The Remuneration Report for 2022 was approved at the Annual 
General Meeting on 4 May 2023 with a majority vote of 82.94 %."
"Overall, the remuneration system and the Remuneration Report 
are strongly supported by investors and proxy advisors."
"Changes to the composition of the Board of 
Management 
Giulio Terzariol was released from his mandate as a member of the 
Board of Management on 31 December 2023 so that he can pursue 
a career opportunity outside the company in his home country."
"Claire-Marie Coste-Lepoutre took over from Giulio Terzariol on 
1 January 2024 and has been working with Mr. Terzariol on a 
seamless handover of his responsibilities."
"The aim is to 
ensure and promote sustainable and value-oriented management of 
the company that is in line with our corporate strategy."
"The key 
principles are as follows: 
− 
Support of the Group’s strategy: The design of variable 
compensation, and in particular of performance targets, reflects 
the business strategy and sustainable long-term development of 
the Allianz Group."
"− 
Alignment of pay and performance: The performance-based 
variable component of the remuneration of members of the Board 
of Management forms a significant portion of the overall 
remuneration, corresponding to 70 % of the target compensation."
"− 
Sustainability of performance and alignment with shareholder 
interests: A major part of the variable remuneration reflects 
longer-term performance, with deferred payout (64 %), and is 
linked to the absolute and relative performance of the Allianz 
share price."
"The Board of Management’s remuneration is decided upon by the  
entire Supervisory Board, based on proposals prepared by the 
Supervisory Board’s Personnel Committee."
"If required, the Supervisory 
Board may seek outside advice from independent external 
consultants."
"The Personnel Committee and the Supervisory Board 
consult with the Chairperson of the Board of Management in 
assessing the performance and remuneration of Board of 
Management members."
"The Chairperson of the Board of 
Management is generally not involved in discussion about their own 
remuneration."
"The Supervisory Board designs the remuneration system 
for the members of the Board of Management in accordance with the 
requirements of the AktG in its currently valid version, as well as with 
regulatory requirements and the recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
Clarity and comprehensibility are ensured at all times.
"Feedback 
from investors is also considered."
"Based on the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board determines 
the 
target 
total 
compensation 
and 
regularly 
reviews 
the 
appropriateness of the remuneration."
"This is based on both a 
horizontal comparison (i.e., with peer companies) and a vertical 
comparison (in relation to Allianz employees)."
"Again, the Supervisory 
Board’s Personnel Committee develops respective recommendations, 
if necessary with the assistance of external consultants."
"The structure, weighting, and level of each remuneration 
component should be adequate and appropriate."
"As part of the review in 2022 of the appropriateness of the 
remuneration of the Board of Management, a need to adjust the level 
of remuneration for the Board members at Allianz SE was identified 
for 2023 and going forward."
"In addition, the reduction of the entire Board of 
Management to nine members and the associated redistribution of 
tasks led to an increase in the workload for the remaining Board 
members."
"For these reasons, the Supervisory Board deemed an 
increase in the annual target remuneration of 5 % for all Board 
members to be appropriate."
"The exact amounts can be found in the 
graph relating to the overview of the structure of the target 
remuneration."
"Vertical appropriateness 
This comparison is based on the total direct remuneration of a member 
of the Board of Management and the average direct remuneration of 
an employee of the German Allianz companies."
"The Supervisory 
Board’s decision in December is based on the factor resulting from this 
comparison for the previous financial year."
"For the 2022 financial year, 
the factor for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an 
employee was “65” and the factor for a regular Board member to an 
employee was “37”."
"For the 2023 financial year, the respective factor 
for the Chairperson of the Board of Management to an employee is 
“68” and the factor regular board member to employee is “36”."

Fixed remuneration 
The fixed remuneration components comprise the base salary, 
perquisites, and pension contributions."
"These components provide 
competitive remuneration to attract and retain Board of Management 
members with experience and skills that enable them to develop and 
successfully implement the Allianz Group’s strategy."
"They secure a 
reasonable level of income in line with market conditions and promote 
a company management that is commensurate with risk."
"Base salary 
The base salary, which is not performance-related, is paid in twelve 
equal monthly installments."
"Perquisites 
Perquisites mainly consist of contributions to accident and liability 
insurances, tax consultant fees, and the provision of a company car 
and further individual perquisites if applicable."
"Perquisites are not 
linked to performance."
"Each member of the Board of Management is 
responsible for paying the income tax due on these perquisites."
"The 
Supervisory Board regularly reviews the level of perquisites; a 
contractual annual cap applies."
"If an appointment to the Board of 
Management requires a change of residence, relocation expenses are 
reimbursed to an appropriate extent."
"Pension contribution 
To provide competitive and cost-effective retirement and disability 
benefits, company contributions to the defined-contribution pension 
plan “My Allianz Pension” are invested with a guarantee for the 
contributions paid but no further interest guarantee."
"Each year, the Supervisory Board decides whether a budget is 
provided and, if so, to what extent."
"The current pension contribution 
generally represents 15 % of the target remuneration of the Board 
members."
"Apart from cases of occupational or general disability for medical 
reasons, the earliest age a pension can be drawn is 62."
"Should Board 
membership cease before the retirement age is reached, accrued 
pension rights are maintained if vesting requirements are met."
"Members of the Board of Management may have additional 
pension entitlements under former pension plans based on previous 
positions in the Allianz Group or due to membership of the Board of 
Management prior to 2015."
"Payments of social insurance 
contributions abroad required by Allianz in individual cases may also 
give rise to additional pension entitlements."
"Performance-based remuneration 
The performance-based variable remuneration includes the short-
term annual bonus and long-term share-based remuneration."
"This 
composition aims to balance short-term performance, longer-term 
success, and sustained value creation."
"The Supervisory Board ensures 
that the variable remuneration targets are challenging, sustainable, 
and ambitious."
"Annual bonus 
The annual bonus provides incentives for profitable growth and further 
development of the operating business by successfully implementing 
the business objectives for the respective financial year."
"In doing so, the 
overall responsibility for reaching the Group targets as well as the 
individual performance with regard to the operational responsibilities 
of the individual members of the Board of Management are taken into 
consideration."
"The annual bonus is calculated by multiplying the target 
achievement factor by the target amount for the annual bonus."
"It is 
paid out in cash after the end of the relevant financial year, with 
payment limited to a maximum of 150 % of the target amount."
"Long-term incentive – LTI 
The long-term, share-based remuneration is oriented mainly towards 
the sustainable increase in the enterprise value."
"Taking the share price 
performance in absolute and relative terms as a basis, it encourages 
combining the interests of the shareholders with those of the members 
of the Board of Management."
"Other stakeholder aspects are taken into consideration by setting 
strategic sustainability targets."
"The achievement of these targets forms 
the basis for the final assessment at the end of the four-year 
contractual vesting period."
"Almost two thirds (64 %) of the variable remuneration is share-
based, so as to adequately reflect the long-term performance of the 
company in the Board of Management remuneration."
"Ownership is required for the entire term of service on the Board of 
Management."
"Shares will be acquired through mandatory pay 
component conversion."
"In the event of a base salary increase, the 
shareholding obligation increases accordingly."
"The ownership 
obligation ceases with the end of the mandate."
"In combination with the virtual shares (RSU) accumulated over 
four years through the LTI plan, the Allianz SE Board of Management 
has significant economic exposure to Allianz stock."
"This amounts to 
approximately 800 % of base salary for the Chairperson and 
approximately 700 % of base salary for a regular Board member."
"In the same way, variable remuneration components already paid 
may be subject to a clawback for three years after payout."
"Additionally, a reduction or cancellation of variable remuneration may 
be implemented if this is required by the supervisory authority (BaFin) 
in accordance with its statutory powers."
"Payout cap 
In 
accordance 
with 
§ 87a (1) sentence 2 (1) AktG 
and 
the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the 
Supervisory Board has determined a remuneration cap."
"If the remuneration for 
the financial year exceeds this amount, compliance with the maximum 
limit will be ensured by reducing the payout of the long-term variable 
remuneration accordingly."
"This payout cap principle was introduced for the first time for the 
2019 financial year."
"Given that the actual amount of the long-term 
variable remuneration paid out cannot be determined until after 
vesting and the final sustainability assessment, compliance with the 
payout cap will be reported on for the first time in the Remuneration 
Report for the 2024 financial year."
"Deviation from the remuneration system  
The Supervisory Board can temporarily deviate from the remuneration 
system in exceptional circumstances in accordance with the statutory 
requirements (§ 87a (2) AktG), if this is necessary in the interests of the 
long-term welfare of the company."
"The assessment may take into 
account both macroeconomic and company-related exceptional 
circumstances, such as impairment of the long-term viability and 
profitability of the company."
"The deviation requires a prior proposal by 
the Personnel Committee."
"The duration of the deviation shall 
be determined by the Supervisory Board at its due discretion, but 
should not exceed a period of four years."
"In a crisis situation, for 
example, this principle is intended to allow the appointment of a new 
Board member with skills such as crisis management expertise, with a 
remuneration 
structure 
that 
temporarily 
deviates 
from 
the 
remuneration structure."
"In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board did not make use 
of the option to deviate from the remuneration system."
"Remuneration adjustment 
The Supervisory Board is also entitled to take appropriate account of 
extraordinary unforeseeable developments when determining the 
amount of the variable remuneration components."
"This rule takes up 
a recommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code and 
allows for the adjustment of the remuneration in rare unforeseeable 
exceptional cases."
"Conceivable cases of application include, for example, significant 
changes in accounting rules, or in the tax or regulatory framework, as 
well as catastrophic events not yet known at the time of target setting."
"The application of this rule may also lead to a reduction in the variable 
remuneration."
"In doing so, it shall take into account the horizontal and 
vertical comparison of the Board of Management remuneration."
"The 
aim of this rule is to moderately adjust Board of Management 
remuneration on the basis of horizontal and vertical salary trends, and 
thus to avoid major salary increases."
"Rather than being automatic, adjustment requires a justified 
decision by the Supervisory Board on a case-by-case basis."
"Such a 
moderate adjustment of the target remuneration does not in itself 
represent a significant change to the remuneration system."
"These 
adjustments or deviations must be justified in detail in the respective 
Remuneration Report for the financial year."
"Termination of service 
Board of Management contracts are limited to a period of five years."
"For new appointments, a shorter period of up to three years is provided 
based on the recommendation by the German Corporate Governance 
Code."
"Severance payment cap 
Payments for early termination to Board members with a remaining 
term of contract of more than two years are capped at twice the 
annual compensation, consisting of the last financial year’s base 
salary and 100 % of the variable target compensation."
"If the remaining 
term of contract is less than two years, the payment is made on a pro-
rata basis for the remaining term of the contract."
"Contracts do not 
contain provisions for any other cases of early termination of Board of 
Management service."
"In the event of a contractually agreed non-compete clause, a 
severance payment is offset against compensation resulting from the 
non-compete clause in the event of premature termination of service."
"Transition payment 
Board members appointed before 1 January 2010 are eligible for a 
transition payment after leaving the Board of Management."
"The 
transition payment comprises an amount corresponding to the most

payment of 25 % of the target variable remuneration at notice date."
"Where an Allianz pension is due at the same time, this pension is 
deducted from the monthly transition payments."
"In the event of a 
contractually agreed non-compete clause, the remittance of the 
transitional payment will be offset against the payment resulting from 
the non-compete clause."
"In recognition of related benefits to the organization, and subject 
to prior approval by the Supervisory Board of Allianz SE, Board 
members are also allowed to accept a limited number of non-
executive supervisory roles at appropriate external organizations."
"In 
these cases, 50 % of the remuneration received is paid to Allianz SE."
"The respective Board member will only retain the full 
remuneration for that position if the Allianz SE Supervisory Board 
classifies the appointment as a personal one (ad personam)."
"Any 
remuneration paid by external organizations will be itemized in those 
organizations’ annual reports; the level of remuneration will be

Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
Target achievement factor to determine the 
variable remuneration 
In line with the overarching strategic objective “simplicity wins”, the 
calculation of variable remuneration follows a simple system."
"The 
annual bonus and LTI allocation are based on only two Group financial 
targets for the relevant financial year: operating profit and net income 
attributable to shareholders, each at 50 %."
"The resulting target 
achievement is adjusted by an individual contribution factor (ICF) in 
the range of 0.8 to 1.2, which reflects both the results of the business 
division and the performance of the individual Board member."
"If 
targets are not met, the variable compensation can be reduced to 
zero."
"If targets are significantly exceeded, the target achievement is 
limited to 150 %."
"Group financial targets 
The Group financial targets are based on equally weighted targets for 
Group operating profit and Group net income attributable to 
shareholders."
"This regulation is intended to prevent meaningful transactions from 
having a negative impact on the remuneration of the Board of 
Management."
"Operating profit highlights the underlying performance of 
ongoing core operations."
"Net income attributable to shareholders is the profit after tax and 
non-controlling interests (minorities)."
"Furthermore, the net income 
forms the basis for the dividend payout, as well as for calculating the 
return on equity."
"Both key performance indicators (KPIs) are important 
steering parameters for the Allianz Group and therefore reflect the 
level of implementation of the Group’s strategy."
"The Group’s financial target achievement is limited to a maximum 
of 150 % and can drop to zero."
"The minimum, target, and maximum values for the Group 
financial targets are set annually by the Supervisory Board."
"These 
targets are documented for the respective next financial year and 
published ex-post in the Remuneration Report."
"B _ Corporate Governance

Individual performance indicators 
The Group financial target achievement is multiplied by the ICF for 
each member of the Board of Management."
"The ICF is based on an 
assessment by the Allianz SE Supervisory Board of performance, 
sustainability and strategic goals, based on KPIs reflecting the 
respective Board member’s area of responsibility and their personal 
contribution."
"− 
Strategic priority: An individual strategic priority will be set for 
every Board member at the beginning of each performance year, 
linked to a corresponding KPI and qualitatively assessed by the 
Supervisory Board."
"In addition, overarching strategic goals that 
apply to all Board members are set."
"For Board members with a functional focus, division-
specific performance targets are determined based on their key 
responsibilities, and are qualitatively assessed."
"− 
Sustainability targets: Non-financial sustainability targets take 
into account customer satisfaction (e.g., digital Net Promoter 
Score (dNPS), employee engagement (e.g., Allianz Engagement 
Survey), and leadership quality."
"Additional 
information, 
in

regarding

Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
Determining the individual contribution factor (ICF) 
The Supervisory Board determines the ICF for each member of the 
Board of Management based on the fulfillment of the individual 
performance indicators."
"Most of the performance indicators are 
provided with quantitative criteria, and therefore offer a sufficiently 
concrete basis for the combined assessment."
"Each ICF category – strategic priority, performance, and 
sustainability – has a significant weighting, and all three categories are 
of equal importance and make an equal contribution to the overall 
assessment."
"However, the individual indicators are not weighted on a 
fixed percentage basis, so that the ICF is not determined on the basis 
of a formulaic calculation."
"This allows the Supervisory Board to take 
appropriate consideration of the individual criteria and to react 
appropriately to changes in priorities during the year."
"In particular, 
significantly underperforming in one category should allow a low 
overall rating without being balanced out by the other indicators."
"Since performance is determined without a specified weighting, 
the ICF covers a narrow range of 0.8 to 1.2."
"1_For accounting purposes, the determination of the fair value of RSUs is based on an option pricing model, 
taking into account additional input parameters, including the term structure of interest rates and the 
expected relative performance of the Allianz share price compared to the peer index."
"For the latter, 
Long-term incentive (LTI) design 
The long-term, share-based compensation component makes up the 
largest portion of variable compensation."
"It promotes alignment with 
shareholders and reflects the sustainable implementation of the 
company’s long-term strategy."
"The LTI is based on the performance in  
absolute and relative terms (i.e., versus competitors) of the Allianz 
share."
"Furthermore, the long-term development of KPIs is reflected in 
the deferred sustainability assessment following the four-year 
contractual vesting period."
"− 
Grant and contractual vesting period: The LTI is granted annually 
in the form of virtual Allianz shares, known as restricted stock units 
(RSUs)."
"simulation techniques are applied at the valuation date to determine the volatility of the Allianz stock, 
the volatility of the peer index, their correlation, and the expected dividends."
"The value of the RSUs used 
− 
The RSU allocation value is based on the ten-day-average 
Xetra closing price of the Allianz stock following the annual 
financial media conference1."
"As RSUs are virtual stock without 
dividend payments, the relevant share price is reduced by the 
net present value of the expected future dividend payments 
during the four-year contractual vesting period."
The LTI grant is followed by a contractual vesting period of four years.
"After that period, the LTI amount to be paid is determined based on 
the relative performance of the Allianz share, the relevant share price, 
and the results of the sustainability assessment."
"− 
Relative performance versus peers: Besides the absolute share-
price development, the LTI payout takes the relative performance 
of the Allianz share into account."
"B _ Corporate Governance

Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
contractual vesting period."
"− 
To determine the factor, 100 percentage points are added to 
the result."
"Example: 1 percentage point outperformance 
results in a relative performance factor of 102 %; 1 percentage 
point underperformance results in a relative performance 
factor of 98 %."
"In order to avoid incentivizing excessive risk-taking, the relative TSR 
performance factor is limited: it can vary between zero (for 
underperformance of the index by - 50 percentage points or lower) 
and 200 % (for outperformance of the index by minimum 
+ 50 percentage points or higher)."
"− 
Sustainability assessment: Prior to the payout of each LTI tranche, 
the Personnel Committee makes a preliminary assessment before 
the Supervisory Board determines, whether there are any 
sustainability-related concerns regarding a full payout."
"If any 
concerns are identified, payment of the tranche may be cancelled 
in full or in part."
"The sustainability assessment covers: 
− 
compliance breaches, 
− 
balance sheet issues, such as reserve strength, solvency,  
indebtedness, and ratings, 
− 
KPIs contained in the individual Board members’ targets, such 
as dNPS, employee satisfaction, and climate targets."
"The assessment is made by applying a comparable basis; i.e., any 
regulatory changes, changes in accounting regulations, or 
changes in calculation methods for the KPIs in question are taken 
into account."
"The relevant share price is 
capped at 200 % of the grant price."
"Likewise, the relative TSR 
performance factor is capped at a maximum of 200 %."
"Taking into 
account the overall compensation cap (€ 6,000 thou for a regular 
Board member and € 11,750 thou for the Chairperson of the 
Board of Management), the LTI payout in relation to the LTI target 
– which deviates from the individual LTI component caps – is 
limited to 272 %."
"Outstanding RSU holdings are forfeited should a Board member leave 
at their own request or be terminated for important cause."
"The operating profit target of € 14.20 bn was 
exceeded to € 14.75 bn as the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, 
Corporate and Other business segments achieved growth in operating 
profit and more than compensated for the slight decline in the Asset 
Management business segment."
"This resulted in a target achievement 
of 107.69 % for the operating profit."
"The transition to IFRS 9 means a significant increase in the share 
of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss on the balance 
sheet in the Property-Casualty business segment and thus significantly 
higher volatility of the net income in combination with fewer steering 
options."
"For the 2023 financial year, the bonus curve was adjusted in 
order to address fluctuations in the net income that the Board of 
Management cannot control in either direction."
"For this purpose, 100 % 
target achievement was defined as a plateau with an upward or 
downward fluctuation range of € 500 mn."
"Net income attributable to 
shareholders amounted to € 8.54 bn in the past financial year and was 
therefore within the target range of € 7.9 – 8.9 bn, resulting in a target 
achievement of 100.00 %."
"Overall, this results in a target achievement rate for the Group’s 
financial targets of 103.85 %."
"The Supervisory Board determines the ICF for each Board 
member in line with their achievement of the targets defined in the 
individual agreement on the individual performance indicators."

understanding of risks and can exploit potential business 
opportunities to benefit shareholders, customers, and other 
stakeholders."
"Our group-wide rules and processes   
Our group-wide corporate rules and sustainability processes apply to 
all relevant underwriting, proprietary investment, and operations 
activities."
"They require strong collaboration between relevant 
functions and business areas."
"Key processes are included in the internal Allianz Standard for 
Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other corporate rules 
such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting and Allianz ESG 
Functional Rule for Investments."
"A new corporate rule, the Allianz 
Standard for Integration of Sustainability (ASIS), captures and updates 
some of the sustainability components of the AS RRIM in effect from 
1 January 2024."
"The 
publicly 
available 
Allianz 
Sustainability 
Integration 
Framework provides transparency around our sustainability-related 
processes and guidelines."
"We published the fifth version of the 
Framework in 2023 on the Allianz company website."
"Our asset management units have developed processes, rules, 
and governance for integrating sustainability into their investment 
activities."
"Consistent application of sustainability processes in our own 
business operations, insurance, and proprietary investment activities is 
crucial to mitigate risks and exploit the opportunities from the 
transition to a sustainable economy and society."
"It is also essential to 
our transformation into a sustainable financial service provider."
"Regulation as a driver of sustainability integration   
We welcome sustainability regulation as a major driver for fair 
competition and a level playing field."
"We believe that sound 
regulation can improve the structure and clarity of sustainability 
information."
"In 2023, we also actively engaged in and supported regulatory 
developments."
"For example, we are a member of the European 
Commission’s Platform on Sustainable Finance and have contributed 
to the work of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group 
(EFRAG) on EU sustainability reporting standards."
"Until April 2022, we 
did this via in-kind membership of the Project Task Force on European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (PTF-ESRS)."
"Since May 2022, when 
the new EFRAG governance was set up, our contribution has been via 
an in-kind membership representing the EU insurance industry in the 
Sustainability Reporting Technical Expert Group (SR TEG)."
"In this context, Allianz aims to contribute expert input with respect 
to the insurance industry, such as on the dual role of insurers as 
preparers and users of sustainability information, as well as on existing 
interconnected regulation."

We aim to leverage regulation on sustainability by ensuring 
consistent implementation across all Allianz businesses."
"At the same 
time, we aim to build business opportunities in line with regulatory 
concepts."
"Allianz has established a Sustainable Finance Regulation 
implementation project at Group level to drive this."
"Internal guidance 
is designed in close interaction with Group Centers and Operating 
Entities, to ensure consistent interpretation and implementation."
"The 
focus in 2023 was on the implementation of Sustainable Finance 
Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), namely regarding pre-contractual and 
periodic product disclosure as well as website disclosure in 
consideration of “Principal Adverse Impact” for the Life-Asset product 
offering."
"In 2023, Allianz started convergence into future CSRD reporting 
with a respective implementation project."
"The project is managed by 
the Group Accounting and Reporting function and defines policies, 
processes and reporting content in line with future ESRS requirements."
"The Group Sustainability Board oversees progress and deliverables of 
the project and provides directional guidance."
"The CSRD project is 
underpinned by the ambition to implement ESRS requirements with 
the same quality and diligence as for financial reporting processes."
"Environmental matters 
Human-made climate change, one of the greatest global challenges 
of our time, has already caused far-reaching negative consequences 
and losses for nature and people."
"Various human and natural systems 
are being stressed beyond the limits of their adaptive capacity."
"Therefore, irreversible damage has already started to occur."
"In order to mitigate these developments, the 2015 Paris 
Agreement set the goal of limiting global warming to a maximum of 
1.5 °C by the end of the century."
"This has resulted in a fixed greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) budget; i.e., an upper limit for global emissions 
that may still be released."
"Based on modeled emission pathways from 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th 
Assessment Report, emissions need to be almost halved every decade 
to restrict warming to 1.5 °C with limited or no overshoot, with a 50 % 
probability of success."
"This would allow carbon (CO2) emissions to 
reach net-zero by 2050, meaning that residual emissions would be 
balanced by atmospheric carbon removal."
"Climate scientists estimate 
that halting GHG emissions on a net level would subsequently put a 
stop to further warming."
"In 2022, however, annual energy-related carbon emissions 
reached a record level of 37 billion tons according to the International 
Energy Agency."
"If current trends continue, the GHG budget will be 
exceeded way before 2030 and the target of 1.5 °C will be overshot 
significantly."
"This increases the need for an even more rapid transition 
later on, as well as the use of atmospheric carbon removal – i.e., 
negative emission solutions – to bring warming back to 1.5 °C by the 
end of this century."
"Recent research has shown this is still possible but 
requires urgent action by companies and policymakers alike."
"Our approach to climate change is grounded in the Allianz Group 
Climate Change Strategy."
"First published in 2005, it steers our response 
to climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities in our insurance 
and investment business."
"Since 2015, the Climate Change Strategy has 
been built around our efforts to anticipate climate risks, care for our 
customers, and enable the net-zero transition."
"Since 2018, our Climate Change Strategy has committed us to 
contribute to pursuing efforts that limit global warming to 1.5 °C by the 
end of the century."
"To anticipate and enable this transition, Allianz has 
committed to net-zero greenhouse gases (GHG) for our proprietary 
investments, Property-Casualty insurance, and our own operations."
"In 
September 2023, we published our Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan 
on the Allianz company website, which describes our intermediary 
targets for 2030 and key actions to achieve them."
"This approach builds 
on the previously released 2025 emissions targets for proprietary 
investments and own operations."
"These elements, which address the impacts, risks, and 
opportunities of climate change, are explained in more detail in the 
subsequent sections on insurance, investments, own operations, and 
risks."
"Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and 
investee companies across different sectors in their transition toward 
net-zero."
"Since the net-zero transition is a systemic issue, it requires a whole-
of-society response."
"Therefore, we are also seeking to join forces with 
other stakeholders."
"Our approach on the investment side builds on the 
work of the U.N.-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, which 
Allianz co-founded and currently chairs."
"Furthermore, we encourage 
companies to implement net-zero strategies via our participation in 
The B Team, Climate Action 100+, the Transition Pathway Initiative, 
and the Principles for Responsible Investment."
"For further information and a full list of sustainability related 
memberships, please refer to the section “06.3” in our Group 
Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website."
"Climate-related opportunities 
Our materiality analysis under CSRD found climate-related 
opportunities to be material for the Property-Casualty insurance and 
proprietary investments."
"Our business strategy and our net-zero 
transition plan aim to systematically leverage opportunities to finance 
and insure a low-carbon and climate-resilient future, e.g., by investing 
in renewable energy, energy efficiency in real estate, and electric 
vehicle infrastructure."
"We have strategically insured and invested in low-carbon assets 
for over a decade."
"With our 2023 Inaugural Net-Zero Transition Plan, 
we have also set quantitative targets for investing and insuring 
solutions that are needed in the net-zero transition."
"Our Sustainable 
Solutions program provides products and services that aim to create 
positive impacts with our (re-)insurance activities and investments."
"Growing sustainable solutions is among the topics included in the 
annual financial planning processes of our operating entities, in order 
to systematically identify growth and profitability potential."
"For further 
information on sustainable solutions, please refer to the section EU 
Taxonomy for non-life insurance."
"We believe our intermediate climate targets will help us realize 
growth potential."
"For commercial insurance in particular, our transition 
plan includes a target to achieve 150 % profitable growth in revenues 
from renewable energy and low-carbon technology solutions by 2030."

Climate policy dialogue  
We can achieve our targets only jointly with public policy and the real 
economy, as the necessary changes require broad support."
"For 
instance, sufficient frameworks and market incentives are required to 
bring down demand for emission-intensive products and to allocate 
capital in line with a 1.5 °C trajectory."
"The private sector, including 
insurers, can play an important role in raising awareness and making 
the business case for getting on track to limit global warming."
"To that 
end, we also work with policymakers and regulators to support 
sustainable financing and achieve the goals laid down in the Paris 
Agreement."
"− 
Developing sector policies to promote a swift and socially fair 
transition, including the development of more granular short-, 
medium- and long-term net-zero infrastructure plans."
"− 
Implementing stringent carbon pricing to internalize the external 
costs of pollution, including a phase-out of direct and indirect fossil 
fuel subsidies."
"− 
Protecting nature and supporting regenerative forestry and 
agriculture."
"Supporting and redirecting fossil fuel-related subsidies 
to scale up new technologies that will provide solutions in hard-to-
abate sectors, e.g., carbon capture and storage, and green 
hydrogen."
"− 
Promoting mandatory assured climate disclosure, including 
transition plans, GHG emissions, associated reduction targets, and 
alignment with 1.5 °C trajectories, ideally aligned internationally."
"− 
Ensuring sustainable finance regulation that provides a defined, 
science-based, and reliable framework via a common taxonomy 
of sustainability, clarification of asset managers’ duties, inclusion 
of sustainability in prudential regulation, and enhanced 
transparency of corporate reporting."
"Further scenarios used include the IEA’s Net-Zero by 2050 and the One Earth 
Climate Model."
"1.5 °C alignment of targets 
Our emission targets are aligned with credible, science-backed climate 
scenarios – such as those provided by the IPCC1 – that limit global 
warming in 2100 to 1.5 °C with only a limited or no overshoot of this 
temperature during this century."
"While the individual scenarios differ 
in their assumptions and narratives, they agree on a necessary 
emission reduction range for CO2 emissions of 36 % to 69 % from 2020 
to 2030, with a median reduction of 48 %.2 All our existing sub-portfolio 
targets with a global focus are in line with this."
"For our motor retail 
portfolio, the targeted reductions, which apply to nine European 
markets, are aligned with respective net-zero pathways.3  
Our target year 2030 is defined as year-end 2029."
"Our base years 
for the 2030 targets in proprietary investments and operations 
continue to be the base year 2019 (building on existing 2025 targets)."
"This also allows us to filter out the temporary effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic."
"The approach taken for our P&C insurance targets was to 
focus on the most recent year for which data was available, this being 
2022."
"The former relies directly on GHG emission reductions in the real 
economy, which is not under our control."
"The latter can also occur 
naturally as part of typical insurance and investment business cycles in 
different lines of business, sectors, and individual customers, and is 
generally more under our control."
"We aim to achieve GHG emission reductions through actions such 
as engaging customers, increasing exposures to lower-carbon 
business, and setting targets for lower-carbon technologies, as well as 
reducing our exposure to defined fossil-fuel business such as thermal 
coal."
"For our own operational GHG emissions, the main levers for 
reduction are Electricity, Buildings as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and 
Procurement."
"These elements are described in more detail in the 
following sections."
We apply both absolute and intensity GHG emission targets.
"Absolute GHG emissions refer to an absolute amount of GHG 
emissions associated with the respective business activity such as 
2_For GHG emissions, the range is 34 to 60, with a median of 43."
"3_Target applies to the most relevant markets for Allianz, where adequate and reliable data is available."
"investing or insuring; absolute GHG emission targets seek to reduce the 
absolute amount of GHG emissions."
"GHG emission intensity and 
associated targets, on the other hand, harmonize the GHG emissions 
through a denominator that relates to a business activity."
"For example, 
GHG emissions per million invested or per million of premium."
"Property-Casualty insurance 
The GHG emissions associated with our commercial portfolio will be 
reduced as we continue the planned implementation of our 
underwriting guidelines for coal as well as for oil and gas in line with 
announced thresholds and timelines."
"Our portfolio will also change as 
we continue to expand our risk appetite in the segment of renewable 
energy, low-carbon, and transition technologies."
"We will also benefit 
from GHG emission reductions in the real economy that our corporate 
customers pursue as part of their own net-zero strategies as required 
by governments, investors, and other stakeholders, and in addition, 
enabled by us as an insurer."
"A supportive policy environment is crucial 
here and is an important lever both for the net-zero transition in the 
global economy and for our target achievement."
"The GHG emissions associated with our motor retail portfolio are 
planned to be reduced through various initiatives; firstly, by increasing 
our share of battery electric vehicles for our markets in scope."
"It is also 
clear from market research that customers want to drive less, so we will 
encourage sustainable behaviors by providing offerings that reward 
these lifestyle changes."
"Another key lever will therefore be providing 
further incentives for reducing GHG emissions via mileage-based 
product offerings."
"When considering potential initiatives we took into 
account future projections in each of the countries for which we have 
set targets, including energy usage, vehicle usage and vehicle types."
"Our incentives will therefore balance the improvements we expect to 
see in the respective markets with Allianz actions aimed at closing the 
gap to our stated targets."
"We will therefore actively steer our in-scope 
portfolios to be more sustainable whilst benefiting from changes we 
predict to observe in market behavior."
"We will also engage with customers to support their transition to 
electric mobility and meet their changing needs."
"We are committed to 
offering comprehensive insurance products for battery electric 
vehicles and the related ecosystem, and to supporting our customers 
in transitioning to new forms of mobility."

Proprietary investment 
Our investment management function allows us to influence our 
portfolio allocation by setting targets and frameworks for our asset 
managers."
"These include defining concrete decarbonization targets 
for individual mandates, excluding certain high-emitting companies 
without reduction plans, and increasing target volumes for investments 
in climate solutions."
"In order to achieve GHG emission reductions in the companies in 
our portfolio, we cultivate all types of engagement: bilateral, 
multilateral, and asset manager engagement."
"As part of our 
multilateral engagement activities, the transition of whole sectors is a 
particular focus."
"Own operations 
As the specific definition of net-zero is still evolving for financial 
institutions and we anticipate CSRD requirements, we are no longer 
referring to the 2030 target for our Own Operations as a net-zero 
commitment."
We will instead refer to it as a 2030 intermediate target.
"The rest of the decarbonization and removal targets for Own 
Operations remain as communicated in the Inaugural Net-Zero 
Transition Plan."
"By 2025 we aim to reduce GHG emissions per employee by 50 % 
versus a 2019 baseline across Scope 1, Scope 2, and selected Scope 3 
emissions (for further information, please refer to the section “Own 
Operations”)."
"For year-end 2030, we target GHG emission reductions 
of 70 % and for year-end 2029, 65 %1 versus a 2019 baseline."
"To address the remaining 30 %2 of the emissions we will use high-
quality carbon removal solutions."
"Key levers for GHG emission reduction will be the areas of 
Renewable Electricity, Buildings, as well as Fleet, Business Travel, and 
Procurement."
"In the area of Renewable Electricity, we source 100 % 
renewable electricity from 2023 onwards and implement energy 
efficiency measures.3 For Buildings, we have developed a Buildings 
Standards Catalogue that includes various measures addressing GHG 
emission reduction."
"For Procurement, we will ask

"Carbon removal and carbon credits 
In the past reporting year, we did not use carbon removal and 
associated carbon credits when accounting for our GHG and the 
associated reduction targets."
"Our net-zero targets will likely require the 
use of atmospheric carbon removal in the respective net-zero targets 
year."
"For this, we expect to only use high-quality carbon removal."
"Our 
focus remains on GHG emission reductions."
"Governance 
Ultimate responsibility for all matters relating to sustainability, 
including climate, resides with the Board of Management of Allianz SE 
as the Group’s parent company."
"This includes climate change and the 
net-zero transition plan, which has been approved by the Board of 
Management."
"Climate-related matters are typically part of all Group 
Sustainability Board meetings, which are held at least quarterly."
"For 
further information, please refer to the section “Corporate 
sustainability governance and strategy”."
"Our Climate Change Strategy is rooted in the established 
sustainability governance (for further information, please refer to the 
section “Corporate sustainability governance and strategy”) and its 
associated policies on sustainability, climate, and the energy sector."
"For further information, please refer to the section “Overarching

"The Allianz sustainability approach integrates climate and 
sustainability-related 
considerations 
by 
applying 
group-wide 
corporate rules and sustainability instruments across underwriting and 
investment activities."
"Key processes include the internal Allianz 
Standard for Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM) and other 
corporate rules, such as the Allianz Standard for P&C Underwriting 
(ASU) and Allianz ESG Functional Rule for Investments (EFRI)."
"The AS RRIM has been in place since 2013 and establishes a core 
set of principles and processes for the management of reputational 
risks and sustainability issues within the Group."
"It is owned by Group 
Risk, authorized by the Group Finance and Risk Committee and 
acknowledged by the Allianz SE Board of Management."
"The objective 
of the Standard is to proactively identify business decisions and 
business activities with the potential to trigger reputational issues and, 
where appropriate, take action to minimize their probability and/or 
impact."
"This Standard is mandatory for all operating entities of the 
Allianz Group."
"For 2024, the intention is for it to be superseded by the 
Allianz Standard for Communications and the Allianz Standard for 
Integration of Sustainability."
"Furthermore, Allianz has four energy-related guidelines in place: 
thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas, and renewable/low-carbon energy."
"The guidelines are owned by Global Sustainability and authorized by 
the Allianz SE Board of Management."
"They apply to proprietary 
investments and P&C insurance, including facultative reinsurance."
"Their common goals are to contribute to the transition from fossil fuels 
to cleaner energy technologies, to manage sustainability and 
reputational risks, and to achieve our net-zero related targets."
"The 
three fossil fuel guidelines define business practices and business 
models where we do not provide further services or investments along 
defined technical exclusion criteria."
"They typically differentiate 
between single-site restrictions – which apply to stand-alone P&C 
covers as well as direct project investments – and restrictions on 
company-level exposures."
"Purely to support renewable and low-
carbon technologies, we allow ring-fenced coverages of and 
investments into projects and subsidiaries of companies that are 
otherwise restricted due to the fossil-related energy guidelines."
"This is 
described in the Renewable/Low-Carbon Energy Guideline."
"The 
guidelines were introduced in 2015 (thermal coal), 2021 (oil sands), 
2022 (oil & gas), and 2023 (renewable/low-carbon) respectively."

As in previous years, we report on the exemptions granted based 
on the rules outlined in the guideline to companies breaching thermal 
coal thresholds."
"In 2023, we received two coal-related requests from 
our operating entities to exempt corporate clients from company-
based restrictions related to both P&C insurance and proprietary 
investment segments."
"Of these, one was granted and one was not 
granted."
"The granted one was a 1.5 °C exemption, which means that 
the company was assessed to be on a 1.5 °C pathway despite its coal 
exposure."
"The option to grant a grace period of one year for 
companies aligned with well below 2 °C was granted four times in 
2022."
"As of January 2023, this was no longer possible as per the

"The attribution factor determines what 
share of the absolute emissions of an insured customer or asset is 
attributable to re/insurance."
"For motor retail, the calculation considers the Scope 1 and 2 
emissions of insured vehicles within a portfolio and multiplies them by 
an attribution factor."
"The attribution factor represents the insurance 
industry's share of the total cost of ownership of a vehicle, which 
includes other costs such as depreciation, fuel, and maintenance."
"The 
carbon emissions of the insured vehicles are multiplied by the industry 
attribution factor (calculated by PCAF as 6.99 % for 2023) to calculate 
the insurance-associated emissions."
"For the motor retail portfolios covered by the emission reduction 
target, the baseline for absolute insurance-associated emissions in 
2022 was 2.10 mn t CO23 (Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) in line with 
the PCAF standard."
"Overall GHG emission reduction target

Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty."
"We are focusing on those

addition to factoring in expected portfolio growth, our target definition 
was also informed by the anticipated real economy decarbonization, 
which we modeled using authoritative scenarios such as the Stated 
Policies Scenario (STEPS) of the International Energy Agency."
"Our first intermediary target for commercial lines targets the sub-
portfolio with the largest climate impact and adequate GHG data 
quality."
"This will allow us to steer our portfolio and measure our 
progress based on reasonable and verifiable GHG emission data, 
rather than overly relying on sector estimates."
"For retail insurance, we are setting a target to reduce the absolute 
carbon emissions within our motor retail portfolio."
"For the motor retail 
portfolio, the target covers nine key European markets, namely: 
Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, 
Switzerland, and the UK."
"Our target is to reduce the absolute carbon 
emissions within our in-scope portfolios by 30 % by 2030 against our 
2022 baseline."
"Portfolios classified as in scope are aligned with the 
PCAF standard for personal motor."
"For the 2022 baseline, the in-scope portfolios within these markets 
represent 55 % of the motor retail premiums."
"The target focuses on the 
most relevant motor markets for Allianz where the biggest impact can 
be made."
"This includes where there is adequate and reliable data 
available, in order for emissions to be measured and progress against 
our target to be accurately tracked."
"In addition, our target setting is aligned with limiting global 
warming to 1.5 °C and was informed by the anticipated real economy 
decarbonization, which we modeled using scenarios from external 
data partners."
"follows IFRS definition of gross written premiums and deviates from PCAF, which excludes external 
acquisition costs; following PCAF definition of insurance premiums, scope coverage represents roughly 
16 % of the eligible premiums in the commercial segment."
"More details can be found in the explanatory 
notes."
"To this end, we will proactively approach customers to foster 
dialogue and encourage a shift toward science-based net-zero 
strategies."
"Firstly, each year we will engage with the top 100 customers, 
selected by premium size and average industry sector emission 
intensity, who do not currently have an emissions reporting or a 
disclosure approach and are therefore currently not in scope for our 
emission reduction target."
"By taking this step, we are endeavoring to 
raise awareness for increased transparency and data exchange and 
ultimately aiming to close the GHG reporting gap in our portfolio."
"Secondly, we will engage with customers within the transportation 
industry – specifically aviation and marine – by leveraging best-
practice exchanges on decarbonization strategies for these sectors."
"Thirdly, we will seek dedicated exchanges with two to three companies 
per year on their net-zero strategies."
"For this engagement category, we 
will screen our portfolio to identify high-emitting companies who have 
not yet developed science-based net-zero strategies."
"Sustainability 
teams within AGCS will support in the selection of engagement 
candidates and prepare the engagement dialogues, which will be 
conducted jointly with the distribution and underwriting teams."
"For motor retail insurance, we will also actively engage with our 
customers to encourage the transition to net-zero."
"The 20 million target 
reflects the current and estimated future number of customers in the 
markets defined as in scope, who do not own a battery electric vehicle 
(BEV)."
"Engagement will include focusing on the benefits of switching 
to electric mobility and the practicalities of doing so, for example home 
charging infrastructure and insurance options."
"To increase our share of sustainably-minded customers, we will 
offer mileage-based products to reward customers who are actively 
seeking to reduce their emissions."
"Our aim in offering such solutions is 
to encourage change across the insurance sector in how we, as an 
industry, approach motor insurance."
"By offering mileage-based products, we will ensure fair and risk-
adequate pricing for our customers that aligns with our technical 
excellence program."
"Increasing our market share of BEVs will enable 
us to collect more data and thus improve the accuracy of our risk 
models."
"We are committed to understanding the risks, gathering data, 
and being actively involved in research in order to ensure our net-zero 
plan invests in society to the benefit of all."
"To support the implementation of our actions, a dedicated team 
within Global P&C at Allianz SE will support engagement activities, 
which will be achieved in collaboration with OEs."

"Although we 
aspire to calculate financed GHG emissions for as much of our 
portfolio as possible, we are constrained by the development of 
methodologies and availability of data."
"Nevertheless, we remain 
committed to progressively expanding the coverage of our portfolio 
over time."
"We do not calculate financed GHG emissions for covered bonds, 
ABS/MBS and cash as there is no methodology available yet for these 
asset classes."
"To see these asset classes, please see lines “no 
methodology” in table “Financed emissions”."
"As there 
is no specific PCAF guidance on carbon accounting for sub-sovereigns 
and supranationals, we have adapted the methodology for sovereign 
debt to these two asset classes."
"We do not cover 100 % of our exposure 
in these three types of financed GHG emissions (i.e., Corporates, Real 
Estate and Public Debt) due to the lack of relevant emission data 
information."
"To see this data coverage gap, please see column

Target setting for GHG emission reduction – 
introduction 
We deem the framework laid out by the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset 
Owner Alliance (NZAOA) for target setting for GHG emission reduction 
to be best practice."
"Thus we in general follow the recommendations of 
the NZAOA for setting intermediate decarbonization targets."
"While 
the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol (NZAOA TSP) defines targets for 
engagements, sectors and financing the transition, we display these as 
actions in line with ESRS E1."
"The NZAOA TSP was aligned with all 
relevant stakeholders and vetted in a public consultation and was 
developed with a strong reference to the 1.5°C no/low overshoot 
climate scenarios in the latest report of the IPCC."
"For further 
information, please see section “The scientific basis for establishing 
net-zero targets” of the NZAOA TSP1."
"We 
have 
already 
reached 
our 
intermediate 
2025 
decarbonization target for corporate bonds and listed equities in 2023 
as we reduced our financed GHG emissions by 44 % against the target 
of a 25 % reduction."
"For full 2025 target reporting, please refer to the 
section “03.2” in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz 
company website."
"We have also reached our targets for engagements 
and financing the transition."
"For further information, please refer to the 
section “Decarbonization Levers”."
"We have therefore decided to update our complete range of 
targets in 2023 and define new targets for 2030."
"When setting these 
targets, we considered potential future developments in large 
industries, especially the E.U."
"and the U.S., based on the latest climate 
law and regulation; i.e., “Fit for 55” and the “Inflation Reduction Act”."
"We also wanted our new targets to include what we have learned from 
previous years; e.g., related to data availability."
"The targets remain in 
line with the latest science (IPCC report) and industry best practice 
(NZAOA TSP) and are broader in terms of coverage and depth."
"For a 
detailed explanation of our 2030 targets, please refer to Explaining 
Allianz Intermediate Climate Target Setting 2030 for Proprietary 
Investments2 on the Allianz company website."
"As of the financial year 2024, we will only report on our new 2030 
targets."
"Overall GHG emission reduction target 
We have set an absolute GHG emission reduction target for listed 
corporates (corporate bonds and public equity)."
"Our target is to reduce 
absolute GHG emissions in the respective asset classes by 50 % by 2030 
compared to the 2019 baseline emissions."
"We have added a 2030 emission intensity reduction target 
covering all listed and unlisted corporate exposure (e.g., infrastructure 
debt) in the amount of 50 % compared to the 2019 baseline emission 
intensity (see table “2030 Targets for emissions associated with 
proprietary investments"")."
"A reduction of 50 % is in line with latest IPCC scenarios and equals the 
midpoint of the respective scenario range from 40 % to 60 %."
"For 
further information, please refer to section “1.5 °C alignment of 
targets” and the work of the NZAOA with the IPCC scenarios3."
"For unlisted corporates, we are still in the process of 
gathering emission data and we do not know beforehand how many 
of our portfolio companies and indirect investments via funds will 
deliver data in the coming years until 2030."
"As data coverage is 
uncertain and changing, we cannot set a reasonable absolute GHG 
emission reduction target for our overall corporate portfolio."
"An 
intensity metric does not rely on coverage as absolute GHG emissions 
are divided by the respective portfolio exposure."
"We therefore decided 
to set an emission intensity reduction target for our listed and unlisted 
corporates portfolio for 2030."
"We have set 2030 targets that are aligned with the Carbon Risk 
Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for our real estate equity and debt 
portfolios."
"These sectoral decarbonization pathways are based on the 
latest science, supported by the Science Based Targets initiative, and 
widely accepted as best practice."
"Our progress toward target achievement will be monitored 
regularly and reported in the Non-Financial Statement."
"The

2_Explaining Allianz Intermediate Climate Target Setting 2030 for Proprietary Investments."
"As an investment management function, we have set targets and 
frameworks for our asset managers that will ultimately lead to a 
change in our portfolio allocation with respect to asset classes, 
investees, and sectors."
"As we have set overall GHG reduction targets on a Group-wide 
level, we start by breaking down the global target to individual 
mandate level."
"Each asset manager is then responsible for reaching 
the respective mandate decarbonization target by taking appropriate 
actions."
"For real estate, for example, these actions might include 
tenant engagement, portfolio transactions, and deep refurbishments."
"We hold regular deep-dive meetings where we monitor and discuss 
the decarbonization performance of our asset managers against the 
set targets."
"As well as setting decarbonization targets per mandate, we 
exclude certain companies in line with our global energy-related 
guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, oil & gas."
"For further information, 
please refer to section “Overarching Policies”."
"These exclusions 
therefore contribute to the implementation of our sector targets for oil 
& gas and utilities that are outlined below."
"All excluded companies are 
included in the Allianz Group Risk Global Restricted List and are shared 
with all asset managers on a regular basis."
"Asset managers are 
obliged to comply with these restrictions."
"We aim to finance the transition of companies in the hard-to-
abate cement and steel sector that are aligned with a 1.5 °C world and 
have well-defined decarbonization strategies."
"We will therefore create 
a separate emission bucket and adjust the sub-portfolio target for 
listed equity and corporate bonds to reflect additional exposure in 
those transition leaders included on our new steel and cement climate 
list."
"1_We have started working on harmonizing terminology and underlying eligible technologies related to 
the targets for climate solutions (currently used for proprietary investments) and transition solutions 
(currently used for P&C insurance)."
We expect to conclude this work and report on it in FY2024.
We have set sector targets for the high-emitting sectors listed below.
"For both sectors, 
we are currently implementing data flows as a first step."
"Portfolio decarbonization will also be fostered by increasing our 
share in Sustainable Investments."
"We have achieved our 2025 target 
for financing the transition; i.e., we have created between 4 and 5 new 
blended finance vehicles and have made initial investments in forestry 
and hydrogen."
"We have therefore included a quantitative 2030 target for 
investments in climate solutions, which is to increase climate solution 
investments by at least € 20 bn by 2030, subject to market environment 
and constraints."
"As a first step to reach this target, we have defined all low-carbon 
technologies that qualify as climate solutions1."
"We need to develop a 
process to align and agree on concrete volumes per annum with all 
relevant stakeholders: operating entities, asset managers, and 
relevant Group centers."
"We have defined two additional requirements for our 
investments."
"Firstly, we will predominantly invest in Article 8 or Article 9 
funds (or equivalent) as defined by the EU Sustainable Finance 
Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)."
"Secondly, we will require a credible 
transition plan for all unlisted direct investment with a carbon intensity 
above 100 t CO2e/€ mn invested."
"Portfolio company decarbonization 
The extent to which we can achieve reduction of GHG emissions for our 
investee companies and real estate investments depends on the 
respective ownership structure."
"For example, in the case of fully-owned 
real estate assets, we can directly influence GHG emissions by deep 
refurbishments."
"However, if we are only a minority owner, we are 
restricted to indirectly impacting GHG emissions through engagement, 
for example, or proxy voting (public equity)."
"One indirect lever to reach our 2030 GHG emission reduction 
targets is therefore continued engagement and support of our 
portfolio companies."
"We have consequently implemented a 
systematic and strong engagement approach across all types of 
engagements: bilateral, multilateral, and asset manager."
"For further 
information on our engagement approach, please refer to our 2023 – 
Allianz Investment Management – Our Engagement Approach on the 
Allianz company website."
"We have already achieved our 2025 engagement targets in 2023 
as we have engaged the top 30 (non-aligned) emitters in our portfolio, 
increased our engagement activities by 100 %, and fully participated 
in all NZAOA sector and asset manager engagements."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
68 
We have therefore updated our engagement targets earlier than 
originally planned."
"By 2030 (versus September 2023), we firstly want 
to engage with all external asset managers who are “below 
expectations” based on a systematic assessment."
"In order to reach this 
target, we initially need to perform a systematic sustainability 
assessment of all of our public and private asset managers."
"If an asset 
manager does meet our minimum expectations, we will start 
engagement to close identified gaps."
"We regularly review our public 
equity asset managers against best practice guidance (e.g., NZAOA 
guidance on best practice for proxy voting and climate lobbying)."
"Secondly, we want to participate in 30 multilateral engagements 
(at least 15 of them with a focus on climate), either as the lead 
organization or as a member."
"In order to reach this target, we will 
continuously review existing or new multilateral engagement 
initiatives."
"In 2023, we joined the collaborative engagement initiative 
“Investor Initiative on Hazardous Chemicals” (IIHC)."
"Thirdly, we aim to engage with 15 non-multilaterally engaged 
portfolio emitters among the top 100."
"We will screen the financed GHG 
emissions of our portfolio companies to identify those qualifying for 
engagement; i.e., those with the highest financed GHG emissions that 
are not already engaged."
"As many of our high emitters in the portfolio can only decarbonize 
properly if the whole sector – including the value chain – decarbonizes, 
we are also active in sector engagements via multilateral engagement 
initiatives."
"Sector engagements are supporting our sector targets for 
2030, in particular in the oil & gas and steel sectors."
"For more 
information on our sector targets, please refer to the section “Portfolio 
allocation changes”."
"The whole investment management function of Allianz is 
responsible for implementing climate topics in the existing processes 
and hence in the investment portfolio."
"Proprietary investment specific policies 
We are committed to managing climate change risk identified as a 
material risk for our proprietary investment portfolio."
"To align our 
investment management function with this commitment, we have set 
ambitious GHG emission reduction targets that incentivize respective 
decision-making (see table “2030 Targets for emissions associated 
with proprietary investments”)."
"Our Allianz ESG Functional Rule for 
Investments (EFRI) sets out the rules, principles, and processes that

data centers by 2023."
"RE100 is a global initiative bringing together 
businesses committed to 100 % renewable electricity."
"Energy sourcing has been a strategic procurement function since 
2021 and plays a key role in our transition toward 100 % renewable 
electricity, mainly by shifting energy procurement from locally driven to 
globally driven processes."
"Activities in 2023 included leveraging 
opportunities to agree green tariffs with local power providers and 
holding conversations with landlords supported by green lease 
clauses."
"We encourage green tariffs and local direct investments in 
Allianz-owned self-generation, centrally supported by PIMCO Prime

"Climate change will materially affect global economies and Allianz, with 
its international footprint and many different lines of business, is no 
exception – as already highlighted in the section on materiality analysis."
"The risks and opportunities emerging today will evolve and increase over 
the mid to long term."
"They include acute and chronic physical impacts on 
property and human health, such as increasing temperatures, extreme 
weather events, rising sea levels, intensifying heatwaves, droughts, and 
potential changes in vector-borne diseases."
"Risks and opportunities also result from the cross-sectoral structural 
change stemming from the transition to a low-carbon economy."
"These 
transition risks include the impacts of changes in climate policy, technology, 
and market sentiment, and their impact on the market value of financial 
assets, as well as impacts resulting from climate change litigation."
"Impact on and impact of our business 
The Allianz Group is exposed to risks that are influenced by climate change 
in a multitude of ways."
"− 
As a large-scale institutional investor with significant interests in various 
economies, companies, infrastructure, and real estate that might be 
affected by the physical impact of climate change and the transition 
to a low-carbon economy."
"As well as being impacted by climate change, the choices Allianz makes 
about how to conduct our business have an impact on climate change, 
e.g., by investing in or insuring activities that either cause or reduce GHG 
emissions."
"To manage potentially detrimental impacts on both the climate 
and our business, we have committed to align our proprietary investment 
and insurance underwriting portfolios to 1.5 °C climate scenarios."
"Strategy resilience, stress tests, and climate scenario 
analysis 
Climate change considerations are an integral part of our insurance and 
investment strategy."
"We apply various quantitative and qualitative strategies when 
carrying out climate stress testing and scenario analysis."
"Considerations in 
this regard include the long-term horizons over which climate change may 
unfold and the high level of uncertainty over the direction of future climate 
and economic developments."
"Our objective is to foster risk awareness, 
build expertise in the assessment of financial risks from climate change, 
test our business strategy resilience, and inform risk management and 
business decision-making."
"We perform sensitivity and scenario analyses with time horizons up to 
2050 and including scenarios ranging from 1.5 °C to 4 °C of average 
warming by the end of the century."
"While time horizons naturally differ 
depending on the lines of business under consideration, the range of 
scenarios we apply allows us to better assess a variety of risks associated 
with climate change."
"When we conduct analyses that assess 1.5 °C scenario alignment, we 
adjust our scenario selection using guidance developed by the NZAOA 
that is focused on 1.5 °C scenarios with no or low overshoot of 1.5 °C of 
warming."
"This limits the need to remove GHG emissions from the 
atmosphere in the second half of the century."
"When conducting outside-in impact scenario analysis, we use a 
broader range of scenarios in terms of temperature outcomes and 
characteristics."
"We deploy quantitative assessments for indicative 
sizing of our exposure to climate change risks."
"A top-down approach is 
developed to assess risks at the level of our balance sheet."
"Complementary bottom-up modeling for the most relevant exposures 
provides insights into climate change risks at the level of individual 
investment or underwriting projects and may support contextualization of 
results from top-down analyses."
"It should be noted that the analyses included in this report reflect our 
current approaches to climate change risk assessments."
"Prevailing 
methodological and data limitations as well as the high degree of 
uncertainty inherent in any long-term analysis may still limit the decision-
making usefulness of some results."
"However, these approaches will 
change over time as climate scenarios evolve in line with research, 
developmental-stage methods improve further, and industry best 
practices emerge."
"There are multiple ways 
in which climate change may trigger risk events, so it is essential that this 
understanding is established in enough detail for it to provide a solid basis 
for applying risk-based prioritization with the aim of evaluating mitigation 
effectiveness and management actions."
"To achieve full coverage of Allianz’s business footprint, the assessment 
was structured along investments, property-casualty underwriting, 
life/health underwriting, operations, with investments and underwriting 
further subdivided into asset class and line of business, respectively."
"For 
each area (or alternatively, asset class for investments, and line of business 
for underwriting), the main relevant climate change-related risk drivers 
were identified."
"In this context, a risk driver is any development or event 
wholly or primarily attributable to climate change that potentially impacts 
Allianz’s risk profile."
"Such risk drivers can be categorized into technological, 
regulatory, legal, and consumer behavior developments (transition risks), 
as well as physical risks such as floods, drought, or wildfires."
"For each risk driver, a range of potential short- to medium-term and 
long-term impacts for the insurance sector was considered, utilizing 
knowledge acquired via a combination of desktop research and 
consultation with subject matter experts both internal and external to 
Allianz."
"Lastly, the potential magnitude of each of these risk impacts was 
assessed against various dimensions of financial and non-financial 
performance."

"Investments 
- Companies that fail to adopt these new technologies may face future cost disadvantages via a combination of higher energy costs, 
higher financing costs or costs from participation in carbon emissions trading schemes."
"On the revenues side, customers may become 
adverse towards companies that fail to adopt climate-related technologies."
"This risk is particularly relevant for those business sectors 
with a comparatively high emissions footprint, such as energy, transportation and construction."
"- Stranded assets are also possible, whereby technological breakthroughs render older, high emission technologies obsolete, in 
particular when further squeezed by decarbonization-related regulations."
"Conversely, it is also possible that promising technologies 
ultimately fail to deliver on their potential and earn a return on substantial investments in research and development."
"- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be 
impacted by the above developments."
"Underwriting 
The introduction of new technologies may lead to more frequent and severe malfunctions, damage or process disruptions, especially 
in the early application phase."
"Areas of particular vulnerability include electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, such as 
battery energy storage systems."
"In this context, providing insurance coverage may represent a challenge for insurers due to the lack 
of historical claims data as a basis for modeling and pricing, which may trigger an increase in insured manufacturers‘ product liability 
exposure."
"To deliver on these commitments countries are enacting increasingly 
stringent regulations designed to reduce carbon emissions, such as 
the phase out of combustion engines, encouraging the adoption of 
heat pumps or increasing the share of sustainably produced energy."
"Given the swift and drastic reduction required, the impact of these 
regulations is widespread across many business sectors, although 
naturally most consequential for those responsible for the largest 
share of emissions."
"Direct consequences include write-down costs, whereby as a result of a regulatory directive, 
the projected financial return on company assets is diminished."
"- Furthermore, fragmentation of regulations at a regional and global level may lead to competitive disadvantages based on a 
company’s geographic location, especially for companies that are highly dependent on international trade."
"Competitive 
disadvantages may result from either operating under a comparatively strict set of regulations relative to peers (e.g."
"carbon emission 
limits), or conversely, due to regulations enacted to counter such environmental arbitrage (e.g."
"border taxes, restricted market access 
for companies with poor climate practices)."
"- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be 
impacted by the above developments."
"Operations 
- Allianz is committed to full compliance with all climate-change regulations applicable to the organization."
"The design and 
implementation of processes needed to comply will require investments in employees, external expertise, 3rd party databases, IT 
systems and more."
"- Beyond the direct costs, regulations are likely to result in an increase in Allianz’ operational complexity – for example in the form of 
expanded data gathering and reporting requirements or additional sustainability considerations to be applied in the design, 
marketing and service of products."
"This increased complexity in turn may drive an increase in the likelihood and severity of process 
failures and accompanying operational losses."

Risk driver 
Context 
Main potential risk impacts 
Climate litigation 
Climate change has emerged to become a source of potential high-
impact litigation, whether in terms of monetary losses (e.g."
"fines, 
awarding of damages) or through court ordered changes in 
defendants’ business practices that negatively impact profitability or 
– in extreme cases – viability of the business model itself."
"This trend is expected to continue as both litigants seek compensation 
for climate related damages and activists turn to court systems in 
response to real or perceived political and business failures to 
adequately address climate change."
"- Climate attribution science supports the assignment of responsibility for climate-change related damages to those companies 
historically responsible for a large share of emissions, whether from the extraction and processing of fossil fuels or their consumption 
via production or product use (e.g."
"energy generation, transportation)."
"As the confidence levels of climate attribution models improve 
they may increasingly be recognized by courts and juries in determining culpability and corresponding damages."
"Given past studies 
suggesting a relatively small number of companies are responsible for an outsized share of total historical emissions – primarily 
within the oil & gas and utility sectors – the legal exposure of these companies in particular may be quite significant."
"- In addition to the costs or losses directly attributable to climate-change related regulations, companies also face legal exposures 
for failure to comply."
"Against the backdrop of sweeping regulations and tight timelines for their adoption – which is unavoidable in 
the light of nations’ legally binding emission reduction commitments – it may prove challenging for certain companies or even entire 
sectors to fully comply."
"This is relevant not only for operations and product design, but also climate-change related reporting and 
disclosure requirements."
"- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be 
impacted by the above developments."
"Underwriting 
The above climate litigation drivers for investments may also adversely impact Allianz’ risk profile with respect to Underwriting Risks."
"Allianz risk exposures arise 
from indemnity coverages for legal proceedings against these policyholders, in particular within the D&O and Liability lines of 
business."
"Investments 
- Within the real estate sector property valuations may increasingly be dependent on exposure to extreme weather events, both from 
a macro- and micro-geographic perspective."
"The most exposed properties might experience higher losses from property damage, a 
loss of rental income due to business disruptions and higher insurance and financing costs."
"While measures may be taken to help 
mitigate the real estate impact of extreme weather events, such as strengthening structures against wind and flood damage, these 
typically require costly investments."
These issues also largely apply towards the construction and infrastructure sectors as well.
"- At a sovereign level, government finances may become strained through an ever increasing need to finance recovery and repair 
efforts following catastrophic weather events."
"Over time this support may lead to a deterioration in the creditworthiness of sovereign 
debt, further compounding losses via higher debt servicing costs, or in extreme cases may even lead to default scenarios."
"Alternatively, governments may choose to invest in mitigation or adaption initiatives, however in many cases these solutions come 
with high costs that may likewise place pressure on government finances."
"- At a more general level, corporate bonds and equities may be impacted to various degrees depending on the sector and 
geographic location."
"For example, floods, fires, droughts and heat waves can trigger large loss events in many different sectors, such 
as agriculture, tourism, energy production, shipping and manufacturing."
"This injects a new source of risk and volatility into corporate 
financial outcomes, which may challenge their ability to consistently deliver reliable profits or, in extreme cases, trigger instances of 
bankruptcy."
Ultimately these issues will be reflected in share prices and bond valuations.
"- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be 
impacted by the above developments."
"Underwriting 
- Increases in the frequency and severity of claims are almost certain to occur across both retail and commercial P&C business lines."
"This projection concerns not only property claims due to direct physical damage, but other coverages as well, such as those typically 
contained within business interruption, accident, entertainment, and travel policies."
"- Claims for liability coverages may also increase insofar as policyholders are considered negligent in protecting customers or other 
third parties from damages caused by extreme weather events."
"- In addition to impacts derived from policy exposures, it may also become increasingly cost-prohibitive for Allianz to obtain 
reinsurance coverages in line with our risk appetite and risk bearing capacity."
"Such developments might restrict our ability to 
underwrite some risk exposures and – in extreme cases – precipitate an exit from certain insurance markets."
"Impacts beyond availability of resources include phenomena such as 
permanent decreases in worker productivity due to frequent 
heatwaves or a loss in attractiveness for those tourist destinations no 
longer reliably providing the desired weather."
"Investments 
- An increased volatility in the availability – and therefore price – of raw materials has various implications at the individual company 
level, especially for those companies whose value generation is primarily dependent on the processing of raw materials."
"Collectively, 
these implications may have consequential impacts on overall economic activity."
"- Resource availability will emerge as an increasingly important consideration in the capital investment decisions of companies 
within certain sectors (e.g."
"manufacturing, timber, agriculture, fisheries)."
"Volatility and scarcity risks in raw material inputs will 
increase the required risk-adjusted return on such investments, which may lead to a higher number of boardroom decisions to forego 
potential profit-generating opportunities (i.e."
will trigger corporate retrenchment instead of expansion).
- Companies may struggle to optimally price their goods against a backdrop of higher price volatility for their production inputs.
"Participation in commodity markets to hedge against price volatility will likely come with a higher cost than in the past, as 
commodity markets react to the volatility by increasing the risk premium on futures contracts."
"- Beyond manufacturing and raw material processing, temperature volatility may also adversely impact weather dependent sectors, 
such as construction, tourism and sustainable energy generation."
"- Allianz is susceptible to financial market losses based on investment exposures to those companies and sectors most likely to be 
impacted by the above developments."
"Underwriting 
- Insurance portfolios may experience consequential shifts in the risk profile for those regions or sectors with the highest exposures to 
climate volatility, affecting both claims and insurance demand."
"In contrast to acute physical risks, these risks are not attributable to 
individual extreme weather events, but rather reflect permanent trends or slow-developing climate change impacts."
"- For example, rising sea levels that make coastal areas more prone to flooding are likely to increase claims costs and expenses for 
both retail and commercial property coverages."
"- Overall, while climate volatility risks are generally considered more long term in nature, if not carefully managed these 
developments will increase the potential risk for Allianz of losing market share, premium income or profitability."
"The above results demonstrate that the most relevant climate change 
risks for Allianz as an organization relate to proprietary investments 
and property-casualty underwriting."
"Risks related to company 
operations and life/health underwriting are also present, albeit to a 
lesser extent."
"In terms of time frames, the assessment foresees transition risks as 
more significant in the short to medium term than in the long term 
under scenarios where alignment with the goals of the Paris  
 
Agreement is rigorously pursued."
"This reflects the view that a large 
proportion of measures to address climate change will need to be 
introduced in the next 5 to 15 years, which will constitute a 
comparatively dynamic period of transition risk relevance."
"In terms of the most relevant physical risks, acute physical risks are 
likewise considered more significant over the short to medium term 
than the long term."
"While this may run contrary to the understanding 
that acute physical risks will continue to increase in both magnitude  
 
and frequency, the presumption is that adaptive measures will help 
blunt impact severity in the longer term."
"This includes both adaptive 
measures by external parties – such as regulations restricting or 
encouraging movement away from disaster prone areas – and 
mitigation measures by Allianz, such as improvements in the 
management of insurance risk concentrations and the pricing of 
insurance coverages."

When considering the above results, it is important to understand 
that outcomes of this qualitative process are highly dependent on the 
input of individual risk experts."
"Although the process leveraged 
research and statistical information where possible, professional 
judgment was applied in determining the impacts specific to Allianz."
"Provided that professional judgment is subject to various forms of bias, 
results are liable to change."
"In addition, the emergence of further 
statistical and other fact-based research may also influence 
conclusions."
"For further information on mitigation measures to address and 
manage risk impacts, please refer to the section “Conclusion”."
"Quantitative assessment of climate change risks 
The integrated climate change stress test presented in the following 
section complements the holistic qualitative risk assessment with 
quantitative information for a limited set of risks and risk transmission 
channels."
"It demonstrates our continuing efforts to build capabilities 
and capacities for quantitative climate change risk assessments and 
gain experience with sizing balance sheet exposures to climate 
change risks."
"The stress test covers both sides of the balance sheet by 
measuring asset- or liability-specific stress impacts, as well as their 
dependencies for a static balance sheet."
"We take into account a 
period up to 2050, which is relevant both for the implementation of key 
political and business strategies linked to the Paris Climate Agreement 
and for the onset of increasing global warming and its negative 
consequences."
"Impacts are estimated for market stresses, as well as 
property-casualty and life/health underwriting stresses, using 
NGFS1/IPCC2 scenario-based data from various sources."
"IPCC Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs) are the starting point of well-established scientific

are in scope for the assessment.
"The main focus of the analysis is to 
provide a best estimate for market value balance sheet impacts."
"For the current implementation of the integrated climate change stress 
test, we have considered five scenario narratives from the suite of 
NGFS reference scenarios."
"The (1) Net Zero 2050 scenario is 
determined by an orderly transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 
following the target to limit global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent 
climate policies at the cost of moderate economic strain in the initial 
years."
"The (2) Below 2 °C scenario assumes an early and orderly 
transition to a low-carbon economy, with an unambitious policy target 
to limit global warming to below 2 °C by the end of the century."
"In this 
scenario, policy action has limited impact on economic growth."
"In the 
(3) Delayed Transition scenario, GHG emissions remain high until 2030, 
when strong policy measures are taken to limit warming to below 2 °C."
"Physical risks are relatively small in these scenarios over the 2050 time 
horizon."
"The (4) Nationally Determined Contributions scenario includes all 
pledged climate policies, even if not yet implemented."
"However, these 
pledged policies are still insufficient to limit global warming to below 
2 °C, leading to increasing physical risks."
"Accounting only for climate 
policies that were in place before 2019, the (5) Current Policies 
scenario is characterized by limited transition risks and high physical 
risks, which start to become more visible over the second half of the 
projection period."
"NGFS scenarios are used to obtain financial market variables for 
application in the market stress module of the integrated climate 
change stress test."
"The market stresses themselves are applied to 
market values of both assets and liabilities of in-scope entities, where 
a simplified approach is used to assess the mitigation of stress impacts 
due to policyholder profit sharing."
"Scenario variables used in the 
property-casualty and life/health underwriting stress modules are 
derived from hazard models that are contingent on the IPCC’s RCPs 
2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5."
"For the life/health underwriting stress module, 
stress variables are based on a study by Gasparrini et al.3 that projects 
temperature-related excess mortality under various heat and cold 
pathways and their net change up to the end of the century."
"The 
life/health underwriting stresses are applied to the best estimate of

liabilities for biometric risk exposure.
"The property-casualty underwriting stresses are applied to the best 
estimate of liabilities for NatCat risk exposures."
"To separate the impact of climate change risk from trend growth, 
stress levels are assessed relative to a baseline or counterfactual 
scenario as defined by the NGFS, a hypothetical scenario in which 
neither progression of climate change nor the implementation of 
transition measures is assumed."
"Furthermore, the calculation of stress 
impacts is based on instantaneous stresses on the static year-end 2023 
balance sheet, without adaptation or mitigation actions from Allianz 
and its business partners."
"In particular, internal measures such as 
contract repricing, deployment of reinsurance strategies, or portfolio 
steering have not been taken into account, as well as external 
measures such as public investment in flood defences."
"Impact 
estimates from the different stress test modules are integrated based 
on a matching of global mean temperatures for 2050 between NGFS 
and IPCC scenarios as well as consideration of the overall scenario 
characteristics."
"No diversification between market stresses and 
underwriting stresses is assumed for the aggregation."
"Impact estimates from the integrated climate change stress test 
rely on scientific research and scenario data that is available and 
considered relevant as of the current point in time."
"Nevertheless, the 
magnitude of outcomes has to be treated with caution when 
accounting for the significant uncertainties inherent in climate change 
modeling and the crucial role of assumptions in long-term projections."
"Uncertainties around assumptions for the 
counterfactual scenario can also have a critical impact on results."

In terms of the aggregate market and property-casualty and 
life/health underwriting stress impacts, two key overarching 
observations may be derived."
"Secondly, market stress is the largest contributor to overall 
cumulative market value balance sheet impacts, exceeding the 
combined contribution from property-casualty and life/health 
underwriting stresses by a considerable margin."
"Expounding upon the above general observations at the individual 
scenario level, we note the following: 
− 
Moderate cumulative market value balance sheet impacts are 
realized in the Net Zero 2050 scenario, where the initial economic 
strain subsides rapidly until 2030."
"− 
The orderly implementation of the not too ambitious policy target 
in the Below 2 °C scenario comes with a low transition risk initially."
"Economic recovery 
is rather slow in this scenario."
"− 
Initial losses from transition risk in the Nationally Determined 
Contributions scenarios, comparable to losses in the Below 2 °C 
scenarios, turn into losses from physical risk in later years that 
gradually increase over time."
"Beyond 
this period, both the Current Policies and the Nationally 
Determined Contributions scenarios are expected to entail even 
more material losses as impacts from physical risks increase and 
outweigh transition risk impacts."
"An excerpt from the aggregated stress test results is shown in table 
“Estimated maximum adverse cumulative market value balance sheet 
impacts in NGFS/IPCC scenarios relative to a baseline scenario 
without climate change”."
"For example, with respect to property-
casualty underwriting, well-established techniques such as premium 
adjustments, changes in coverages, exclusions, expansions, or revisions 
to risk limits can all be effectively utilized."
"Despite this conclusion, the 
consequences in areas where climate change is set to fundamentally 
transform insurance markets are less predictable and require strategic 
attention."
"Fundamental transformation includes aspects such as 
coverage affordability, the shrinkage of existing markets, or the 
emergence of new markets, as well as products or coverages 
encompassing difficult-to-price risks (e.g., similar to industry 
experience around the emergence of cyber insurance)."
"From the quantitative perspective, the overall impact estimates 
derived from the integrated climate change stress test are considered 
to be within Allianz’s risk tolerance, considering both the magnitude of 
predicted losses and the time horizon over which they materialize."
"The approximate 
estimates we carried out on the effectiveness of selected management 
actions confirm this view."
"Addressing 
the 
immediate 
effects 
of 
climate 
policy 
implementation requires the incorporation of climate change-specific 
measures."
"These include long-term strategies aimed at aligning 
investment and insurance portfolios with climate policy targets, as 
formulated in our transition plan, see the section “Transition plan & 
strategy”."
"We will continue to refine our climate change risk assessments in 
line with the evolving understanding of assessment methodologies 
and improving data availability and quality, while also accounting for 
a shifting climatic and political baseline."

"It is an initiative that 
OEs can run in the countries we operate in and an initiative which we 
support financially with our SIF."
"For MoveNow, the SIF picks up and leverages existing formats 
from the partnerships with the IOC and the IPC."
"In 2023, it provided 
resources for 18 local partnerships that focus on the goals of SDG 8."
"To 
further support its local entities in setting their ambitions and 
measuring and reporting on the impact of corporate citizenship 
activities at a local level, Allianz has introduced the Allianz Social 
Impact Measurement Framework."

Responsible consumer/sales 
Our strong reputation is built on the trust our customers, shareholders, 
employees, and the general public place in our integrity."
"This trust 
hinges on the quality of our products, information, and advice, and on 
the personal conduct and capabilities of our sales employees and 
representatives."
"The Allianz Group Code of Conduct (CoC) is at the core of our 
corporate culture."
"The Code emphasizes that fairness towards 
customers and transparent communication about our products and 
services – including their limitations – maximizes our opportunity to 
earn the long-term trust of customers."
"This is expressed through our 
Global Sales Compliance Framework program, which specifies 
standardized processes and controls for communication, monitoring, 
and review, and is regularly updated to reflect regulatory 
developments."
"The Allianz Standard for Sales Compliance aims to promote and 
protect the interests of our customers."
"It is designed to ensure 
transparency and the fair, honest, and responsible treatment of Allianz 
customers in their purchase of our financial products and their 
dealings with us."
"The Standard lays the foundation for a 
comprehensive customer protection framework designed to ensure all 
Allianz entities adhere to its prudential norms and robust protection."
"It 
covers five key areas to address conduct risk: Product Oversight and 
Governance, Incentives and Steering of Distributors, Standard of 
Distribution, Sales Force Selection and Training, and Monitoring and 
Reporting."
"We use the globally recognized Net Promoter Score® (NPS) as our 
key metric for measuring customer loyalty through customers’ 
willingness to recommend Allianz."
"In 2022, we switched to digital NPS 
tracking."
"The digital NPS paradigm allows us to measure customer 
loyalty continuously, eliminating seasonality and deepening our 
understanding of customers’ sentiment."
"Additionally, the new 
measurement sets higher standards for our operating entities, which 
are measured against a broader set of competitors."
"This year, we 
achieved a remarkable NPS of 59 % Loyalty Leadership across all our 
business segments."
"This result exceeds our target (50 % loyalty leaders 
by 2024) and reinforces our position as a trusted and preferred 
insurance and financial service partner."
"Our Voice of the Customer program applies a holistic and 
standardized methodology to monitor and improve the customer 
experience by collecting real-time qualitative and quantitative 
feedback."
"Customers are invited to rate their satisfaction on a five-star 
scale after their recent experience at predefined touch points along 
five customer journeys."
"To this end, we map the main interactions a 
customer has with Allianz along the following journeys: Sales & 
Onboarding; Claims; Issue Resolution & Contract Management; 
Renewal, Cancelation & Termination; and Outbound Communication."
"If customers rate their experience with three stars or fewer, we follow 
up with them to resolve the issue directly and gather more insights."
"We use insights from Voice of the Customer and NPS to improve 
our products, services, communications, and processes."
"We combine 
and analyze sources of customer data in strict accordance with 
applicable privacy laws to prioritize and implement structural 
improvements."
"Local operating entities use customer feedback to 
derive concrete actions."
"Findings from the VoC and dNPS programs also help us design 
the global Allianz experience for our customers."
"In 2023, we continued 
our journey to co-create and scale one global Allianz customer 
experience by developing additional initiatives."
"Firstly, we continued to 
implement the Annual Policy Review initiative, which was launched in 
November 2022, as a way to engage with customers and discuss their 
insurance portfolio and current needs."
"Secondly, we worked together with the Allianz Behavioral 
Economics team to improve the policy renewal communication 
template by providing customers with more clarity and transparency."
"And thirdly, in June 2023, we launched a global Prewarning & 
Prevention initiative, focused on helping customers prevent damage to 
their property due to climate-related events."
"Working with climate 
scientists and risk experts across the Group, we co-created the Global 
Risk Assessment (GloRiA) tool and customer education assets, which 
enable users to learn more about the Nat Cat risks associated with 
their place of residence."
"The Allianz Customer Model (ACM) is our end-to-end global 
business model that puts the customer at the center of our business 
and enables Allianz to be simple, digital, and scalable."
"Our ambition 
is to simplify and harmonize our business globally."
"Within this context, the Allianz Customer Model was designed first 
for Retail Property and Casualty lines and then extended to Health, 
Life, B2B2C, MidCorp, Large Corporate and Reinsurance."
"Our target has been to continuously roll out the model across 
Allianz operating entities."
"As of the second quarter of 2023, ACM has 
been rolled out to 39 operating entities, comprising 99 % of gross 
written premium (GWP) for our retail Property and Casualty business."
"A tangible example of how the Allianz Customer Model is 
transforming our business is our Master Products."
"A Master Product is 
a template available in the Allianz Product Lab with streamlined 
product elements that are linked to harmonized claims and pricing 
values."
"Allianz OEs can configure Master Products to create the right 
product for their market and make adaptations that are required by 
regulation."
"So far, we have created 21 Property-Casualty Master 
Products which cover more than 90 % of Property-Casualty GWP in our 
OEs (excluding global lines)."
"Harmonized Master Products allow us to 
efficiently scale essential IT assets such as Quote & Buy and First 
Notification of Loss in the Business Master Platform."
"This platform 
digitalizes the business requirements of the ACM."
"It comprises 
a combination of scalable technological elements, systems and 
services plus functionalities and configurations, to better serve our 
customers, intermediaries, partners, and employees."
"This involves transforming the whole value chain across products, 
sales, claims, and operations."
"Our aim is to continuously roll out the 
model across Allianz OEs."
"Rather than selling individual insurance products, our vision is to 
evolve our products into full ecosystems and offer customers relevant 
and trusted solutions."
"In addition, we are using the ACM to upgrade 
customer journeys at the Group level."
"Our approach to customer responsibility and compliance is 
described in the section “04.3” of our Group Sustainability Report 2023 
on the Allianz company website."

Cybersecurity 
In this section, we describe the impact of cybersecurity on our business 
activities and relationships, as well as the impact of the Allianz Group´s 
activities and relationships with regard to IT topics."
"In addition, we 
describe the concepts and achievements related to the management 
of these impacts with a focus on information security, data privacy, and 
data ethics."
"Information security is the application of technologies, processes, and 
controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices, and data 
from unauthorized access and against cyberattacks, and to meet 
related regulatory requirements."
"Our dedicated Information Security 
function aims to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of 
information across the Allianz Group."
"As a core business discipline, information security is managed 
globally through a robust and mature governance framework aligned 
with international standard ISO 27001."
"Our approach is closely 
monitored by a dedicated Group Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) function and the Allianz SE Board of Management."
"An 
executive accountability regime supports the enforcement of the 
governance framework for all entities."
"The Allianz Information Security Governance Framework 
comprises multiple layers of corporate rules and processes."
"An overall 
policy establishes core principles, roles, and responsibilities, as well as 
the Information Technology and Information Security organizational 
framework within the Allianz Group."
"The functional rules are complemented by detailed descriptions 
of best practices to be followed across 16 defined topics to ensure the 
“‘security by design”’ principle."
"Information security is regularly audited, 
both internally and externally, and regular training is provided through 
dedicated exercises across all layers of the organization."
"To fulfill our commitment, cyber risk is assessed and tracked as 
one of the top risks faced by Allianz and is closely managed along key 
risk indicators covering security maturity, risk exposure, and security 
operations across the Allianz Group."
"Performance against these 
indicators is discussed, reviewed, and reported quarterly to the Board 
of Management and Supervisory Board."
"Monitoring for cyber 
incidents, and measures to prevent them from occurring, are 
implemented at a global level and supplemented locally where 
required, together with the local CISOs that exist in all Allianz 
operating entities."
"Specific actions to improve security controls are continuously 
evaluated and developed with priorities assigned on a global, risk- 
based view that is informed by the current and expected threat 
landscape."
"Actions to achieve our cyber risk targets focus on five key 
risk areas: reducing the likelihood of incidents; increasing the 
likelihood of detection; reducing damage from incidents; streamlining 
compliance; and training/educating the organization to further 
improve security awareness."
"All employees are required to participate in cyber-awareness 
training at least quarterly."
"This training includes activities like 
simulated phishing e-mails, awareness campaigns, and dedicated 
information security training, with the latter being offered regularly."
"We also participate in industry and global/regional initiatives to 
support the security of the internet ecosystem as a whole."
"Further information on our commitment to information security is 
described in the section “05.1.1” in our Group Sustainability Report 
2023 on the Allianz company website."
"Protecting personal data and maintaining trust in our processes are 
key priorities."
"Our customers, employees, and other stakeholders 
expect us to treat their data with the utmost care and we take this 
responsibility extremely seriously."
"We are committed to the highest 
standards to protect customer privacy and we work closely with other 
stakeholders involved in the update and modernization of European 
privacy legislation, including industry associations, members of 
parliament, and authorities."
"We also strive to communicate honestly 
and openly about actions that involve the personal data we process 
by publishing privacy notices that explain who we are, how we collect, 
share, and use personal data, and how individuals can exercise their 
privacy rights."
"Our group-wide privacy program ensures compliance with all 
relevant data privacy laws and regulations."
"All data privacy matters 
are overseen by Group Data Privacy."
"The Allianz Privacy Standard (APS) is our global standard for data 
privacy and the foundation of the Allianz Privacy Framework."
"As the 
highest policy document in the Allianz Privacy Framework, the APS 
defines rules and principles for collecting and processing personal 
data, including the ten privacy principles that all employees must 
respect wherever they are in the world: 
1."
"Data quality (purpose limitation, data minimization and storage 
limitation)."
"Lawful basis (personal data is only processed if we have a lawful 
basis to do so)."
"Transparency and openness towards employees and customers 
on where personal data is stored and used."
"Relationships with data processors (ensure organizations that 
process personal data on our behalf adhere to our privacy 
requirements)."
Adequate protection of personal data when it is transferred.
"Security 
and 
confidentiality 
(appropriate 
technical 
and 
organizational security safeguards are in place to protect 
personal data)."
Timely reporting of personal data breaches.
Privacy by design and default.
Cooperation with data protection authorities.
"In addition to the APS, our data protection authority has approved our 
Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), which allow Allianz Group 
companies to lawfully transfer personal data from within the 
European Economic Area to other jurisdictions, where it is required for 
business purposes."
"Our employees play a critical role in upholding our commitment 
to protect personal data."
"To ensure all our employees have the 
knowledge to properly use and safeguard personal data, they are 
required to complete annual privacy training."
"This training covers the 
Allianz Privacy Framework requirements in detail and provides a solid 
foundational understanding of core privacy concepts and the proper 
handling of personal data."
"For Privacy Experts, five-day Privacy Expert 
Training is focused on providing Data Privacy Professionals and Data 
Protection Officers with the practical knowledge to effectively conduct 
their day-to-day activities."
"For Privacy Champions, two-day Privacy 
Champion Training is focused on the practical knowledge and 
exercises required for the Privacy Champion role to ensure data 
protection compliance within the business."
"As part of our Privacy Risk Management process, we identify and 
manage privacy risks at the operational process level to ensure they 
are measured, monitored, and mitigated across our core businesses."
"Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) of processes that use personal 
data – such as customer health data and employee data – enable the 
early identification of privacy risks and ensure they are managed 
appropriately."
"We 
designed a TIA template in our privacy management platform, which 
was rolled out to all our operating entities in the EEA to ensure such 
assessments are conducted in a consistent, semi-automated way."
"In committing to the highest standards of data protection, we 
believe the maintenance of a state-of-the-art privacy program needs 
to be supported by diligent and continuous monitoring and assurance 
activities."
"Privacy reviews require every operating entity, global line, 
and regional office to undergo a rigorous examination of the design, 
implementation, and effectiveness of its local privacy program and 
related process and controls."
"The frequency of these reviews is based 
on risk, but they are carried out at least once every five years."
"As of the 
end of 2023, we have conducted 22 privacy reviews, including joint 
reviews with Information Security and peer Data Protection Officers 
(DPOs)."
"This is a 37 % increase compared to 2022 and concludes the 
five-year privacy review cycle."
"For further information on our commitment to data privacy, 
please refer to the section “05.1.2” in our Group Sustainability Report 
2023 on the Allianz company website."
"Our aim is to maintain stakeholder trust and position Allianz as a 
leader in conducting data-driven business in a trustworthy and ethical 
manner."
"This includes elevating data ethics as well as selected data 
and analytics-related topics in the governance and decision-making 
processes of the Allianz Group."
"We strive for a responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) in our 
business activities based on a strong AI Governance Framework."
"This 
includes ensuring a human-centric approach in our usage of AI 
systems."
"For each AI system, an appropriate level of human control 
must be determined according to the inherent risks of harm for 
individuals as part of a Privacy and Ethics Impact Assessment."
"Ensuring compliance with current and upcoming regulations and 
embedding best practices in anticipation of regulatory change are 
also high priorities in fulfilling our data ethics commitments."
"In 2023, the DAB monitored the 
final implementation of the Allianz Practical Guidance for AI in OEs 
that are members of the Renewal Agenda Committee."
"Furthermore, emerging risks regarding generative AI have been 
addressed by dedicated guidelines in further development of the 
Allianz Practical Guidance for AI."
"Training led by Group Privacy and 
Group Data Analytics has been expanded to target a broader 
employee base as well as employees who develop and/or use AI in 
applicable OEs."
"For further information on our commitment to data ethics, please 
refer to the section “05.1.3” in our Group Sustainability Report 2023 on 
the Allianz company website."
"We are constantly developing our solutions to enable customers to 
manage cyber threats."
"As an example, Allianz (within its commercial 
Property-Casualty products) has eradicated around 98 % of silent 
cyber exposure, therefore providing clarity to customers on what is and 
is not covered within the products."
"As an insurer, we combine policy and 
service improvements to help businesses understand the need to 
strengthen their controls."
"We continue to evolve cyber risk exposure 
coverage across Property-Casualty policies spanning commercial, 
corporate, and specialty insurance segments."
"The Cyber Underwriting 
Strategy addresses exposures to cyber risks and is reviewed regularly 
to ensure policies are updated and clarified in response to cyber risks."

Fair remuneration 
Allianz is committed to equity and fairness as defined in our 
Allianz Group Code of Conduct."
"This includes ensuring Allianz 
operating entities enforce equal pay for equal work in the same or 
comparable roles for all genders."
"This principle is outlined in our 
Allianz Group Remuneration Policy."
"An annual global equal pay 
review across the organization identifies equal pay gaps which can be 
mitigated with appropriate action."
"In addition to equal pay, there is also a gender pay gap to be 
considered."
"This consists of the difference in average remuneration 
between men and women across a whole organization, irrespective of 
role or seniority."
"If one gender is more represented in higher paid, 
senior roles in one organization, for example, there will be a gender 
pay gap."
"Allianz takes several actions to foster gender equity in 
representation and thus close the gender pay gap."
"One important 
action is the ambition to have higher female representation in senior 
positions."
"To reach our gender representation targets, we monitor the 
percentage of our female employees on a quarterly basis and 
implement concrete actions towards target achievement."
"We also 
foster best practice exchange among operating entities to drive 
gender equality in representation (see also the section “Diversity, 
Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)”)."

"In 
a few countries, unemployment benefits are excluded in case of self-termination of work contract, for 
Our Global Benefits Strategy for the insurance business is 
structured around these four pillars."
"We introduced minimum 
standards for benefits available to employees across Allianz in 1Q 
2023, and we expect our global rebranding and communication 
campaign to further increase the transparency and visibility of Allianz 
benefits among employees in 2024."
"Benefits take economic, environmental, and social factors into 
account, and incentives are oriented towards creating long-term value 
and financial protection."
"The Allianz Employee Share Purchase Plan 
(ESPP) for instance offers employees Allianz shares at favorable 
conditions in 43 countries, allowing them to benefit from the success of 
the company and its long-term performance."
"As a token of 
appreciation for meeting previous year Group targets, Allianz offered 
one Allianz Free Share – or its cash equivalent in countries that do not 
offer the ESPP – to employees globally in 2023."
"For further information on employee benefits, please refer to our 
People Fact Book 2023 and our Global recruiting homepage."
"Social protection 
We operate in countries where our employees have at least access to 
social protection programs against loss of income due to major life 
events: sickness, unemployment, employment injury, parental leave, 
and retirement."
"In countries where social protection is not provided 
through public social security schemes, we aim to close potential gaps 
through additional offerings."
"Best practice examples are our entities in 
the United States, where Allianz provides health insurance benefits, or 
India, where we provide paternity, and carer leave options.1 
Health and safety 
The health, safety, physical, and mental well-being of our employees is 
a top priority."
"We aim to sustain and improve employee health and 
well-being across our global workforce."
"Two key levers to achieve this 
ambition are our Minimum Health Requirements and our 
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system."
"The four Minimum Health Requirements are: 
example in Croatia or in Türkiye."
"In Singapore and Hong Kong unemployment benefits are generally not 
part of the social security system."
"Professional Support: Allianz offers employees 24/7 free of 
charge access to professional psychological support through 
Employee Assistance Programs."
"Leadership Enablement: Allianz offers targeted health and well-
being training for people leaders, through both the #lead 
program and other platforms to ensure managers are equipped 
with the knowledge to sustain employee health and well-being 
as well as to strengthen resilience in their teams."
"Employee Feedback: Employees have the opportunity to give 
once a year feedback on their health and well-being through 
global surveys, such as Pulse surveys."
"For further information, 
please refer to the section “Engaging with own workforce”."
"Focus Time: Meeting-free calendar days have been introduced to 
provide most employees with time to focus on their work."
"The four Minimum Health Requirements are reinforced by the 
“Agreement on Guidelines concerning Work Related Stress and 
Minimum Health Requirements” between the Allianz SE and the 
(European) SE Works Council of Allianz SE."
"It applies to Allianz SE and its 
subsidiaries with registered offices in the Member States of the E.U., the 
contracting states of the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland."
"All best endeavors 
will be made to adopt the minimum health requirements across the 
Allianz Group, where national legislation does not prevent this."
"The minimum health requirements were monitored regularly and 
reported to both management and employee representatives once a 
year, which shows our commitment to the well-being of our global 
workforce."
"To effectively manage OHS matters, most local Allianz entities 
have furthermore implemented OHS management systems."
"They 
include OHS risk and hazards assessments, dedicated action plans to 
mitigate these risks as well as emergency actions."
"Internal inspections 
take place frequently and progress in reducing and preventing health 
issues and risks is assessed against targets on a regular basis."
"This 
includes procedures to investigate work-related injuries, ill health, 
diseases, and incidents."
"Our workforce is trained regularly to raise 
awareness and reduce operational health and safety incidents."

"Flexible working 
Allianz offers a wide range of offerings."
"For us, hybrid working 
combines the best of both worlds: the flexibility of mobile working with 
the benefits of targeted collaboration and in-person connection."
"Flexible work options are key for talent attraction and employee 
engagement, while regular in-person touch points help us foster team 
spirit, co-creation, and cross-team exchange."
"Most of our employees across the globe have the opportunity to 
spend a minimum of 40 % of their working hours working from outside 
the office."
"Our global minimum offering provides a lot of 
empowerment, trust, and flexibility to our local teams to decide what 
works best for their customers, their business, and their teams."
"The 
flexible work offerings therefore differ in our operating entities but for 
all of them customer centricity and customer needs are the north star."
"We track the actual employee time that was spent working 
outside the Allianz offices on a biannual basis and collect employee 
feedback in our AES survey."
"The survey results show that flexible work 
has been one of the positive drivers for employee engagement in 
2023."
"For further information on further flexible work options, please 
refer to our People Fact Book 2023 on the Allianz company website."

services."
"Family-related leave is specific to countries and usually covers 
maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave, and carers’ leave."
"Allianz adheres to all statutory requirements in the countries we 
operate in and aims to exceed those standards where possible and 
appropriate."
"Collective bargaining coverage and social 
dialogue 
We aim to ensure that employee rights are protected across all Allianz 
operating entities."
"Allianz was one of the first companies to create pan-
European worker participation standards and to establish a European 
SE Works Council under the legislation for Societas Europaea (SE) 
companies (an agreement concerning the participation of employees 
in Allianz SE)."
"Through this body and the regular dialogue between 
management and employee representatives and their trade unions, 
Allianz ensures effective representation of all its employees at 
European level."
"Our (European) Works Council Executive Committee 
is evidence that Allianz endorses the establishment of employee 
representatives in its Group companies and welcomes their 
cooperation with the trade unions."
Employee representation is widespread across Europe.
"The right 
of workers to establish workers’ representative bodies and thus 
negotiate working conditions is guaranteed by law in many 
jurisdictions."
"The mandate of workers’ representatives and the role of 
the employer in regard to collective bargaining and the social 
dialogue is very much shaped by local legal requirements."
"Allianz supports the principles enshrined in the ILO (International 
Labour Organization) core conventions on freedom of association and 
collective bargaining."
"In countries where those principles have been 
enshrined in local law, we fully respect and implement local rules on 
trade unions and worker representation."
"In countries that have not 
ratified the relevant ILO conventions, we respect the primacy of local 
laws and look for ways to allow our employees to organize and voice 
their interests vis-à-vis management."
"Globally, the percentage of 
Allianz’s workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements is 
48.46 %."
"According to CSRD reporting requirements, ""coverage"" includes 
the number of employees to whom the companies concerned are 
obliged to apply the collective agreements."
"Irrespective of the 
obligation, there are a large number of companies that apply the 
collective agreements and provisions on a voluntary basis."
"We work closely with employee representatives (members of the 
(European) SE Works Council’s Executive Committee and employee 
representatives on the supervisory board of Allianz SE) to support 
change implementation, manage impacts on employees, and 
promote opportunities."
"The “social dialogue” is our pan-European 
forum that has existed for over a decade."
"It supports the progress of 
our business strategy, our agenda, and our response to the increased 
pace of change in topics such as the digital revolution."

"This section outlines the two strategic sub-sections Diversity, Equity, 
and Inclusion (DEI), focusing on Gender and Age distribution, and 
Persons with disabilities."
"We further describe the Strategic Workforce 
Planning topic."
"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 
Diversity is a core element of our culture."
"Our customers are diverse, 
and in order to best understand and serve them, our workforce needs 
to be diverse, too."
"We believe that diverse teams create better results, 
show higher resilience, and are more innovative and more productive, 
provided they can act in an environment where everyone can be 
themselves and unique views are appreciated."
"Being both diverse and 
inclusive has a positive impact on our business."
"We are committed to strengthening inclusion in our workplace, by 
ensuring equal opportunities for all, and shaping a diverse workforce 
along five DEI dimensions: gender, people with disabilities, 
nationalities/ethnicities, generations, and LGBTQ+."
"including gender, age, sexual orientation, ethnicity, nationality, 
physical or mental abilities, religious beliefs, or social background."
"At Allianz, we want to achieve our targets and ambitions for our DEI 
dimensions in a sustainable manner."
"The key to this is an inclusive 
workplace environment."
"The GIC has been in place since 
2007 and consists of more than 20 Allianz senior managers from 
operating entities, Allianz Group Center representatives, and the 
leads of our five global employee networks for DEI which leads to 
81 local network chapters."
"− 
DEI Employee Networks: Employee networks enable us to engage 
with our employees."
"They help us to raise awareness, support 
employees, advocate for change, and shape the agenda for DEI."
"We have five global employee networks: “Allianz NEO” for gender 
inclusion, “Allianz Beyond” for disability inclusion, “Allianz GRACE” 
for ethnicity and cultural inclusion, “Allianz Engage” for 
generational inclusion, and “Allianz Pride” for LGBTQ+ inclusion."
15 new networks operating locally were added in 2023.
"− 
DEI as part of daily business – Mentoring Campaign: At Allianz, 
DEI is integrated into the way we conduct business."
"Our global 
Mentoring Campaign #KeepExploring, which took place 
throughout 2023, championed an intersectional approach 
featuring personal experiences of employees presenting more 
than one diversity dimension, e.g."
"combining different generations 
with nationalities, and/or genders."
"Global People and Culture monitor the development of our targets 
and ambitions on a regular basis and report progress to the Allianz 
Board of Management on a semi-annual basis (for gender, this is done 
on a quarterly basis)."
"Additionally, we support operating entities in 
setting up their individual local action plans to reach DEI targets and 
foster best practice exchange."
"The achievements of our DEI strategy are recognized by external 
global awards and rankings."
"For example, Refinitiv – a global Diversity 
and Inclusion Index – identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies 
with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces."
"In 2023, Allianz was 
ranked #1 in the Insurance industry and #1 in Germany across all 
industries."
"Our reputation as a DEI leader strengthens Allianz’s brand 
as a trusted provider of financial services."

are committed to equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, and 
put measures in place to see this reflected in the staffing of leadership 
positions."
"As outlined in our Allianz Functional Guidelines for DEI1, our 
2024 targets are to have 30 % women in Allianz Global Executive 
positions, and 30 % women in Allianz Senior Executive positions."

opportunities, creating dialogue and allyship, and endorsing new 
perspectives and novel working models for both women and men."
"Generations 
With five different generations currently working together at Allianz, 
we are committed to leveraging the combined strengths, individual 
skills, and experiences of all generations."
"We aim to have a balanced 
generational representation, where GenZ and GenY (employees 
under 35) represent at least 25 % of our global workforce."
"As of the end 
of 2023, 34.31 % of our global workforce (see table S1-9.2) is younger 
than 35, which ensures a balanced generational representation."
"Our efforts for age inclusion are strongly supported by Allianz Engage, 
our employee network for generational diversity with 11 local networks in 
place."

that our processes and workplaces are equally accessible to everyone, 
irrespective of their disability status."
"Allianz Beyond, our employee network for disability inclusion, 
currently has 12 local networks in place, with three local networks 
launched in 2023."
"It focuses on raising awareness of disability inclusion, 
identifying ways to make Allianz more accessible (physically and 
digitally)."
"It also aims at creating a safe space for employees to 
disclose their disability and voice their workplace assistance needs in 
order to perform at their best."
"And it promotes Allianz externally as an 
attractive employer for people with disabilities."

"Strategic Workforce Planning 
Allianz has implemented Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) to 
create transparency on upcoming workforce developments."
"SWP 
compares workforce supply by cluster of job profiles (called Talent 
Segments) against projected workforce demand over the next five 
years."
"At Allianz, this is a structured yearly process that is integrated 
into the annual planning cycle."
"The result goes far beyond providing 
transparency on possible recruiting gaps."
"We are able to steer the mix 
of roles that we need in our workforce in order to implement Allianz 
strategies and fulfil our future vision."
"SWP provides a quantitative 
assessment of the resources required for ongoing transformations and 
indicates how our workforce can be equipped with the skills they need 
to remain employable in the future."
"This global transparency allows us to decide what to focus our 
work on and customize solutions for up- and reskilling as well as 
retention and recruiting."
"SWP currently covers approximately 85 % of 
our 2023 employee population."
"Global monitoring and steering using 
SWP KPIs ensures the implementation of Strategic Workforce 
Planning and maximizes its value within the business functions."
"Good working conditions along with equal treatment and equal 
opportunities for all are the basis for the CSRD convergence approach 
discussed in this Employee matters section."

"In 2021, the Compliance Assurance of Risks and Effectiveness 
(CARE) program was initiated."
"In 2023, the Compliance Function 
continued to develop the way it assesses Group and local Compliance 
departments."
"Review procedures have been expanded to confirm 
adequate compliance scope, ensure adequate skills to meet the scope, 
and confirm compliance with global programs and local specificities."
"While CARE is primarily a challenged self-assessment exercise, it is 
reinforced with Compliance Reviews of operating entities that are 
completed 
and 
coordinated 
by 
Allianz Group 
Compliance."
"Compliance Reviews are completed on a risk-based, three-yearly 
cycle."
"Compliance Reviews are supplemented by Targeted Reviews, 
which assess the implementation status and effectiveness of individual 
programs such as Antitrust and Sales Compliance."
"This multi-faceted 
review and confirmation strategy has several benefits."
"First, operating 
entities are monitored more frequently and are engaged in more 
holistic assurance activities."
"Second, frequent interactions with 
operating entities provide additional opportunities to monitor, guide, 
and – if necessary – enforce remedial activities."
"Finally, people can 
learn from local and Group best practices, which further reinforces our 
compliance culture."
"An online compliance management tool provides an overview of 
issues detected during the above activities."
"Users are required to use 
the tool to report and document actions taken to mitigate and follow 
up on any issues identified."
"The information gathered is the primary basis of reports to the 
Group Board and the Allianz SE Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee."

Allianz has zero tolerance of fraud.
"We are committed to 
complying with all applicable anti-fraud, anti-bribery, and anti-
corruption laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we operate."
"Zero tolerance applies regardless of who benefits from the fraud – 
Allianz as a company, other internal parties (employees, tied agents, 
intermediaries) or any third parties acting on behalf of Allianz."
"To 
protect against fraud, we will take prompt and appropriate action 
where necessary – against employees, others acting on behalf of 
Allianz or third parties."
"This includes appropriately protecting customer 
and third-party data."
"Similarly, Allianz does not tolerate bribery and corruption."
"Anti-corruption training must be provided at least once every 
three years to all employees."
"Employees are encouraged to report concerns and have multiple 
channels for doing so."
"These include via management, speaking

"The EU Taxonomy Regulation came into 
effect in 2020 and Allianz is reporting Taxonomy-eligibility for the third 
year in a row; however, Taxonomy-alignment is reported from the 
financial year 2023 onwards (described subsequently) only."
"The EU 
Taxonomy Regulation intends to provide increased transparency for 
stakeholders."
"On 21 December 2023, the EU Commission published a guidance 
on Art."
8 EU Taxonomy Regulation.
"The document was assessed by 
Allianz but could not be fully considered for the 2023 reporting.1 
Details about the implemented changes can be found in the 
respective subchapters."
"Allianz’s approach to Sustainable Solutions in the 
Property and Casualty insurance business 
We are regarding the EU Taxonomy Regulation in the broader context 
of sustainable insurance solutions and are consequently reporting on 
it in combination with our Sustainable Solutions framework."
"It is an integral part of our strategy to not only insure our 
customers against risks, but also to support them in their challenges of 
a world which is about to transition to a more sustainable way of living 
and doing business."
"We aim to create real world impact through our 
business activities and contribute to ESG objectives based on science 
and in line with regulatory requirements and international 
agreements."
"This is based on the understanding that property-
casualty (P&C) insurance can support multiple ESG objectives beyond 
climate change adaptation."
"The role of the insurance industry is not 
limited to the classic role as risk managers but goes beyond and 
includes the public expectations to accelerate a fair and just transition 
of economies and societies."
"and definitions, a certification grid, governance, and defined processes 
to safeguard us against greenwashing risks, provide strategic 
guidance to explore business opportunities, and take corporate 
responsibility for our planet."
"Under the Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework, the Technical 
Screening Criteria (Annex 2, 10.1, Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2021/2139) (Climate Delegated Act) supplementing the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation) serve as minimum requirements to qualify 
products as sustainable."
"Simultaneously, the Technical Screening 
Criteria are used as guidance for our product development with the 
objective to increase the resilience of our insurance activities and 
support our customers in building adaptive capacity."
"In 2023, the first year of Taxonomy-alignment reporting, we have 
been focusing on screening our existing product portfolio, identifying 
gaps, working on immediate actions to close gaps in existing products, 
and have started developing and implementing further new 
Taxonomy-aligned products."
"The Climate Delegated Act and the Technical Screening Criteria 
set forth therein predominantly expect insurance activities to 
adequately reflect climate-related risks and support customers and 
society in building resilience against the adverse effects of climate 
change."
"It consequently reflects the traditional role of the insurance 
industry as risk manager."
"Only the “do no significant harm” and 
“minimum safeguards” criteria set additional requirements for 
Taxonomy-alignment beyond the contribution to climate change 
adaptation."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation does not impose business 
restrictions or material requirements for insurance activities but 
introduces disclosure obligations for the insurance Lines of Business 
(LoBs) in scope."
"EU Taxonomy-eligibility  
The eight LoBs of non-life insurance laid down in the Technical 
Screening Criteria are in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
(“Taxonomy-eligible”), as the insurance products sold under these LoBs 
have the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation."
"We 
define all P&C LoBs laid down in Annex 2 section 10.1 of the Climate 
Delegated as eligible and they have been included in the Taxonomy-
alignment screening."
"The template “Taxonomy KPIs for non-life 
underwriting” below also includes our Taxonomy-eligible and 
Taxonomy-non-eligible proportions for financial year 2022."
"Since 
Taxonomy-alignment has been assessed for the first time by Allianz for 
financial year 2023, the 2022 figures are not applicable for these lines 
and marked as such."
"EU Taxonomy-alignment 
Taxonomy-alignment of an activity goes beyond Taxonomy-eligibility."
"We have screened 
our entire eligible non-life insurance portfolio under the Article 3 
Taxonomy Regulation and the Technical Screening Criteria and are 
reporting accordingly."
"It is in the nature of new regulations that not all details are 
specified, and a common understanding and application needs to be 
developed across markets to achieve consistency and comparability."
"In order to ensure a consistent application across all Allianz entities, we 
have developed internal guidelines and also taken a conservative 
approach, where screening criteria left room for interpretation."
"The Allianz approach to state-of-the-art pricing is the Technical Price 
System as part of our Technical Excellence initiative."
"In the existing 
Technical Price Certification (TPC), portfolios are screened on a regular 
basis across the Allianz Group."
"A successful TPC requires (but is not 
limited to), that the technical price is available at policy level."
"This 
includes the best estimate of all future, expected costs of the risk 
(including the expected ultimate loss) as a forward-looking scenario."
"Both output from hazard mapping and NatCat risk models are 
included in expected claims costs."
"Where and to the extent that a 
portfolio meets our internal TPC requirements, we have concluded 
that predicted costs of climate related hazards are properly reflected 
in the Technical Price at best estimate."
"Provide incentives for risk reduction (1.3): This criterion is based on 
the fundamental understanding, that the insurer should protect itself 
and set incentives for customers to protect themselves or their assets, 
against the adverse effects of climate change."
"Therefore, it is 
necessary, however sufficient, if the climate-related exposure is 
considered in pricing as a price signal of risk (e.g., hazard zones) or in 
terms and conditions such as deductibles or limits, that serve as a 
differentiator for respective exposures."
"Product design  
Risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders (2.1): 
The regulator expects an insurance product to include risk-based 
rewards for customers to take preventive actions in order to protect 
themselves or their insured assets against climate change risks."
"Other 
than for the previous criterion (“Provide incentives for risk-reduction), 
differentiation only related to the location of a risk is not sufficient."
"We 
define preventive actions as any specific measures that can be taken 
by customers if they are suitable to reduce either the frequency or 
severity of climate change related claims."
"They must be considered in 
the product and be offered to all customers."
"Risk-based rewards must 
be reflected in the technical price, and there has to be a direct relation 
between the preventive measure taken by the customer, and the risk-
based reward granted."
"Hence, general deductibles which do not refer 
to specific preventive measures or no claims discounts are not 
sufficient."
1_Principles for Sustainable Insurance – United Nations Environment – Finance Initiative (unepfi.org).
"Thus, the distribution strategy must include 
measures to ensure that customers (new and existing) are informed 
about the preventive measures and the relevance of such preventive 
measure that they could take."
"It is also appropriate to briefly inform the 
customers about the topic and direct them to more detailed 
information, for instance on a company website."
"Do no significant harm (“DNSH”) – Climate change mitigation 
The DNSH criterion defines which insurance activities related to 
customers engaged in the fossil fuel value chain must not be classified 
as sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned)."
"We are taking a mainly 
conservative approach and define the fossil fuel value chain 
extensively as upstream (e.g., exploration, extraction), midstream (e.g., 
transport, storage, pipelines) or downstream (e.g., refinery, trading and 
sales including gas stations) activities or related assets."
"Additionally, 
we consider commercially used fossil fuel power plants to be part of 
the fossil fuel value chain."
"Beyond that, the end-use of fossil fuels is not 
in scope of this criterion (e.g., combustion engine vehicles or oil-fired 
heating systems)."
"Thus, the DNSH criterion is automatically fulfilled for 
retail business, as private use is considered as end-use."
"We have screened our portfolios against 
this internal classification system."
"As our commercial risks are allocated 
to ISIC codes (or comparable national or internal classifications), we 
could identify policies and revenues which do not comply with DNSH."
"There are no further environmental objectives next to “climate 
change mitigation” that insurance activities could significantly harm 
according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, meaning that an 
assessment of further DNSH criteria is not applicable."
"These are still 
indicated with a “Y” in the template “Taxonomy KPIs for non-life 
underwriting” below."
"Minimum Safeguards   
Taxonomy-aligned activities needs to be carried out in compliance 
with Minimum Safeguards with respect to the value chain (i.e., with 
respect to policyholders in the insurance context)."
"Minimum 
Safeguards require a due diligence process which is aligned with UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and OECD 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
"This is ensured by our 
Sustainability referral process governed by the Allianz Standard for 
Reputational Risk Management (AS RRIM), which applies to insurance 
transactions following a risk-based approach."
"For more information on 
the Sustainability referral process, please refer to the Allianz 
Sustainability Integration Framework, version 5.0 on the Allianz 
company website."
"Overall results of EU Taxonomy Screening  
For the financial year 2023 we are reporting a relatively low share of 
Taxonomy-aligned revenues."
"Risk-based rewards for preventative 
actions and the respective advice to customers turned out to be the 
most important aspects."
"We have been focusing on screening our 
existing product portfolio, identifying gaps, working on immediate 
actions to close gaps in existing products, and started developing and 
implementing further new Taxonomy-aligned products."
"Allianz’s Sustainable Solutions 
Changing customer expectations and demands as well as regulatory 
evolution are modifying the role of the insurance industry and require 
a dedicated strategy to manage the impact of sustainability in P&C 
Business."
"As a result, our overall approach for 
assessing and classifying Sustainable Solutions was revised."
"The 
former Sustainable Solution definition and its application were 
replaced by the new Sustainable Solutions framework as of January 
1st, 2023."
"This also enables us to report on Sustainable Solutions based 
on the new Sustainable Solutions framework for the financial year 
2023."
"The Sustainable Solutions framework is based on regulatory 
requirements (e.g., the EU Taxonomy Regulation) as an integral part."
"However, it goes beyond and includes additional product elements 
which contribute to ESG objectives beyond climate change adaptation 
to support our customers in their transition."
"To ensure compliance across the Allianz Group, the Sustainable 
Solutions framework is codified in internal policies and applies as a 
harmonized and mandatory framework for all Allianz P&C entities, 
including a certification process for sustainable products and services."
"Eligible objectives and suitable product elements have been 
predefined."
"They were derived from the EU Taxonomy Regulation – 
where available1 – and the United Nation Sustainable Development 
Goals, and can be summarized as follows: 
− 
Climate change mitigation: avoid, reduce or remove GHG 
emissions."
"− 
Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: 
contribute to good status of water bodies."
"− 
Transition to a circular economy: promote durability, re-use and 
recycling."
"− 
Pollution prevention and control: improve quality of air, water, and 
land."

"TBV presents a measure for the overall amount of

"This premium figure represents the required gross written 
premiums level."
"Determination of (retro)ceded premium share 
For natural catastrophe events, the Allianz Group has a centralized 
program in place that pools exposures from its subsidiaries through 
internal reinsurance agreements."
"Allianz SE limits exposures in this 
portfolio 
through 
external 
reinsurance."
"Subsidiaries 
of 
the 
Allianz Group generally do not enter into individual external 
reinsurance agreements for natural catastrophe events."
"Accordingly, a 
breakdown into single Taxonomy-aligned products is not available, as 
indicated in the template below."
"The guidance on EU Taxonomy Reporting2 published by the EU 
Commission in December 2023 states that insurance undertakings 
should use those insurance premiums that only pertain to the coverage 
of climate-related perils for the purpose of computing Taxonomy-
alignment."
"Hence, only the portion of the premium from Taxonomy-
aligned products related to the exposure stemming from climate 
related perils could be reported as sustainable revenue."
"We applied 
this guidance to calculate the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenues."
"For our reinsurance contracts issued (third party), we prepared our 
systems to report the entire premium of any treaty providing coverage 
for climate-related perils for financial year 2023 reporting, based on 
the prevailing market practice and interpretation of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"With the new requirement to unbundle the premium into 
solely climate risk related, our systems need further adaptation to 
systematically allow this premium unbundling in the required quality 
and could not be done in time for financial year 2023."
"As of January 2023, all newly developed products and services 
must be assessed and classified under the Sustainable Solutions 
framework in the product development process by our operating 
entities."
"Results are validated by a dedicated function within our Group 
Center Global P&C, which has the responsibility to approve or not 
approve submitted products as a sustainable and in case of a positive 
approval, issue a respective certification."

Allianz’s actions and measurements 
The Sustainable Solutions framework incorporates material ESG 
objectives into P&C decision-making and portfolio management 
processes."
"We aim to shift our product portfolio towards sustainable 
products by using the Sustainable Solutions framework as guiding 
considerations in the product development process."
"Allianz has always offered comprehensive insurance cover for 
climate-related perils."
"Still, closing the insurance protection gap 
remains a major challenge in many markets."
"To increase the 
penetration rate of covers for natural catastrophes, our product 
strategy is moving towards coverage for natural catastrophes per 
default (with opt-out elements)."
"To manage climate-related risks adequately, we are continuously 
improving our risk- and pricing-models by integrating the latest data 
and information on climate change impacts through forward-looking 
NatCat scenarios and global hazard maps."
"However, effective 
adaptation to climate change does not only require adequate pricing 
of risks, but also individual measures by customers."
"We have therefore 
started considering preventative actions taken by the customer in our 
products and pricing models."
"Living up to our role as a climate risk 
manager, we are also integrating advisory services into our customer 
communication and provide relevant information to customers, for 
example, on how to build stronger resilience against climate-related 
events."
"For instance, 
Allianz entities offer BEV insurance products, which meet the specific 
needs of the new ecosystem such as range anxiety, comprehensive 
coverage of accessory equipment, and coverage for battery disposal."
"Within our commercial energy and construction business, we offer 
insurance to cover the setup, installation, and operation of renewable 
energy projects such as solar and wind farms, both onshore and 
offshore."
"Material ESG objectives are also considered in our claims 
processes."
"We have started integrating environmental standards into 
our claims processes by encouraging or incentivizing our customers, 
car repair shops, and manufacturers to repair instead of replace or to 
use refurbished parts, where possible."
"Allianz’s ambition  
Our ambition is to be a trusted partner for our customers and investee 
companies across different sectors in their transition to net zero, as 
well as to support our customers in their transition to environment-
friendly choices."
"The new Allianz Sustainable Solutions framework was launched 
in January 2023 across all our entities."
"This includes qualitative targets 
for the financial year 2023 for to the Board of Management and CEOs 
of our operating entities to ensure the implementation of Sustainable 
Solutions."
"To accelerate the journey in 2024, we have set quantitative 
growth targets for to the Board of Management and CEOs of our 
operating entities."
"In our reinsurance lines, we initiated discussions with our clients on 
their fossil fuel related exposures in order to support their net-zero 
transition pathways."
"As of 2024, our entities will continue to report internally on a regular 
basis on the following KPIs:

"This means that for Taxonomy reporting as an investor in 
other undertakings, the Allianz Group can only consider reported data 
of economic activities of investees in scope of the NFRD that are, thus, 
obliged to disclose under Art."
8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.
"Where 
the Allianz Group fully controls a non-financial investment – including 
real estate – the scope is not limited in that regard."
"The eligibility and alignment share includes activities of controlled 
subsidiaries, NFRD-related investments, and non-NFRD funds that 
may have underlying NFRD investments or non-financial assets."
"For 
controlled investments and mortgages with property as collateral, 
Allianz has three main asset classes: real estate held for investment, 
commercial and retail mortgages, and renewable investments."
"Allianz’s minority interest investments in investees are mostly through 
publicly listed stocks and bonds."
"Eligibility for Allianz’s controlled assets 
has been determined for all six environmental objectives that are listed 
in the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"Alignment reporting is produced for 
the two published environmental objectives of climate change 
mitigation and climate change adaptation."
"As in 2022, all real estate asset classes including mortgages are 
considered 100 % eligible, with the addition in 2023 of joint ventures in 
real estate."
"For further information, please refer to section “Changes to 
proprietary investment reporting”."
"Eligibility (and alignment) for 
Allianz investments in investees is attained via reported data provided 
by Moody’s Analytics."
"The focus of Taxonomy reporting for 2023 is alignment, which is a 
step beyond eligibility."
"Naturally, eligibility is a prerequisite for alignment."
"Alignment screening relates to the first two climate change 
objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation."
"Allianz has attained a relatively low alignment quota from screening 
our own portfolio."
"The main constraints included lack of data 
availability for commercial mortgages, and lack of comparative data 
for real estate held for investment (typically for Energy Performance 
Certificates determined on demand data that could not be 
benchmarked to the top 15 % of real estate stock)."
"For retail mortgage loans especially, Allianz uses a third-party 
provider (SkenData) that employs an EU Taxonomy model to screen 
real estate objects at a building level."
"The criteria used to assess 
energy performance are equal to the ones used in energy 
performance certificates."
"The DNSH criteria considers both the 
exposure and vulnerability (after considering mitigating action)."
"Overall risk materiality is then determined for each building jointly 
assessing the said factors."
"Only when such risk is classified as low or 
medium, the real estate object can be considered Taxonomy-aligned."
"The Allianz Group uses only reported data for listed assets (no 
estimated data is used)."
"For single listed asset products, Allianz 
employs a data hierarchy prioritizing data reported at issuer level."
"If 
reported data is not available at issuer level, then parent-level data is 
sourced."
"If that is unavailable, Allianz uses reported data from the 
ultimate group parent entity."
"Taxonomy-alignment is considered only 
for NFRD companies that publish reported data."
"The data hierarchy 
logic is suppressed for investment funds."
"For further information, 
please refer to section ”Limitations of reported numbers”."
"For investments, a look-through approach applies for investment 
funds and unit-linked products."
"However, such reporting for the 
financial year 2023 is limited due to lack of available data at issuer 
level."
"For further information, please refer to section “Limitations of 
reported numbers”."

Allianz complies with the EU Taxonomy Regulation by reporting 
the respective Taxonomy KPIs."
"For investments, these numbers give us 
a technical view on the current status of our investment portfolio with 
regards to their Taxonomy-alignment."
"At this stage, the EU Taxonomy 
investment criteria is not used for business or investment steering 
purposes."
"However, we continue to monitor the evolution of the 
Taxonomy Regulation to cover further sectors of the economy and 
become a tool for portfolio steering in the future."
"Nuclear and Gas Delegated act 
In addition, as part of the 2023 Taxonomy reporting, Allianz is required 
to disclose its exposure to the six nuclear and gas activities stipulated 
in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 (Annex III)."
"This disclosure seeks to elicit the portion of aligned investments that 
are a result of the stated activities."
"For 2023, Allianz’s exposure to 
nuclear and gas activities is considered very small (around 2 % of 
aligned assets for turnover and CAPEX based on total alignment 
figures)."
"However, additional disclosure tables have been produced 
with the limitation that some KPIs were unable to be calculated due to 
lack of data at the climate objective level."
"Reporting about third-party asset management 
In 2023, Allianz took the decision to de-scope third-party asset 
management from EU Taxonomy investment reporting, in line with 
current market practice and interpretation of existing regulatory 
requirements for 2023 reporting."
"Calculation of KPIs 
The main alignment KPIs for 2023 include alignment based on 
turnover and alignment based on CAPEX."
"For our financial 
investments, each KPI is determined using only reported data for the 
investee."
"If, for example, Allianz has an investment in a company with 
a turnover alignment of 10 % and the book value of the investment is 
100, Allianz would report a turnover alignment balance of 10."
"And if 
Allianz has covered assets of 200, then the final alignment share based 
on turnover would be 10/200, or 5 %."
"The total alignment based on 
turnover additionally includes alignment shares from Allianz’s own 
investment real estate held for investment, retail mortgages, and 
renewable investments."
"The total alignment KPI based on CAPEX is 
determined in the same way."
"For 2023, Allianz has followed the disclosure guidance for insurer 
investment KPIs detailed in Annex IX/X of the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (Disclosure Delegated Act)."
"As mentioned 
earlier, the main changes regarding the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for 2023 are the introduction of alignment 
KPIs (by turnover and CAPEX) and the separate tables required for 
nuclear/gas exposures."
"The Annex X template has a number of 
shortcomings, with the main one concerning its specification of the 
non-eligible KPIs."
"Eligibility and alignment fractions are determined as 
a percentage of the turnover or CAPEX denominators."
"As such, these 
rows need to be made explicit in the template."
"In the absence of these 
rows, the numbers have been provided in the footnotes for 
completeness."
"Changes to proprietary investment reporting 
For Taxonomy reporting in 2023, there were some changes to how 
Allianz presents its numbers."
"The first change relates to the treatment of cash and cash 
equivalents."
"In 2022, Allianz considered these as non-eligible; however, 
they were included as part of the denominator for KPI calculations."
"After reassessing the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Allianz has determined 
that cash and cash equivalents should not be included in the scope of 
assets covered by the investment KPI."
"Cash and cash equivalents are 
specifically not included in the scope of assets covered by the 
investment KPI."
"This view is affirmed by EIOPA’s technical advice on key 
performance indicators under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation 
of February 26, 2021 (EIOPA-21-184)."
"The second change relates to the asset classes considered 
relevant for eligibility."
"In 2022, Allianz considered investments in real 
estate funds to be 100 % eligible on the basis that the vast majority of 
the underlying investments were in real estate."
"In 2023, Allianz 
determined that, by the same logic, its joint venture real estate 
investments should also be 100 % eligible."
"The impact of this 
reassessment leads to a small reclassification from non-eligible to 
eligible for this asset class for 2023."
"Finally, in 2023, the transition to a new accounting regime has 
meant that most of Allianz’s real estate investment held for 
investments are measured at fair value, as opposed to cost less 
accumulated depreciation."
"In particular, this has led to higher 
valuations of the stated asset class compared to the previous year."
"Limitations of reported numbers 
For 2023, Allianz is relying on reported information from investees for 
the year 2022."
"For that year, financial institutions were not required to 
report alignment figures; as a result, alignment quotas for the said 
companies will be low or zero."
"For investment funds, Allianz uses a fund look-through approach 
where possible to report fund eligibility, leveraging data in the 
Tripartite Template (TPT)."
"However, look-through coverage of 
companies was limited for 2023 due to limited adoption of the TPT and 
the inability to obtain underlying investment eligibility."
"In addition, the 
aforementioned data hierarchy approach is suppressed for investment 
funds: if investment level look-through data is not available, eligibility 
is assumed to be zero."
"This is because listed asset data for Allianz SE 
has been collected for the underwriting KPI, which has a high eligibility 
share of 79 %."
"This is deemed inappropriately high for investment 
funds."
"The conservative approach is designed to mitigate the risk of 
reporting eligibility figures that may not be representative of the 
underlying investments."
"Going forward, Allianz aims to expand the 
look-through capability for investment funds."
"In addition, a complete screening of our renewables portfolio was 
not possible for United States based SPVs."
"The said investments are 
100 % eligible and likely have a high degree of alignment but have not 
been considered as such for 2023 reporting due to inadequate data at 
the time of reporting."

"It follows the double materiality principles as per 
the CSRD/ESRS and the guidance provided by EFRAG in its Draft 
Implementation Guidance on the materiality assessment from 
December 2023."
"The CSRD DMA identifies material impacts, risks, and 
opportunities that (may) arise in the short-, medium- or long-term, or a 
mix thereof, following ESRS 1."
"In terms of topical scope, the CSRD DMA 
covers both the sustainability matters addressed by the topical ESRS 
as well as Allianz-specific sustainability matters not (sufficiently) 
covered therein, based on the previous GRI materiality assessment."
"When assessing impact materiality, we consider positive and 
adverse actual and potential impacts caused by, contributed to, or 
connected with the Allianz Group."
"Such impacts are assessed based on 
the criteria scale, scope, remediation possibility, and likelihood."
"When 
assessing financial materiality – namely, the materiality of risks and 
opportunities for the Allianz Group – we take into account the 
likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of the potential financial 
effects."
"In this context, we also consider our dependencies on the 
continuing use of natural, human, and social resources."
"Financial 
materiality is assessed in accordance with established Allianz-specific 
risk assessment processes."
"For opportunities, the identification is tied to 
our strategy, as the fact that a strategy to exploit opportunities exists is 
a precondition for (likely) materialization."
"As to risks, besides the broad range of risk assessments 
established within the Allianz Group (e.g."
"Top Risk Assessment), a 
dedicated in-depth risk assessment covering the CSRD topics 
alongside the value chain was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 
to enhance the CSRD DMA going forward."
"Until this deep-dive is 
completed and given that guidance for financial companies and 
industry practice is still evolving, for 2023 reporting, all CSRD topics are 
generally considered in scope due to potential risks (e.g."
"policy or 
reputational risks)."
"This means that we describe (potential) risks based 
on a conservative initial approach, thereby reporting on topics broadly, 
despite the majority of them being (currently) considered to be at most 
designated “low materiality” from a risk perspective."
"In a similar vein, 
our impact assessment will be regularly reviewed to reflect, for 
example, evolving regulation and methodology as well as increasing 
availability of portfolio-specific data."
"GHG emissions), 
tailored to the Allianz business context and complemented by 
expert evaluations."
"In addition, for our Life/Health commercial 
lines, a country analysis is performed to assess impacts regarding 
potential business conduct and human rights issues."
"Sources include sector proxies for environmental impacts from the 
Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure 
(ENCORE) data base, as well as, for investments, for example 
principle adverse impacts on sustainability factors (SFDR PAIs) or 
ESG sub-scores by MSCI."
"In addition, we conduct a country analysis 
to assess impacts regarding potential business conduct and 
human rights issues, similar to the analysis mentioned above for 
our Life/Health commercial lines."
"The evaluations of these criteria 
were enhanced by consulting a broad range of relevant business 
experts, in order to ensure consideration of Allianz portfolio-
specific information, especially where there was of a lack of 
(sufficiently granular) data."
"Allianz will continue to work on data 
coverage and quality over the coming years."
"As to proprietary 
investments, the first CSRD DMA focuses on General Account 
investments."
"The inclusion of unit-linked investments into the CSRD 
DMA will be revisited during the annual revision process."
"When 
assessing impact materiality at portfolio level, we apply absolute 
thresholds based on gross written premiums for our commercial 
(re)insurance business and based on assets under management 
for proprietary investments."
"This ensures that both multiple smaller 
impacts and fewer larger impacts are considered in the 
assessment."
"Similar to the approach for risks, we tend to include 
(potential) adverse impacts in the reporting scope at this stage, 
following a conservative approach."
"We will further develop our materiality 
assessment process for the third-party asset management 
business for the financial year 2024."
"For example, while the topic 
“Climate change” (ESRS E1) is material from an own operations and 
value chain perspective, the materiality of further environmental 
topics (ESRS E2-E5) is generally associated with providing financing 
and insurance to corporate clients."
"As to social and governance-
related topics, they are particularly relevant from our own operations 
perspective (esp."
"ESRS S1, G1), while also playing a role in our value 
chain (esp."
"For our third-party asset management, we 
have initiated a more detailed assessment, which will be reflected in 
our reporting for 2024."
"In addition to the topics “Climate change” and 
“Own workforce”, “Business conduct” remains a key topic for the Allianz 
Group."
"Also, our ongoing focus on customer experience alongside the 
customer journey remains unchanged (ESRS S4), given its materiality 
and relevance to the Allianz sustainability strategy."
"C _ Group Management Report

107 
Material (potential) impacts, risks, and opportunities for Allianz are 
outlined below in more detail:1 
− 
The topic “Climate change” (ESRS E1) is assessed to be material 
from an own operations and value chain perspective."
"− 
Adverse impacts in our own operations result from energy 
usage of our operations and our carbon footprint (mainly 
driven by this energy usage as well as by business travel), while 
positive measures are in place via in-place practices of energy 
savings and renewables usage."
"− 
For Property-Casualty insurance and proprietary investments, 
(potential) adverse impacts with respect to climate change 
can materialize through insuring and financing carbon-
intensive activities or sectors, or government exposures with 
high CO2 emissions (per capita)."
"This is a current reflection, 
while (potential) adverse impacts for the current portfolios are 
expected to decrease over time as we work to implement our 
net-zero transition plan."
"Regarding positive impacts in our 
(re)insurance activities and investments, we focus on offering 
insurance products in line with our Sustainable Solutions 
framework and on enlarging our Sustainable Investments."
"For 
further information, please refer to the section “02.1.1” in our 
Group Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company 
website."
"− 
Related opportunities are considered material for our 
Property-Casualty lines and proprietary investments in that we 
are supporting our clients in their low-carbon transition journey 
in accordance with our Allianz sustainability strategy and 
targets."
"− 
The materiality of climate change risks, especially in our value 
chain, is mainly driven through physical climate-related risks, 
with climate-related transition risks – such as policy and 
litigation risks – increasing with longer time horizons."
"− 
For further information, please refer to the Group 
Sustainability Report 2023 on the Allianz company website."
"(ESRS E4), and “Resource use and circular economy” (ESRS E5) – 
are assessed to be material for Allianz, primarily from a general 
value chain perspective."
"− 
For Property-Casualty commercial lines and investments, 
(potential) adverse impacts with respect to these topics can 
materialize through insuring and financing pollution-, water 
use-/resource 
use-intensive 
and 
biodiversity-affecting 
activities, sectors, and governments."
"For our Property-Casualty 
retail insurance portfolio, particularly “Resource use and 
circular economy” is material, also giving rise to opportunities 
associated with our sustainable claims initiative (repair instead 
of replace)."
"− 
Given our provision of insurance coverage, the increase of 
physical hazards – also induced through biodiversity loss – 
poses a risk for Property-Casualty, which also puts pressure on 
insurability."
"This also applies for proprietary investments, given 
potential nature-related risks for our portfolio."
"In addition, 
there is also a potential short-term technology and resource 
scarcity/price risk for Property-Casualty retail insurance 
related to “Resource use and circular economy”."
"− 
The topic “Own workforce” (ESRS S1) is assessed to be material for 
Allianz, as our employees are a key success factor for our business, 
and as we are committed to creating a Great Place To Work®."
"− 
Positive impacts are created through Allianz practices on 
employee engagement, training, learning, and personal 
development, accompanied by strategic workforce planning."
"We have a strong focus on diversity, equal treatment, and 
inclusion as well as on talent acquisition and retention."
"The 
health and well-being of our employees continues to be an 
area of focus – our practices include offering flexibility in 
working time, paying above industry-average wages, and 
fostering freedom of association and dialogue with our 
employees."
"Furthermore, securing the confidentiality of 
employee data is key for us."
"By implementing these and further 
practices – including annual risk assessments regarding the 
protection of human/employee rights in accordance with the 
German Supply Chain Act – we continue to work to ensure 
(potential) adverse impacts are prevented and reduced."
"− 
In terms of financial materiality, risk drivers relate to policy 
changes as well as skill shortage and retention risk, either 
associated with demographic change, or by not meeting 
employee expectations, especially compared to other 
employers."
"− 
We also see opportunities associated with our employees, in 
that the practices mentioned above allow us to attract and 
retain talent as a key success factor for our business."
"− 
The social topics alongside the value chain (ESRS S2-S4) are 
assessed to be material for Allianz from an impact and financial 
perspective."
"In addition, the topic “Workers in the value 
chain” (ESRS S2) is assessed to be material for Allianz from an 
impact perspective regarding our suppliers (incl."
"service 
providers relevant for our Property-Casualty retail business)."
"− 
As to risks, potential cases of adverse impacts regarding value 
chain workers or affected communities in the value chain can 
also lead to spill-over effects for Allianz."
"In addition, 
securing data privacy and confidentiality of consumer data is 
key for us."
"Financial implications may particularly arise in case 
of policy changes."
"− 
The topic “Business conduct” (ESRS G1) is assessed to be material 
for Allianz primarily from an own operations perspective."
"− 
Given our practices related to corporate culture health, 
whistleblower 
protection, 
supplier 
management, 
and 
prevention of corruption and bribery, we deem our impacts on 
business conduct to be positive."
"In addition, we engage with 
political stakeholders with regards to sustainability-related 
aspects, and we actively engage in and support regulatory 
developments."
"Potential adverse impacts may arise from our 
proprietary investment portfolio, given exposures to sectors or 
governments with higher likelihood of business conduct-
related issues."
"− 
As business conduct is also reliant on the proper behavior of 
individuals, potential risks can never be fully eliminated."
"As a 
result, the matters of ethics and responsible business are also 
considered material from a financial perspective in our own

Economic environment 20231
  
In economic terms, 2023 provided a few surprises: primarily, the 
resilience of the U.S."
"The failure of the predicted recession to 
materialize was mainly due to U.S."
"consumers, who remained keen to 
consume thanks to a robust labor market and excess savings 
accumulated during the pandemic."
"As many companies had also 
secured the previous low interest rates for the long term, the 
turnaround in interest rates was not yet fully reflected in corporate 
balance sheets."
"The bottom line was relatively strong growth of 2.5 %; 
at the same time, inflation fell sharply to 4.1 % (annual average)."
"The expected upturn in China following the reopening of the 
economy after the long COVID-19 lockdowns turned out to be short-
lived."
"Structural weaknesses – particularly the challenging situation in 
the real-estate market – quickly regained the upper hand and 
dampened sentiment."
"Nevertheless, the Chinese economy grew by 
5.2 % in 2023, although this was a rather modest development 
compared to previous years."
"Finally, the eurozone recorded weak 
growth of only 0.5 %; at the same time, inflation remained at an annual 
average of over 5 %, although it fell below 3 % again at the end of the 
year."
"This weak growth was mainly due to developments in Germany, 
where the economic output fell by 0.3 % as a result of the energy price 
shock."
"Global economic growth slowed to 2.7 %, remaining only slightly 
below the pre-pandemic average."
"The fears of recession stoked at the 
beginning of 2023 did not materialize."
"The interest rate turnaround remained the dominant topic in the 
financial markets, with the focus increasingly shifting to the question of 
the end-of-interest-rate-hike cycle."
"Federal Reserve and 
the European Central Bank conducted their last interest rate hikes for 
the time being in July and September, respectively."
"In 2023, the key 
interest rates in the United States rose by 100 basis points to 5.5 %, and 
in the eurozone by 200 basis points to 4.0 % (deposit rate)."
"Despite this 
fundamentally restrictive monetary policy, the end-of-interest-rate-
hikes and the expectation of future interest rate cuts led to strong price 
gains and optimism in the stock markets."
"equities (S&P 500) rose 
by 24 % and even German equities (DAX) increased by 20 % – despite 
 
1_At the date of the publication of this report, not all general market data for the year 2023 used in this 
chapter was final."
"Also, please note that the information provided in this chapter is based on our 
estimates."
"A similar trend was also observed in 
government bond yields."
"Contrary to the further rise in key interest 
rates, yields on German government bonds fell by 53 basis points to 
2.0 %; U.S."
government bonds remained virtually unchanged at 3.9 %.
"Business environment 2023 for the 
insurance industry 
Inflation remained the defining issue for the insurance industry in 2023."
"Even though consumer price inflation slowed, claims inflation 
remained high, not least due to rising wages."
"This development had a 
negative impact on underwriting results in property and casualty 
insurance."
"Higher repair costs were also a factor – in addition to the 
climate change-related increase in damage events – that pushed 
insured losses from natural disasters above the USD 100 bn mark for 
the fourth year in a row."
"The interest rate level was generally higher, which resulted in rising 
investment income for insurers from new investments and 
reinvestments."
"At the same time, however, this also intensified 
competition in the life business: simple investment products such as 
term deposits were once again able to score points with savers, which 
had a particularly negative impact on the single premium business."
"However, the feared wave of life policy lapses did not materialize, 
insurers’ business remained stable."
"In 2023, two familiar topics also became increasingly urgent: 
digitalization and sustainability."
"The breakthrough of generative 
artificial intelligence took the digitalization of business processes – 
especially the customer interface – to a new level."
"In terms of 
sustainability, insurability became a particular focus."
"Increasing 
natural hazards mean that some risk areas are no longer insurable at 
affordable prices."
"Some insurers in the United States have already 
responded by discontinuing new business in certain lines of business."
"In the property-casualty sector, we observed strong premium 
growth in some areas in the reporting year, although this was primarily 
due to rising prices: all insurers had to increase premiums in response 
to the persistent claims inflation."
"Nevertheless, underwriting results 
remained under pressure in some divisions, like motor."
"Investment 
income also increased further due to higher yields."
"In the life sector, premium development was much more subdued."
"There were also very large differences between the markets due to 
diverging market and product structures."
"In general, however, demand 
for risk products remained strong."
"Following the end of the pandemic, 
the topic of old-age provision is once again attracting more attention 
from consumers."
"As in property and casualty insurance, the sector has 
benefited from higher investment returns."
"Business environment 2023 for the 
asset management industry  
The asset management industry has faced considerable volatility in 
the capital market over the past 12 months."
"The key drivers for this 
were surging inflation and rapidly changing interest rates, 
compounded by banking turmoil and geopolitical upheaval."
"Another 
relevant change is the structural shift towards CO2-neutral business 
models, bringing with it a requirement for new investment solutions."
"Stock markets rose, with the MSCI World Index up by 23.8 % in 
2023."
"For bonds, active management demonstrated its value for 
achieving returns against the backdrop of rapidly changing interest 
rates."
"Although active investments still account for most of the assets 
under management, growth in passive and alternative investments 
continued in 2023."
"Besides the focus on CO2 emissions and the 
ongoing growth in ESG-oriented offerings (ESG = Environment, Social, 
Governance), digitalization with the application of artificial 
intelligence (AI) and other technologies is becoming increasingly 
important."
"AI, for example, is creating new opportunities when it comes 
to analyzing large and unstructured sets of data."
"Furthermore, AI is 
finding its way into supporting operational efficiency via innovative 
forms of automation."
"Client satisfaction remains a high priority for the 
asset management value chain as a whole."

"Earnings summary 
Our total business volume increased by 8.0 % on an internal basis2, 
compared to the previous year."
"This was mostly driven by our Property-
Casualty business segment due to positive price effects and volume 
effects, from many entities including Allianz Partners, AGCS, and 
Germany."
"The Life/Health and the Asset Management business 
segments also recorded positive internal growth."
Our operating profit increased by 6.7 % in comparison to 2022.
"This was mainly due to a higher operating investment result from our 
United States operations in the Life/Health business segment."
"Our 
Property-Casualty business segment recorded a solid operating profit 
driven by a higher operating investment result; this was partly offset by 
a lower operating fee and other result as well as the insurance service 
result."
"Operating profit from our Asset Management business segment 
declined slightly, mainly as a result of unfavorable foreign currency 
translation effects."
"Our operating investment result increased by € 1,025 mn to 
€ 4.8 bn, largely driven by the United States due to an accounting 
mismatch in the prior year."
"In addition, in our Property-Casualty 
business segment we recorded higher interest and similar income 
mostly due to higher interest rates."
"Our non-operating result improved by € 1.0 bn to a loss of 
€ 3.2 bn as the prior year result was negatively impacted by the 
increase in the Structured Alpha provision."
"In the current year, we 
recorded lower non-operating net investment income."
"Income taxes decreased by € 259 mn to € 2.5 bn, and the 
effective tax rate decreased to 22.0 % (29.1 %), due to a more 
favorable profit mix, tax benefits from write-up of deferred tax assets 
on tax losses, higher tax-exempted income, and the absence of non-
recurring items."
"The increase in net income was largely driven by an increase in 
the provision for litigation expenses for Structured Alpha booked in the 
first quarter of 2022, higher operating profit, and lower income taxes."
Shareholders’ core net income was strong at € 9.1 bn.

to the chapter Reconciliations."
"Our shareholders’ equity3 increased by € 4,062 mn to € 58.5 bn, 
compared to 31 December 2022."
"This increase was mainly driven by 
the net income and positive net OCI, partly offset by the dividend 
payout and share-buy-back program."
"Over the same period, our 
Solvency II capitalization ratio increased to 206 %4."

"On an 
internal basis3, our total business volume increased by 11.2 %."

an internal growth of 12.7 %."
"This was mainly driven by favorable 
volume effects in our health business as well as in our travel insurance 
business."
"AGCS: Total business volume increased to € 12,245 mn, an 
internal growth of 7.1 %, driven by positive volume and price effects."
"Germany: Total business volume went up 6.6 % on an internal 
basis, totaling € 12,400 mn."
"This was mainly caused by price increases, 
predominantly from motor and property business."
"Türkiye: Total business volume amounted to € 1,419 mn – up 
109.1 % on an internal basis."
"This development is driven by strong price 
increases due to the hyperinflationary environment and to a lower 
extent volume effects, predominantly in the health business."
"Despite our strong insurance revenue growth, our operating

ratio."
"The impact of 
claims from natural catastrophes on our combined ratio increased by 
0.6 percentage points to 3.4 %."
"Leaving aside losses from natural catastrophes, our accident year 
loss ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points to 69.1 %."
"This was mainly 
due to a positive discounting impact of 2.9 %, a change of 
1.2 percentage points compared to the previous year due to the high 
interest rate environment."
"This positive effect was, however, partially 
offset by higher claims inflation, in particular in retail business."
"Most of our operations contributed positively to the development of 
our accident year loss ratio."
"The main positive contributors were: 
Brazil: 0.3 percentage points, driven by a business profitability 
recovery."
"France: 0.2 percentage points, mostly due to a lower level of 
large losses in 2023 compared to the previous year."

Operating revenues 
Our operating revenues decreased by 1.8 % on a nominal basis."
"This 
development was driven by lower net fee and commission income 
mainly at AllianzGI, partially offset by higher other operating revenues, 
primarily driven by higher net interest income."
"On an internal basis1, 
operating revenues increased by 2.4 %."
"Net fee and commission income declined, mainly driven by a 
lower average third-party AuM level at both PIMCO and AllianzGI, 
while we recorded higher performance fees – predominantly at 
PIMCO."
"Operating profit 
Our operating profit decreased by 2.2 % on a nominal basis, as the 
decline in operating revenues exceeded a decrease in operating 
expenses."
"On an internal basis1, our operating profit remained 
stable at last year’s level."
"The nominal decrease in administrative expenses stemmed from

"Earnings summary 
The operating result improved in 2023 compared to the previous year."
"This was due to a higher contribution from Banking and Alternative 
Investments, which more than offsets the decline in operating result 
from Holding & Treasury."
"The increase in our net loss was mainly because of a lower non-
operating investment result, which was burdened by a lower valuation 
result from financial assets and liabilities, lower income from 
derivatives as well as lower non-operating realized gains and losses 
(net)."
This was partly offset by a higher positive income tax result.

"On the one hand, 
this reflects the expectation that inflation is largely under control, as 
annual average inflation will probably be within striking distance of 
inflation targets in both the United States (2.3 %) and the eurozone 
(2.5 %)."
"On the other hand, it is a reaction to the continued weakness 
in demand, which is fed by several sources: the delayed effect of 
interest rate hikes on investment, declining fiscal policy support, and 
depleted savings reserves."
"Overall, we therefore expect economic 
growth to decline in 2024, falling by 0.3 percentage points to 2.4 % 
worldwide; for the United States, we expect it to decline to 1.4 % 
(-1.0 percentage points)."
"Only the eurozone is likely to reach around 
the previous year’s level with a rate of 0.8 %, as a return to positive 
growth is assumed for Germany."
"China will also face headwinds, not 
least due to its structural problems: we expect rather modest growth of 
4.6 %."
"Ongoing uncertainty about the timing and extent of the next 
interest rate moves means volatility in the financial markets will remain 
high in 2024."
"As the expected cuts in interest rates have already been 
anticipated 
in 
many 
market 
prices, 
disappointment 
and 
corresponding market reactions cannot be ruled out."
"Overall, equities 
and bonds are likely to move more or less sideways."
"The outlook for 2024 is subject to a special caveat since it is a 
super election year."
"Citizens will go to the polls in countries that 
account for 60 % of global economic output – from India to the United 
States – with election results significantly impacting the economic and 
geopolitical constellation."
"First and foremost, this applies to the U.S."
"The associated global political uncertainty is 
fostering a wait-and-see-attitude among companies and households."
"There is also the threat of rising political and social tensions as a result 
of increasing polarization in a weak economic environment."
"1_The information presented in the sections “Economic outlook”, “Insurance industry outlook”, and “Asset 
management industry outlook” is based on our own estimates."
"Insurance industry outlook 
Inflation will remain a dominant topic for the insurance industry in 
2024, as claims inflation is unlikely to fall as quickly as consumer price 
inflation, mainly due to rising wages."
"However, continued premium 
increases mean that pressure on underwriting results should ease."
"On 
the other hand, the challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment is hampering premium growth."
"In view of the increasing geopolitical upheavals, climate-related 
natural hazards, and technological risks worldwide, the need for risk 
protection and prevention remains high."
"Thanks to its financial 
strength, the insurance industry can meet these needs with innovative 
solutions, so its role as a partner for strengthening social resilience will 
continue to grow in importance."
"Despite ongoing high volatility, the investment environment 
should remain relatively friendly in 2024."
"The higher interest rate level 
offers good opportunities for long-term investors, and insurers’ 
investment income is likely to continue to rise."
"Premium growth in the property-casualty insurance sector will 
continue at a slower pace; however, as in the previous year it is likely to 
be driven primarily by rising prices."
"At the same time, claims 
development remains challenging, with structural factors such as 
increasing climate-related natural catastrophes also playing a role."
Investment income is expected to increase.
"As higher wages are 
putting pressure on operating costs, increasing productivity through 
fully digitalized processes is essential."
"In the life insurance sector, providers are increasingly reflecting 
the higher interest rate level in their products, which should benefit 
demand for savings and pension products."
"This is possible because 
awareness of the need for protection in old age not only remains high 
but should also continue to rise in the future."
"The same applies to 
demand in the risk business."
"Furthermore, higher investment income 
will strengthen profitability."
"Asset management industry outlook 
In 2024, the asset management industry will probably face a different 
economic landscape to 2023, and will also be impacted by 
megatrends, including disruptive technologies and sustainability."
"This challenging environment is an opportunity for active asset 
management to demonstrate its value potential by focusing on 
diversification and risk management, which help to deliver 
outperformance."
"With inflation falling and rate cuts expected in the United States 
and the eurozone, there will be many opportunities in bond markets."
"Fixed income will therefore be an important asset class for investors in 
2024."
"Investment grade, for example, is likely to benefit from strong 
yield levels, manageable supply and still decent fundamentals."
"Demand for alternatives – especially private market assets – is also 
expected to remain high."
"This trend is supported by investors looking 
for both diversification and protection against inflation."
"Infrastructure 
– including renewable energy – is expected to grow further, driven by 
the effort to limit CO2 emissions."
"In this context, ESG-oriented 
investments are becoming more complex and competitive, as many 
investors seek ways to make a real-world impact by focusing on 
environmental and inclusive-growth themes."
"Technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), will emerge as a 
core part of the long-term opportunity set."
"AI will be increasingly 
implemented and will help raise global productivity by both 
automating laborious tasks and analyzing large data sets ."
"Margin pressure is very likely to persist, driven by passive products 
as well as fierce competition."
"Despite this multifaceted situation, the 
asset management industry meets all the prerequisites to remain 
attractive and return to a long-term growth path."

"Management’s assessment of 
expected revenues and earnings for 
2024 
In 2023, our total revenues were € 161.7 bn, a 5.5 % increase on a 
nominal and an 8.0 % increase on an internal basis1, compared to 
2022."
"For 2024, we envisage 3 % growth overall, resulting from growth 
in Property-Casualty and Asset Management, combined with 
relatively stable revenues in Life/Health, owing to our selective focus 
on profitable growth."
Our operating profit was € 14.7 bn in 2023.
"For 2024, we envisage 
strong performance in all business segments and an overall operating 
profit of € 14.8 bn, plus or minus € 1.0 bn."
"Our core net income attributable to shareholders was € 9.1 bn in

sensitivity 
of 
our 
non-operating 
results 
to 
capital 
market 
developments, we have chosen not to provide a precise outlook for net 
income."
"However, since our outlook presumes no major disruptions in 
our capital markets, we anticipate a positive development for both net 
income and core net income in 2024."
"In this business segment, we expect total business volume to increase 
by 5 % to 7 % in 2024 (total business volume growth in 2023: 8.4 %) due 
to organic growth, which is supported by favorable price and volume 
effects across our subsidiaries."
"We believe that the rise in prices we saw in a number of markets 
in 2023 will continue in 2024."
"That said, we will continue to focus on 
achieving strong insurance service results by adhering to our strict 
underwriting discipline, as in previous years."
"Our combined ratio was 93.8 % in 2023, which is above target."
"In 
2024, we envisage a combined ratio in the range of approximately 
93 % to 94 %."
"The underlying assumption is that the aggregate effect of 
improvements in pricing, claims management, and productivity will 
compensate for inflation in attritional claims."
"The impact of 
discounting loss reserves on our combined ratio depends on the 
development of interest rate levels throughout 2024."
"As for impacts 
from natural catastrophes, despite the highly volatile nature of such 
catastrophes in recent years, we expect those claims to be at 
approximately 3 %."
"The investment income is expected to further benefit from the 
high interest-rate environment, despite a likely reduction of interest 
rates in the second half of 2024."
"Going forward, we will continue to 
actively adapt our investment strategy to changing market conditions."
"It should be noted that, with the introduction of the new IFRS 17 
accounting standard, the unwinding of discounted loss reserves will 
weigh on our investment income, dependent on interest rate levels of 
prior years."

Organization  
The Allianz Group’s liquidity management is based on policies and 
guidelines approved by the Allianz SE Board of Management."
"Allianz SE and each of the operating entities are responsible for 
managing their respective liquidity positions, while Allianz SE provides 
central cash pooling for the Group."
"Capital allocation is managed by 
Allianz SE for the entire Group."
"This structure allows the efficient use of 
liquidity and capital resources, and enables Allianz SE to achieve the 
desired liquidity and capitalization levels for the Group and its 
operating entities."
"Liquidity management of our 
operating entities  
The major sources of liquidity for our operational activities are  
primary and reinsurance premiums received, reinsurance receivables 
collected, investment income, and proceeds generated from the 
maturity or sale of investments."
"These funds are mainly used to pay 
claims arising from the Property-Casualty insurance business and 
related expenses, life policy benefits, surrenders and cancellations, 
acquisition costs, and operating costs."
"We receive a large part of premiums before payments of claims 
or policy benefits are required, generating solid cash flows from our 
insurance operations."
"This allows us to invest the funds in the interim to 
create investment income."
"Our insurance operations also carry a high proportion of liquid 
investments, which can be converted into cash to pay for claims."
"Generally, our investments in fixed-income securities are sequenced to 
mature when funds are expected to be needed."
"The overall liquidity of our insurance operations depends on 
capital market developments, interest rate levels, and our ability to 
realize the market value of our investment portfolio to meet insurance 
claims and policyholder benefits."
"Other factors affecting the liquidity 
of our Property-Casualty insurance operations include the timing, 
frequency, and severity of losses underlying our policies and policy 
renewal rates."
"In our Life operations, liquidity needs are generally 
influenced by trends in actual mortality rates compared to the 
assumptions underlying our life insurance reserves."
"Market returns, 
crediting rates, and the behavior of our life insurance clients – for 
example, regarding the level of surrenders and withdrawals – can 
also have a significant impact."
"Within our Asset Management operations, the most important sources 
of liquidity are fees generated from asset management activities."
These are primarily used to cover operating expenses.
"As such, the following sections include comments 
on the liquidity and funding resources of Allianz SE."
"Restrictions on the 
transferability of capital within the Group mainly result from the capital 
maintenance rules under applicable corporate laws as well as from 
the regulatory solvency capital requirements for regulated Group 
companies."
"Allianz SE ensures adequate access to liquidity and capital for our 
operating entities."
"The main sources of liquidity available to Allianz SE 
are dividends received from its subsidiaries and external funding 
raised in the capital markets."
"Liquidity resources are defined as readily 
available assets – specifically cash, money market securities, and 
highly liquid fixed-income securities."
"Our funds are primarily used 
for interest payments on our debt funding, operating costs, internal 
and external growth investments, and dividends or share buy-backs to 
our shareholders."
"Allianz SE’s access to external funds depends on various factors such 
as capital market conditions, access to credit facilities, credit ratings, 
and credit capacity."
"The financial resources available to Allianz SE in 
the capital markets for short-, mid- and long-term funding needs are 
described below."
"In general, mid- to long-term financing is covered by 
issuing senior bonds, subordinated bonds or ordinary no-par value 
shares."

Long-term debt funding 
As of 31 December 2023, Allianz SE had senior and subordinated 
bonds with a variety of maturities outstanding, reflecting our focus on 
long-term financing."
"As the cost and availability of external funding 
may be negatively affected by general market conditions or by  
matters specific to the financial services industry or the Allianz Group, 
we seek to reduce refinancing risk by actively steering the maturity 
profile of our funding structure."
2_A senior bond of € 0.75 bn was redeemed in 2023.
"3_As of 31 December 2023, includes accrued interest of € 80 mn (2022: € 79 mn)."
"4_Includes the issuance of two subordinated bonds (€ 1.25 bn and USD 1.0 bn) and the redemption 
of a € 1.5 bn subordinated bond in 2023."
"5_As of 31 December 2023, includes accrued interest of € 183 mn (2022: € 147 mn)."
"Interest expenses on senior bonds increased, mainly due to higher 
funding costs on average in 2023."
"For subordinated bonds classified 
as debt, the increase of interest expenses was mainly driven by higher 
amounts outstanding on average in 2023."

"Funds raised in non-euro currencies are incorporated in our general 
hedging strategy."
"As of 31 December 2023, approximately 24.0 % 
(2022: 20.7 %) of the long-term debt was issued or guaranteed by 
Allianz SE in currencies other than the euro."

Short-term debt funding 
The Medium-Term Note Program and the Commercial Paper 
Program constitute the available short-term sources of funding."
"Money market securities slightly decreased in the use of commercial 
paper, compared to the previous year-end."
"Interest expenses on 
money market securities increased, mainly due to higher funding costs 
on average in 2023."
"We can therefore continue funding our liquidity under the 
Euro Commercial Paper Program at an average rate below Euribor, 
and under the U.S."
"Dollar Commercial Paper Program at an average 
rate slightly above SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)."
"Further potential sources of short-term funding that allow the  
Allianz Group to fine-tune its capital structure include letter of 
credit facilities and bank credit lines."
These changes have also been reflected in comparative periods.
"2_Includes effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of € (468) mn and 
€ 268 mn in 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by € 6.5 bn 
to € 24.5 bn in 2023."
"This figure comprises net income plus adjustments 
for non-cash charges, credits, and other items included in net earnings, 
as well as cash flows related to the net change in operating assets and 
liabilities."
"Net income after adding back non-cash charges and similar 
items decreased by € 10.5 bn to € 20.5 bn in 2023."
"Operating cash 
flows from net changes in operating assets and liabilities rose by 
€ 17.0 bn."
"This was mainly driven by higher net changes from our 
insurance and investment contract liabilities with partially offsetting 
effects from financial assets for unit-linked contracts."
"In addition, last 
year we recorded the settlement of the majority of the provision 
related to the Structured Alpha matter."
"Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased by € 3.0 bn to 
€ 12.0 bn in 2023."
"This was mainly due to net cash inflows from 
derivative assets and liabilities after material net cash outflows in 
2022, in particular in our Life/Health business operations."
"Net cash outflow used in financing activities increased by 
€ 1.4 bn and amounted to € 5.7 bn in 2023."
"This development was 
largely driven by lower net cash inflows from liabilities to banks and 
customers and other financial liabilities as well as higher net cash 
outflows from the Allianz SE share buy-back program."
"Lower net cash 
outflows from our refinancing activities and higher net cash inflows 
from transactions between equityholders partially offset these effects."
"Cash and cash equivalents increased by € 6.3 bn, mainly 
stemming from our Life/Health business operations in Germany and 
the United States."

The analysis in the previous chapters is based on our consolidated 
financial statements and should be read in conjunction with them."
"In 
addition to our figures stated in accordance with the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Allianz Group uses total 
business volume, operating profit, shareholders’ core net income, and 
internal growth to enhance the understanding of our results."
"These 
additional measures should be viewed as complementary to, rather 
than a substitute for, our figures determined according to IFRS."
"For further information, please refer to note 5 to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Total business volume 
Total business volume comprises gross premiums written as well as fee 
and commission income in Property-Casualty, statutory gross 
premiums in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset 
Management."
"Accordingly, in addition to presenting nominal total business volume 
growth, we also present internal growth, which excludes these effects."
"In addition, we take the requirements of rating agencies into 
account."
"While capital requirements imposed by regulators constitute 
a binding constraint, meeting rating agencies’ capital requirements 
and maintaining strong credit ratings are strategic business objectives."
"These analyses 
allow us to take appropriate measures to preserve our continued 
capital and solvency strength."
"For example, the risk capital reflecting 
the risk profile and the cost of capital is an important aspect that is 
considered in business decisions."
"Furthermore, we ensure a close 
alignment of the risk and business strategy by the fact that business 
decisions to achieve our set targets are taken within the determined 
risk appetite and in line with the risk strategy."
"The implemented sound 
processes to steer the business and assess and manage associated 
risks ensure a continuous alignment of the risk and business strategy, 
and enable us to detect and address any potential deviations."
"In addition, our liquidity risk management framework ensures that 
all legal entities in scope are responsible for managing their liquidity 
risks and maintaining a sufficient liquidity position under both market 
and business conditions (expected as well as stressed)."
"Risk governance system and internal 
control system 
As a provider of financial services, we consider risk management, 
including an internal control system (ICS), to be a core competency 
and an integral part of our business."
"Our risk management framework 
covers all operations and subsidiaries within the Group in proportion 
to the inherent risks of their activities, ensuring that risks across the 
Group are consistently identified, analyzed, assessed, and adequately 
managed."
"The key elements of our risk management and internal 
control system framework are: 
− 
Promotion of a strong risk management culture, supported by a 
robust risk governance structure."
"− 
Consistent and proportional application of an integrated risk 
capital framework to protect our capital base and support 
effective capital management."
"− 
Integration of risk considerations and capital needs into 
management and decision-making processes by attributing risk 
and allocating capital to business segments, products, and 
strategies."
"Our risk management system is based on the following four pillars: 
− 
Risk identification, assessment and underwriting: A robust system 
of risk identification, assessment and underwriting forms the 
foundation 
for 
appropriate 
risk 
management 
decisions."
"Supporting activities include standards for underwriting, valuation 
methods, individual transaction and new product approvals, 
emerging/operational/top risk assessments, liquidity risk and 
scenario analyses, amongst others."
"− 
Risk strategy and risk appetite: Our risk strategy defines our risk 
appetite in line with our business strategy."
"It ensures that rewards 
are appropriate based on the risks taken and the required capital."
"It also ensures that delegated decision-making bodies work in line 
with our overall risk-bearing capacity and strategy."
"− 
Risk reporting and monitoring: Our comprehensive qualitative 
and quantitative risk monitoring and reporting framework 
provides management with the transparency needed to assess 
whether our risk profile remains within the approved limits and to 
identify emerging issues and risks quickly."
"For example, risk 
dashboard and limit utilization reports as well as scenario 
analyses and stress tests are regularly prepared and 
communicated."
"− 
Communication and transparency: Transparent risk disclosure 
provides the basis for communicating our strategy and 
performance to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring a 
sustainable positive impact on valuation and financing."
"It also 
strengthens the risk awareness and risk culture."
"In order to support these pillars, especially risk identification, 
assessment and monitoring, the Allianz Group has established an ICS, 
which consists of both specific risk controls and further control 
elements."
"Its objectives are to: 
− 
Safeguard the Group’s existence and business continuity."
"− 
Ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations."
"− 
Create a strong internal control environment, ensuring that all 
personnel are aware of the importance of internal controls and 
their role within the internal control system."
"− 
Provide the management bodies with the relevant information for 
their decision-making processes."
"Notwithstanding the oversight exercised by the Supervisory Board of 
the Allianz SE, controls are performed within the Allianz Group in terms 
of control areas, activities, and reporting, taking into account 
independence requirements, where applicable."
"The controls are 
embedded into the operational and organizational set-up throughout 
the Allianz Group and are subject to periodic reviews."
"Where 
appropriate, internationally recognized control frameworks such as 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO) or the IT-related Control Objectives for 
Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are used."
"These controls help to continuously review the effectiveness of the 
relevant processes and procedures (including operations and 
reporting), their coherence and proportionality within the Group, and 
to identify potential actions for the timely rectification of deficiencies."
"The ICS of the Allianz Group encompasses the entirety of activities 
undertaken to perform controls in different areas."
The ICS comprises various control concepts.
"These are supplemented by management 
reports."
"Integrated Risk and Control System for financial 
and non-financial reporting 
The following information is provided pursuant to §289(4) and §315(4) 
of the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB”)."
"For 
general information about our Integrated Risk and Control System 
(IRCS) and the Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), please refer 
to the section “Operational risk”."
"Accounting and consolidation processes 
The accounting and consolidation processes we use to produce our 
Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a central 
consolidation and reporting IT solution and local general ledger 
solutions."
"The latter are largely harmonized throughout the Group, 
using standardized processes, master data, posting logics, and 
interfaces for data delivery to the Holding."
"Access rights to accounting 
systems are managed according to strict authorization and hierarchy-
linked procedures."
"Accounting rules for the classification, valuation, and disclosure of 
all items in the balance sheet, the income statement, and notes related 
to the annual and interim financial statements are defined primarily in 
our Group accounting manual."
"The dedicated financial reporting control system approach can be 
summarized as follows: 
− 
A centrally developed risk catalog is linked to individual accounts."
"This risk catalog is reviewed on a yearly basis and is the starting 
point for the definition of the Group’s as well as the operating 
entities’ scope of financial reporting risks."
"In the course of the 
scoping process, both materiality and susceptibility to a 
misstatement are considered simultaneously."
"In addition to the 
quantitative calculation, we also consider qualitative criteria, such 
as the expected increase in business volume or the complexity of 
transactions."
"− 
Based on the centrally provided risk catalog, our local entities 
identify risks that could lead to material financial misstatements."
"− 
Preventive and detective key controls addressing financial 
reporting risks have been put in place to reduce the likelihood and 
impact of financial misstatements."
"When a potential risk is 
detected or materializes, actions are taken to reduce the impact of 
the financial misstatement."
"Given the strong dependence of 
financial reporting processes on information technology systems, 
we have also implemented IT controls."
"− 
Operating entity level controls to address non-financial reporting 
risks have been introduced and will be expanded going forward."
"− 
Group Audit and local internal audit functions ensure that these 
controls are subject to regular control testing, in order to assure 
reasonable design and operating effectiveness."
"Internal Audit 
does so through a comprehensive risk-based approach that 
assesses the key controls of the company’s internal procedures 
and processes, including local and group-internal controls over 
financial reporting risks, from an integrated perspective."
"Governance 
Group Accounting & Reporting and other Group center functions, the 
Group Disclosure Committee, and our operating entities support the 
Allianz SE Board of Management to ensure the completeness, 
accuracy, and reliability of our Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Group Accounting & Reporting also helps to ensure that non-financial 
reporting requirements are fulfilled and that data quality requirements 
are adhered to."
"In 2023, the Group Disclosure Committee 
met on a quarterly basis before the quarterly statements and financial 
reports were issued."
"In addition, the Group Disclosure Committee 
reviewed and approved the Solvency II reports prior to issuance."
"Subsidiaries within the scope of our control system are individually 
responsible for adhering to the Group’s internal governance and 
control policy and for creating local Disclosure Committees that are 
similar to the Group-level committee."
"The entities’ CEOs and CFOs 
provide periodic signoffs to the management of Allianz SE, certifying 
the effectiveness of their local systems of internal control as well as the 
completeness, accuracy, and reliability of financial data and non-
financial information reported to the Holding."
"For the management of compliance risks, Allianz maintains a 
Compliance Management System (CMS)."
"At the center of the CMS, 
Allianz has established compliance functions at the levels of the 
Allianz Group and the local operating entities as part of the Second 
Line of Defense."
"For details of the CMS, or more specifically of anti-
corruption and bribery matters, please refer to the Non-Financial 
Statement."

ineffective, and is therefore confident that they meet both the 
challenges of a rapidly changing environment and day-to-day 
business needs."
"This assessment is based on several factors:

wide responsibilities."
"The Board of Management formulates business objectives and 
sets a corresponding business strategy, risk strategy, and investment

"It also defines risk limits and allocates risk capital to the 
business activities within the Allianz Group."
"The core elements of the

approved by the Board of Management."
"The Board of 
Management reports to the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board advises, challenges, and supervises the

The Supervisory Board Risk Committee reports to the Supervisory 
Board, where the information and the findings are discussed with the 
Board of Management."
"It monitors the effectiveness of the Allianz risk

"Furthermore, it focuses on risk-related 
developments as well as general risks and specific risk exposures, and 
ensures that the business strategy is aligned with the risk strategy."
"For more information, please refer to the paragraph “Risk 
Committee” in the Supervisory Board Report."
"The GFRC also ensures that an

"The Second Line of Defense 
is made up of independent global oversight functions including Risk, 
Actuarial, Compliance, and Legal, which support the Board of

in place between the control functions to allow fully informed and 
educated decision-making."
"Group Risk Management function 
Group Risk is managed by the Group Chief Risk Officer, who also serves 
as the Chief Risk Officer of Allianz SE."
"Group Risk supports Allianz SE’s 
Board of Management, including its committees, by performing 
various analyses, communicating information related to risk 
management, and preparing and implementing committee 
decisions."
"Group Risk also supports the Board of Management in 
developing the risk management framework – which covers risk 
governance, risk strategy and appetite – and risk monitoring and 
reporting."
"Group Risk strengthens and maintains the Group’s risk network 
through regular and close interaction with the management of related 
undertakings and with other key stakeholders, such as the local 
finance, risk, actuarial, underwriting, and investment departments."
"A 
strong group-wide risk network enables the Allianz Group to influence 
risk culture across the Group, identify risks at an early stage, and make 
management aware of these risks."
"Related undertakings 
Related undertakings are responsible for their own risk management, 
including adherence to both external requirements (for example, 
those imposed by local regulators) and internal standards."
"Their 
Boards of Management are responsible for setting and approving a 
local risk strategy − supporting the Group’s risk strategy − during the 
annual Strategic and Planning Dialogues with the Group and for 
ensuring adherence to their risk strategy."
"The insurance and asset management operations of our related 
undertakings are subject to regular reviews in the context of the group-
wide internal risk management and control system."
"The control 
measures are accompanied by local Risk Management functions, 
headed by Chief Risk Officers, which are independent from business 
line management."
"The Risk Management functions run risk-
monitoring and -controlling processes, locally set up by the respective 
entities."
"Furthermore, the local activities are subject to additional 
reviews by regional entities, or the Allianz Asset Management GmbH 
for asset management."
"This ensures the adherence to Group 
requirements and the related reporting."
"A local Risk Committee 
supports both the Board of Management (or an equivalent executive 
committee) and the Chief Risk Officer by acting as the primary risk 
monitoring and controlling body."
"Moreover, the Group Chief Risk Officer must be 
consulted on decisions regarding the staffing, objectives, and

Allianz Group as well as Allianz SE and our other related undertakings 
and employees from regulatory and reputational risks."
"Group Compliance has defined preventive, detective, and 
responsive controls for the assigned compliance risk areas, which are 
based on requirements specified in the compliance standards and 
Code of Conduct."
"A compliance control catalog, including the 
development of control objectives arising from the various corporate 
compliance guidelines, as well as a cataloging of normative risk 
scenarios and defined key control activities, are available."
"Group Actuarial contributes towards assessing and managing 
risks of the Allianz Group and Allianz SE in line with regulatory 
requirements, in particular for those risks whose management requires 
actuarial expertise."
"The range of tasks includes, amongst others, the 
calculation and monitoring of technical provisions, technical actuarial 
assistance in business planning, reporting and monitoring of the 
results, and supporting the effective implementation of the risk 
management system."
"The latter includes joining Group Risk in a 
discipline to regularly monitor internal risk capital models, 
assumptions, and parameters – as well as their changes."
"It also 
includes providing support regarding capital efficiency management, 
contributing to the modeling of insurance risk capital, and supporting 
the identification of underwriting risks via independent reserve reviews."

Risk-based steering and risk 
management1 
We are exposed to a variety of risks, including market, credit, 
underwriting, 
business, 
operational, 
strategic, 
liquidity, 
and 
reputational risks."
"Allianz’s Asset Management business segment is primarily 
exposed to operational risk, reputational risk, and business risk."
"Market and credit risk are primarily borne by the segment’s underlying 
investors, be they internal or third-party clients."
"We consider diversification across different business segments, 
lines of business and regions to be an important element in managing 
our risks efficiently, as it limits the economic impact of any single event 
and contributes to relatively stable results."
"Our aim is to maintain a 
balanced risk profile without any disproportionately large risk 
concentrations and accumulations."
"With Solvency II being the regulatory regime relevant for the 
Group, our risk profile is measured and steered based on our approved 
Solvency II internal model2."
"We have introduced a target solvency ratio 
range in accordance with Solvency II, based on pre-defined stress 
scenarios 
for 
both 
the 
Group 
and 
related 
undertakings, 
supplemented by ad-hoc scenarios, historical and reverse stress 
tests, and sensitivity analyses."
"Unlike the insurance business, which is balance-sheet sensitive, 
our Asset Management business is mainly a cash flow business."
"Therefore, the risk of the Asset Management business segment is also 
analyzed through the impact of pre-defined material stress scenarios 
on the operating profit."
"These are one component in a system of key 
risk indicators for Asset Management and are regularly monitored."
"These risk limits are reviewed on a regular basis with First Line of 
Defense business owners, confirming the pre-assessments derived by 
the entity’s Risk Management functions."
"These risk limits (sometimes 
called risk bearing capacity thresholds) are presented to the 
underlying Risk Committee and are ultimately ratified by the Audit 
Committees and/or Executive Management Boards."
"In addition, central elements of Allianz’s dividend policy are linked 
to Solvency II capitalization based on the internal model."
"This helps us 
to ensure a consistent view on risk steering and capitalization in line 
with the Solvency II framework."
"1_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"2_From a formalistic perspective, the German Supervisory Authority deems our model to be “partial” 
because not all our entities use the internal model."
"Some of our smaller insurance entities report under 
the standard formula and others apply third country equivalence."
"For asset management, banking, and 
Allianz steers its business portfolio taking a comprehensive view 
of risk and return, which is based on the internal model and is 
supported by scenario analyses."
"Risk and concentrations are actively 
restricted by limits based on our internal model."
"The Life/Health 
business segment is steered – in addition to the Return on Equity – by 
a return on risk capital3 (RoRC) approach for new business at the 
product level, while for the Property-Casualty business segment a 
return on equity (RoE insurance) at the portfolio level is used."
"RoRC and RoE insurance are indicators that allow us to identify 
profitable lines of business and products on a sustainable basis."
"For 
new Life/Health insurance business, RoRC reflects the expected 
average return against the capital commitment over the lifetime of the 
products and is a key criterion for capital allocation decisions."
"For 
Property-Casualty insurance business, the RoE insurance reflects the 
return against the underlying equity which is allocated to the specific 
portfolios based on the respective risk capital requirements."
"This 
allows us to take appropriate risk-based decisions."
"Consistent with industry practices, the Asset Management 
business segment is measured on its efficiency based upon cost to 
income, i.e., the Cost Income Ratio (CIR)."
"As a consequence, the internal model is fully integrated in the 
steering of the insurance business, and its application satisfies the so-
called “use test” requirement under Solvency II."
"Qualitative assessments as part of the Insurance and Asset 
Management risk framework include Top Risk Assessments, as well as 
group-challenged self-assessments and selected group reviews of the 
maturity of the local risk management systems and the adherence to 
the risk policy framework."
"Key results of the entities’ qualitative risk 
assessments are reported to the Group on a regular basis."
"As an inherent part of our insurance operations, we collect premiums 
from our policyholders and invest them in a wide variety of assets."
"The 
resulting investment portfolios back the future claims payments and 
benefits to our customers."
"In addition, we also invest shareholders’ 
capital, which is required to support the business."
"Finally, we use 
derivatives, mostly to hedge our portfolio against adverse market 
movements (for example, protective puts) or to reduce our 
reinvestment risk (for example, by using forwards, swaps, or 
Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision (IORP), sectoral requirements are applied."
"Without 
loss of generality, we might use the term internal model in the following chapters, e.g., in case of 
descriptions also referring to entities that use the internal model, or descriptions focusing on processes 
with respect to the internal model components."
"Asset/liability management (ALM) decisions are taken 
based on the internal model, considering both the risks and the returns 
on the financial market."
"As the fair values of our investment portfolios and liabilities 
depend on the changes observed in the financial markets, we are 
exposed to the risk of adverse financial market developments."
"The 
long-dated liabilities in our Life/Health business segment and those 
attributable to internal pensions contribute to interest rate risk, in 
particular when they cannot be fully matched by available 
investments due to long maturities."
"In addition, we are also exposed to 
adverse changes in equity and real estate prices, credit spread levels, 
inflation, implied volatilities, and currencies, which might impact the 
value of our assets and liabilities."
"To measure these market risks, real-world stochastic models4 for 
the relevant risk factors are calibrated using historical time series to 
generate possible future market developments."
"After the scenarios for 
all the risk factors are generated, the asset and liability positions are 
revalued under each scenario."
"The worst-case outcome of the sorted 
portfolio profit and loss distribution at a certain confidence level 
(99.5 %) defines the market Value at Risk (VaR)."
"For entities modeled 
using the standard formula, the market risk is based on aggregating 
the losses under specified standard formula shock scenarios."
"Strategic asset allocation benchmarks and risk limits – including 
stand-alone interest rate and equity sensitivity limits, and foreign 
exchange exposure limits – are defined for the Group, Allianz SE, and 
the other related undertakings."
"Limits are closely monitored and, if a 
breach occurs, countermeasures are implemented which may include 
escalation to the respective decision-making bodies and/or the closing 
of positions."
"Furthermore, we have put in place standards for hedging 
activities, due to the exposure to fair-value options embedded in our 
life insurance products."
"3_The return on risk capital is defined as the present value of future real-world profits on the capital 
requirement (including buffer to regulatory requirements) held at the local level."
"4_Internal pensions are evaluated and modeled based on deterministic cash flow models, following IAS 19 
principles."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
 
134 
Finally, guidelines are provided by the Group regarding certain 
investments, new investment products, and the use of derivatives."
"Compliance with these guidelines is controlled by the risk and 
controlling functions at Allianz SE and the other operating entities."
"With respect to investment assets of the Property-Casualty and 
Life/Health business segments managed by Allianz’s asset managers, 
guidelines applicable to our insurance undertakings must be clearly 
elaborated as part of the asset managers’ client investment 
guidelines."
"Notwithstanding the above, portfolios managed by 
Allianz’s asset managers for the benefit of third-party investment 
clients must adhere to the investment frameworks and constraints as 
defined by and agreed with them."
"Interest rate risk 
Allianz is a liability-driven investor."
"We may suffer an economic loss in 
the event of falling interest rates as we reinvest maturing assets at 
lower rates prior to the maturity of liability contracts, if the duration of 
our assets is shorter than our liabilities."
"This risk is higher for long-dated 
life investment and savings products as well as for internal pensions, 
with a significant part of the Life/Health business segment’s interest 
rate risk coming from Western Europe, mainly from traditional life 
insurance products with guarantees."
"Conversely, opportunities may 
arise when interest rates increase."
"Interest rate risk is managed within 
our asset/liability management process and controlled via interest 
rate sensitivity and duration mismatch limits for the Group and the 
local entities."
"Inflation risk 
We are exposed to changing inflation rates, predominantly due to our 
Property-Casualty insurance obligations but also due to inflation-
indexed internal pension obligations."
"The risk that 
inflation rates deviate from inflation assumptions is incorporated in our 
internal model."
"Potential severe structural breaks are monitored via 
historical and ad-hoc stress tests."
"Measures have been taken to 
manage currently observed elevated inflation levels."
"On the Property-
Casualty side, this includes continuous monitoring of claims inflation, 
sufficient provisioning, and timely adjustments of premium rates to 
reflect both actual and expected inflation."
"Equity risk 
Insurance-focused Allianz entities may hold equity investments to 
diversify their portfolios and to take advantage of expected long-term 
returns."
"Strategic asset allocation benchmarks, investment and equity 
sensitivity limits are used to monitor and manage these exposures."
"In 
addition, equity investments fall within the scope of the credit risk 
platform to avoid single-name risk concentrations."
"Risks from changes 
in equity prices are normally associated with decreasing share prices 
and increasing equity price volatilities."
"As stock markets might also 
increase, opportunities may arise from equity investments in those 
events."
"Credit spread risk 
Fixed-income assets such as bonds may lose value if credit spreads 
widen."
"However, our risk appetite for credit spread risk takes into 
account the underlying economics of our business model: As a liability-
driven investor, we typically hold fixed-income assets until maturity."
"This implies that we are less affected economically by short-term 
changes in market prices."
"In our capacity as a long-term investor, this 
gives us the opportunity to invest in bonds yielding spreads over the 
risk-free return and earning this additional yield component."
"Currency risk 
Allianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group 
typically invest in assets which are denominated in the same currency 
as their liabilities."
"However, some foreign currency exposures are 
allowed to support portfolio diversification and tactical investment 
decisions."
"Based on the Allianz Group’s foreign exchange 
management limit framework, currency risk is monitored and 
managed at the levels of the Allianz Group, Allianz SE, and the other 
operating entities of the Allianz Group."
"Real estate risk 
Despite the risk of decreasing real estate values, real estate is a 
suitable addition to our investment portfolio due to good 
diversification benefits, as well as to the contribution of relatively 
predictable, long-term cash flows."
"Allianz’s Group Investment Committee has defined a framework 
for standard transactions for real estate equity and commercial real 
estate loan investments."
"These standards outline diversification 
targets, minimum-return thresholds, and other qualitative and 
quantitative requirements."
"All transactions that do not meet these 
standards or have a total investment volume (including costs) 
exceeding a defined threshold must be reviewed individually by Group 
Risk and other Group center functions."
"In addition, all applicable limits 
must be respected, in particular those resulting from strategic asset 
allocation as well as its leeways and risk limits, with regards to an 
investing entity’s portfolio."
"Credit risk is measured as the potential economic loss in the value of 
our portfolio that would result from either changes in the credit quality 
of our counterparties (“migration risk”) or the inability or unwillingness 
of a counterparty to fulfill contractual obligations (“default risk”)."
"The Group’s credit risk profile originates from three sources: our 
investment portfolio, our credit insurance business, and our external 
reinsurance."
"− 
Investment portfolio: Credit risk results from our investments in 
fixed-income bonds, loans, derivatives, cash positions, and 
receivables whose value may decrease depending on the credit 
quality of the obligor."
"However, losses due to credit events can be 
shared with the policyholder for certain life insurance products."
"− 
Credit insurance: Credit risk arises from potential claim payments 
on limits granted by Allianz Trade to its policyholders."
"Allianz 
Trade insures its policyholders against credit risk associated with 
short-term trade credits advanced to policyholder’s clients."
"When 
the client of the policyholder is unable to meet its payment 
obligations, Allianz Trade indemnifies the loss to the policyholder."
"− 
Reinsurance: Credit risk arises from potential losses from non-
recoverability of reinsurance receivables or due to default on 
benefits under in force reinsurance treaties."
"Our reinsurance 
partners are carefully selected by a dedicated team."
"Besides 
focusing on companies with strong credit profiles, we may also 
require letters of credit, cash deposits, funds withheld, or assets 
held in trust, or other financial measures to further mitigate our 
exposure to credit risk."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
 
135 
The internal credit risk capital model takes into account the major 
determinants of credit risk for each instrument, including exposure at 
default, rating, seniority, collateral, and maturity."
"Additional 
parameters assigned to obligors are migration probabilities and 
obligor asset correlations reflecting dependencies within the portfolio."
"Ratings are assigned to single obligors using a clearly defined 
assignment process."
"The central components of this assignment 
process are long-term ratings from external rating agencies, and 
internal rating models in case of specific internal investment strategies."
"If available, a dynamic adjustment using market-implied ratings and 
the most recent qualitative information available is applied."
"The loss profile of a given portfolio is obtained using a Monte 
Carlo simulation, taking into account interdependencies and exposure 
concentrations per obligor segment."
"The loss profiles are calculated at 
different levels of the Allianz Group, and then fed into the internal 
model at each level for further aggregation across sources of risk to 
derive diversified credit risk."
"Our credit insurance portfolio is modeled by Allianz Trade, based 
on a proprietary model component which is a local adaptation of the 
central internal credit risk model."
"Allianz Trade’s loss profile is 
integrated in the Group’s internal credit risk model to capture the 
concentration and diversification effects."
"To ensure effective credit risk management, credit VaR limits are 
derived from our internal risk capital framework, and rating bucket 
benchmarks are used to define our risk appetite for exposures in the 
lower investment-grade and non-investment-grade area."
"Our group-wide country and obligor group limit management 
framework (CrisP1) allows us to manage counterparty concentration 
risk, covering both credit and equity exposures at the Group, Allianz SE, 
and other operating-entity levels."
"This limit framework forms the basis 
for discussions on credit actions and provides notification services 
featuring the quick and broad communication of credit-related 
decisions across the Group."
"Clearly defined processes ensure that exposure concentrations 
and limit utilizations are appropriately monitored and managed."
"Property-Casualty 
The Property-Casualty primary and reinsurance business of the 
Allianz Group 
is 
exposed 
to 
premium-risk-related 
adverse 
developments in the current year’s new and renewed business, as well 
as to reserve risks related to the business in force."
"Premium risk 
As part of our Property-Casualty business operations, we receive 
premiums from our customers and provide insurance protection in 
return."
"Premium risk is the risk that actual claims for the business in the 
current year develop adversely relative to expected claims ratios."
"Premium risk can be mitigated by reinsurance as well as by technical 
excellence in underwriting."
"Assessing risks as part of the underwriting 
process is therefore a key element of our risk management framework."
"There are clear underwriting limits and restrictions which are defined 
centrally and applied across the Group."
"Premium risk is subdivided into three categories: natural 
catastrophe risk, terror risk, and non-catastrophe risk including man-
made catastrophes."
"Premium risk is estimated based on actuarial models that are 
used to derive loss distributions."
"Non-catastrophe risks are modeled 
using frequency and severity models for large losses and aggregate 
loss distribution models for attritional losses."
"Natural disasters such as 
earthquakes, storms, and floods represent a significant challenge for 
risk management due to their high accumulation potential for higher 
return periods."
"For natural catastrophe risks, we use special modeling 
techniques which combine portfolio data (geographic location, 
characteristics of insured objects, and their values) with simulated 
natural disaster scenarios to estimate the magnitude and frequency of 
potential losses."
"Where such stochastic models do not exist, we use 
deterministic, scenario-based approaches to estimate potential losses."
"Similar approaches are used to evaluate risk concentrations for terror 
events and man-made catastrophes, including losses from cyber 
incidents and industrial concentrations."
2_Property-Casualty is also referred to as Non-Life.
"These loss distributions are then used within the internal model to 
calculate potential losses with a predefined confidence level of 99.5 %."
"Reserve risk 
Reserve risk represents the risk of adverse developments in best-
estimate reserves over a one-year time horizon, resulting from 
fluctuations in the timing and/or amount of claims settlement."
"We 
estimate and hold reserves for claims resulting from past events that 
have not yet been settled."
"In case of unexpected developments, we 
would experience a gain or loss dependent on the assumptions 
applied for the estimate."
"In addition, the risk of inflation volatility 
deviating from historical observations and of changes in yield curves is 
covered in the specific market risk modules."
"Similar to premium risk, reserve risk is calculated based on 
actuarial models."
"The reserve distributions derived are then used 
within the internal model to calculate potential losses based on a 
predefined confidence level of 99.5 %."
"In order to reduce the risk of unexpected reserve volatility, 
Allianz SE and the other related undertakings of the Allianz Group 
constantly monitor the development of reserves for insurance claims 
on a line-of-business level."
"In addition, related undertakings generally 
conduct annual reserve uncertainty analyses based on similar 
methods used for reserve risk calculations."
"The Allianz Group performs 
regular independent reviews of these analyses and Group 
representatives participate in the local reserve committee meetings."
"Retrocession is another important instrument to mitigate reserve 
risk."
"Life/Health 
Underwriting risks in our Life/Health operations (biometric risks) 
include mortality, disability, morbidity, and longevity risks."
"Mortality, 
disability, and morbidity risks are associated with an unexpected 
increase in the occurrence of death, disability, or medical claims."
"Longevity risk is the risk that the reserves covering life annuities and 
pension products might not be sufficient due to longer life 
expectancies of the insured."
"Life/Health underwriting risk arises from profitability being lower 
than expected."
"As profitability calculations are based on several 
parameters – such as assumptions on future mortality rates, or 
morbidity claims – the actual development may differ from the 
expected one."
"For example, lower-than-expected mortality rates 
would lead to additional annuity payments in the future."
"However, 
3_Life/Health is also referred to as Life."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
 
136 
beneficial deviations are also possible; for example, a trend towards 
healthier lifestyles will most likely result in lower overall health 
insurance claims."
"We measure these risks within our internal model, distinguishing, 
where appropriate, between risks affecting the absolute level and 
trend development of the actuarial assumptions on the one hand and 
pandemic risk scenarios on the other."
"Depending on the nature and 
complexity of the risks involved, our health business is represented in 
the internal model according to Property-Casualty or Life/Health 
calculation methods and is therefore included in the relevant Property-
Casualty and Life/Health figures accordingly."
"However, most of our 
health business is attributable to the Life/Health business segment."
Business risks include cost risks and policyholder behavior risks.
"They 
are mostly driven by the Life/Health business and to a lesser extent by 
the Property-Casualty and the Asset Management business."
"Cost risks 
are associated with the risk that expenses incurred in administering 
insurance policies – or investment management expenses for portfolio 
management – are higher than expected or that new business volume 
decreases to a level that does not allow Allianz to absorb its fixed costs."
Business risk is measured relative to baseline plans.
"For the Life/Health business, policyholder behavior risks are risks 
related to unpredictable, adverse behavior of policyholders in 
exercising their contractual options, such as, for instance, early 
termination of contracts, surrenders, partial withdrawals, renewals, 
and annuity take-up options."
"Assumptions on policyholder behavior are set in line with 
accepted actuarial methods and based on own historical data, where 
available."
"If there is no historical data, assumptions are based on 
industry data or expert judgment."
"These are used as a basis to 
determine the economic impact of policyholder behavior under 
different scenarios within our internal model."
"1_For further information on cyber risk, see section “Cybersecurity” in the Non-Financial Statement."
"− 
Cross effects: This part takes into account that a combined impact 
of a market rate change and a lapse rate change could deviate 
significantly from the sum of the two impacts."
"Examples include mis-selling, non-compliance with 
internal or external requirements related to products, anti-trust 
behavior, data protection, sanctions and embargoes, etc."
"These 
losses tend to be less frequent but, when they occur, can have a 
high financial (and reputational) impact."
"− 
“Execution, Delivery, and Process Management”: potential losses 
arising from transaction or process management failures."
"Examples include interest and penalties from non-payment or 
underpayment of taxes, or losses associated with broker and 
agent distribution processes."
"These losses tend to be of a relatively 
higher frequency but with little financial impact (although single 
large-loss events can occur)."
"In the last year, the following two operational risks related to IT have 
gained in importance in particular:  
The first operational risk results from fast developments in the 
area of artificial intelligence (AI) including generative AI."
"Allianz addresses these new legal 
and reputational risks seriously with its AI governance framework, 
which is already rolled out in various OEs."
"It basically includes a 
practical guidance for AI promoting transparency, privacy, fairness, 
human agency and accountability in the development and 
deployment of AI solutions."
"Privacy and ethics impact assessments 
help to implement these AI principles on a case-by-case basis."
"These 
activities are supported by various training and awareness campaigns 
for Allianz employees, and by a data advisory board preparing 
decisions for the Board of Management in the area of AI and data 
ethics."
"The Allianz AI governance framework will be further adjusted, 
especially to implement the European Union AI Act in its final version, 
and structurally rolled out in the operating entities."
"The second operational risk is compliance with rising regulatory 
requirements on the management of IT risks."
"In the second quarter 
2022, BaFin conducted an audit on the implementation of the 
supervisory requirements for insurance on IT (VAIT) at Allianz SE, with 
the new version published on 3 March 2022."
"To address the findings, 
Allianz SE has set up a program under the lead of the division 
“Operations, IT and Organization” and approved and submitted to 
BaFin a corresponding remediation plan."
"The remediation plan has 
been accepted by BaFin."
"Additional recent examples are the European Commission’s 
Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and similar requirements 
from local regulators relevant for the Allianz Group."
"To achieve 
compliance with the large number of very granular DORA standards, 
an extensive program coordinated by Group Protection & Resilience 
was initiated during 2023."
"The program aims to implement adequate 
solutions by January 2025, when the requirements set by the act need 
to be effectively met by Allianz."
"Group Risk is participating in the 
project and is actively involved in contributing to the design required 
by DORA."
"In the last year, one operational risk related to IT has reduced in 
importance."
"The program 
was supported with a tailored risk assessment approach, which will 
now happen in a similar way for the local project."
"Risks at all levels of 
the program – at operating entities, business areas and the global 
program – were independently identified, assessed, and will – where 
necessary – continue to be managed, and monitored in a harmonized 
way."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group

The Allianz Group’s operational risk primarily refers to losses in 
either the insurance or the asset management business, or both."
"The Group’s operational risk capital is dominated by the risk of 
potential losses within the categories “Clients, Products, and Business 
Practices” and “Execution, Delivery, and Process Management”."
"With 
regard to the largest category “Clients, Products, and Business 
Practices”, key external drivers are changes in laws and regulations."
Internal drivers reflect potential failures of internal processes.
"These 
drivers are considered in the local scenario analyses."
"Operational risk capital is calculated using a scenario-based 
approach based on expert judgment, as well as internal and external 
operational loss data."
"The estimates for frequency and severity of 
potential loss events for each material operational risk category are 
assessed and used as a basis for our internal model calibration."
"Allianz has developed a consistent operational risk management 
framework, which is applied across the Group based on 
proportionality and focuses on the early recognition and proactive 
management of material operational risks."
This framework triggers specific mitigating control programs.
"For 
example, compliance risks are addressed with written policies and 
dedicated compliance programs monitored by compliance functions 
across the Allianz Group."
"The risk of financial misstatement is 
mitigated by a system of internal controls covering financial reporting."
"Outsourcing risks are covered by our Outsourcing Policy, Service Level 
Agreements, and Business Continuity and Crisis Management 
programs to protect critical business functions from these events."
"Due to the particular importance of operational risks for the Asset 
Management business, a key task for the local Risk Management 
functions in the related entities is a regular monitoring of the internal 
controls attached to material processes."
"This is also supported by the 
introduction of the concept on Non-Financial Risk Management 
(NFRM)."
"The ICS for operational risk encompasses the management of 
compliance, financial reporting, and other operational risks."
"The 
effectiveness of this internal control system is monitored along two 
dimensions: 
− 
Monitoring the effective implementation of the Non-Financial Risk 
Management (NFRM) framework, which is progressively replacing 
the Integrated Risk and Control System (IRCS) framework."
"If 
correctly implemented, these frameworks ensure that risks are 
identified in time, and controls are appropriately set up and tested 
frequently to identify potential weaknesses or gaps in the internal 
control system."
"− 
Monitoring the resolution of identified weaknesses in the internal 
control system."
"NFRM strengthens the internal control system by using a new risk 
taxonomy consistent across the Group, which helps to aggregate the 
risks at Group level, and by using an even more rigorous testing 
approach."
"It is being rolled out in so-called waves with close 
monitoring by Group Risk and Group Compliance."
"Insurance and Asset 
Management entities of the first two waves – 44 operating entities out 
of 67 – have already undergone important implementation steps in 
2023 to further bolster assurance activities."
"Operating entities part of 
the last wave 3 have continued to apply the IRCS framework and will 
implement NFRM in 2024."
"The full implementation of the new framework across the Group 
is expected to be completed by year-end 2024."
"Meanwhile, Group Risk 
and Group Compliance are closely monitoring all waves, seamlessly 
bridging an effective migration between IRCS and NFRM."
"The NFRM is an integral part of the overall ICS, whose 
fundamentals are described in the section “Risk Governance System 
and Internal Control System”."
"The NFRM is the framework by which the Second Line of Defense 
supports and facilitates the fulfillment of First Line of Defense 
responsibility to implement an adequate and effective system for 
managing Non-Financial Risks."
"The NFRM aims to strengthen the 
control system by using a harmonized methodology to:  
− 
Achieve a consistent and commonly accepted definition of risks 
that fall under the category Non-Financial Risk, via establishing a 
set of non-financial risk vectors."
"− 
Facilitate the implementation of adequate controls via an NFRM 
control catalog, consisting of control objectives, risk scenarios, and 
exemplary key controls."
"− 
Ensure a robust testing of these controls, using a systematic risk-
based approach."
"The NFRM framework has the following key features:  
− 
Objective data is used through a consistent methodology to 
facilitate a baseline assessment of non-financial risks."
"− 
An assessment of top non-financial risks prioritizes risks to better 
allocate resources."
"− 
A process-level view is used to approach risks and controls from a 
business view, and to facilitate integrated assurance."
"− 
Standardized key controls are defined to support compliance and 
risk management by design, and to enforce integrated assurance 
and testing rigor."
Fundamental to the NFRM is the concept of a holistic approach.
"While 
there are several different sources of operational risks, the process 
towards the management of the risks always follows the same core 
principle."
"This is that operational risks must be identified, assessed, and 
prioritized, and underlying mitigating controls have to be effective."
"This 
is the basic premise behind establishing an integrated approach."
"At the Allianz Group level, it is important to monitor the quality of 
the local implementation of this framework as a means of ensuring 
that internal control system weaknesses are identified prior to the 
occurrence of operational risk events (ex-ante)."
"C _ Group Management Report 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
 
138 
To fulfill this objective, Allianz relies on a methodology known as 
the OE control environment rating."
"The OE control environment rating 
evaluates the effectiveness of the framework at the operating entity 
level by leveraging several sources of data and KPIs, which are then 
further enhanced via certain qualitative criteria."
"Additionally, an Allianz group-wide Executive Accountability 
Regime (EAR) is in place to further support the integration of risk 
management into business processes."
"It is essential that the Board of 
Management demonstrates a strong risk culture to support this 
integration – they lead by example in order to make clear throughout 
the business that the management of risks is an important factor when 
it comes to the achievement of business objectives."
"In 
addition, to reinforce these accountabilities amongst business leaders, 
compliance with internal and external regulations as well as vigilance 
in living the Group’s risk culture is taken into account when determining 
performance."
"In 2023, the EAR has been further enhanced to include 
a minimum set of clearly defined key indicators to measure OE 
management’s timely responsiveness in the areas of Risk, Compliance, 
Legal, Data Privacy, Audit, and People & Culture."
"These quantitative 
indicators are complemented with a holistic qualitative assessment."
"There are risks which, due to their nature, cannot be adequately 
addressed or mitigated by setting aside dedicated capital."
"These risks 
are therefore not considered in the internal model."
"For the identification, 
analysis, assessment, monitoring, and management of these risks we 
also use a systematic approach, with risk assessment generally based 
on qualitative criteria or scenario analyses."
"The most important of 
these other risks are strategic, liquidity, and reputational risk."
"Strategic risk 
Strategic risk is the risk of a decrease in the company’s value arising 
from adverse management decisions on business strategies and their 
implementation."
"Strategic risks are identified and evaluated as part of the Group’s 
Top Risk Assessment process and discussed in various Board of 
Management-level committees (for example, GFRC)."
"We also monitor 
market and competitive conditions, capital market requirements, 
regulatory conditions, etc., to decide if strategic adjustments are 
necessary."
"The most important strategic risks are related to the value 
creation levers, which focus on three themes: Growth, Margin 
Expansion, and Capital Efficiency."
"Progress on mitigating strategic 
risks and meeting the value creation levers is monitored and evaluated 
in the course of the Strategic and Planning Dialogues between the 
Allianz Group and Allianz SE and the other related undertakings."
"Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that current or future payment 
obligations cannot be met or can only be met on the basis of adversely 
altered conditions."
"Liquidity risk can arise primarily if there are 
mismatches in the timing of cash in- and outflows."
"The liquidity risk profile of Allianz predominantly originates from the 
uncertainty about the volume and timing of cash needs from 
insurances liabilities."
"This relates especially to: 
− 
Coverage of various types of catastrophes in the Property-
Casualty business, with the frequency of such events anticipated to 
increase going forward as a result of the unfolding climate change 
effects."
"− 
Mass lapse events or rising lapse rates in the Life/Health insurance 
business, especially in combination with changes in the relevant 
capital market environment."
"Major risks can also result from derivative transactions used by Allianz 
to hedge specific market risks."
"Allianz is exposed to liquidity risk as well due to large operational 
risk events, which may potentially result in significant cash outflows."
"Another source of liquidity risk for Allianz are potential regulatory 
actions by local supervisors, which may reduce dividends from 
subsidiaries to the Group (e.g., due to global events such as those 
partially observed during the COVID-19 crisis)."
"Each legal entity of the Allianz Group measures and manages 
liquidity risk locally, using asset/liability management systems 
designed to ensure that assets and liabilities are adequately matched."
"Local investment strategies particularly focus on the quality of the 
investments and ensure a significant portion of liquid assets (e.g., high-
rated government bonds or covered bonds) in the portfolios."
"These analyses are 
predominantly performed at legal entity level and are monitored by 
the Group for large- and mid-sized units."
"The annual and the high-level three-year cash flow plan for 
Allianz SE and the Holding and Treasury reportable segment reflect 
the overall operating, financing, and investing strategy of the 
Allianz Group."
"The liquidity stress-testing framework of Allianz SE is 
identical to that of the other legal entities."
"Major contingent liquidity 
requirements arise mainly from market risk scenarios for Allianz SE and 
its subsidiaries, from the non-availability of external capital markets, 
and from reinsurance risk scenarios for Allianz SE."
"In addition, the cash position of the Group cash pool investment 
portfolio is monitored and forecast on a daily basis."
"In the liquidity risk measurement process, early warning and limit 
thresholds are applied to regularly measure the local (stressed) 
liquidity position, inform senior management, and decide on actions if 
needed."
"The management of Allianz’s liquidity risk at a local level is 
facilitated by a dedicated governance and organizational setup."
"In 
general, the First Line of Defense is responsible for managing liquidity 
risk."
"Monitoring of liquidity risk is the responsibility of the local Risk 
Management functions, and potential liquidity gaps are reported to 
the respective local boards of management."
"Reputational risk is the risk of an unexpected drop in the value of 
the Allianz SE share price, the value of the in-force business, or the 
value of future business caused by a decline in our reputation in the 
eyes of internal or external stakeholders."
"The identification and assessment of reputational risks is part of 
the annual Top Risk Assessment process, undertaken by the 
Allianz Group and all operating entities."
"As part of this process, senior 
management approves the risk strategy for the most significant risks 
and their potential reputational impact."
"Allianz’s strategy for the management of these risks begins with 
establishing a comprehensive understanding of all the ways ESG 
factors can trigger adverse events within the investment, underwriting, 
and operations areas of our business, as well as from a broader 
reputational perspective."
"For this purpose, a dedicated ESG risk 
inventory has been established and a corresponding risk assessment 
performed, which enables us to take a risk-based view in terms of 
evaluating the adequacy of mitigation measures in place."
"ESG-related mitigation measures may vary substantially, 
depending on the precise nature of the underlying risk, ranging from 
establishment of specific controls at the business process level through 
to adjustments in Allianz’s long-term business strategy."
"Given that all 
adverse impacts attributable to ESG factors are ultimately realized 
within one of Allianz’s existing risk categories, we aim – to the greatest 
extent possible – to embed the identification and management of 
these risks directly within risk management processes already in place."
"At the Group level, the GFRC is responsible for overseeing ESG-
related risks."
"In addition, a Group Sustainability Board is in place, which 
is responsible for Allianz’s overall ESG strategy and for steering the 
integration of ESG aspects into core investment and insurance activities."
"For a broader perspective on our key ESG integration processes, 
please refer to the sections “Sustainability integration approach” and 
“Transition plan and strategy” in the Non-Financial Statement."
"derived objectives of ESG investing, while complying with globally and 
locally relevant rules and regulations."
"Climate change 
Within the broad scope of ESG, climate change is currently the ESG 
factor of primary emphasis, both in terms of regulatory focus and 
potential to materially influence our risk profile over a short- to mid-
term and long-term horizon."
"Commensurate with this emphasis, an 
assessment of Allianz’s climate change-related risks has been 
conducted during 2023, including both a qualitative risk assessment 
following the structure of the ESG risk inventory, as well as quantitative 
scenario analyses and stress-testing."
"For information about the climate change risk management 
methodology, the outcome of the assessments and next steps, please 
refer to the section ”Climate-related risks” in the Non-Financial Statement."
"Internal risk capital framework1 
We define internal risk capital as the capital required to protect us 
against unexpected, extreme economic losses, and which forms the 
basis for determining our Solvency II regulatory capitalization."
"We 
calculate and consistently aggregate internal risk capital across all 
business segments on a quarterly basis."
"We also regularly project risk 
capital requirements between reporting periods in times of financial 
market turbulence."
"For the management of our risk profile and solvency position, we utilize 
an approach that reflects the Solvency II rules in that it comprises our 
approved internal model covering Allianz SE and all other major 
insurance operations."
"Other entities are reflected based on standard 
formula results, others under the deduction and aggregation 
approach as well as on sectoral requirements (e.g., Asset 
Management) or local requirements for non-insurance operations, in 
accordance with the Solvency II framework."
"Internal model 
Our internal model is based on a VaR approach using a Monte Carlo 
simulation."
"Following this approach, we determine the maximum loss 
of portfolio value in scope of the model within a specified timeframe 
2_Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America is based on third-country equivalence."
"(“holding period”, set at one year) and probability of occurrence 
(“confidence level”, set at 99.5 %)."
"We simulate risk events from all risk 
categories (“sources of risk”) modeled and calculate the portfolio 
value based on the net fair value of assets minus liabilities, including 
risk-mitigating measures such as reinsurance contracts or derivatives, 
under each scenario."
"The risk capital required is defined as the difference between the 
current portfolio value and the portfolio value under adverse 
conditions at the 99.5 % confidence level."
"As we consider the impact of 
a negative or positive event on all risk sources and covered businesses 
at the same time, diversification effects across products and regions 
are taken into account."
"The results of our Monte Carlo simulation allow 
us to analyze our exposure to each source of risk, both separately and 
in aggregate."
"We also analyze several pre-defined stress scenarios 
representing historical events, reverse stress tests, and adverse 
scenarios relevant for our portfolio."
"Furthermore, we conduct ad-hoc 
stress tests on a monthly basis to reflect current political and financial 
developments, and to analyze specific non-financial risks more closely."
"Coverage of the risk capital calculations 
The Allianz Group’s internal model to calculate our Solvency Capital 
Requirement (SCR) covers all major insurance operations 2."
"This 
includes both relevant assets (including fixed income, equities, real 
estate, and derivatives) and liabilities (including the run-off of all 
current and planned technical provisions as well as deposits, issued 
debt, and other liabilities)."
"For with-profit products in the Life/Health 
business segment, the options and guarantees embedded in 
insurance contracts – including policyholder behavior – are taken into 
account."
"Smaller related undertakings in the European Economic Area 
which are not covered by the internal model are reflected with their 
standard formula results."
"Until the third quarter 2023, the Solvency 
Capital Requirements for certain smaller insurance undertakings 
outside the European Economic Area with only immaterial impact on 
the Group’s risk profile were accounted for at the level of Allianz Group 
by means of book value deduction3."
"Due to regulatory requirements, 
starting from the fourth quarter 2023, the book value deduction 
approach is no longer used for these entities."
"Instead, the contribution 
of the solvency capital requirement from these entities to the Group is 
derived through experience values from the standard model, in 
alignment with the regulator."
"3_Under book value deduction, the book value of the respective entity is deducted from eligible Own Funds 
of the Group."
"As the impact on the Group’s total Solvency Capital 
Requirement is minor, risk management for the banking operations is 
not discussed in greater detail."
"For our Asset Management business segment, we assign internal risk 
capital requirements based on sectoral regulatory capital requirements."
"In view of the above, Allianz’s risk capital framework covers all 
material and quantifiable risks."
"Risks not specifically covered by the 
internal model include strategic, liquidity, and reputational risks."
"Risk-free rate and volatility adjustment 
When calculating the fair values of assets and liabilities, the 
assumptions regarding the underlying risk-free yield curve are crucial 
in determining and discounting future cash flows."
"For liability 
valuation, we apply the methodology provided by the European 
Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to 
extrapolate the risk-free interest rate curves beyond the last liquid tenor."
"In addition, we adjust the risk-free yield curves by a volatility 
adjustment (VA) in most markets where a volatility adjustment is 
defined by EIOPA and approved by the local regulator."
"This is done to 
better reflect the underlying economics of our business, as the cash 
flows of our insurance liabilities are largely predictable."
"The 
advantage of being a long-term investor is the opportunity to invest in 
bonds yielding spreads over the risk-free return and earning this 
additional yield component over the duration of the bonds."
"Being a 
long-term investor mitigates much of the risk of having to sell debt 
instruments at a loss prior to maturity."
"We take account of this by applying the volatility adjustment to 
mitigate the credit spread risk, which we consider to be less meaningful 
for long-term investors than the default risk."
"Allianz also models the 
volatility adjustment dynamically within our approved internal model, 
which differs from the static EIOPA VA concept applied in the standard 
formula."
"For risk capital calculations, we assume a dynamic movement 
of the volatility adjustment broadly consistent with the way the VA 
would react in practice; however, we base the movement on our own 
portfolio rather than the EIOPA portfolio."
"To account for this deviation, 
Allianz applies a more conservative, reduced application ratio for the 
dynamic volatility adjustment."
"Validation is performed regularly to 
verify the appropriateness and prudency of the approach."
"Valuation assumptions: replicating portfolios 
We replicate the liabilities of our Life/Health insurance business."
"This 
technique enables us to represent all product-related options and 
guarantees, both contractual and discretionary, by means of standard 
financial instruments."
"In the risk calculation, we use the replicating 
portfolio − together with a Least Square Monte Carlo approach for 
risks that are not covered by the replication − to determine and revalue 
these liabilities under all potentially adverse Monte Carlo scenarios."
"Diversification and correlation assumptions 
As Allianz is an integrated financial services provider offering a variety 
of products across different business segments and geographic 
regions, diversification is key to our business model."
"Diversification typically occurs when looking at combined risks 
that are not, or only partly, interdependent."
"Important diversification 
factors include regions (e.g., windstorm in Australia vs."
"windstorm in 
Germany), risk categories (e.g., market risk vs."
"underwriting risk), and 
subcategories within the same risk category (e.g., commercial vs."
personal lines of property and casualty risk).
"Ultimately, diversification 
is driven by the specific features of the investment or (re)insurance 
products in question and their respective risk exposures."
"For example, 
an operational risk event in Australia can be considered to be highly 
independent of a change in credit spreads for a French government 
bond held as investment."
"The internal model considers concentration, accumulation, and 
correlation effects when aggregating results at the Group level, 
Allianz SE level, or at the level of other Group companies."
"The resulting 
diversification reflects the fact that all potential worst-case losses are 
not likely to materialize at the same time."
"Where possible, we derive correlation parameters for each pair of 
market risks through statistical analysis of historical data, considering 
observations over more than a decade."
"In cases where historical data 
or other portfolio-specific observations are insufficient or unavailable, 
correlations are set by the Correlation Settings Committee, which 
combines the expertise of risk and business experts in a well-defined 
and controlled process."
"In general, when using expert judgment, we 
set the correlation parameters to represent the joint movement of risks 
under adverse conditions."
"Based on these correlations, we use an 
industry-standard approach, the Gaussian copula, to determine the 
dependency structure of quantifiable sources of risk within the applied 
Monte Carlo simulation."
"Actuarial assumptions 
Our internal model also includes assumptions on claims trends, liability 
inflation, mortality, longevity, morbidity, policyholder behavior, 
expenses, etc."
"We use our own internal historical data for actuarial 
assumptions 
wherever 
possible, 
additionally 
considering 
recommendations from the insurance industry, supervisory authorities, 
and actuarial associations."
"The derivation of our actuarial 
assumptions is based on generally accepted actuarial methods."
"Our 
internal risk capital and financial reporting framework incorporates 
comprehensive processes and controls to ensure the reliability of these 
assumptions."
"As the internal model is based on a 99.5 % confidence level, there is a 
low statistical probability of 0.5 % that actual losses could exceed this 
threshold in the course of one year."
"We use model and scenario parameters derived from historical 
data, where available, to characterize future possible risk events."
"If 
future market conditions were to differ substantially from the past, for 
example, in an unprecedented crisis or as a possible result of severe 
structural breaks resulting from climate change, our VaR approach 
might be too conservative or too liberal in ways that are difficult to 
predict."
"In order to mitigate reliance on historical data, we 
complement our VaR analysis with stress testing."
"Furthermore, we validate the model and parameters through 
sensitivity analyses, independent internal peer reviews, and, where 
appropriate, independent external reviews, focusing on methods for 
selecting parameters and control processes."
"To ensure that the model 
is validated adequately, we have established an Independent 
Validation Unit (IVU) within Group Risk, responsible for validating our 
internal model within a comprehensive model validation process."
"Any 
limitations identified during the validation process are remedied after 
consultation with the Group regulator."
"Overall, we believe that our 
validation efforts are effective and that the model adequately 
assesses the risks to which we are exposed."
"The construction and application of the replicating portfolios 
mentioned are subject to the set of replicating instruments that are 
available and might be too simple or restrictive to capture all factors 
affecting the change in value of liabilities."
"As with other model 
components, the replication framework is subject to independent

141 
validation and to suitability assessments as well as to stringent data 
and process quality controls."
"Therefore, we believe that our liabilities 
are adequately represented by the replicating portfolios."
"Since the internal model takes into account the change in the 
economic fair value of our assets and liabilities, it is crucial to estimate 
the market value of each item accurately."
"For some assets and 
liabilities, it may be difficult, if not impossible – notably in distressed 
financial markets – to either obtain a current market price or to apply 
a meaningful mark-to-market approach."
"For such assets we apply a 
mark-to-model approach."
"For some of our liabilities, the accuracy of 
their values also depends on the quality of the actuarial cash flow 
estimates."
"Despite these limitations, we believe the estimated fair 
values are appropriately assessed."
"In 2023, our internal model was further enhanced based on regulatory 
developments, model validation results, and the feedback received in 
the course of our consultations with regulators."
"The net impact of regulatory and model changes on the 
Solvency II risk capital of the Group in 2023 was € 2.9 bn."
"The most important changes are: 
− 
Inclusion of capital requirements for certain previously not 
modeled minor non-EEA insurance entities1, including currency risk 
(impact: € 3.0 bn)."
"− 
Change in the modeling of contingent capital reinsurance at 
Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG (€ 0.2 bn)."
"− 
Dynamic inflation extrapolation, which improves the inflation 
modeling by refining both the coverage of the term structure and 
the extrapolation to the central bank’s long-term inflation target 
(€ (0.3) bn)."
"In addition, in an effort to enhance the explanatory power of the risk 
capital movement analyses, our approach for allocating the risk 
capital from Group insurance entities which are modeled based on the 
Solvency II standard formula was improved."
"In the refined approach, 
the risk contributions to single risk categories are better aligned to the 
risk profile of the standard formula entities, and the diversification as 
well as the loss absorbing capacity of deferred taxes in the standard 
formula are more appropriately reflected."
"The change in the allocation 
approach does not impact the total SCR of the Allianz Group, but it 
increases all contributions of these standard formula entities to the 
single risk categories."
"In all subsequent sections, the figures including model changes 
will form the basis for the movement analyses of our risk profile in 2023."
"As our general capital steering continues to focus on the Solvency II 
ratio impacts, excluding the application of transitional measures on 
technical provisions, the figures in the following table exclude 
transitional measures unless specifically stated."
2_Allocation of business risk from standard formula entities according to the subcategories in the internal model.
3_2022 risk profile figures adjusted based on the impact of the 2023 model changes.
4_2022 risk profile figures as reported previously.
"1_Formerly, both capital requirements and Own Funds of those minor non-EEA entities did not enter 
Solvency II capitalization figures, as Allianz made use of the book value deduction approach."
"This is partially offset by the SCR reduction due to the dynamic inflation 
extrapolation model change."
"Overall, these model change result in a € 3.2 bn higher market risk 
of the Allianz Group at € 26.0 bn (2022: € 22.8 bn)."
"Credit risk and operational risk 
The higher credit risk, and operational risk figures at Allianz Group 
level are mainly driven by the improved approach for allocating risk 
capital from major Group standard formula entities to the risk 
categories."
"The minor model changes in 2023 do not have a material impact 
on credit risk and operational risk."
"Underwriting risk and business risk  
For underwriting risk and business risk, the higher figures at 
Allianz Group level are mainly resulting from the improved approach 
for the allocation of risks from standard formula entities."
"The minor model changes in 2023 do not materially impact 
underwriting risk and business risk."
"Diversification benefits and tax relief 
The higher diversification benefits and tax relief figures are due to the 
explicit reflection of diversification benefits and the loss-absorbing 
capacity of deferred taxes from the standard formula entities."
"Capital add-on 
The reduction in the capital add-on is mainly due to a decrease in the 
replicating portfolio add-on due to the dynamic inflation 
extrapolation model change."
"Minor non-EEA insurance entities 
Due to regulatory requirements, starting from the fourth quarter 2023, 
the book value deduction approach will no longer be used for certain 
minor non-EEA insurance entities."
"Instead, a value for the contribution 
 
1_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"of solvency capital requirements from these entities to the Group is 
derived from an approach based on experience values from the 
standard formula calculations for the Allianz Group, which has been 
aligned with the regulator."
"The remaining impacts of central, minor and immaterial model 
changes are mainly driven by Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG."
"Impacts of transitional measures 
The continued application of transitional measures on technical 
provisions for Allianz Lebensversicherungs-AG and Allianz Private 
Krankenversicherungs-AG resulted in an increase in the Own Funds of 
€ 10.2 bn at the Group level."
"The 
execution of the strategic objectives may impact the potential severity 
or likelihood of these existing risks, contribute towards concentrations 
of certain types of risk, or potentially even give rise to new risks within 
a given risk category."
"However, from a broad perspective, the overall 
risk profile of Allianz has remained and is expected to remain stable."
"Please refer to section 
“Solvency II Regulatory Capitalization” for further details."
"To manage financial risk effectively and avoid accumulated losses 
in times of financial crisis, it is essential to clearly identify, measure, 
monitor, and control the risks inherent in the investment portfolios 
and in insurance products, including the development of new 
products."
"− 
Underwriting risks: Exposures to these risks are required to serve 
customers and generate shareholder value."
"Quality control 
mechanisms are applied to ensure adherence to Allianz’s 
underwriting standards and monitor the quality of the portfolio 
and underwriting process."
"The underwriting processes must 
support sustainable and profitable business, secure consistency, 
align with the risk appetite of the Group and of the operating 
entities as well as avoid undesired and/or excessive risks and 
accumulations."
"− 
Other non-financial risks: These risks are inherent to the core 
business and need to be carefully managed via continuous 
improvements in risk identification, risk assessment, and control 
environments."
"This occurs through elements of the Group Risk 
management framework such as the Top Risk Assessment (TRA), 
Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM), Reputational Risk 
Management Framework, and Liquidity Risk Management."
"Allianz faces a challenging financial market and operating 
environment."
"Markets are characterized by the risk of persistently high 
volatility."
"Interest rates have further increased, reflecting continued 
monetary policy tightening by key central banks to counter current 
inflation rates and long-term inflation expectations being above 
central banks’ long-term inflation targets."
"Lasting geopolitical and new regional political crises dominate 
the political and economic agenda."
"There is no clear resolution on the 
horizon for the lasting war in Ukraine."
"In addition, the Israel-Hamas 
war in Gaza risks escalating into a regional military conflict with the 
involvement of Iran and the U.S., encompassing new risks for energy 
prices and inflation."
"Furthermore, there is the risk of a deterioration in 
the United States-China relationship, as well as of a further hardening 
of China’s attitudes towards Taiwan."
"In addition to the geopolitical crises, there are several other 
factors that may lead to a persistent high financial market volatility."
"The risk factors also include further disruptions to global 
supply chains, which weigh on global trade, with the potential to 
prompt long-term structural shifts in these chains."
"Lasting risk factors 
include the challenges of implementing long-term structural reforms 
in key eurozone countries."
"Therefore, we continue to closely monitor political, financial and 
technological developments as well as the global trade situation to 
manage our overall risk profile to specific event risks."
"Our approved partial internal model has been applied since the 
beginning of 2016 when Solvency II came into effect."
"There is some 
uncertainty whether the provisional equivalence of the U.S."
"solvency 
regime for Solvency II purposes will be extended beyond 2025, as well 
as about future regulatory requirements resulting from the potential 
introduction of future global capital requirements and from the 
current Solvency II review."
"The Solvency II concept of “equivalence” allows third country 
solvency regimes to be recognized and used for Solvency II purposes."
"Most relevant for Allianz today, it allows the integration of Allianz Life 
Insurance Company of North America into the Group capital 
calculation based on U.S."
"The current 
provisional equivalent treatment of the U.S."
"expires at the end of 2025 
and there is some risk that the equivalence will not be extended 
beyond 2025, with a potential negative impact on the solvency ratio of 
the Allianz Group."
"The framework for potential future capital requirements for 
Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs) is yet to be finalized by 
the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) and the 
Financial Stability Board (FSB)."
"In addition, in recent years, the European Commission reviewed 
the Solvency II directive as foreseen in European legislation."
"The corresponding update of Level 2 
legislation (Solvency II regulation) as well as EIOPA guidelines will be 
performed by the European Commission and EIOPA during 2024 and 
2025 and will cover outstanding technical details as delegated by the 
directive."
"The application of the new rules will start 24 months after 
their publication in the official journal of the European Union, i.e., for 
the second quarter of 2026 at the earliest."
"Finally, the potential for a multiplicity of different regulatory 
regimes, capital standards, and reporting requirements based on a 
parallel application of a global capital framework (Insurance Capital 
Standard – ICS) as well as Solvency II could increase operational 
complexity and costs."
"The management feels comfortable with the Group’s overall risk 
profile and capitalization level."
"This confidence is based on several 
factors: 
− 
Due to its effective capital management, the Allianz Group is well 
capitalized and has met its internal, rating agency, and regulatory 
solvency targets as of 31 December 2023."
"Allianz remains one of 
the most highly rated insurance groups in the world, as reflected 
by our external ratings."
"− 
The Group has a conservative investment profile and disciplined 
business practices in the Property-Casualty, Life/Health, and Asset 
Management business segments, leading to sustainable 
operating earnings with a well-balanced risk-return profile."
"− 
Allianz is well-positioned to deal with potentially adverse future 
events such as those related to the ongoing war in Ukraine – due 
to our strong internal limit framework, stress testing, internal 
model, and risk management practices."
"− 
Furthermore, the Group has the additional advantage of being 
well-diversified, both geographically and across a broad range of 
businesses and products."
"Based on the information available to us at the moment of report 
completion, we expect to continue to be sufficiently capitalized and 
compliant with both the regulatory Solvency Capital Requirement and 
the Minimum Capital Requirement."

"In the second quarter of 2020, Allianz had been granted approval for 
the application of transitionals on technical provisions for the two 
entities 
Allianz 
Lebensversicherungs-AG 
and 
Allianz 
Private 
Krankenversicherungs-AG."
"As of 31 December 2023 and including the 
application of transitional measures on technical provisions, the Own 
Funds and SCR amounted to € 99.7 bn and € 43.5 bn, leading to a 
Solvency II ratio of 229 %."
"Our general capital steering, however, 
continues to focus on the previous approach, i.e., excluding the 
application of transitional measures on technical provisions."
"Consequently, the figures in all subsequent sections exclude 
transitional measures unless otherwise stated."
"Compared to year-end 2022, our Solvency II capitalization ratio 
increased by 5 percentage points to 206 % (2022: 201 %) since the 
increase in the Solvency II Capital Requirement was overcompensated 
by significantly higher Own Funds."
This was partially compensated by negative effects.
"The main 
impact came from (capital) management actions ((16) percentage 
points), dominated by dividend accruals and share buy backs."
"Taxes 
also contributed to the decrease of the capitalization ratio ((8) 
percentage points)."
"A small negative contribution ((1) percentage 
point) resulted from the net impact of capital market developments, 
whereby strain, especially from lower real estate valuations and 
interest rates, was largely offset by positive impacts, e.g., from stronger 
equity markets and lower inflation."
"The following table presents the sensitivities of our Solvency II 
capitalization ratio under certain standard financial market scenarios."
"2_This section contains specific risk disclosures as required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7 relating to the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The presented sensitivity analyses are based on defined variations of 
specific parameters and describe the resulting development of our 
Solvency II capitalization under such idealized scenarios (e.g., 
decrease in interest rates by 50 basis points)."
"The observed 
developments will, however, typically materialize in a more complex 
way (e.g., interest rates are typically not decreasing in a parallel shift 
manner along the term structure)."
"Therefore, sensitivities are to be 
interpreted in a way such that they provide valuable information on 
areas to which our capitalization is particularly sensitive together with 
an indication of the estimated magnitude."
"The actual observed 
developments in the capitalization can, however, be more or less 
pronounced depending on the specific realized circumstances."
"Our 
comprehensive stress testing framework is regularly analyzed in order 
to identify potential enhancements to support the explanatory power 
of stress tests conducted in light of our risk profile."
"The Allianz Group is a financial conglomerate within the scope of 
the Financial Conglomerate Directive (FCD)."
"The FCD does not impose 
a materially different capital requirement on the Allianz Group 
compared to Solvency II."
"Quantifiable risks and opportunities by 
risk category2 
This Risk and Opportunity Report outlines the Group’s risk figures, 
reflecting its risk profile based on pre-diversified risk figures and Group 
diversification effects."
"We measure and steer risk based on an approved internal model 
which quantifies the potential adverse developments of Own Funds."
"The results provide an overview of how our risk profile is distributed 
over different risk categories and determine the regulatory capital 
requirements in accordance with Solvency II."
"The pre-diversified risk figures reflect the diversification effect 
within each modeled risk category (i.e., market, credit, underwriting, 
business, and operational risk), but do not include the diversification 
effects across risk categories."
"Group diversified risk figures also capture 
the diversification effect across all risk categories."
"As of 31 December 2023, the Group-diversified risk capital, which 
reflects our risk profile before considering non-controlling interests, 
amounted to € 43.5 bn (2022: € 41.6 bn)."
"The € 1.8 bn increase in the Solvency II Capital Requirement was 
driven by the positive business evolution in the Property-Casualty 
business segment."
"This was partially compensated by risk capital relief 
from effects such as model and assumptions updates at Allianz 
Lebensversicherungs-AG and various other companies of the Group."
"The following sections explain the evolution of our risk profile per 
modeled risk category."
"All risks are presented on a pre-diversified basis 
and concentrations of single sources of risk are discussed accordingly."
"The following table presents our group-wide risk figures related to 
market risks by business segment and source of risk."
"In 2023, the Allianz Group’s total pre-diversified market risk barely 
changed, as a strong increase in equity risk was offset by a decrease in 
interest rate risk and a higher risk relief from inflation risk."
"The rise in the contribution of equity risk to market risk, especially 
in the Life/Health business segment, primarily resulted from stronger 
equity markets, together with a higher exposure to alternative equity 
investments and diversification effects within market risk."
"A decrease 
in interest rates, together with a lower duration gap, caused a shift in 
the contribution of interest rate risk and inflation risk to market risk."
"However, these impacts would have been partially offset by 
policyholder participation."
"In addition, the Solvency II Own Funds 
effect is much more limited due to our active duration management, 
reducing the duration mismatch of the Group to 0.2 years (from 0.6 
years in 2022), representing Solvency II liabilities of shorter duration 
than assets."
"The impact of a 0.5 % increase in interest rates on the Solvency II 
ratio is shown in the table “Solvency II regulatory capitalization ratio 
sensitivities” in the section “Solvency II regulatory capitalization”."
"Equity risk 
As of 31 December 2023, our investments excluding unit-linked 
business that are sensitive to changing equity markets – amounting to 
a market value of € 77.4 bn3 (2022: € 73.6 bn) – would have lost 
€ 19.7 bn4 (2022: € 18.4 bn) in value assuming equity markets had 
declined by 30 %."
"However, this impact would have been partially 
offset by policyholder participation."
"1_The stated market value includes all assets from internal model entities whose market value is sensitive 
to interest rate movements (excluding unit-linked business) reflecting the Solvency II framework, and 
therefore is not based on classifications given by accounting principles."
2_The effects do not consider policyholder participation.
"The following table presents our group-wide risk figures for credit risks 
by business segment."
"Throughout 2023, the Allianz credit portfolio was not affected by 
significant movements or events with respect to credit migration risk 
and default risk."
"Ultimately, the overall credit risk for the Allianz Group increased 
by € 0.2 bn to € 4.7 bn (2022: € 4.5 bn)."
4_The effect does not consider policyholder participation.
"amounted to € 1,185.7 bn (2022: € 1,102.0 bn), and the maximum 
exposure to credit risk from reinsurance amounted to € 28.1 bn (2022: 
€ 28.8 bn)."
"Credit risk – investments  
As of 31 December 2023, the credit risk arising from our investment 
portfolio accounted for 64.8 % (2022: 64.2 %) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk6."
"Credit risk in the Life/Health business segment is primarily driven 
by long-term assets covering long-term policyholder liabilities."
"Typical 
investments are government bonds, senior corporate bonds, covered 
bonds, self-originated mortgages and loans, and a modest number of 
derivatives."
"In the Property-Casualty business segment, fixed-income 
securities tend to be short- to mid-term, due to the nature of the 
business, and are not subject to policyholder participation."
"In addition, Allianz closely monitors 
counterparties’ credit ratings and exposure movements."
"As of 31 December 2023, the rating distribution of our fixed-
income portfolio based on issue (instrument) ratings was as follows: 
 
5_The stated investment exposure figures reflect gross carrying amounts."
"They are based on IFRS 
requirements and include investments that are not within the scope of the Solvency II framework."
"6_Additionally, 10.8 % (2022: 11.7 %) of our total Group pre-diversified internal credit risk is allocated to 
receivables, potential future exposure for derivatives and reinsurance, and other off-balance sheet 
exposures."
Table excludes private loans.
Stated book values include investments not in scope of the Solvency II framework.
Figures for both years are based on IFRS 9.
"Credit risk – credit insurance 
As of 31 December 2023, 20.7 % (2022: 19.6 %) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to Allianz Trade credit 
insurance exposures."
"Credit risk – reinsurance 
As of 31 December 2023, 3.8 % (2022: 4.5 %) of our total Group pre-
diversified internal credit risk was allocated to reinsurance exposures."
"For substantial single-name 
reinsurance exposures or exposures to non-rated captives, risk-
mitigating techniques such as collateral agreements or funds-withheld 
concepts are in place."
"The following table presents the pre-diversified risk calculated for 
underwriting risks associated with our insurance business."
2_2022 risk profile figures adjusted based on the impact of the 2023 model changes.
"During 2023, the total Group pre-diversified underwriting risk capital 
increased by € 1.9 bn."
"Property-Casualty 
The increase in Property-Casualty underwriting risk was mainly driven 
by exposure increases affecting all sources of risk."
"The increase in 
premium natural catastrophe risk was mainly impacted by a change in 
Group reinsurance structure."
"2_Represents claims and insurance benefits incurred (net), divided by premiums earned (net)."
"The top five perils contributing to the natural catastrophe risk as of 
31 December 2023 were: windstorms in Europe, tropical cyclones in the 
USA, floods in Germany, earthquake in Australia, and hail in Germany."
"Life/Health 
The underwriting risk capital contribution of biometric risk increased by 
€ 0.6 bn compared to the previous year."
"This is mainly due to changes 
in the interest rates environment."
"Materially lower EUR interest rates in 
particular led to a significant increase in longevity risk."
"In addition, local 
model calibration updates had an upward impact on mortality risk."
"Contributions from the Property-Casualty and the Corporate and 
Other business segments are generated by the longevity risk of the 
internal pension schemes they contain."
"Due to effective product design and the diversity of our products, 
there were no significant concentrations of underwriting risks within 
our Life/Health business segment."
Business risk capital increased by 0.4 bn to € 6.5 bn (2022: € 6.1 bn).
"The main reason is the impact of the significantly lower EUR interest 
rates on the cost risk."
"Overall, the operational risk capital showed a slightly increased risk 
profile after the regular annual update of central and local 
parameters (increase by 0.4 bn from € 3.9 bn in 2022 to € 4.3 bn in 
2023), mainly due to regulations and increasing cyber threats in some 
local markets."
"Detailed information regarding our liquidity risk exposure, liquidity, 
and funding – including changes in cash and cash equivalents – is 
provided in Liquidity and Funding Resources and in notes 7.3.1, 7.3.2 
and 7.5 to the consolidated financial statements."
"As can be inferred 
from the section on the management of liquidity risks, while these are 
quantified and monitored through regular stress test reporting as well 
as properly managed, they are not quantified for risk capital purposes."
"After the release of the Annual Report 2022, 
the Allianz Group continued with the preparation of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet and made some non-material adjustments."
"As such, the final version of the IFRS 9/17 opening balance sheet for 2022 is slightly different from the preliminary version in the Annual Report 2022."

These changes have also been reflected in comparative periods.
"Allianz SE is recorded in the Commercial Register of the municipal 
court in Munich under the number HRB 164232."
"They have been prepared in conformity with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted under European 
Union (E.U.) regulations in accordance with § 315e (1) of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB)."
"Within these consolidated financial 
statements, the Allianz Group has applied all standards and 
interpretations issued by the IASB and endorsed by the E.U."
"that are 
compulsory as of 31 December 2023."
"In these consolidated financial statements, the Allianz Group has 
applied IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 for the first time."
"The related changes in 
significant accounting policies are described in note 2."
"The consolidated financial statements have been prepared as of 
and for the year ended 31 December 2023."
"The Allianz Group’s 
presentation currency is the euro (€)."
"Amounts are rounded to the 
nearest million (€ mn) unless otherwise stated."
"The consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue 
by the Board of Management on 22 February 2024."
"The Allianz Group offers property-casualty insurance, life/health 
insurance, and asset management products and services in almost 70 
countries."
"2 _ Accounting policies, significant 
estimates, and new accounting 
pronouncements 
The following paragraphs describe important accounting policies and 
significant estimates and assumptions relevant for the Allianz Group’s 
consolidated financial statements."
"Estimates and assumptions 
particularly influence the inclusion method as well as the accounting 
treatment of financial instruments and insurance contracts, goodwill, 
litigation provisions, pension liabilities and similar obligations, and 
deferred taxes."
"Significant estimates and assumptions are explained 
in the respective paragraphs."
"Reporting and presentation principles  
The Allianz Group’s consolidated balance sheet is not presented using 
a current/non-current classification."
"The following balances are 
generally considered to be current: cash and cash equivalents, non-
current assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, 
and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale."
"The 
following balances are generally considered to be non-current: 
investments, deferred tax assets, intangible assets, and deferred tax 
liabilities."
"Insurance contracts are split by contracts issued (insurance) and 
held (reinsurance)."
"Insurance contract portfolios in asset and liability 
position are further presented separately on the balance sheet."
"IFRS 17 is conceptually based on a prospective cash view, therefore all 
payables and receivables from insurance contracts as well as any 
deposits are part of the (re)insurance contract assets or liabilities."
"The Allianz Group has made an accounting policy choice to apply 
the year-to-date approach for the accounting for insurance contracts."
"Therefore, the treatment of accounting estimates made in previous 
interim financial statements may change under IFRS 17 in subsequent 
interim financial statements and in the annual reporting period."
"Principles of consolidation 
Scope of consolidation and consolidation procedures 
In accordance with IFRS 10, the Allianz Group’s consolidated financial 
statements include the financial statements of Allianz SE and its 
subsidiaries."
"Subsidiaries are generally entities where Allianz SE, 
directly or indirectly, owns more than half of the voting rights or similar 
rights with the ability to affect the returns of these entities for its own 
benefit."
"Initial accounting for business combinations and measurement 
of non-controlling interests 
Where newly acquired subsidiaries are subject to business 
combination accounting, the provisions of IFRS 3 are applied."
"During 
the IFRS 3 measurement period, which is for a maximum of one year 
post the acquisition date, it may be necessary to adjust existing or 
recognize additional assets and liabilities if new information is 
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date."
"Associates and joint arrangements  
Associates are entities over which the Allianz Group can exercise 
significant influence."
"In general, if the Allianz Group holds 20 % or more 
of the voting power in an investee but does not control the investee, it 
is assumed to have significant influence."
"Although the Allianz Group’s share in some entities is below 20 %, 
the Allianz Group has significant influence over these entities if it is 
sufficiently represented in the governing bodies that decide on the 
relevant activities of these entities."
"For certain third party managed investment funds in which the 
Allianz Group holds a stake of above 20 %, the Allianz Group has no 
significant influence if it is not represented in the governing bodies of 
these investment funds or their investment activities are largely 
predetermined."
"Pursuant to IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements have to be 
classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, depending on the 
contractual rights and obligations of each investor."
"The Allianz Group 
has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined 
them to be joint ventures in most cases."
"Generally, investments in associates and joint ventures are 
accounted for using the equity method, which may imply a time lag of 
up to three months."
"Income from investments in associates and joint 
arrangements – excluding distributions – is included in the interest 
result."
"Accounting policies of associates and joint arrangements are 
generally adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the 
accounting policies adopted by the Allianz Group."
"For the 
purposes of this election, insurance contracts include investment 
contracts with discretionary participation features."
"For further information, please refer to note 7.2."
"Foreign currency translation 
Foreign currency translation follows the guidance set forth in IAS 21."
"Foreign currency gains and losses arising from foreign currency 
transactions are reported in the valuation result in the consolidated 
income statement, unless they relate to the foreign exchange 
component of fair value changes that are recognized in other 
comprehensive income."
"In the latter case, the foreign exchange 
component is also recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Financial instruments 
Recognition and derecognition 
Financial assets are generally recognized and derecognized on the 
trade date, i.e., when the Allianz Group commits to purchase or sell 
securities."
"At the Allianz Group, financial assets that are backing insurance 
liabilities are generally considered to be held in a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows 
and selling financial assets (“hold and sell” business model)."
"In accordance with IFRS 9, investments in equity financial 
instruments are measured at fair value."
"Measurement at fair value through profit or loss is only applied in 
exceptional cases, e.g., to reduce an accounting mismatch that would 
otherwise arise or if the above-mentioned preconditions for fair value 
through other comprehensive income measurement are not fulfilled."
"− 
Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset 
does not qualify for derecognition or when the continuing 
involvement approach applies."
"These liabilities are measured in 
accordance with paragraphs 3.2.15 and 3.2.17 of IFRS 9."
"− 
Financial guarantee contracts."
"− 
Contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business 
combination 
to 
which 
IFRS 3 
applies; 
such 
contingent 
consideration shall subsequently be measured at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"D _ Consolidated Financial Statements 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
157 
 
Measurement at fair value 
The Allianz Group carries certain financial instruments at fair value 
and discloses the fair value of all financial instruments."
"Assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value in the 
consolidated financial statements are measured and classified in 
accordance with the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13, which categorizes 
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three 
levels."
"Level 1 inputs of financial instruments traded in active markets are 
based on unadjusted quoted market prices or dealer price quotations 
for identical assets or liabilities on the last exchange trading day prior 
to or at the reporting date, if the latter is a trading day."
"Level 2 applies if the market for a financial instrument is not active 
or when the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques 
based on observable input parameters."
"Level 3 applies if not all input parameters that are significant to 
the entire measurement are observable in the market."
"Accordingly, the 
fair value is based on valuation techniques using non-market 
observable inputs."
"Valuation techniques include the discounted cash 
flow method, comparison to similar instruments for which observable 
market prices exist, and other valuation models."
"Appropriate 
adjustments are made, for example, for credit risks."
"− 
Cost approach: Amount that would currently be required to 
replace the service capacity of an asset (current replacement cost)."
"− 
Income approach: Conversion of future amounts such as cash 
flows or income to a single current amount (present value 
technique)."
"There is no one-to-one connection between valuation technique and 
hierarchy level."
"Depending on whether valuation techniques are 
based on significant observable or unobservable inputs, financial 
instruments are classified in the fair value hierarchy."
"Estimates and assumptions of fair values and hierarchies are 
particularly significant when determining the fair value of financial 
instruments for which at least one significant input is not based on 
observable market data (classified as level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy)."
"The availability of market information is determined by the 
relative trading levels of identical or similar instruments in the market, 
with emphasis placed on information that represents actual market 
activity or binding quotations from brokers or dealers."
"The degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of 
financial instruments closely correlates with the use of non-market 
observable inputs."
"The Allianz Group uses a maximum of observable 
inputs and a minimum of non-market observable inputs when 
measuring fair value."
"Observability of input parameters is influenced 
by various factors such as type of the financial instrument, whether a 
market is established for the particular instrument, specific transaction 
characteristics, liquidity, and general market conditions."
"If the fair 
value cannot be measured reliably, amortized cost is used as a proxy 
for determining fair values."
"In discharging its responsibilities in the area of the fair value 
measurement of illiquid investments (level 3), the Allianz Group has set 
up an independent Group Valuation Committee (GVC)."
"The GVC is a 
cross-functional body which includes representation from the Allianz 
Group’s accounting and reporting, risk, and, investment management 
functions as well as major operating entities."
"The GVC’s objectives are 
the establishment and maintenance of appropriate market valuation 
standards as well as checks and balances in order to successfully 
manage the risks inherent in the internal and external fair valuation of 
illiquid investments."
"In this regard, the GVC initiates, approves, and 
maintains documented valuation best practices by illiquid asset 
cluster."
"Furthermore, the GVC is responsible for performing regular 
independent price verifications, onsite visits of operating entities, and 
for requiring the implementation of best practices in the area of the 
illiquid assets valuation."
"It also has prerogatives to implement 
measures to resolve any related findings and valuation disputes."
"For further information with regards to the measurement at fair 
value, please refer to note 7.5."
"Impairments 
The Allianz Group’s central risk framework under Solvency II serves as 
the basis for IFRS 9 impairment calculations."
"In regard of credit ratings 
which represent a central parameter of credit risk, the Allianz Group re-
uses the Solvency II assessment of the long-term creditworthiness of its 
debtors."
"In detail, the Solvency II rating assignment for the investment 
portfolio of the Allianz Group is based on external agency ratings 
enhanced by the Group’s internal credit assessment."
"The internal credit 
assessment is used to add a point-in-time component to long-term 
ratings in order to capture current market information and to add 
forward-looking information."
"The Allianz Group uses hurdle ratings 
that indicate a significant increase in credit risk and consequently a 
transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 on a notch-by-notch basis."
"In addition, 
the rating hurdle is dependent on the expected maturity of the 
investment."
"A transfer to Stage 3 is triggered by a D rating or when one 
or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future 
cash flows of that financial asset have occurred."
"The loss-given default 
assignment is performed based on the established methods applied 
for Solvency II purposes."
"The Allianz Group follows a cash-flow-based 
approach for the expected credit loss (ECL) calculation."
"Modifications of financial assets 
In some circumstances, the renegotiation or modification of the 
contractual cash flows of a financial asset can lead to the 
derecognition of the existing financial asset in accordance with IFRS 9."
"The Allianz Group accounting policies prescribe that a substantial 
modification of the terms of an existing financial asset shall lead to the 
derecognition of the original financial asset and the recognition of a 
new financial asset."
"The determination whether the contractual terms 
have been modified substantially is based on a qualitative and/or 
quantitative assessment."
"The quantitative assessment is required in case the qualitative 
assessment is not sufficient to establish that the terms of the modified 
financial asset are substantially different from those of the original 
financial asset."
"For the quantitative assessment, the Allianz Group 
applies the criteria for the extinguishment of financial liabilities 
analogically."
"Derivative 
financial 
instruments 
designated 
as 
hedging 
instruments in hedge accounting relationships are included in the line 
items investments measured at fair value through profit or loss and 
financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss."
Freestanding derivatives are included in the same line items.
"For further information on derivatives, please refer to note 7.4."
"Insurance contracts 
Insurance and investment contracts 
Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary 
participation features are accounted for under the insurance 
accounting provisions of IFRS 17."
"Investment contracts without 
discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial 
instruments in accordance with IFRS 9, please see section “Investment 
contracts liabilities”."
"Insurance contracts are classified as direct participating contracts or 
contracts without direct participation features."
"The classification of 
insurance contracts forms the basis for the measurement model 
applied (see section “Measurement”)."
"As IFRS 17 does not provide any threshold for determining whether a 
share or proportion is substantial, this assessment requires judgment."
"Allianz has set up a group-wide process for assessing insurance 
contracts based on qualitative and quantitative criteria in order to 
appropriately reflect the individual contract specifics."
"For this 
assessment, the terms “substantial share“ and “substantial proportion” 
have been applied by using 50 % as rebuttable presumption."
"Separation of components 
IFRS 17 requires the separation of embedded derivatives, investment 
components, and performance obligations to provide non-insurance 
goods and services at inception of a contract, if certain conditions are 
met."
"The separated components need to be accounted for separately 
according to IFRS 9 (embedded derivatives, investment components) 
or IFRS 15 (non-insurance goods and services)."
"The Allianz Group has 
not identified material performance obligations embedded in 
insurance contracts to provide non-insurance goods and services."
"The Allianz Group applies IFRS 9 to determine whether there is an 
embedded derivative to be separated and, if so, how to account for 
that derivative, unless the derivative is itself a contract within the scope 
of IFRS 17."
"IFRS 17 defines investment components as the amounts that an 
insurance contract requires the entity to repay to a policyholder in all 
circumstances, regardless of whether an insured event occurs."
"The 
Allianz Group identifies the investment component of a contract by 
determining the amount that it would be required to repay to the 
policyholder in all scenarios with commercial substance."
"These include 
circumstances in which an insured event occurs or the contract matures 
or is terminated without an insured event occurring."
"An investment component is classified as being distinct or non-
distinct."
"The Allianz Group has not identified material distinct 
investment components."
"Investment components that are non-distinct are not to be 
separated from the host insurance contract but are excluded from 
insurance revenue and insurance service expenses."
"For most common 
life insurance products, the Allianz Group defines the cash surrender 
value as the non-distinct investment component."
"Generally, property-
casualty contracts do not have a surrender or maturity value and only 
have a benefit payment when a claim occurs."
"Therefore, a standard 
property-casualty contract without additional guaranteed payment 
features does not include any investment component."
"However, it is 
common with property-casualty contracts to have other explicit 
guaranteed payments, for example a low or no claim bonus or profit 
participation, which the Allianz Group defines as non-distinct 
investment components, if all respective criteria are met."
"Level of aggregation 
Measurement is not carried out at the level of individual contracts, but 
based on groups of contracts."
"To allocate individual insurance 
contracts to groups of contracts, the Allianz Group first defines 
portfolios which include contracts with similar risks that are managed 
together."
"These portfolios are subdivided into groups of contracts on 
the basis of profitability and annual cohorts."
"Both portfolios and 
groups of insurance contracts are always determined by the individual 
operating entities, considering their respective circumstances."
"The 
requirement to form annual cohorts that prevents contracts issued 
more than one year apart from being included in the same group 
(IFRS 17.22) is subject to an optional exemption in the E.U."
"users the 
right to choose whether or not to apply the requirement in IFRS 17.22 
for certain contracts."
"The Allianz Group does not make use of this 
exemption."
"Contracts in different currencies can fulfill the standard 
requirements of similar risks that are managed together."
"At the 
Allianz Group, there is one calculation currency per group of contract 
(GoC)."
"In case of a GoC with contracts with different transaction 
currencies, a leading currency (GoC currency) is determined."
"Measurement 
IFRS 17 includes three measurement models."
"The Allianz Group generally applies the same accounting policies to 
reinsurance contracts held as to insurance contracts issued."
"The effect of the non-performance risk 
of the reinsurer is assessed at each reporting date and the effect of 
changes in the non-performance risk is recognized in profit or loss."
"Liability for remaining coverage under the GMM/VFA 
The liability for remaining coverage (LRC) under the GMM consists of 
the fulfillment cash flows related to future services and the contractual 
service margin (CSM)."
"The fulfillment cash flows represent the risk-
adjusted present value of Allianz’s rights and obligations to the 
policyholders, comprising the building blocks of estimates of expected 
future cash flows, discounting, and an explicit risk adjustment for non-
financial risk."
"The CSM represents the unearned profit from in-force 
contracts that an entity will recognize as it provides services over the 
coverage period."
"Each building block is measured separately, both on 
initial recognition and for subsequent measurement."
"The estimates of future cash flows comprise all cash flows expected to 
arise as the insurance contract is fulfilled."
"In estimating these future 
cash flows, the Allianz Group incorporates, in an unbiased way, all 
reasonable and supportable information that is available without 
undue cost or effort at the reporting date."
"Cash flows within the 
boundary of a contract relate directly to the fulfillment of the contract, 
including those for which the Allianz Group has discretion over the 
amount or timing."
"These include premiums from policyholders, 
payments to (or on behalf of) policyholders, insurance acquisition cash 
flows, and other costs incurred in fulfilling the contracts."
"Insurance acquisition cash flows arise from the activities of selling, 
underwriting and starting a group of contracts that are directly 
attributable to the portfolio of contracts to which the group belongs."
"According to IFRS 17, all future cash flows must be discounted."
"The 
IFRS 17 requirements for the interest curves used in the discounting are 
principle-based."
"An entity should use observable market data based 
on a risk-free base curve and portfolio-specific adjustments to reflect 
the illiquidity of insurance obligations in determining the interest 
curves."
"The Allianz Group applies a bottom-up approach in which the 
basic risk-free liquid yield curves are usually derived from swap rates 
or government yields for the specific currency and adjusted for 
remaining credit risk."
"These risk-free liquid yield curves are then 
adjusted to reflect illiquidity of the underlying insurance liabilities 
based on reference portfolios."
"In case of participating business, the 
reference portfolio reflects own assets and it is a currency-specific 
portfolio for non-participating business."
The impact of this change on the disclosed range is +67 bps on the lower bound and +45 bps on the upper bound.
"The risk adjustment reflects the compensation an entity would require 
for bearing non-financial risks, i.e., the uncertainty of cash flows that 
arise from insurance contracts, other than the uncertainty arising from 
financial risks."
"Such non-financial risks include insurance risks, lapse 
and expense risk."
"IFRS 17 does not prescribe a specific approach for 
determining the risk adjustment."
"Allianz applies a Cost of Capital 
approach with a Cost of Capital rate of currently 6 % as under 
Solvency II."
"The main differences in disclosure are that IFRS 17 requires 
a separate presentation of the risk adjustment for non-financial risk for 
gross and ceded business, and a split for LRC and LIC."
"The risk adjustment for LRC for life/health corresponds to a 
confidence level of 72 % to 77 % and is calculated based on distribution 
assumptions consistent to Solvency II (where applicable)."
"For 
life/health, an ultimate distribution is estimated based on the 
Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital methodology for 
calculation of the risk adjustment for the LRC, projected to ultimate 
horizon per entity and aggregated to diversified group level."
"The 
confidence level is derived as the quantile of the Group net of 
reinsurance risk adjustment in the ultimate distribution of the Group."
"If the fulfillment cash flows lead to a 
negative CSM at inception, it will be set to zero and the negative 
amount will be recorded immediately in the statement of profit or loss."
"At subsequent measurement, the CSM gets adjusted for changes in 
cash flows related to future services and for the interest accretion at 
interest rates locked-in at initial recognition of the group of contracts."
"A release from the CSM is recognized in profit or loss each period to 
reflect the services provided in that period based on “coverage units”."
"IFRS 17 only provides principle-based guidance on how to determine 
these coverage units."
"Generally, the Allianz Group has defined the 
account value for the reflection of investment services and the sum at 
risk for insurance services as the default approach to determine these 
coverage units."
"If multiple services are provided in one contract, a 
weighting is applied, which is determined by the respective 
operational entity based on the respective features of the contract."
"The VFA is a mandatory modification of the GMM regarding the 
treatment of the CSM to accommodate direct participating contracts."
"The assessment of whether an insurance contract meets the VFA 
eligibility criteria is made at the contract’s inception and not revised 
later, except in case of a substantial modification of the contract."
"For 
contracts with direct participation features, the CSM is adjusted for 
changes in the amount of the entity’s share of the fair value of the 
underlying items."
"No explicit interest accretion is required since the 
CSM is effectively remeasured when it is adjusted for changes in 
financial risks."
"An additional CSM release is considered to avoid a delayed profit 
recognition by systematic real-world returns of direct participating 
business measured with the VFA."
"This adjustment reflects the expected 
real-world returns in relation to the risk-neutral returns applied in 
IFRS 17 measurement for a more appropriate allocation of the 
services provided in the current period, i.e., the relating income in the 
P&L is based on real-world assumptions."
"The adjustment is applied by 
the life/health entities in Germany, France, Italy, and Switzerland."
"Expected real-world returns are updated once a year based on a 
fundamental analysis of long-term expectations."
"If certain criteria are met, an entity may apply the so-called risk 
mitigation option when it uses a derivative, a non-derivative financial 
instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss, or a 
reinsurance contract held to mitigate financial risk."
"The 
 
D _ Consolidated Financial Statements 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
161 
 
Allianz Group applies the risk mitigation option only for a limited 
number of portfolios in the Life/Health segment."
"The PAA eligibility per group of contract is regularly 
assessed."
"This assessment takes into account qualitative and 
quantitative factors which are determined at the Group level."
"The 
qualitative factors include but are not limited to the volatility of 
financial variables, related embedded derivatives, and the average 
length of the coverage period."
"For the quantitative test, the 
Allianz Group provides detailed scenarios including interest rate 
shocks per selected currency."
"Overall, the PAA is applied for the vast 
majority of the Allianz Group’s property-casualty business (gross and 
ceded)."
"Subsequently, the loss component is 
remeasured at each reporting date as the difference between the 
amounts of the fulfillment cash flows determined under the GMM 
relating to the future service and the carrying amount of the LRC 
without the loss component."
"Insurance acquisition cash flow asset 
At the Allianz Group, insurance acquisition cash flows are not 
expensed as incurred, but deferred over the coverage period for all 
measurement models."
"IFRS 17 foresees two levels of deferral (pre-
coverage DAC and in-coverage DAC, DAC = deferred acquisition 
costs)."
"Regarding the pre-
coverage DAC, a four-step approach applies to ensure standard 
compliant measurement: 
1."
"Identify and allocate insurance acquisition cash flows that relate 
to expected contract renewals and recognize those insurance 
acquisition cash flows as an asset (pre-coverage DAC)."
"As soon as the expected contract renewals turn into insurance 
contracts, the pre-coverage DAC has to be transferred into in-
coverage DAC and included in the contractual cash flows."
"Regular assumption review of pre-coverage DAC per reporting 
period."
"Perform an assessment regarding the recoverability of the pre-
coverage DAC, if facts and circumstances indicate potential 
impairment."
"Liability for incurred claims (LIC) 
The LIC is measured at the fulfillment cash flows relating to incurred 
claims."
"It comprises the fulfillment cash flows related to past service at 
the reporting date."
"It is calculated at a level of aggregation, which is 
determined at the local level based on relevant factors, e.g., line of 
business, region, or distribution channel."
"The LIC consists of the present 
value of future cash flows relating to incurred claims and the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk, applying the same principles for the 
estimates of future cash flows, the discount rate and the risk 
adjustment for non-financial risk that apply to the LRC."
"For the insurance contracts measured under the PAA, the 
Allianz Group decided to discount the future cash flows relating to 
incurred claims, even if those cash flows are expected to be paid or 
received in one year or less from the date the claims are incurred."
"For property-casualty, this is based on the ultimate distribution 
underlying the Solvency II one-year-view used in the Cost of Capital 
methodology for the calculation of the risk adjustment for the LIC, 
aggregated and diversified at Group level."
"The confidence level is 
derived as the quantile of the Group net of reinsurance risk adjustment 
in the ultimate distribution of the Group."
"Reserving process  
In the following, the term reserves is meant to include the present value 
of future cash flows, the risk adjustment and the CSM."
"For the business segments Life/Health and Property-Casualty, the 
central oversight process around reserve estimates includes the setting 
of group-wide standards and guidelines, regular site visits, as well as 
regular quantitative and qualitative reserve monitoring."
"The oversight and monitoring of the Allianz Group’s reserves 
culminate in quarterly meetings of the Allianz Group Reserve 
Committee, which is the supervising body that governs all significant 
reserves."
"It particularly monitors key developments across the 
Allianz Group affecting the level of the best estimate reserves."
"These assumptions also have an impact on the presentation of costs 
arising from the origination of insurance business (acquisition cash 
flows)."
"To ensure consistency in the application of actuarial methods 
and assumptions in the Life/Health reserving process, the 
Allianz Group has designed a two-stage reserving process: 
Stage one: Life/Health reserves are calculated by qualified local 
staff experienced in the subsidiaries’ business."
"The process follows 
group-wide standards for applying consistent and reasonable 
assumptions."
"The appropriateness of the best-estimate reserves and 
their compliance with group-wide standards is confirmed by the local 
chief actuary and local reserve committee."
"Any adjustments to the 
reserves and other insurance-related reporting items are reported to 
and analyzed together with the Allianz Group Reserve Committee."
"Property-Casualty reserves are set by leveraging the use of 
actuarial techniques and educated judgment."
"These include the best 
estimate of the cash flows (e.g., claims, premiums, and expenses) and 
the discounting of the claims."
"A two-stage process exists for the setting 
of the P&C reserves in the Allianz Group: 
 
D _ Consolidated Financial Statements 
Annual Report 2023 − Allianz Group  
162 
 
Stage one: Property-Casualty reserves are calculated by local 
reserving actuaries at the Allianz subsidiaries."
"The reserves are set at a 
best-estimate level based on a thorough analysis of historical data, 
enhanced by interactions with other business functions (e.g., 
Underwriting, Claims and Reinsurance)."
"Actuarial judgment is applied 
where necessary, especially in cases where data is unreliable, scanty, 
or unavailable."
"The judgment of Property-Casualty actuaries is based 
on past experience of the characteristics of each line of business, the 
current stage of the underwriting cycle, and the external environment 
in which the subsidiary operates."
"The reserves are proposed to a local 
reserve committee, where the rationale of the selections is discussed 
and subsequently documented."
"The appropriateness of the best-
estimate reserves and their compliance with group-wide standards is 
confirmed by the local chief actuary and local reserve committee."
"Stage two: The Allianz Group Actuarial function forms an opinion 
on the best-estimate level of the reserves proposed by the local 
entities."
"The Allianz Group Actuarial function challenges the operating 
entities’ selection through their continuous interaction with local teams 
and quarterly attendance in the local reserve committees."
"The ability 
to form a view on the reserve best-estimate level is further enabled by 
regular reviews of the local reserving practices."
"Such reviews consist of 
an evaluation of the reserving process as well as of the 
appropriateness of models, methods, and assumptions, and an 
analysis of the movements of the reserves."
"Significant findings from 
these reviews are communicated in the Allianz Group Reserve 
Committee to initiate actions where necessary."
"The Allianz Group 
Actuarial function monitors and assesses the documentation of the 
validation work performed by the Allianz subsidiaries."
"Distinction between financial and non-financial risk  
In general, the Allianz Group recognizes inflation as a financial risk for 
claims benefits and other insurance expenses (e.g., claims handling) 
only when inflation is contractually linked to an index."
"There are 
insurance products where the amounts to be paid are legally or 
contractually linked to an inflation-index such as a consumer price 
index."
"Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise balances with banks payable on 
demand, balances with central banks, cash on hand, and treasury bills 
to the extent they are not included in investments measured at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"Furthermore, this balance sheet item 
contains checks and bills of exchange that are eligible for refinancing 
at central banks, subject to a maximum term of three months from the 
date of acquisition as well as reverse purchase agreements that are 
due within three months."
"Equity instruments are included in this line item if Allianz 
deviates from its general approach to designate them as measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income or if they do not fulfill 
the prerequisites for such a designation."
"Investments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income 
These investments include debt financial assets that are held within a 
“hold and sell” business model and whose contractual cash flows are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding (SPPI)."
"In addition, investments in equity instruments that are designated 
to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
presented in this line item."
"As prescribed by IFRS 9, amounts presented 
in other comprehensive income are not subsequently transferred to 
profit or loss."
"Instead, the Allianz Group accounting policies foresee 
that the cumulative amounts are transferred directly within equity 
upon derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument that is 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"Investments in associates and joint ventures 
For details on the accounting for investments in associates and joint 
ventures, please see the section “Principles of consolidation”."
"Real estate held for investment 
Real estate held for investment is initially measured at cost, including 
directly attributable transaction costs."
"For the subsequent measurement, the Allianz Group applies the 
fair value model in accordance with IAS 40.33 if the property is held as 
an underlying item for insurance contracts with direct participation 
features and investment contracts with discretionary participation 
features."
"In all other cases, the Allianz Group applies the cost model 
pursuant to IAS 40.56 and carries real estate held for investment at 
cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated 
impairment losses."
"Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
property’s useful life, with a maximum of 50 years."
"Furthermore, real 
estate held for investment is regularly tested for impairment."
"Fixed assets from alternative investments 
Except for biological assets, these assets are carried at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and impairments in accordance with 
IAS 16."
"They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful life, 
with a maximum of 35 years, and regularly tested for impairment."
"Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with 
changes therein recognized in profit or loss."
"D _ Consolidated Financial Statements

163 
 
Financial assets for unit-linked contracts 
Financial assets for unit-linked contracts are neither held within a “hold 
to collect” nor within a “hold and sell” business model."
"Consequently, 
they are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"(Re-)Insurance contract assets 
The balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance 
and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (“insurance 
contracts”) or held (“reinsurance contracts”)."
"For details regarding main 
accounting policies and significant estimates please see separate 
section Insurance contracts."
"Other assets 
Other assets primarily consist of leased or owned real estate held for 
own use, software and equipment, receivables, non-current assets and 
assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale, and assets for 
deferred compensation programs."
"The Allianz Group has elected the fair value model in accordance 
with IAS 40 as its accounting policy to measure properties held for own 
use that are underlying items of (a group of) insurance contracts with 
direct participation features."
"For the purpose of this election, insurance 
contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation 
features."
"All other items of property, plant and equipment are subsequently 
measured based on the cost model pursuant to IAS 16.30."
"When 
applying the cost model, depreciation is generally computed using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets."
"Software is generally amortized straight-line over its expected useful 
life."
"The right-of-use assets related to leased property and equipment 
are generally depreciated over the lease term."

Intangible assets and goodwill 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortization and impairments."
"The table below summarizes estimated useful lives and the 
amortization methods for each material class of intangible assets with 
finite useful lives."
"Goodwill is generally carried in the acquiree’s 
functional currency."
"An evaluation of whether the goodwill is deemed 
recoverable takes place at least once a year."
"Further explanations on the impairment test for goodwill and its 
significant assumptions as well as respective sensitivity analyses are 
given in note 8.9."
"Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities for puttable financial instruments  
The Allianz Group records financial liabilities where non-controlling 
shareholders have the right to put their ownership interests back to the 
Allianz Group (puttable instruments)."
"If these non-controlling 
shareholders still have present access to the risks and rewards 
associated with the underlying ownership interests, the non-controlling 
interests remain recognized, and profit or loss is allocated between 
controlling and non-controlling interests."
"The financial liabilities for 
puttable instruments are generally required to be recorded at the 
redemption amount."
"The Allianz Group recognizes valuation changes 
in equity where the non-controlling shareholders have present access 
to risks and rewards of ownership."
"In all other cases, valuation changes 
are recognized in the income statement."
"This is the case for puttable 
instruments issued by mutual funds controlled but not wholly owned 
by the Allianz Group."
"Certificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities  
Certificated liabilities and subordinated liabilities are subsequently 
measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method to 
amortize the premium or discount to the redemption value over the life 
of the liability."
"(Re-)Insurance contract liabilities 
The balance sheet position differentiation by IFRS 17 into insurance 
and reinsurance contracts relates to contracts issued (“insurance 
contracts”) or held (“reinsurance contracts”) ."
"For details regarding 
main accounting policies and significant estimates please see 
separate section Insurance contracts."
"Investment contract liabilities 
Investment contract liabilities include financial liabilities of investment 
contracts without discretionary participation features accounted for 
under IFRS 9."
"Subsequently, the non-unit-linked investment 
contracts are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method, while the unit-linked contracts are recorded at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognized in the income statement."
"Other liabilities 
Pensions and similar obligations 
Pensions and similar obligations are measured at present value and 
presented net of plan assets by applying the provisions of IAS 19."
"Further explanations and sensitivity calculations are given in 
note 8.16."
"Share-based compensation plans 
The share-based compensation plans of the Allianz Group are 
classified as either equity-settled or cash-settled plans."
"Where equity-
settled plans involve equity instruments of Allianz SE, a corresponding 
increase in shareholders’ equity is recognized."
"Where equity-settled 
plans involve equity instruments of subsidiaries of the Allianz Group, 
the corresponding increase is recognized in non-controlling interests."
"Where expected tax deductions differ, in terms of amount and timing, 
from the cumulative share-based payment expense recognized in 
profit or loss, deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences."
"Lease liabilities 
The Allianz Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and 
lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets."
"Furthermore, the Allianz Group does not recognize right-of-use assets 
and lease liabilities for car leases."
"The expenses relating to the short-
term leases and leases of low-value assets including car leases are 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
"For further information on these expenses, please refer to 
note 8.15."
"Equity 
Issued capital represents the mathematical per-share value received 
at the issuance of shares."
"Additional paid-in capital represents the premium exceeding the 
issued capital received at the issuance of shares."
"Undated subordinated bonds comprise Restricted Tier 1 notes 
that qualify as equity instruments pursuant to IAS 32."
"The instruments 
are presented within shareholders’ equity and any related interest 
charges are classified as distributions from shareholders’ equity, 
without affecting profit or loss."
"The notes are measured at their 
historical value."
"In addition, notes denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated to euro at the quarterly closing exchange rate."
"The 
corresponding foreign exchange differences are recognized as foreign 
currency translation adjustments in equity."
"Non-controlling interests represent equity in subsidiaries, not 
attributable directly or indirectly, to Allianz SE as parent."
"Retained earnings comprise the net income of the current year 
and of prior years not yet distributed, treasury shares, amounts 
recognized in other comprehensive income, and any amounts directly 
recognized in equity according to IFRS."
"Please refer to the section “Foreign currency translation” above for 
an explanation of foreign currency changes that are recognized in 
equity."
"The effective portion of gains and losses of hedging instruments 
designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation is 
recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments."
"The unrealized gains and losses from insurance contacts (net) are 
the cumulative amounts between the total insurance finance income 
or expenses and the amount included in profit or loss."
"Insurance revenue 
Insurance revenue under the GMM/VFA 
The Allianz Group recognizes insurance revenue as it provides services 
under groups of insurance contracts."
"− 
Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk relating to 
current services."
"− 
Other amounts, including experience adjustments for premium 
receipts for current or past services."
"Insurance revenue under the PAA 
In applying the PAA, insurance revenue for the period is the amount of 
expected premium receipts (excluding any investment component 
and adjusted to reflect the time value of money and the effect of 
financial risk, if applicable) allocated to the period."
"Insurance service expenses 
These expenses consist of claims and other insurance service expenses 
incurred during the period as well as the amortization of insurance 
acquisition cash flows, but exclude repayments of investment 
components."
"Furthermore, they include the changes in the fulfillment 
cash flows relating to the LIC, the losses on onerous groups of contracts 
and reversals of such losses and the impairment loss on the assets for 
the pre-coverage acquisition cash flows and the reversals of such 
losses."
"For the insurance contracts with direct participation features, it 
also includes an adjustment for experience adjustments of the non-
financial underlying items."
"Insurance service expenses include only costs that relate directly 
to the fulfillment of the insurance contracts."
"The Allianz Group 
furthermore distinguishes between direct costs and overhead costs."
"Interest result 
Interest result is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective 
interest method."
"This line item also includes dividends from equity 
securities, income from investments in associates and joint ventures 
measured using the equity method, as well as lease income."
"Dividends 
are recognized in income when the right to receive the dividend is 
established."
"Valuation result 
Valuation result contains all investment income and expenses as well 
as realized and unrealized gains and losses from financial assets and 
liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for 
income and expenses that are recognized in interest result."
"In addition, commissions attributable to trading operations and 
related interest expenses, as well as refinancing and transaction costs 
are included in this line item."
"Foreign currency gains and losses on 
monetary items are also reported within valuation result."
"For further details on the composition of this line item, please refer 
to note 7.1."
"Net insurance finance expenses 
Net insurance finance expenses consist of finance income or expenses 
from insurance contracts issued and the finance income or expenses 
from reinsurance contracts held including the effect of time value of 
money and the effect of financial risk."
"It includes the interest accretion 
of the fulfillment cash flows and the CSM as well as the changes in the 
fulfillment cash flows due to changes in financial assumptions."
"For 
groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features, 
changes in the value of underlying items excluding additions and 
withdrawals are included in net insurance finance expenses."
"Generally, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the 
insurance finance income or expenses other than those arising from 
the risk mitigation option between profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income (OCI) based on a systematic allocation."
"Furthermore, the Allianz Group chooses to disaggregate the change in 
risk adjustment for non-financial risk between a change related to 
non-financial risk and the effect of the time value of money and 
changes in the time value of money, which are included in net 
insurance finance expenses."
"For groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the GMM, 
the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is 
determined using the discount rates by which estimated future cash 
flows have been discounted on initial recognition, i.e., the “locked-in” 
interest rate."
"For Life/Health entities, the Allianz Group applies a cash 
flow-weighted average of interest curves through the quarters."
"It 
means averaging each quarterly interest curve for each maturity over 
the cash flows with maturity over the quarters."
"An 
expected crediting rate approach uses an allocation that is based on 
the amounts credited in the period and expected to be credited in 
future periods based on the crediting strategy of the operating entities 
and under the contractual features."
"For the finance income or 
expenses arising from the CSM, a systematic allocation is determined 
using the “locked-in rate”."
"For groups of insurance contracts with direct participation 
features accounted for under the VFA, the Allianz Group generally 
holds the underlying items."
"For groups of insurance contracts accounted for under the PAA, 
the systematic allocation for the finance income or expenses is 
determined using the discount rates at the date of the incurred claim, 
i.e., the “locked-in” interest rate based on accident year."
"For Property-
Casualty entities, the Allianz approach is the simple average of interest 
curves through the quarters weighted by ¼ each."
"Fee and commission income 
Fee and commission income primarily consists of asset management 
fees which are recognized when the service is provided."
"For those fees, 
the service is considered to be provided periodically."
"Performance fees 
from funds are not usually recognized as income until the end of the 
funds’ term."
"Before its completion, the payment claim depends on the 
occurrence of certain events, such as the future development of the 
fund, which is regularly not reliably estimable."
"Carried interest is 
generally recognized as revenue on the date of the formal declaration 
of distribution by the investee and only earlier if sufficient evidence 
exists to support that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of 
carried interest revenue will not occur."
"The transaction price for asset 
management services is determined by the fees contractually agreed."
"Income taxes 
Current income taxes are calculated based on the respective local 
taxable income and local tax rules for the period."
"In addition, current 
income taxes presented for the period include adjustments for 
uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods not yet finally 
assessed, excluding interest expenses and penalties on the 
underpayment of taxes."
"In the event that amounts included in the tax 
return are considered unlikely to be accepted by the tax authorities 
(uncertain tax positions), a provision for income taxes is recognized."
"The amount is based on the best possible assessment of the tax 
payment expected."
"Tax refund claims from uncertain tax positions are 
recognized when it is probable that they can be realized."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated for temporary 
differences between the tax bases and the financial statement 
carrying amounts, including differences from consolidation, unused 
tax loss carry-forwards, and unused tax credits."
"The measurement of 
deferred tax assets has to take into account estimates on the 
availability of future taxable profits."
"This includes the character and 
amounts of taxable future profits, the periods in which those profits are 
expected to occur, and the availability of tax planning opportunities."
Further explanations are given in note 8.4.
"First application of IFRS 9 and 17 
General information 
The Allianz Group has initially applied IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, including 
any 
consequential 
amendments 
to 
other 
standards, 
from 
1 January 2023."
"These standards have brought significant changes to 
the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments."
"IFRS 17 supersedes IFRS 4 and establishes principles for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance 
contracts issued, reinsurance contracts held, and investment contracts 
with discretionary participation features."
"Detailed qualitative and 
quantitative descriptions of the effects from the initial application of 
IFRS 17 on the Allianz Group’s financial statements have been included in 
note 2 of the Annual Report 2022."
"IFRS 17 has to be applied 
retrospectively unless this is impracticable."
"Fulfillment cash flows are 
determined prospectively at every reporting date, including the date of 
initial application."
"However, the contractual service margin is rolled 
forward over time, a split of profits between equity (“earned profits”) and 
contractual service margin (“unearned profits”) is required but is often 
judgmental."
"If a full retrospective application is impracticable, an entity 
can choose between a modified retrospective approach or a fair value 
approach."
"This accounting policy choice for the transition approach was 
made on a group of contract level."
"The decision involved the 
consideration of multiple criteria, such as availability of reliable and 
objective information, operational complexity, or the reasonableness of 
the split between earned and unearned profits."
"For contracts measured 
under the variable fee approach, the Allianz Group has generally applied 
the modified retrospective approach using the fair value of the underlying 
items as the basis from which to determine the contractual service margin 
at transition."
"The most significant portion of insurance contracts measured 
under the fair value approach is the life business in the U.S."
"The Allianz Group applied modifications under the modified 
retrospective approach only to the extent that it did not have reasonable 
and supportable information available to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively."
"Conceptually, the contractual service margin usually reflects 
the insurer’s expected future profits from writing business (entry price 
concept)."
"Under the fair value approach, however, the contractual service 
margin reflects the margin an average market participant would require 
taking over the contracts (exit price concept)."
"Therefore, when 
determining the fair value of a group of contracts, the Allianz Group 
replaces entity-specific assumptions with objective assumptions that an 
average market participant would use for pricing the liability."
"For this, the 
Allianz Group has determined the exit price either based on a real-world 
projection of the present value of future profits of the group of contracts 
or using an internal rate of return methodology based on distributable 
earnings."
"For most groups of contracts for which the internal rate of return 
methodology was applied, the Allianz Group used an internal rate of 
return of 13 %."
"Besides the determination of the contractual service margin, another 
crucial key topic at transition is the determination of historic interest rates."
"The Allianz Group makes use of the introduction of Solvency II, which is the 
general basis for the interest rates."
"IFRS 9, issued by the IASB in July 2014, fully replaces IAS 39 and 
provides a new approach on how to classify financial instruments based 
on their cash flow characteristics and the business model under which 
they are managed."
"Furthermore, the standard introduces a new forward-
looking impairment model for debt instruments and provides new rules 
for hedge accounting."
"Upon transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the Allianz Group has elected 
to restate the comparative information of financial assets for IFRS 9."
"This 
includes the application of the classification overlay to all financial assets 
derecognized in the comparative period."
"In connection with the 
classification overlay, the Allianz Group also applies the impairment 
requirements of IFRS 9 to all financial assets in scope."
"These changes had no material impact on the Allianz Group’s financial 
results or financial position."
"Recently issued accounting pronouncements 
The following amendments and revisions to standards and 
interpretations have been issued by the IASB but are not yet effective 
for or have not been adopted early by the Allianz Group."
"Early 
adoption is generally allowed but not intended by the Allianz Group."
"Innovation Group’s capabilities complement the Allianz Group’s 
existing claims management options."
"For example, Innovation Group 
operates a proprietary software platform to outsource claims 
management which enables largely automated claims management 
through a simple, intuitive user interface and connects all relevant 
participants, including data providers, in the claims process."
"The Allianz Group acquired identifiable assets and liabilities with 
a fair value of € 259 mn and € 402 mn, respectively."
"Expected cost 
synergies and future revenues from operating Innovation Group 
independently serving all customers are the main factors that make up 
the goodwill recognized in an amount of € 270 mn."
"Incontra Assicurazioni S.p.A., Milan 
On 30 November 2023, the Allianz Group completed the acquisition of 
50 % of the shares of Incontra Assicurazioni S.p.A., Milan, a non-life 
insurance business to strengthen the bancassurance partnership with 
UniCredit."
"The Allianz Group acquired identifiable assets and liabilities with 
a preliminary fair value of € 456 mn and € 377 mn, respectively."
"Expected cost synergies are the main factors that make up the 
goodwill recognized at a preliminary amount of € 40 mn."
"In 2022, the Allianz Group acquired 100 % of the shares of European 
Reliance General Insurance Company S.A., Chalandri, a leading Greek 
insurer."
"For more information, please see note 4 to the Annual Report 
2022."
"The assets and liabilities of the affected operations across Africa 
contributed to the partnership were allocated to the reportable 
segments Global Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin 
America, Middle East and Africa (Property-Casualty and Life/Health)."
"On completion, cumulative losses of € 194 mn previously reported in 
other comprehensive income relating to the business operations 
contributed to the partnership mainly consisting of foreign currency 
translation effects were reclassified to profit or loss."
"Russian insurance operations 
On 17 May 2023, the Allianz Group completed the sale of 50 % plus 
one share in its Russian insurance operations to Interholding LLC, 
Moscow."
"The assets and liabilities of the Russian insurance operations sold 
were allocated to the reportable segments German Speaking 
Countries and Central & Eastern Europe (Property-Casualty and

"Allianz Saudi Arabia 
On 27 September 2023, the Allianz Group entered into a binding 
agreement to sell its 51 % stake in Allianz Saudi Fransi to Abu Dhabi 
National Insurance Company (ADNIC)."
"Pending receipt of regulatory

"Euler Hermes Re S.A., Luxembourg 
On 26 January 2024, the Allianz Group entered into a binding 
agreement to sell its 100 % stake in Euler Hermes Re S.A., Luxembourg, 
to a Luxembourg captive reinsurance company."
"Pending receipt of 
regulatory approvals, the sale is expected to be completed in the 
second quarter of 2024."
The assets and liabilities of Euler Hermes Re S.A.
"classified as held 
for sale are allocated to the reportable segment Global Insurance 
Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East and Africa 
(Property-Casualty)."
"As of 31 December 2023, cumulative losses of € 8 mn were 
reported in other comprehensive income relating to the disposal group 
classified as held for sale."
"Due to differences in the nature of 
products, risks, and capital allocation, insurance activities are further 
divided into the business segments Property-Casualty and Life/Health."
"Both asset management as well as corporate and other activities 
represent separate reportable segments."
"In total, the Allianz Group 
has identified 11 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8."
"The types of products and services from which the reportable 
segments derive revenues are described below."
"Asset Management 
The reportable segment Asset Management operates as a global 
provider of institutional and retail asset management products and 
services to third-party investors."
"It also provides investment 
management services to the Allianz Group’s insurance operations."
"The 
products for retail and institutional customers include equity and fixed-
income funds as well as multi-assets and alternative products."
"The 
United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region represent 
the primary asset management markets."
"Corporate and Other 
The reportable segment Corporate and Other includes the 
management and support of the Allianz Group’s businesses through 
its strategy, risk, corporate finance, treasury, financial reporting, 
controlling, communication, legal, human resources, technology, and 
other functions."
"Furthermore, it includes the banking activities in 
France, Italy, and Bulgaria, as well as digital investments."
"Prices for transactions between reportable segments are set on an 
arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties."
"Lease transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS, except 
for intra-group lease transactions which are classified as operating 
leases (i.e., off-balance sheet treatment by lessee) for internal and 
segment reporting purposes."
"Transactions between reportable 
segments are eliminated in the consolidation."
"Financial information is 
recorded based on reportable segments; cross-segmental country-
specific information is not determined."
"The Allianz Group uses operating profit and shareholders’ core net 
income to evaluate the performance of its reportable segments as well 
as of the Allianz Group as a whole."
"Operating profit highlights the portion of income before income 
taxes that is attributable to the ongoing core operations of the 
Allianz Group."
"The Allianz Group considers the presentation of 
operating profit to be useful and meaningful to investors because it 
enhances the understanding of the Allianz Group’s underlying operating 
performance and the comparability of its operating performance over 
time."
"The following exceptions apply to this general rule: 
− 
In all reportable segments, the valuation result from investments 
and other assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value 
through profit or loss is treated as operating profit if it relates to 
operating business."
"− 
For life/health insurance business and property-casualty insurance 
products with policyholder participation, all items listed above are 
included in operating profit if the profit sources are shared with 
policyholders."
"Shareholders’ core net income presents the shareholders’ portion of 
income before market movements and amortization of specific 
intangible assets from business combinations (including any related 
tax effects)."
"The Allianz Group considers the presentation of 
shareholders’ core net income to be useful and meaningful because it 
reduces the volatility and impact caused by non-operating items which 
are not attendant to the Allianz Group’s sustainable performance."
"− 
Non-operating amortization and impairments of intangible assets 
from business combinations except for insurance, investment or 
service contracts or agreements for the distribution of such 
contracts."
"Operating profit and shareholders’ core net income should be viewed 
as complementary to, and not as a substitute for, income before 
income taxes or net income as determined in accordance with IFRS."
"Effective 1 January 2023, the Allianz Group reorganized the structure 
of its insurance activities to reflect the changes in the responsibilities of 
the Board of Management."
"The insurance activities in Iberia & Latin 
America have been included in the reportable segment Global 
Insurance Lines & Anglo Markets, Iberia & Latin America, Middle East 
and Africa."
"Greece was moved into the reportable segment Western & 
Southern Europe, Allianz Direct and Allianz Partners."
"Previously 
reported information has been adjusted to reflect this change in the 
composition of the Allianz Group’s reportable segments."
"Additionally, some minor reallocations between the reportable 
segments have been made."
"The definition of total business volume is comparable to the definition of total revenues previously 
used within the Allianz Group."
"The revenues from the banking business are, however, not part of the total business volume anymore as the remaining banking activities can be considered immaterial."
"Moreover, in Property-Casualty and in Life/Health, smaller adjustments to premiums at some entities 
are applied, following some interpretation/presentation changes."
"2_Total revenues comprise insurance revenue and fee and commission income in Property-Casualty, insurance revenue in Life/Health, and operating revenues in Asset Management."
"3_Includes acquisition and administrative expenses, other income, and other expenses."
"4_Includes, if applicable, acquisition-related expenses, income taxes related incidental benefits/expenses, litigation expenses, one-time effects from significant reinsurance transactions with disposal character, and income and expenses from the application of hyperinflation accounting."
"Until 2022, the 
effects from the application of hyperinflation accounting were included in non-operating investment income (net)."
"The main line items affected 
are the operating insurance service result, the operating net result from 
investment contracts, and the operating net investment income."
"The Allianz Group uses operating insurance service result as a 
performance indicator."
"− 
non-attributable acquisition, administrative, and claims expenses 
which before adoption of IFRS 17 were also included in the 
underwriting result."
"These expenses are included in the line 
acquisition and administrative expenses in the consolidated 
income statement1; 
− 
adjustments for experience variances at claims and expenses if the 
technical result is shared with the policyholders."
"In the 
consolidated income statement, these experience variances are 
part of the net insurance finance expenses; 
− 
specific restructuring charges and amortization of intangible 
assets which are shared with the policyholders."
"For a better analysis of the result from investment contracts, all related 
income and expenses are included in the line operating result from 
investment contracts."
"For this, fee and commission income and 
expenses as well as net investment income are reclassified from the 
respective line items in the Group income statement."
"Fee and commission income and expenses are reclassified to 
operating net investment income if they are related to insurance 
contracts."
"The following table reconciles the amounts in the consolidated 
Group income statement to the amounts presented in the 
reconciliation of operating profit (loss) to net income (loss) (OP 
reconciliation)."
"The remaining deviation from the amounts disclosed as finance income (expenses) (net) in notes 6.6 and 
6.7 results from different exchange rates used for the translation of profit or loss and balance sheet amounts."

"The second set analyzes the movements of contracts not 
measured under the PAA by measurement components."
"The corresponding analyses for reinsurance contracts are 
included in note 6.7."
"No material groups of onerous contracts which are not measured 
under the PAA were initially recognized in the periods ended 
31 December 2023 and 2022, nor were material groups of contracts 
not measured under the PAA were acquired."
"The pattern of recognition does not contain unwinding of 
valuation rates and expected over-return of assets for contracts 
measured using the VFA and interest accretion of the CSM arising from 
unwind of locked-in rates for contracts using the building block 
approach."
"Furthermore, the future CSM release will also include 
amounts related to new contracts written in future periods."
"Consequently, the CSM release projection should not be interpreted as 
the CSM release expected for future periods."
Please refer to note 2 for further details.
"They can comprise any items; for example, a reference 
portfolio of assets, the net assets of the entity, or a specified subset of 
the net assets of the entity."
"The underlying items are determined from a single entity view, i.e., 
not from a consolidated Allianz Group view, and are based on the 
specific contractual terms including applicable rules imposed by law 
or regulation."
"This includes underlying items that are not solely 
financial in nature, e.g., an entity’s profit based on local accounting 
principles."
"Deriving these sensitivities requires complex and judgmental 
valuations."
"Furthermore, market developments or insurance events 
reflected in the scenarios would usually trigger management reactions 
to balance the impact, reflecting the overall circumstances and the 
variety of simultaneous sensitivities including cross effects."
"The impact 
taking into account these reactions cannot be reasonably reflected in 
a single number."
"The sensitivities are thus calculating the theoretical impact of an 
instantaneous shock at the end of the reporting period."
"They do not 
fully take into account all management actions and indirect effects, 
such as changes in the asset allocation."
"Consequently, the shareholders’ net income sensitivity should not 
be interpreted as a comprehensive reflection of the respective 
scenarios."

6.15 _ Claims development 
The loss triangle is a tabular representation of loss-related data (such 
as payments, loss reserves, ultimate losses) in two time-related 
dimensions."
"One of these is the calendar year, the other is the accident 
year (year of loss occurrence)."
"Loss triangles – as the basis for 
measuring loss reserves – express how the loss reserves change over 
the course of time due to payments made and new estimates of the 
expected ultimate loss at the respective reporting date."
"The ultimate loss of an accident year comprises all payments 
made for that accident year up to the reporting date, plus the loss 
reserves at the reporting date."
"Given complete information regarding 
all losses incurred up to the reporting date, the ultimate loss for each 
accident-year period would remain unchanged."
"In practice, however, 
the ultimate loss (based on estimates) is exposed to fluctuations that 
reflect the increase in knowledge regarding the loss cases."
"It is important to highlight that the following triangles, which show 
only figures of the Property-Casualty business segment, follow 
different accounting standards on the disclosure of the payments, loss 
reserves, and ultimate losses."
"Calendar years 2021 and prior are disclosed according to IFRS 4, 
meaning that the overall development of loss reserves considers 
undiscounted non-annuities and discounted annuities."
"Calendar years 2022 and onward are disclosed according to 
IFRS 17, hence loss development by accident year is fully on an 
undiscounted basis (for both annuities and non-annuities)."
"A full 
reconciliation of the undiscounted reserves disclosed in below 
triangles to the net liabilities for incurred claims (LIC) is presented in 
the second table below."
"It should be noted, that a simplified approach 
has been used for the calendar year 2022 loss development."
"While the 
first disclosure of calendar year 2022 followed IFRS 4 accounting, the 
below restated calendar year 2022 loss developments are disclosed 
according to IFRS 17."
"The simplified approach adopted relies on the 
split by accident year of the undiscounted IFRS 4 reserves, applied on 
the IFRS 17 undiscounted reserves underlying the financial year 2023 
opening balance sheet."
"The data is only presented on a net basis, as this is considered to 
be more meaningful in order to represent the retained impact on 
Group results."
"The loss triangles are not prepared on a currency-
adjusted basis."
"This means all figures are translated from the 
respective local currency into the Allianz Group presentation currency 
(euro), consistently using the exchange rates applicable at the 
respective reporting date."
"This ensures that the reserves reconcile with 
reserves in the consolidated balance sheet."
"This means that effects like changes 
in consolidated subsidiaries and foreign currency translation are 
presented differently, while other effects (as e.g."
"discounting, risk 
adjustment) are fully excluded from above loss ratio triangle."
"2_Including liability for remaining coverage of contracts measured under the PAA, receivables, payables, and deposits."

"The 
Allianz Group realized a loss of € 229 mn for the year ended

"Disposals of equity investments are driven by overall risk 
management considerations including sensitivity considerations as

absolute value of the notional principal amounts of derivatives with 
positive and negative fair values."
"Although these notional principal 
amounts reflect the degree of the Allianz Group’s involvement in

in the sections on market and credit risk of the Risk and Opportunity 
Report, which forms part of the Group Management Report."

3_Consists solely of foreign exchange contracts.
"Fair value hedges 
The Allianz Group uses fair value hedges to hedge the exposure to 
changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities due 
to movements in interest or exchange rates, and to hedge its equity 
portfolio against equity market risk."
"As of 31 December 2023, the 
derivative financial instruments used for the related fair value hedges 
of the Allianz Group had a total negative fair value of € 128 mn."
"The ineffectiveness that arises from fair value hedges amounted to 
€ (10) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023."
"Cash flow hedges 
Cash flow hedges were used to hedge the exposure to the variability 
of cash flows arising from interest rate or exchange rate fluctuations 
as well as inflation."
"As of 31 December 2023, the derivative 
instruments utilized had a total negative fair value of € 414 mn."
"The ineffectiveness that arises from cash flow hedges amounted to 
€ (1) mn for the year ended 31 December 2023."
"The change in the 
value of the hedging instrument recognized in other comprehensive 
income was € 948 mn for the year ended 31 December 2023."
"Hedges of net investment in foreign operations 
As of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group hedged part of its foreign 
currency net investments through the issuance of several foreign 
currency denominated liabilities and the use of forward contracts."
"The 
total negative fair value was € 107 mn for the year ended 
31 December 2023."
"The Allianz Group enters into enforceable master netting 
arrangements and similar arrangements mainly for derivatives 
transactions."
"None of these enforceable master netting arrangements 
or similar arrangements meet the requirements for offsetting in line 
with IAS 32."
"Credit risk associated with netting arrangements is further 
mitigated by collateral."
"For further information on collateral, please 
refer to note 7.5."
"The maximum credit risk exposure is represented by 
the carrying amount of the financial asset."
"Regarding IBOR Reform, the transition to alternative benchmark rates 
affects two components, the risk-free rates for discounting cash flows 
in derivative transactions as well as reference rates of variable 
financial instruments and transactions."
"In the meantime, the derivatives of the Allianz Group are fully 
migrated due to the already implemented transition of the risk-free 
discount rate in major currency blocks."
"For cash instruments, the 
transition of the risk-free discount rate and the transition of the 
reference rate Euribor used for the euro region, where the majority of 
the relevant financial instruments are, has already happened."
"The USD 
Libor transition happened by mid 2023."
"Overall the associated or 
expected effect of this transition is not material for the Allianz Group."
2_Market observable inputs.
3_Non-market observable inputs.
4_Changes in the derivatives level 3 fair values mainly result from a clarification regarding the significant inputs observability of certain contracts.
"Applied to 2022, the comparative level 3 assets would increase by € 1,084 mn, financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss by € 1,054 mn, 
with a concurrent decrease of level 1 fair values."
2_Include for real estate held for investment reclassifications into non-current assets and assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale of € (542) mn.
"If financial assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring 
basis at the time of impairment, or if fair value less cost to sell is used 
as the measurement basis under IFRS 5, corresponding disclosures can 
be found in note 7.1."
2_Market observable inputs.
3_Non-market observable inputs.
4_The increase within Level 2 compared to 31 December 2022 is mainly driven by the reassessment and the underlying reclassification by Allianz Bulgaria.
5_The increase in Level 2 fair values is mainly driven by an improved valuation for a German investment product.
The valuation techniques for these debt investments are similar.
"The fair value is determined using the market and the income 
approach."
"Primary inputs for the market approach are quoted prices 
for identical or comparable assets in active markets, where 
comparability between the security and the benchmark defines the 
fair value level."
"The income approach in most cases means that a 
present value technique is applied where either the cash flows or the 
discount curve are adjusted to reflect credit risk and/or liquidity risk."
"Depending on the observability of these risk parameters in the market, 
the security is classified as level 2 or level 3."
"Level 3 investments are mainly priced based on the income 
approach."
"The primary non-market observable input used in the 
discounted cash flow method is an option-adjusted spread taken from 
a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics."
"A significant 
yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a 
decreased fair value, while a significant yield decrease could result in 
an increased fair value."
"However, a 10 % stress of the main non-market 
observable inputs has only immaterial impact on fair value."
"Equity investments in fair value through other comprehensive 
income and funds 
For level 2, the fair value is mainly determined using the market 
approach or net asset value techniques for funds."
"Level 3 mainly comprises private equity fund investments as well 
as alternative investments of the Allianz Group, and in most cases 
these are delivered as net asset values by the fund managers."
"These 
net asset values are calculated using material, non-public information 
about the respective private equity companies."
"The Allianz Group has 
only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers, 
hence a sensitivity analysis is not applicable."
"The fund’s asset manager 
generally prices the underlying single portfolio companies in line with

for 
the 
year 
ended 
31 December 2023, income of € 89 mn (2022: expenses of € 1,227 mn) is 
attributable to the recognition of deferred taxes on temporary 
differences, and income of € 112 mn (2022: € 798 mn) is attributable 
to tax losses carried forward."
"Changes to applicable tax rates due to 
changes in tax law led to deferred tax income of € 0 mn (2022: € 2 mn)."

country-specific tax rates, taking into consideration consolidation 
effects with an impact on the Group result."
"The applicable tax rate 
used in the reconciliation for domestic Allianz Group companies 
includes corporate tax, trade tax, and the solidarity surcharge, and 
amounted to 31.0 % (2022: 31.0 %)."
"The effective tax rate is determined on the basis of the effective 
income tax expenses on income before income taxes."
"The reversal of write-down of deferred tax 
assets on tax losses carried forward resulted in deferred tax income of 
€ 122 mn (2022: € 24 mn)."
"Due to the use of tax losses carried forward, 
for which deferred tax assets had previously been written off, the 
current income tax expenses decreased by € 0 mn (2022: € 0 mn)."
"Deferred tax income increased by € 16 mn (2022: € 29 mn) due to the 
use of tax losses carried forward, for which deferred tax assets had 
previously been written off."
"The aforementioned effects are shown in 
the reconciliation statement as “effects of tax losses”."

taxes are the applicable national rates, which in 2023 ranged from 10.0 % 
to 40.0 %, with changes to tax rates that had already been adopted in the 
Czech Republic and Türkiye by 31 December 2023 taken into account."
"Deferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recognized to 
the extent to which it is more likely than not that sufficient future 
taxable profits will be available for realization."
"For an amount 
of € 4,589 mn (2022: € 4,664 mn) no deferred tax liabilities are 
recognized, because they will not reverse in the foreseeable future."
"For 
deductible temporary differences arising from investments in 
Allianz Group companies in the amount of € 355 mn (2022: € 437 mn) 
no deferred tax assets are recognized because it is not probable that 
these differences will reverse in the foreseeable future."
"Tax losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 of € 9,653 mn (2022: 
€ 9,307 mn) resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets to the 
extent that there is sufficient certainty that the unused tax losses will 
be utilized."
"At the reporting date, this prerequisite was considered not 
fulfilled for a partial amount of € 2,839 mn (2022: € 2,752 mn)."

"Allocation principles  
For the purpose of impairment testing, the Allianz Group has allocated 
goodwill to CGUs1.1These CGUs represent the lowest level at which 
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes."
"The business segment Asset Management is represented by the CGU 
Asset Management, mainly including Allianz Global Investors and 
PIMCO."
"The business segment Corporate and Other mainly includes 
Digital Investments."
"The Allianz Group applies generally 
acknowledged valuation principles to determine the value in use."
"For all CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for 
the CGU Asset Management, the Allianz Group mainly uses the 
discounted earnings method to derive the value in use."
"The discounted earnings value 
is calculated by discounting the future earnings using an appropriate 
discount rate."
"The business plans applied in the value in use 
calculations are the results of the structured management dialogues 
between the Board of Management of Allianz SE and the operating 
entities in connection with a reporting process integrated into these 
dialogues."
"Generally, the business plans comprise a planning horizon 
of three years and are based on the current market environment."
"The terminal values are largely based on the expected profits of 
the final year of the detailed planning period."
"Where necessary, the 
planned profits are adjusted to reflect long-term sustainable earnings."
"The financing of the assumed eternal growth in the terminal values is 
accounted for by appropriate profit retention."
"In the prior years, the value in use for all CGUs in the Life/Health 
business segment was mainly based on an Appraisal Value method 
which was derived from the Market Consistent Embedded Value and 
a multiple of the New Business Value (VNB) calculation."
"In 2023 for all CGUs in the Life/Health business segment, the value 
in use is mainly derived from the IFRS net asset value (NAV), a New 
Business Value calculation (VNB), and a multiple of the value of New 
Business."
"For valuation purposes, the Allianz Group defines the NAV as 
the sum of the IFRS total equity without goodwill plus the CSM net of 
tax, net of reinsurance and net of the present value of non-attributable 
costs."
"This NAV reflects the in-force value including expected profits in 
the form of CSM."
"As it is based on the IFRS balance sheet, the NAV 
reflects a market consistent valuation in line with core steering 
measures applied at the Allianz Group, in particular (net) CSM and 
VNB."
"The implementation of IFRS 9 and 17 standards is a fundamental 
new development in the financial reporting process for insurance 
entities."
"Considering the key advantages of these standards for 
insurance entities, the Allianz Group changed the input basis for the 
value in use calculation to the IFRS balance sheet for year-end 2023."
"The change in the input assumption from embedded value or 
appraisal value to an IFRS balance sheet basis is recognized as an 
IAS 8 change of estimate."
"In the Corporate and Other business segment, the value in use in 
the Digital Investments is derived by using the discounted cash flow 
and multiple method."
"Discounted cash flows are calculated based on 
the companies‘ business plan as well as an estimate of sustainable 
returns and eternal growth rates (terminal value)."
"The discounted 
earnings value is calculated by discounting the future earnings using 
an appropriate discount rate."
"For the multiple method, transactions 
and revenues of comparable companies are used."
"Significant assumptions 
In determining the business plans, certain key assumptions were made 
in order to project future earnings."
"For entities included in the CGUs of the Property-Casualty 
business segment, the business plans are mainly based on key 
assumptions including expense ratio, loss ratio, investment income, risk 
capital, market share, premium rate changes, and taxes."
"The bases for 
determining the values assigned to the key assumptions are current 
market trends and earnings projections."
"The discount rate is based on the capital asset pricing model 
(CAPM) and appropriate eternal growth rates."
"The assumptions, 
including the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, segment 
beta, and leverage ratio used to calculate the discount rates, are 
generally consistent with the parameters used in the Allianz Group’s 
planning and controlling process."

For entities included in the CGUs of the Life/Health business segment, 
the valuation is based on the NAV that reflects the in-force value 
including the expected profits in the form of the CSM."
"The CSM is part 
of the insurance contract liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet consisting 
of the present value of future cash flows, a risk adjustment, and the 
value of unearned profits."
"These unearned profits are also included 
from a shareholder’s perspective for the company value, i.e., after tax 
and reinsurance."
"The present value of future cash flows corresponds to the 
probability-weighted average of future cash flows considering the 
time value of money, using the relevant risk-free interest rate term 
structure."
"The risk adjustment reflects an additional provision to 
account for the uncertainty in future cash flows with respect to non-
financial risk."
"For further information regarding the different 
components, please refer to the section “Insurance contracts” in note 2."
"The VNB calculation is based on a best estimate of one year of 
VNB, multiplied by a factor (multiple) to capture expected future new 
business."
"The best estimate of new business is generally derived from 
the achieved value of new business."
"The new business multiple 
accounts for the risk and the growth associated with future new 
business analogous to the discount rate and the growth rate in a 
discounted earnings method."
"For all CGUs in the Life/Health business 
segment, a multiple of not more than ten times the VNB is applied."
"For entities included in the CGU of the Asset Management 
business segment, key assumptions include assets under management 
growth, cost-income ratio, and risk capital."
"The key assumptions are 
based on the current market environment."
"The discount rate for the 
CGU Asset Management is 12.0 % (2022: 10.8 %) and the eternal 
growth rate is 2.6 % (2022: 1.3 %)."
"For the Digital Investments included in the Corporate and Other 
business segment, the bases for determining the values assigned to 
the key assumptions are current market trends and earnings

Sensitivity analyses were performed with regard to discount rates and

"For the CGUs in the Property-Casualty business segment and for 
the CGU Asset Management, sensitivity analyses were performed with 
respect to the long-term sustainable combined ratios/cost-income 
ratios and the discount rate."
"For all CGUs discounted earnings, value 
sensitivities still exceeded their respective carrying amounts."
"In the Life/Health business segment, sensitivity analyses were 
performed mainly based on NAV and VNB sensitivity testing on the 
reference rate."
"The analyses have shown that in case of a change in 
reference rates by 50 basis points, the value in use of each CGU still 
exceeds its carrying amount."
"In the Corporate and Other business segment, a sensitivity 
analysis was performed with respect to earnings and interest rates for 
the Digital Investments."
"The analysis has shown that in case of an 
increase in the interest rates by 50 basis points and under 
consideration of a holding period usual for the asset class, the 
recoverable amount approximates its carrying value."

"The Allianz Group’s insurance subsidiaries (including Allianz SE) 
prepare individual financial statements based on local laws and 
regulations."
"The local regulations establish additional restrictions on 
the minimum level of capital and the amount of dividends that may be

the volume of premiums written or claims paid, amount of insurance 
reserves, investment risks, credit risks, and underwriting risks."
operations of the Allianz Group.
"For further information on the 
Structured Alpha matter please refer to note 8.13."
"Some insurance subsidiaries of the Allianz Group are subject to 
regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be remitted 
to Allianz SE without prior approval by the appropriate regulatory 
body."
"These restrictions require that a company may only pay 
dividends up to an amount in excess of certain regulatory capital 
levels, or based on the levels of undistributed earned surplus or current 
year income or a percentage thereof."
"The Allianz Group’s Board of 
Management believes that these restrictions will not affect the ability 
of Allianz SE to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future."
"The Allianz Group engages in some business activities that involve 
the use of entities that meet the above-mentioned definition of 
structured entities."
"Primarily, the Allianz Group is involved with such 
entities due to its investment activities associated with its insurance 
business and due to its asset management activities."
"Furthermore, 
structured entities are used by the Allianz Group to source out certain 
risks to investors as part of its reinsurance business."
"Generally, the 
classification of an entity as a structured entity may require significant 
judgment."
"In the following sections, the business activities involving 
unconsolidated structured entities are described."
"2_Including the application of transitional measures for technical provisions, the Solvency II capitalization 
ratio amounts to 229 % as of 31.12.2023 (2022: 230 %)."
"These securitization vehicles refinance the 
purchase of assets by issuing tranches of ABS or MBS whose 
repayment is linked to the performance of the assets held by the 
vehicles."
"Securitization vehicles invested in by the Allianz Group have 
generally been set up by third parties."
"Furthermore, the Allianz Group 
has neither transferred any assets to these vehicles nor has it provided 
any further credit enhancements to them."
"Income derived from investments in securitization vehicles mainly 
includes interest income generated from ABS and MBS, as well as 
realized gains and losses from disposals of these securities."
"Within the asset management business, the Allianz Group acts as 
asset manager for some securitization vehicles."
"The assets under 
management of these vehicles amounted to € 3,884 mn as of 
31 December 2023 (2022: € 3,051 mn)."
"Some of the affected vehicles 
have been set up by the Allianz Group, others by third parties."
"In this 
context, the role of the Allianz Group is limited to asset management."
"Income derived from the management of securitization vehicles 
comprises asset management fees."
"Investments in investment funds 
Considering the broad variety of investment funds across different 
jurisdictions, the classification of investment funds as structured entities 
based on the definition in IFRS 12 is judgmental."
"As a general rule, the 
management of relevant activities of an investment fund is delegated 
to the fund manager via asset management agreements."
"In contrast, 
influence from investors on the relevant activities of investment funds 
is usually either precluded by legal or regulatory provisions or not 
deemed substantial."
"Investment funds are generally subject to stringent regulatory 
requirements from financial authorities in all jurisdictions across the 
world."
"Comprehensive regulation of funds protects fund investors and 
also helps to limit investment risk."
"These mechanisms result in a legal 
set-up of funds that the Allianz Group has to accept as investor and 
which may lead to a classification as structured entities under IFRS 12."
"With regard to investment activities, income mainly includes  
distributions from the funds as well as realized gains and losses from 
disposals."
"Asset management activities  
Within the asset management business, investment funds are 
established and managed to accommodate retail and institutional 
clients’ requirements to hold investments in specific asset classes, 
market segments, or regions."
"Within the insurance business, 
policyholder money is partly invested in investment funds managed by 
Allianz’s group-internal asset managers."
"Investment funds managed 
by the Allianz Group may include mutual funds, special funds, and 
other funds."
"Income derived from the management of investment funds 
mainly includes asset management fees and performance-based fees."
"Investment funds launched by group-internal asset managers can 
be considered to be sponsored by the Allianz Group."
"As a sponsor, the 
Allianz Group is involved in the legal set-up and marketing of internally 
managed investment funds through its asset management 
subsidiaries."
"This may include providing seed capital to the funds and 
providing administrative services to ensure the investment funds’ 
operation."
"Investment funds managed by group-internal asset 
managers can be reasonably associated with the Allianz Group."
"The 
use of the Allianz name for investment funds is another indicator that 
the Allianz Group has acted as a sponsor for the respective funds."

"8.13 _ Litigation, guarantees, 
commitments, and other contingencies 
Allianz Group companies are involved in legal, regulatory, and 
arbitration proceedings in Germany and a number of foreign 
jurisdictions, including the United States."
"Such proceedings arise in the 
ordinary course of business, including, amongst others, their activities 
as insurance, banking and asset management companies, employers, 
investors and taxpayers."
"While it is not feasible to predict or determine 
the ultimate outcome of such proceedings, they may result in 
substantial damages or other payments or penalties, or result in 
adverse publicity and damage to the Allianz Group’s reputation."
"As a 
result, such proceedings could have an adverse effect on the 
Allianz Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations."
"Apart from the proceedings discussed below, Allianz SE is not aware 
of any threatened or pending legal, regulatory or arbitration 
proceedings which may have, or have had in the recent past, 
significant effects on its and/or the Allianz Group’s financial position or 
profitability."
"Material proceedings in which Allianz Group companies 
are involved include in particular the following: 
In January 2023 a putative class action complaint has been filed 
against Allianz SE and, in its amended version, against AllianzGI U.S."
"in 
the United States District Court for the Central District of California."
"The 
complaint alleges violation of Federal U.S."
"Securities Laws by making 
false or misleading statements in public disclosures such as the annual 
reports of Allianz in the period between March 2018 and May 2022 
regarding the AllianzGI U.S."
"Structured Alpha matter and internal 
controls."
Allianz SE considers the action to be unfounded.
"Any material contingent liabilities resulting from litigation matters are 
captured in the litigation section above."
Pursuant to §§ 221 et seq.
"of the German Insurance Supervision 
Act (“Versicherungsaufsichtsgesetz – VAG”), mandatory insurance

health insurers are implemented in Germany, which are financed 
through their member undertakings."
"The insurance guarantee scheme for life insurers levies annual 
contributions and, under certain circumstances, special contributions."

obligation is, in principle, based on a maximum of 1 % of the sum of the 
net underwriting reserves with deduction of payments already 
provided 
to 
the 
insurance 
guarantee 
scheme."
"8.14 _ Hyperinflationary economies 
Subsidiaries of the Allianz Group that operate in Türkiye and Argentina 
have to apply hyperinflation accounting in accordance with IAS 29."
"In applying IAS 29, the Allianz Group has adopted the accounting 
policy to present the combined effect of the restatement in accordance 
with IAS 29 and the translation according to IAS 21 as a net change for 
the year in other comprehensive income."
"This also includes an 
impact from the Lebanese business operations which were sold on 
3 July 2023."
"For the year ended 31 December 2023, the lease income for operating 
leases amounted to € 1,270 mn (2022: € 1,271 mn)."
"The Allianz Group leases out its investment properties (see 
note 7.2.1) under operating leases because they do not transfer 
substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to the ownership of 
the assets."
"Investment property comprises a number of commercial 
properties that are leased to third parties."
"For defined benefit 
plans, the beneficiary is granted a defined benefit by the employer or 
via an external entity."
"In contrast to defined contribution 
arrangements, the future cost to the employer of a defined benefit 
plan is not known with certainty in advance."
"The Allianz Group provides competitive and cost-effective  
retirement and disability benefits using risk-appropriate vehicles."
"The 
plans may vary from country to country due to the different legal, 
fiscal, and economic environments."
"Risks typically associated with defined benefit plans are biometric 
risks such as longevity, disability, and death, as well as economic risks 
such as interest rates, inflation, and compensation increases."
"New 
plans are primarily based on contributions and may include, in some 
cases, guarantees such as the preservation of contributions or 
minimum interest rates."
"Each of the pension plans in Germany, the U.K."
"and Switzerland 
contributes more than 5 % to the Allianz Group’s defined benefit  
obligation or its plan assets."
"As the Allianz Retirement and Death 
Benefits Fund in the U.K."
"Most active German employees participate in contribution- 
based plans using different vehicles to cover the base salary both 
below and above the German social security ceiling (GSSC)."
"Since 
1 January 2015, the Allianz Group contributes for new entrants and for 
the majority of contribution-based pension plan beneficiaries to the 
low-risk pension plan “My Allianz Pension”, where only contributions 
are 
preserved."
"For 
salaries 
above 
the 
GSSC, 
the 
Allianz Group decides each year whether and to which extent a 
budget for the contribution-based pension plans is provided."
"Independently of this decision, an additional risk premium is paid to 
cover death and disability."
"Generally the accruals of the contribution-
based pension plans are wholly funded, whereas the grandfathered 
plans are funded to a minor extent."
"On retirement, the accumulated 
capital is paid as a lump sum or converted to a lifetime annuity."
"Employees who joined Allianz before 1 January 2015 participate 
in the Allianz Versorgungskasse VVaG (AVK), financed through  
employee contributions, and the Allianz Pensionsverein e.V."
"(APV), 
which is financed by the employer."
"Both pension funds provide  
pension benefits for the base salary up to the GSSC, are wholly funded 
along local regulatory requirements, and were closed to new entrants, 
effective 31 December 2014."
"AVK and APV are legally separate 
administered pension funds with trustee boards being responsible for 
the investment of the assets and the risk management."
"AVK is subject 
to German insurance regulation."
"The assets of the contribution-based 
pension plans are allocated to a trust (Methusalem Trust e.V.) and 
managed by a board of trustees."
"For the AVK, the annual minimum 
interest rate guaranteed is 1.75 % – 3.50 %, depending on the date of 
joining the Allianz Group, and for the closed part of the contribution-
based pension plan it is 2.75 %."
"There is also a partly funded defined benefit pension plan for 
agents (“VertreterVersorgungsWerk, VVW”), which has been closed for 
new entrants since 31 December 2011."
"A part of the pension plan 
serves as a replacement for the compensatory claim of agents 
according to German Commercial Code (§ 89b)."
"VVW is similar to a 
final salary benefit plan."
"Pension increases apart from AVK and APV are guaranteed at 1 % 
p.a."
"Depending on legal requirements, some pension 
increases are linked to inflation."
"In AVK, the complete surplus share of 
the retirees is used to increase their pension."
"The period in which a retirement benefit can be drawn is usually 
between the ages of 60 and 67."
"Disability benefits are granted until 
retirement pension is paid."
"In the case of death under the previous 
plans, surviving dependents normally receive 60 % (widow/widower) 
and 20 % (per child) of the original employee’s pension, in total not to 
exceed 100 %."
"Under the “My Allianz Pension” plan, the surviving 
dependents receive the capital accrued."
"Additionally, the Allianz Group offers a deferred compensation 
program, “Pensionszusage durch Entgeltumwandlung (PZE)”, for 
active employees."
"Within some boundaries they convert at their 
discretion parts of their gross income and, in exchange, receive a 
pension commitment of equal value."
"PZE is qualified as a defined 
benefit plan with small risk exposure."
"2_As of 31 December 2023, € 5,335 mn (2022: € 4,934 mn) of the defined benefit obligation is wholly unfunded, while € 17,241 mn (2022: € 16,339 mn) is wholly or partly funded."

were immaterial."

Assumptions 
The assumptions for the actuarial computation of the defined benefit 
obligation and the recognized expenses depend on the circumstances 
in the country where the plan has been established."
"The calculations are based on current actuarially calculated 
mortality tables, projected turnover depending on age and length of 
service, and internal Allianz Group retirement projections."
"Although 
this represents the best estimate as of today, considering a further 
increase in life expectancy could be reasonable."
"The weighted 
average life expectancy of a currently 65-year-old female plan 
participant is about 89.3 (2022: 89.6) years, and of a currently 65-year- 
 
old male plan participant about 87.4 (2022: 86.9) years."
"An 
increase in life expectancy by one year would lead to an increase of 
the defined benefit obligation by € 519 mn (2022: € 493 mn)."
"The discount rate assumption is the most significant risk for the 
defined benefit obligation."
"It reflects market yields at the balance 
sheet date of high-quality fixed-income investments corresponding to 
the currency and duration of the liabilities."
"In the eurozone, the decision 
for the discount rate is based on AA-rated financial and corporate 
bonds, and a standardized cash flow profile for a mixed population."
"The range for the sensitivity calculations was derived by analyzing 
the average volatility over a five-year period."
"An increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points would lead to 
a decrease of € 1.0 bn (2022: € 1.0 bn) in the defined benefit 
obligation, whereas a decrease in the discount rate by 50 basis points 
would lead to an increase of € 1.2 bn (2022: 1.1 bn)."
"An increase of pre-retirement benefit assumptions (e.g., a salary 
increase) of 25 basis points would have an effect of € 42 mn (2022: 
€ 39 mn) on the defined benefit obligation."
"However, the increase of 
post-retirement assumptions (e.g., inflation-linked increases of pension 
payments) of 25 basis points would increase the defined benefit 
obligation by € 359 mn (2022: € 343 mn)."
"Based on the liability profiles of the defined benefit obligation and on 
the regulatory funding requirements, the Allianz Group uses stochastic 
asset liability models to optimize the asset allocation from a risk-return 
perspective."
"Due 
to 
a 
well-diversified 
portfolio 
of 
approximately 
132,000 (2022: 129,000) plan participants, no reasonable uncertainty 
is expected with regard to future cash flows that could affect the 
liquidity of the Allianz Group."
"2_Includes as of 31 December 2023 € 608 mn (2022: € 467 mn) in the United Kingdom due to buy-
ins."
3_Includes as of 31 December 2023 € (305) mn in the U.K.
"due to gilt repurchase agreements within 
the Fund's gilt portfolios."
"The loan leg of this structure, which is used to hedge the interest rate 
and inflation risk of the Fund's liabilities efficiently, is treated as a negative cash balance."
"The bulk of the plan assets are held by Allianz Versorgungskasse 
VVaG, Munich, which is not part of the Allianz Group."
"Plan assets do 
not include any real estate used by the Allianz Group, and include only 
€ 4.7 mn (2022: € 4.0 mn) of its own transferable financial instruments."
"In addition to the plan assets of € 14.4 bn (2022: € 13.7 bn), the 
Allianz Group has dedicated assets at Group level amounting to 
€ 8.7 bn as of 31 December 2023 (2022: € 7.1 bn), which are likewise 
managed according to Allianz ALM standards."

Defined contribution plans are funded through independent pension 
funds or similar organizations."
"Contributions fixed in advance (e.g., 
based on salary) are paid to these institutions and the beneficiary’s 
right to benefits exists against the pension fund."
"The employer has no 
obligation beyond payment of the contributions."
"During the year ended 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group 
recognized expenses for defined contribution plans of € 319 mn (2022: 
€ 345 mn)."
"Additionally, the Allianz Group paid contributions for state 
pension schemes of € 402 mn (2022: € 342 mn)."
"8.17 _ Share-based compensation 
plans 
The AEI plan is granted in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and 
is part of the variable compensation component for the plan 
beneficiaries."
"The RSU granted to a plan participant obligates the Allianz Group 
to pay in cash the ten-day average Xetra closing price of the Allianz SE 
share on the vesting day, or to convert one RSU into one Allianz SE 
share."
"The Allianz Group can choose the settlement method for each 
unit."
"The payout is capped at a 200 % share price growth above the 
grant price."
"The RSUs are subject to a contractual vesting period of four years 
and the payout per RSU is fixed on the last day of the contractual 
vesting period, which ends on the tenth trading day following the 
annual financial media conference in the year the respective AEI plan 
expires."
"In addition, upon the death of a plan participant, a change of 
control or notice for operational reasons, the RSUs vest immediately 
and are exercised by the company."
"The RSUs are virtual stocks without dividend payments and with 
a capped payout."
"The fair value is calculated by subtracting the net 
present value of expected future dividend payments until maturity, as 
well as the fair value of the cap from the prevailing share price as of 
the valuation date."
"The cap is valued as a European short call option, 
using prevailing market data as of the valuation date."
"1_For detailed information regarding the LTI plans and the remuneration policy for the members of the 
Allianz SE’s Board of Management, please see the Remuneration Report."
2_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.
"The RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans because the 
Allianz Group intends to settle in cash."
"Therefore, the Allianz Group 
accrues the fair value of the RSUs as compensation expenses over the 
IFRS vesting period."
"During the year ended 31 December 2023, the 
Allianz Group recognized compensation expenses related to the AEI 
plans of € 219 mn (2022: € 113 mn)."
"As of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recorded provisions of 
€ 415 mn (2022: € 326 mn) for these RSUs in other liabilities."
"Under the LTI plan, awards are granted in the form of index-linked 
restricted stock units (RSUs) which are part of the remuneration policy1 
for the members of Allianz SE’s Board of Management."
"The contractual vesting period ends on the tenth trading day 
following the annual financial media conference in the year the 
respective RSU award expires."
"The payout per RSU is subject to a 200 % 
share price cap relative to the share price at the grant date and a 200 % 
cap applied to the performance factor."
"In addition, there is a cap 
applicable to the total compensation including the LTI payout and 
various other compensation components."
"The fair value of the index-linked RSUs is calculated as the present 
value of the expected future payout, taking into account the link 
between share price performance and relative performance compared 
to the index, as well as the relevant caps and thresholds as defined in 
the payout formula."
"The expected future payout is determined on the 
basis of observable market data as of the valuation date and market 
standard simulation techniques."
2_The assumptions for RSU grants delivered in March 2024 are based on best estimate.
"The index-linked RSUs are accounted for as cash-settled plans 
because the Allianz Group settles in cash."
"Therefore, the Allianz Group 
accrues the fair value of the RSUs as compensation expenses over the 
IFRS vesting period."
"During the year ended 31 December 2023, the 
Allianz Group recognized compensation expenses related to the LTI 
plans of € 38 mn (2022: € 16 mn)."
"As of 31 December 2023, the Allianz Group recorded provisions of

"launched a management share-based payment 
incentive plan for certain senior-level executives and affiliates of 
PIMCO LLC."
"Participants in the plan are granted options to acquire an 
own class of equity instruments (M-units), which vest in one-third 
increments on approximately the third, fourth, and fifth anniversary of 
the option grant date."
"Upon vesting, options will automatically be 
exercised in a cashless transaction, provided they are in the money."
"Participants may elect to defer the receipt of M-units through the M-
unit Deferral Plan until termination of their service at the latest."
"With 
the M-unit Plan, participants can directly participate in PIMCO’s 
performance."
"Class M-units are non-voting common equity with 
limited information rights."
"They bear quarterly distributions equal to a 
pro-rata share of PIMCO’s net distributable income."
"Deferred M-units 
have a right to receive a quarterly cash compensation equal to and in 
lieu of quarterly dividend payments."
"A maximum of 250,000 M-units are authorized for issuance under 
the M-unit Plan."
"According to an amendment of the PIMCO LLC Class M-unit Plan, 
no new M-unit options will be issued after 14 March 2020."
"Already 
issued and outstanding M-unit options remain valid and continue as is."
"The fair value of the underlying M-unit options was measured 
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model."
"Volatility was derived in 
part by considering the average historical and implied volatility of a 
selected group of peers."
"The expected life of one granted option was 
calculated based on treating the three vesting tranches (one third in 
years 3, 4, and 5) as three separate awards."
"As of 31 December 2023, the M-unit options outstanding have an 
exercise price between € 13,140.81 and € 16,119.13, and a weighted-
average remaining contractual life of 0.87 years."
"The share options settled by delivery of PIMCO LLC shares are 
accounted for as equity-settled plans."
"Therefore, PIMCO LLC measures 
the total compensation expense to be recognized for the equity-
settled shares based on their fair value as of the grant date."
"The total

"The Allianz Group refrains from disclosure of participations which are 
not included in one of the above categories, as they are of minor 
importance for giving a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position, and profit or loss of the Allianz Group."
"In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not 
audited the content of those parts of the group management report 
listed in the “Other Information” section of our auditor’s report."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
− 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in 
all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the 
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to 
§ 315e Abs."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our 
audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance 
of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report."
"We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and 
the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as 
“EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally Accepted 
Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut 
der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are 
further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management 
Report“ section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the 
group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law 
and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled 
our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) 
point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not 
provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU 
Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have 
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinions on the consolidated financial statements, on the group 
management report and on the non-financial group statement 
included in the group management report."
"Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, 
were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these 
matters."
"Of this amount, liabilities of 
€ 680,654 million (69.2 % of the consolidated total assets) are 
relating to the life and health business segment."
"Within the life and 
health business segment, € 671,886 million of this is attributable to 
the liability, which is measured using the variable fee approach 
(VFA) or the general measurement model (GMM, also known as 
the building block approach)."
"Within the 
measurement of the liabilities, the present values of the estimated 
future cash flows in particular are affected by possible material 
uncertainties."
"This uncertainty stems in particular from the 
methods used and the actuarial assumptions determined in 
connection with interest rates, investment income, mortality, 
disability, longevity, costs and policyholder behaviour."
"② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected 
controls of the Group for selecting the valuation methods applied 
as well as for determining assumptions and making estimates for 
the measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts 
issued."
"With the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we 
have compared the valuation methods and key assumptions with 
generally recognised actuarial methods and industry standards 
and examined to what extent these are suitable for measuring the 
liabilities."
"One focus was the assessment of the cash flows used by 
the IT systems used as well as the appropriate derivation and use 
of assumptions for the measurement of selected liabilities."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy 
ourselves that the methods and assumptions used by the executive 
directors are appropriate overall for measuring certain technical 
liabilities."
"③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of certain 
liabilities from insurance contracts issued in life and health 
insurance are contained in sections “Accounting policies” and 
“Insurance operations” of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Of this amount, liabilities 
€ 96,339 million (9.8 % of the consolidated total assets) is 
attributable to the Property and Casualty Insurance business 
segment."
"Within the insurance contracts liabilities, € 79,148 million is 
attributable to ""Liability for incurred claims"" in the property and 
casualty insurance segment, which recognises the expectations 
regarding insurance claims that have been incurred but not yet 
settled."
"These represent the company's expectation of future 
payments for known and unknown claims as well as the 
associated expenses."
"The company uses various methods to 
estimate these obligations."
"In addition, the measurement of this 
liability requires a significant degree of judgement by the 
executive directors of the Company regarding assumptions to be 
made, such as the impact of changing inflation rates, loss 
developments and regulatory changes."
"In addition, there is a 
significant judgement of the executive directors regarding the 
determination of the discount rate for calculating the liability."
"In 
particular, product lines with a low claims frequency, high 
individual claims or long claims settlement periods are usually 
subject to increased estimation uncertainties."
"② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of selected 
controls of the Group for selecting actuarial methods as well as for 
determining assumptions and making estimates for the 
measurement of certain liabilities from insurance contracts issued 
in the property and casualty insurance."
"With the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, we 
have compared the respective actuarial methods and key 
assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods and 
industry standards and examined to what extent these are 
suitable for measuring the liabilities."
"Our audit also included an 
evaluation of the appropriateness and integrity of the data and 
assumptions, including the assessment of the executive directors 
regarding the impact of changing inflation rates, used in the 
valuation and a reconstruction of the claims settlement process."
"Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the liability for 
selected lines of product, in particular lines of product with large 
liability amounts or increased estimation uncertainties."
"For these 
lines of product, we compared the amounts calculated by us with 
the values determined by the Company for the liabilities and 
evaluated any differences."
"We also examined whether any 
adjustments to estimates in the loss reserves were adequately 
documented and substantiated."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy 
ourselves that the estimates and assumptions used by the 
executive directors are appropriate overall for measuring the 
technical liabilities in property and casualty insurance."
"③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of liabilities for 
outstanding claims in property and casualty insurance are 
contained in sections “Accounting policies” and on “Insurance 
operations” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"❸ Measurement of financial instruments using parameters not 
observable on the market and forward-looking information 
 
① Financial instruments of € 721,802 million (73.4 % of the 
consolidated total assets) are reported in the consolidated 
financial statements of the Company."
"Of these financial instruments, financial assets totalling 
€ 704,390 million are measured at fair value, of which in turn the 
fair values of € 220.967 million are calculated using valuation 
models or based on third-party value indicators."
"These financial 
instruments in particular relate to unlisted securities, other loans,

derivatives and investments in infrastructure, private equity and 
real estate."
"Of the financial instruments reported in the consolidated 
financial statements, financial assets in the amount of 
€ 8,829 million 
are 
measured 
at 
amortised 
cost 
and 
€ 562,693million at fair value through other comprehensive 
income."
"Forward-looking 
macroeconomic forecasts are also included in the model valuation 
to take account of impairments for expected credit losses."
"Model-measured financial instruments are subject to an 
increased measurement risk due to the reduced objectivity and the 
underlying judgements, estimates and assumptions made by the 
executive directors."
"② As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the controls for the valuation of model-measured 
financial instruments and financial instruments measured on the 
basis of third-party indicators."
"In addition, we assessed, among 
other things, the integrity of the underlying data and the process 
for determining the assumptions, estimates and forward-looking 
information used in the valuation."
"With the support of our internal valuation specialists, we also 
assessed the appropriateness of the methods applied by the 
executive directors to determine the fair values and the 
parameters used."
"We compared the methods and assumptions 
used to calculate valuation adjustments in the financial year with 
recognised practices and industry standards and examined the 
extent to which they are suitable for proper accounting."
"To assess 
the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based 
calculation of impairment for expected credit losses, we involved 
internal specialists with particular expertise in the field of credit risk 
modelling."
"We also evaluated the disclosures on valuation 
methods and judgements contained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"③ The company's disclosures on the measurement of financial 
instruments are contained in sections “Accounting policies” and 
“Investments” of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
The executive directors are responsible for the other information.
"The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, 
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of 
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs."
"1 HGB and that the 
consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these 
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position, and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive 
directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are 
responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis 
of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are 
subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which 
authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been 
published."
"Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their 
interpretations of such wording and terms in section ""EU Taxonomy 
Regulation"" of the non-financial group statement."
"The executive 
directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations."
"As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by 
regulators or courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is 
uncertain."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements, of the group management report as well as of 
the non-financial group statement included in the group management 
report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this 
group management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"− 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the 
executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by 
the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and in the group management report or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit 
opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence 
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to 
continue as a going concern."
"− 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the group management report."
"We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German 
law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"− 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the executive directors in the group management 
report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we 
evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the 
executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and 
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information 
from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit 
opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions 
used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future 
events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"− 
Evaluate the suitability of the criteria presented by the executive 
directors in the non-financial group statement as a whole."
"Those inherent uncertainties in the 
interpretation apply to our audit accordingly."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter."
