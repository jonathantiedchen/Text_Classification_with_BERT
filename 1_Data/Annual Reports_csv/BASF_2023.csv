Gabriela, 28, works in Technical Service at the site 
in São Paulo, Brazil."
"She is passionate about our 
customers."
"She works closely with them to  
develop innovative solutions tailored to their 
needs."
"As part of a project to produce more 
eco-friendly cleaning agents, she worked in a 
team on a preservative of natural origin – one of 
the few ingredients that has mainly been produced 
synthetically until now."
"The basis: terpenes  
extracted from orange peel."
"No other country  
produces more oranges than Brazil."
"The preservative Lutensit® EcoCitrus 
can be used in a variety of household cleaners 
and detergents to effectively counteract bacteria 
and fungi in an environmentally friendly way."
"By 
using recycled and renewable raw materials  
instead of fossil ones, Gabriela wants to contribute 
to more sustainability and environmental  
compatibility in the home care industry."

Rutger, 27, is an expert in carbon management at 
our Verbund site Antwerp, Belgium."
"Inspired by his 
grandfather, a chemistry professor, Rutger decided 
to become a chemical engineer."
"It all starts with 
chemistry."
Chemistry is the industry of industries.
"Rutger is convinced that a significant contribution 
to society and environmental protection can be 
made here, at the beginning of the value chain."
"As part of the team, he is working to reduce  
greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2 and  
nitrogen dioxide in production."
"Coordination  
between different production plants and supply 
units is crucial here – Rutger wants to reuse the 
energy that one plant releases as a resource  
elsewhere."
"These optimization measures help 
BASF to continuously reduce the carbon footprint 
and use resources efficiently."

principles: materiality, completeness, sustainability context, balance 
and stakeholder inclusion."
"In addition to this report, we publish further 
information online."
"The relevant links can be found at the end of each

"BASF’s Report addresses 
 
elements of the framework of the former International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC), which is now incorporated into the work of 
the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop 
internationally recognized standards for sustainability reporting."
"Our

"The year 2023 once again required enormous effort on our part, as 
 
the entire chemical industry is in upheaval."
"Our markets, our competitors and 
 
the needs of our customers are changing rapidly."
"The world is still experiencing 
geopolitical conflicts, weak economic growth and high interest rates due to 
 
ongoing inflation."
"In Europe, structurally higher energy price levels, extremely 
sluggish growth and overregulation are especially challenging for the 
 
competitiveness of local European producers."
"This difficult environment is 
 
demanding everything from us and is reflected in our figures."
"However, we accept these challenges."
"We are taking action to maintain our 
competitiveness, especially in Germany."
"We want to grow profitably worldwide 
and become climate-neutral."
We worked hard on this in 2023.
"I am convinced: 
We will succeed in all these areas because we are a strong company."
"We have 
the will to change and a concrete plan, which we are systematically implementing."
"And we will emerge even stronger from these tough times, just as we have done 
repeatedly over our 158-year history."
"Clear focus on strengthening competitiveness and profitability
BASF supplies products and services to around 78,000 customers from various 
sectors in almost every country in the world."
"We want to further strengthen these 
relationships and win new customers too."
"The operating environment has 
changed significantly in recent years for our Battery Materials, Coatings and 
 
Agricultural Solutions businesses."
"Our competitors in these sectors are making a 
more focused push into the market and are thus 
 
increasingly challenging us."
"At the same time, these 
business areas are not integrated so deeply into the 
BASF Verbund."
"That is why we will be giving them 
more space – so they can tailor their business models 
and processes more precisely to the needs of their 
customers and perform even more successfully on 
the market."
"Despite these changes, BASF remains an integrated company with a 
broad portfolio."
"Particularly in a year such as 2023, this structure proved its value 
once again."
"The Coatings and Agricultural Solutions divisions generated record 
earnings, which partly offset weak results in other segments."
"In Germany in particular, we are working systematically on our competitiveness 
and profitability."
"We are reducing our costs by adapting our production 
 
structures, among other measures."
"We acted promptly, but we must not let up."
"Given the extremely difficult market environment and structural challenges, we 
need targeted measures at our site in Ludwigshafen in particular to make it fit for 
the future."
"And we will continue to be under enormous pressure here owing to the 
weak demand compared with other regions, high energy prices and increasingly 
far-reaching regulatory requirements."
"This is why we are implementing changes 
where we need to."
We are altering where it makes us better.
"But we are also 
 
investing where we see opportunities."

Shareholders – Letter from the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors
Focus on future industries and growth markets
Our strategy is to produce locally for local markets."
"We want to be close to 
 
our customers, and we focus on innovation-driven growth areas."
"In 2023, we 
opened Europe’s first colocated center for battery material production and 
 
battery recycling in Schwarzheide, Germany."
"We are the first global producer of 
battery materials with production in all three core markets: Europe, the United 
States and Asia."
"In Geismar, Louisiana, the expansion of our MDI plant is 
 
well underway."
"This enables us to serve the growing demand from our 
 
North American customers in industries such as construction, automotive and 
furniture."
"And construction at our new Verbund site in 
Zhanjiang, China, is proceeding at an impressive pace 
on a site the size of 550 soccer fields."
"This project is 
fully on schedule and on budget."
"As we decided in 2018, we will be divesting the oil and 
gas business."
"At the end of 2023, BASF, LetterOne 
and Harbour Energy signed an advantageous 
­
agreement to combine the businesses of Wintershall 
Dea and Harbour Energy."
"It is planned to transfer the 
exploration and production business, excluding Russia-related activities, to the 
publicly listed firm Harbour Energy in the fourth quarter of 2024."
"Pioneer on the path to climate neutrality
By 2050, we aim to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions for our production (Scope 1) 
and our energy purchases (Scope 2)."
"Despite the difficult economic times, we are 
firmly committed to this ambitious goal."
"I am excited and proud to see how 
 
the entire BASF team is pulling together to make this a reality."
"We are changing 
how we produce."
"With new electrified technologies, such as the world’s first 
electrically heated steam cracker furnace, we are testing what is possible."
"We are 
transitioning our energy supply from grey to green."
"Whether through investments 
in wind farms, solar parks or green electricity contracts, we already meet 
 
20% of our electricity demand from renewable sources."
"By 2030, this proportion 
should rise to at least 60% worldwide – even though our demand for electricity is 
growing."
"We 
are 
getting 
ever 
closer 
to 
this 
target."
"We 
officially 
 
inaugurated the offshore wind farm Hollandse Kust Zuid in the Dutch North Sea 
 
in 2023."
"And we are 
 
already pursuing two other major wind farms: 
 
in the German North Sea and off the coast of 
 
Zhanjiang in China."
"Moreover, we have committed to reducing the 
­
greenhouse gas emissions from raw materials 
­
purchased from our suppliers."
"By 2030, we intend to 
reduce our specific Scope 3.1 emissions by 15% ­
compared with 2022."
"In the 
future, we want to source raw materials with a smaller carbon footprint than today’s 
level from our suppliers."
"Furthermore, we are steadily expanding our portfolio of low-emission products."
"As 
part of this, we are also advancing the circular economy."
"With loopamid®, BASF 
launched a solution for greater circularity in the textile industry in early 2024."
"Textile 
waste is recycled as a valuable raw material to produce polyamide 6."
"This idea 
strikes a chord with our customers: Fashion company Zara recently presented a 
jacket made entirely of recycled polyamide."
"All its components – from the fabrics 
and filling to the hook-and-loop fastener and zipper – are made of loopamid®, so 
the garment is also 100% recyclable."
"Framework conditions remain difficult
All these successes cannot hide the fact that 2023 was an economically tough year 
for BASF."
"We did not reach our targets or meet analyst estimates for sales and 
 
income from operations (EBIT) before special items."
"Our sales in 2023 amounted 
to €68.9 billion (2022: €87.3 billion), a decrease of around 21% versus the prior 
year."
"The downward sales trend was driven by significantly lower prices and 
volumes, while currency effects also had a dampening effect on sales."
"EBIT before 
special items declined to €3.8 billion (2022: €6.9 billion)."
"This year-on-year decline 
of nearly 45% resulted from lower margins due to decreased sales."
"These could 
not be offset by the reduction in fixed costs we achieved."
"“
I am excited to see how  
the entire BASF team  
is pulling together."
"“
We are altering where 
it makes us better and 
investing where we 
see opportunities."
"11

Yet, a glance at our figures also shows that we are working effectively on our cost 
base."
"We considerably reduced our inventory levels and achieved a strong cash 
flow from operating activities."
"BASF therefore continues to have a high equity 
ratio and a strong balance sheet."
"This is all good news for you, dear shareholders."
"It is our goal to increase our dividend per share 
each year, or at least maintain it at the previous 
year’s level."
"We will therefore propose a dividend 
of €3.40 per share, matching the prior-year level, 
to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in April 
2024."
"Based on the 2023 year-end share price 
of €48.78, the BASF share again offers a high 
dividend yield of 7.0%."
The framework conditions will remain difficult in 2024.
"We expect the subdued 
momentum in the global economy seen in 2023 to continue into the first half 
 
of 2024."
"Global economic growth will likely only pick up slightly as the year 
 
progresses."
"Positive change requires a team effort
For the chemical industry, Europe will continue to be the most challenging market 
due to its low growth and structurally higher energy prices compared with other 
regions."
"In addition, there are increasingly far-reaching regulatory requirements."
"BASF and large parts of our customer industries are drowning in this sea of red 
tape."
"We can successfully maintain and 
strengthen our industrial basis in Europe if there is widespread willingness to 
embrace change among society, business and policymakers."
"But this will also 
require a new regulatory framework."
"One that promotes innovations for climate 
protection, enables the international competitiveness of new processes and 
 
accelerates the expansion of renewable energies at competitive prices."
"We need 
an “Industrial Deal” to again foster more entrepreneurship, creativity and profitable 
growth for the chemical industry and our customer industries in Europe."
"At BASF, chemistry is our passion."
"At every site around the globe, our colleagues 
pursue this passion with dedication and creativity."
"They are rethinking chemistry 
every day, just like the three young employees shown 
on the cover of this report."
"I also joined BASF as a 
young person in 1988, and I have had the opportunity 
to help shape the development of our company in 
various roles – for the past six years as Chairman of 
the Board of Executive Directors."
"After 36 years at 
BASF, I will hand over the Chairmanship to Markus 
Kamieth following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 
on April 25, 2024."
"I am certain: The company is in great hands with him and the 
new Board team."
"I am honored to have spent my entire career devoting all my 
strength and passion to the prosperity and future of our BASF."
"I am proud of what 
we have changed and achieved together, in what were not easy times."
"From the 
bottom of my heart, I thank the entire BASF team for their drive, perseverance 
and motivation."
"And I thank you, dear shareholders, for your trust."

expectations of future interest rate cuts."
"BASF shares recovered in 
line with the overall market and closed the year at €48.78."
"Share 
performance in the course of the year was mainly attributable to the 
weakening of the economy, continued high inflation, higher interest

BASF ended its share buyback program on February 24, 2023, earlier 
than planned."
"This was done in line with the company’s priorities for 
the use of cash and in view of the profound changes in the global 
economy over the course of 2022."
"From January  11, 2022, until 
February 23, 2023, 25,956,530 own shares were repurchased; this 
corresponds to 2.8% of the share capital at the time the program was

"The purchase price for these own shares was around 
€1.4 billion."
"Originally, the share buyback program had been planned 
to reach a volume of up to €3 billion and to be completed by the end 
of December 2023 at the latest."
"Broad base of international shareholders
With over 900,000  shareholders, BASF is one of the largest

As a reaction to this, BASF announced concrete measures for a 
cost savings program in nonproduction units with a focus on Europe 
in February 2023."
"These measures include the systematic bundling 
of services in hubs, simplifying structures in divisional management, 
the rightsizing of service units, and increasing the efficiency of R&D 
activities."
"Taking into account new positions to be created, this is 
expected to result in a total reduction of 2,600 positions worldwide."
The cost savings program was launched in 2023.
"We expect annual 
cost savings in nonproduction areas to reach more than €600 million 
by the end of 2024 and more than €700 million by the end of 2026."
"These figures include measures related to Europe in the Global 
Business Services and Global Digital Services units."
"Additional 
measures in these two service units in other regions will probably 
contribute a further €200 million."
"In addition, in 2023, BASF took measures to adjust production 
structures at the Verbund site in Ludwigshafen, Germany."
"These 
adjustments include the shutdown of the caprolactam plant, the 
plants for cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and soda ash, one of the 
two ammonia plants and the fertilizer facility."
"In addition, the 
shutdown of the TDI plant and the precursor plants for dinitrotoluene 
and toluylenediamine was also announced."
"Furthermore, the 
production capacity of adipic acid will be reduced in Ludwigshafen, 
Germany."
"The following plant shutdowns have already been 
completed as of 2023: TDI plant, plant for TDI precursors, ammonia 
plant and the fertilizer facility."
"Further shutdowns will be implemented 
gradually until the end of 2026."
"These measures in production are 
expected to affect around 700 positions."
"BASF expects to reduce 
fixed costs in this way by more than €200 million per year."
"Together with the savings from the aforementioned cost savings 
program focusing on Europe, we expect total annual savings of 
around €1.1 billion from the end of 2026."
"Corporate legal structure
As the publicly listed parent company of the BASF Group, BASF SE 
takes a central position: Directly or indirectly, it holds the shares in 
the companies belonging to the BASF Group and is also one of the 
largest operating companies."

  Combined Management’s Report – Our Strategy
 
Humankind is facing enormous challenges in order to preserve a 
world worth living in for future generations."
"The climate is changing, 
natural resources are becoming scarcer, pressure on ecosystems is 
increasing and our growing world population needs to be fed."
"More 
and more urgently than ever, solutions are needed for a sustainable 
future."
Chemistry plays a key role here.
"In almost all areas of life, it 
can pave the way to greater sustainability and accelerate the 
 
transformation needed to achieve this."
"Our innovative products, 
solutions and technologies help to improve quality of life and protect 
the environment as well as the climate."
"We achieve this by using raw 
materials more efficiently, reducing waste and enabling the 
 
production of healthy and affordable food as well as climate-smart 
mobility."
"At the same time, BASF is also undergoing profound changes."
"We 
are transforming our company and breaking new ground to increase 
our profitability and achieve climate neutrality."
"We are facing up to 
the challenge of making this change socially just."
"This involves 
managing long-term policy decisions like the European Green Deal, 
overcoming the consequences of current geopolitical conflicts and 
driving forward digitalization."

Chemistry is our passion."
"We make use of this passion for our customers: We want to offer them the best possible solutions and 
help them achieve their sustainability goals."
"With our products and technologies, our innovative and entrepreneurial spirit and the 
power of our Verbund integration, we want to grow profitably and, at the same time, create value for society and the environment."
"This is our goal, which is embedded in our corporate purpose: We create chemistry for a sustainable future."
"All of 
this requires a clear vision, responsible action as well as a high 
 
degree of creativity and flexibility."
We want to grow profitably and sustainably.
"We are investing in growth markets, particularly in 
Asia, with China as the largest and most important growth driver of 
global chemical production."
"Furthermore, we are undergoing a 
 
fundamental transformation in the way we steer our company."
"As 
part of our Differentiated Steering concept, we are implementing 
new financial steering indicators tailored to each business."
"Our 
 
operating divisions are also continuing to adapt their specific 
 
business models and processes – supported by customized 
 
process structures, IT systems and governance frameworks (see 
page 37 onward)."
"To further embed sustainability in our business activities, we are 
driving innovations for a sustainable future, focusing our portfolio 
on growth areas and developing products with a lower carbon 
footprint."
We are pioneers in climate-neutral production.
"The success of these measures depends primarily on the ideas and 
commitment of our employees."
"This is why we want to create an 
environment in which they can thrive and contribute to BASF’s 
 
long-term success."
"Moreover, the diverse potential of digitalization 
used in our processes and business models further contributes to 
the successful implementation of these measures."
"We have set ourselves ambitious 
 
milestones on this path: By 2030, we want to reduce Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions by 25% compared with 2018 – while growing 
production volumes in parallel."
"Compared with 1990, this translates 
into a reduction of around 60%."
"We are developing emission-free and 
low-emission production processes, building on lower-emission 
steam generation and improving the energy and process efficiency 
of our plants (carbon abatement)."
"We are also increasingly using 
renewable, recycled and CO2-based raw materials in order to close 
material cycles (circularity)."
"To reduce our raw materials-related 
emissions, we are working with our suppliers."
"We want to help shape the transformation towards climate neutrality 
in a socially just way (just transition)."
"This requires a political and 
 
regulatory environment that promotes innovation in climate 
 
protection, makes it possible to develop new processes that are 
Material topics in focus:
“ 
Our priorities are clear:  
Growing profitably and  
making BASF climate-neutral."
"Our electricity requirements from 
renewable sources will increase significantly due to new, lower- 
emission production processes."
"To meet this demand, we are 
 
investing in our own power assets (wind farms and solar power 
plants) and are increasingly buying green electricity on the market 
(make & buy approach)."
"We are also addressing the question of how 
climate change affects our sites and implementing climate resilience 
measures (see page 113)."

In 2023, BASF commissioned a new supercomputer in 
 
Ludwigshafen, 
Germany."
"Quriosity 
is 
the 
world’s 
largest 
 
supercomputer used in industrial chemical research."
"It replaces the 
supercomputer that has been deployed since 2017."
"With 
 
three petaflops of computing power, the new supercomputer is 
 
considerably more powerful than its 1.75-petaflops predecessor."
"As 
the complexity of research projects is increasing, we have 
 
expanded our computing capacities accordingly."
"In the personal care business area, for example, the 
 
supercomputer’s complex simulations help employees to precisely 
predict which cosmetic ingredients harmonize optimally together 
to achieve the desired effect."
"At an early stage in the development 
of crop protection products, the supercomputer uses molecular 
 
modeling to quickly identify suitable compounds that are effective 
and environmentally sound."
"However, the supercomputer is also 
used in projects outside of research and development, for 
 
example, to optimize plant components in production operations."

"To achieve our climate protection goals, we 
are relying on the use of renewable energy, taking targeted 
 
measures to avoid CO2 emissions, working to close material cycles 
and working together with our suppliers to reduce emissions in the 
supply chain (see page 29)."
"We are focusing our product portfolio even more strongly on 
 
resource efficiency, climate change and energy as well as circular 
economy in order to meet the increasing sustainability requirements of 
our customers with innovative solutions and to comply with 
 
regulatory requirements."
"That is why we have updated our 
 
Sustainable Solution Steering (TripleS) methodology for steering the 
product portfolio based on sustainability criteria (see page 48)."
"We 
applied the new methodology for the first time in the 2023 
 
financial year and developed a new key performance indicator, 
 
“Sustainable-Future Solutions” sales, which indicates the share of our 
products with a particular contribution to sustainability in the 
 
relevant sales."
"In addition, a digital solution enables us to calculate the 
carbon footprint of our approximately 45,000 sales products – from 
raw materials extraction to the factory gate (“cradle-to-gate”)."
"This 
enables us to create transparency around the carbon intensity of our 
products and optimize our processes on this basis: We are 
 
increasingly using low-emission and renewable raw materials and are 
continuously expanding our product portfolio with a lower 
 
carbon footprint."

"We plan to invest €19.5 billion worldwide between 2024 
and 2027 to expand our capacities based on market demand and 
to further increase the availability, efficiency and flexibility of our 
plants."
"In particular, we want to benefit from the strong growth of the 
chemical market in Asia (see “Portfolio”)."
"Our global production 
footprint contributes to the regional diversification of our sales and 
earnings distribution, making it part of our risk management."
"It helps 
us to compensate for economic weaknesses and a lack of growth 
prospects in individual markets within the BASF Group."
"This 
currently applies to Europe and especially Germany, where high

Digitalization
We want to leverage the diverse growth potential of digitalization, 
seize the associated opportunities to the benefit of our customers and 
strengthen our competitiveness."
"To achieve this, we promote digital 
skills among our employees, cooperate with partners and make 
 
digital technologies and ways of working an integral part of our 
business."
"Digitalizing our plants and systematically analyzing data enables us 
to further automate processes."
"In this way, we steer the capacity, 
availability and efficiency of our plants in line with market conditions, 
for example, by simulating value streams within our Verbund 
 
structure or through predictive maintenance."
"Linking data from 
 
different sources and using artificial intelligence (AI) opens up 
 
numerous opportunities for us to manage our business more 
 
efficiently and improve our processes, for example, in logistics."

Agricultural Solutions 
In the Agricultural Solutions segment, we are working to achieve the 
balance between economic, environmental and social value creation 
for a sustainable and efficient agricultural sector."
"While natural 
resources are limited, the demand for food, feed, fiber and energy is 
increasing, given the constant growth of the world’s population.1 
Accordingly, even more efficient farming is essential."
"Balanced 
 
agriculture is a key enabler in producing enough healthy, affordable 
food and responding to changing consumer behavior while reducing 
the impact on the environment."
"As one of the world’s leading agricultural solutions companies, we 
are making a positive impact on sustainably transforming agriculture 
and food systems."
"Our innovation-driven strategy for agriculture 
 
focuses on selected crops and their appropriate cultivation systems: 
soy, corn (maize) and cotton in the Americas; wheat, canola (oilseed 
rape) and sunflower in North America and Europe; rice in Asia; and 
fruit and vegetables globally."
"We integrate sustainability criteria into 
all business and portfolio decisions."
"In doing so, we help farmers 
achieve better yields, protect the planet and produce economically."
"We leverage our expertise in research and development and our 
deep understanding of the way individual growers manage their

"For the safe use of our products, we offer 
support in the following areas: access to tools and services, 
protective equipment, customized training, digital solutions and 
new and future-oriented application technologies such as 
 
drones."
"In line with our 
strategic targets, we aimed to achieve a ROCE considerably above 
the cost of capital percentage every year."
"With ROCE, the same 
data was used for our value-based management, external 
 
communication with the capital markets and variable compensation."
"We are also pursuing the target of reducing our greenhouse gas 
emissions."
"Therefore, CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)¹ are defined 
as a steering-relevant indicator, and we report on them as the most 
important nonfinancial key performance indicator."
"By 2030, we want 
to reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% 
 
compared with the 2018 baseline."
"Further development of the steering concept as of 2024
To increase the value creation of the individual operating divisions, 
we are introducing a Differentiated Steering concept, which we will 
report on at segment level."
"Key criteria in the selection of specific 
steering indicators are the respective strategic direction of the 
 
business, the role of the business in BASF’s portfolio and the 
 
contribution of the business to achieve corporate targets."
"We are 
focusing on industry-specific value drivers, which enables us to 
better integrate market conditions into our management and 
strengthen our business operations."
"We will also benchmark our 
performance even more closely against that of our competitors."
"This is why we have further developed our financial steering concept 
for the financial years from 2024 onward."
"Here, we will differentiate 
between short-term and medium-term steering more clearly than 
before."
"Short-term influencing factors, such as the 
 
development of earnings or current operating assets, can be better 
controlled directly via earnings or cash flow figures."
"Return on capital employed remains a medium-term key financial 
target for the BASF Group."
"We use ROCE to emphasize the 
 
importance of managing our return on capital employed over time."
"Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions remain the most important non- 
financial key performance indicator at Group level."
"We see 
 
sustainability as a decisive factor for our long-term business 
 
success."
"The differentiated approach to steering the operating business units 
takes into account the different business models of the segments."
"The key figure is 
 
therefore particularly suitable for indicating the profitability of a 
 
business and for comparisons with businesses in similar sectors."
"Our Steering Concept
We have firmly anchored our goal of growing profitably and creating value for society in our strategy."
"Both financial and nonfinancial key figures are an 
integral part of our steering concept."
"Until the end of 2023, return on capital employed (ROCE) and CO2 emissions were our most important key 
performance indicators."
"From 2024 onward, we will pursue a Differentiated Steering concept."
"Industry-specific key performance indicators tailored to 
the respective business will enable us to increase the competitiveness of our business units and thus the profitability of the BASF Group."
"We use EBITDA 
before special items and free cash flow as the new most important key performance indicators for short and medium-term steering."
"ROCE will continue 
to play a central role as a medium-term strategic steering indicator."

BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Our Steering Concept
The success of the Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care 
 
segments primarily depends on the generation of new and 
 
profitable business."
"Therefore, the most effective measure of their 
performance is a combination of sales growth and margin."
"Accordingly, the EBITDA margin before special items is the link to 
the BASF Group’s key performance indicator."
"To manage cash flow at segment level, we use a specific key figure, 
segment cash flow, which includes the elements of free cash flow 
that can be managed by the operating divisions."
"This key 
 
performance indicator is relevant in all segments."
"Value-based management throughout the company
The target agreement process is an important part of our value- 
based management."
"It aligns individual employee targets with 
BASF’s targets."
"The most important financial indicator in the 
 
operating business has so far been ROCE."
"The other units’ 
 
contribution to value is also assessed according to effectiveness 
and efficiency on the basis of quality and cost targets."
"To assess 
this, we use metrics such as BASF’s internal service score in the 
service units."
"We are gradually adapting the target agreement process to the 
 
Differentiated Steering concept."
"From 2024 onward, variable 
 
compensation for senior executives in all business units and the 
Service, Research and Corporate Center units will be based on 
 
targets derived from the new key performance indicators for the 
 
steering of the respective business unit or the BASF Group."
"EBIT before special 
items is used to steer profitability at Group and segment level."
"Capital expenditures are used to manage capital employed in the 
BASF  Group."
"These comprise additions to property, plant and 
equipment excluding additions from acquisitions, IT investments, 
restoration obligations and right-of-use assets arising from leases."
"Furthermore, we have been commenting on and forecasting sales at 
Group and segment level so far in our financial reporting as a 
 
significant driver for EBIT before special items and our most 
 
important key performance indicator, ROCE."
"In line with the new steering concept, in future financial reporting, we 
will comment on and forecast the most important key performance 
indicators EBITDA before special items and free cash flow for the 
BASF Group and EBITDA before special items and segment cash 
flow for the segments."
"We will continue to forecast capital 
 
expenditures on property, plant and equipment1 as a key factor for 
free cash flow."
"In addition, we will continue to analyze and comment on sales at 
Group and segment level, but we will not forecast them."
"To calculate the EBIT of the segments, we take the BASF Group’s 
EBIT and deduct the EBIT of activities recognized under Other, 
which are not allocated to the divisions."
"The cost of capital basis is calculated using the month-end figures 
and consists of the operating assets of the segments."
"Operating 
assets comprise the current and noncurrent asset items of the 
segments."
"They include property, plant and equipment as well as 
intangible fixed assets, integral investments accounted for using the 
equity method, inventories, trade accounts receivable, miscellaneous 
assets generated by core business activities and, if applicable, the 
assets of disposal groups."
"The cost of capital basis also includes 
customer and supplier financing."
"We have integrated the cost of capital percentage into our ROCE 
target as a comparative figure."
"This is determined using the 
 
weighted cost of capital from equity and borrowing costs (weighted 
average cost of capital)."
"To calculate a pretax figure similar to EBIT, 
the cost of capital is adjusted using the projected tax rate for the 
BASF Group for the business year."
"In addition, the projected net 
expense of Other is already provided for by an adjustment to the 
cost of capital percentage."
"The cost of equity is ascertained using 
the capital asset pricing model."
"Borrowing costs are determined 
based on the financing costs of the BASF Group."
"The cost of capital 
percentage for 2024 is 10% (2023: 9%)."
"Direct emissions from the generation 
of energy for third parties are not considered here."
"Relevant 
emissions include other greenhouse gases according to the 
 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 
equivalents."
"This is adjusted for special items 
that may arise from the integration of acquired businesses, from 
 
restructuring measures, gains or losses resulting from divestitures 
and sales of shareholdings, and other expenses and income that 
arise outside of ordinary business activities."
"The EBITDA margin 
before special items is calculated as the ratio of EBITDA before 
special items to sales revenue."
"This relative indicator enables 
operational performance to be compared independently of the size 
of the underlying business."
"Calculation of free cash flow and segment cash flow
Segment cash flow measures the cash inflow and outflow of a 
 
segment and thus the contribution to the BASF Group’s free cash 
flow."
"The BASF Group’s free cash flow additionally includes trans-
actions that are not allocated to operations as well as 
 
adjustments of other noncash effects."
"Free cash flow is the cash 
flows from operating activities less payments made for property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets."
"That is why we 
 
pursue ambitious targets along our entire value chain."
"We 
report transparently on target achievement so that our 
 
stakeholders can track our progress."
"In addition to these financial targets, we have set ourselves broad 
sustainability targets."
"We want to considerably reduce our CO2 
emissions in the coming years."
"In addition to the targets for reducing 
our emissions from production (Scope 1) and the purchase of 
 
energy (Scope 2),1 we set ourselves a new target for our purchase 
of raw materials (Scope 3.1)2 in 2023."
"We have also added 
 
Scope 3.1 emissions to our net-zero target for greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2050 (see page 29)."
"As part of this target, we are 
working to strengthen sustainability in our supply chains and use 
resources more responsibly."
"We want to align our product portfolio even more strongly with 
 
climate protection and the circular economy."
"To achieve this, we 
have further updated the methodology used to assess our product 
portfolio against defined sustainability criteria and defined a new 
target figure for products with a particular contribution to 
 
sustainability (see page 48)."
"We want to further improve safety in production and since 2023 we 
have been reporting according to a new system that focuses on

Most important KPIs
BASF sets itself ambitious targets along the value chain."
"Two key 
figures were of particular importance for 2023:
	
– Return on capital employed (ROCE)
	
– Absolute CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)
These most important key performance indicators (KPIs) were 
the main indicators used to steer the BASF Group up to and 
 
including 2023."
"We also use ROCE for employee incentivization, 
while the achievement of targets for reducing CO2 emissions 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) influences the compensation of members 
of the Board of Executive Directors and senior executives."

our growth targets and our ambitious climate targets."
"To achieve our climate targets, we are also making targeted  
investments in modern and more sustainable technologies and processes."
"Our growth projects play a central role, particularly the 
new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, which we are planning from the outset as a pioneer for sustainability."
"We are continuously  
optimizing our portfolio through targeted acquisitions and divestitures."
"1	 Additions to property, plant and equipment excluding acquisitions, restoration obligations, IT investments and right-of-use assets arising from leases
2	 Major growth projects are the construction of our future Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China, as well as our battery materials activities."
"We continued to drive forward our growth projects in 2023 and 
 
further expand our position in our three key regions: Asia Pacific, 
North America and Europe."
"The Asia Pacific region and China in 
particular, which already has a significant influence on the growth of 
the global chemicals market with a share of around 50%, will 
 
continue to play a key role here."
"To serve the increasing needs of 
various growth industries in this region, we are continuously 
 
expanding our market position in China."
"One example of this is the 
construction of our new integrated Verbund site in Zhanjiang (see 
pages 43 and 44)."
"In North America, among other things, we have 
been further expanding our production capacities in the isocyanates

"In Europe, the opening of the first 
 
colocated battery materials and recycling center at the 
 
Schwarzheide site in Germany was a milestone on our way to further 
expanding our position in this area (see page 44)."
"In addition, we want to refine our portfolio through smaller, bolt-on 
acquisitions that promise above-average profitable growth and help 
to expand our market position in a targeted manner."
"A key 
 
consideration is that these acquisitions are innovative, offer a 
 
technological differentiation, or make new, sustainable business 
models possible."
"Investments in the segments and regions

Acquisitions
We did not make any major acquisitions in the 2023 business year."
"Divestitures
The divestiture of BASF’s nickel-based catalysts production site in 
De Meern, Netherlands, to IQatalyst  B.V., a subsidiary of ASC   
Investment  Sarl, Luxembourg, which had been announced in 
July 2022, was closed on August 31, 2023."
"BASF had decided to 
divest the site and the related Fischer-Tropsch and FOCAT1 portfolio 
to increase the efficiency of its global chemical catalysts production 
network."
"The site was part of BASF’s Catalysts division until the 
completion of the divestiture process."
"The transaction mainly 
 
covered production plants, including the associated infrastructure 
and inventories, as well as the transfer of the employees working at 
the site."
"For more information on this divestiture, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements from 
page 240 onward
Agreed transactions
On December 21, 2023, BASF, LetterOne and Harbour Energy plc 
(Harbour) signed an agreement to combine the businesses of 
 
Wintershall Dea and Harbour."
"In exchange, at 
 
closing, the shareholders of Wintershall Dea will receive total cash 
consideration of $2.15 billion (BASF share: $1.56 billion) and new 
shares to be issued by Harbour equating to a total shareholding in 
the enlarged Harbour of 54.5% (BASF share: 39.6%)."
"Until the completion of the transaction, which is, among other things, 
subject to antitrust approvals and further official approvals for foreign 
investments in various countries, among other things, Wintershall 
Dea and Harbour will continue to operate as independent companies."
"Subject to these regulatory approvals, closing is targeted for the 
fourth quarter of 2024."
"Wintershall Dea is accounted for as a non-integral shareholding 
using the equity method."
"To do this, we 
use renewable raw materials and recycled raw material sources."
"At 
the same time, we are developing products and technologies to 
help our customers close loops, create value for society and protect 
the environment."
"BASF’s Verbund structure presents numerous opportunities for a 
circular economy: By intelligently networking our plants, we can use 
by-products from one plant elsewhere as feedstocks or an energy 
source, thereby using resources efficiently (see pages 102 and 110)."
"We are also focusing our raw material base even more strongly on 
nonfossil circular alternatives."
"We procure these raw materials 
 
responsibly in order to minimize negative environmental impacts 
 
(for example, biodiversity loss) (see page 121 onward)."
"Currently, less than 10% of the approximately 350  million metric 
tons1 of plastic waste generated worldwide each year is currently 
recycled, yet the global demand for circular feedstocks is rising."
"Material topics in focus:
“ 
At BASF, embracing the circular 
economy means not just rethinking 
materials and production processes, 
but also our role in the value chain."
"Talke Schaffrannek
Circular Economy
This page:
At the beginning of 2024, Zara launched a jacket that is made 
entirely from recycled polyamide, from the fabric and lining to the 
hook-and-loop fastener and zipper."
"Thanks to BASF’s loopamid® 
solution, the garment is not only made from 100% recycled textile 
waste, it is also 100% recyclable."
"The plastics in our product portfolio are mainly used in durable and 
demanding applications, such as automotive engineering and 
 
insulation foams."
"As a responsible player in the value chain, we are 
working to further improve the sustainable use of plastics throughout 
the entire life cycle."
"That’s why we are developing and marketing 
solutions for improved mechanical recycling."
"Where this is not 
 
possible, we are driving forward the chemical recycling of plastics as 
a complementary technology to expand our supply base: Plastics 
are broken down into their building blocks, which can then be used 
in production as recycled feedstocks."
"To do this, we are developing 
suitable recycling processes, often with partners (see page 124)."
"In 
a challenging environment with limited availability of alternative raw 
materials, we still aim to process 250,000 metric tons of recycled 
and waste-based raw materials, such as pyrolysis oil from mixed 
plastic waste or end-of-life tires, in our production plants annually 
from 2025."
"Many of BASF’s products and technologies are already helping to 
close loops at many points along the value chain."
"Together with our 
customers and other stakeholders, we want to further accelerate the 
transformation from linear to circular business models."
"Our 
 
target: By 2030, we want to double our sales of solutions for the 
 
circular economy to €17 billion (baseline: 2020)."
"As the sustainable 
properties of our products have been reassessed since 2023 using 
the updated TripleS method (see page 48), this target will be adjusted 
in the course of 2024."
"Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency GRI

As the world’s population grows, so does demand for limited natural resources."
"At the same time, many recyclable 
materials end up in landfill or in waste incineration."
"Using resources responsibly and closing loops are crucial for our 
business and achieving our climate targets."

Lifecycle of plastic waste worldwide in 2019 (infographic).
"The 
alternative raw materials are attributed to the end product, partly 
using what is known as the mass balance approach."
"This is 
verified and certified by independent third parties (see box on 
page 124)."
"We use this approach for example for selected 
ingredients for the automotive, cosmetics, detergent, cleaner and 
food industries (see page 122)."
"Other examples are products to 
which pyrolysis oil from the chemical recycling of plastic waste 
can be attributed via the mass balance approach (Ccycled® 
products, see page 125), or products that contain mechanically 
recycled raw materials (Mcycled®)."
"– Products that close material cycles (“close the loop”): 
 
These include products that enable and improve the recyclability 
of valuable resources."
"Our first focus area here is the value chain 
for plastics."
"For example, multilayer packaging produced with our 
water-based Epotal® adhesives can be easily separated into its 
individual recyclable materials during recycling, which can then be 
reused."
"We have expanded our ecovio® plastic portfolio and now 
also offer home-compostable food packaging."
"The second focus 
is recycling mineral raw materials."
"For example, we are driving 
forward innovative technologies and solutions for recovering 
metals such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese from end-
of-life lithium-ion batteries (see page 125)."
"– Products that increase the resource efficiency or lifespan of 
materials (“extend the loop”): These include products that 
 
reduce resource consumption and environmental impact along the 
value chain."
"One example is Oxsilan®, an innovative thin-film 
technology for protecting metals from corrosion, for example, 
 
before painting."
"The process not only enables higher productivity 
with lower material use, but also offers a favorable safety, health 
and 
environmental 
profile 
compared 
with 
conventional 
 
phosphating processes."
"This category also includes products that 
extend service life and/or reduce maintenance intervals."
Tinuvin® light stabilizers are one example of this.
"They extend the 
lifespan of products such as agricultural films by providing reliable 
protection against UV radiation, heat and agrochemicals."
"One of the steps we have taken to meet our targets and accelerate 
the transformation is establishing a company-wide Circular Economy 
Program."
"We also 
cooperate with partners along the value chain and are involved in 
numerous networks, such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the Global 
Battery Alliance and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste."
"In doing so, 
we want to better understand needs, trends and growth 
 
opportunities and contribute to the development of standards."
"At the 
beginning of 2024, BASF brought an innovative and sustainable solution 
to the market to boost circularity in the textile industry: loopamid®."
"Using 
a new chemical recycling process, textile waste made of polyamide 6 
(nylon 6) are first converted into monomers in a process called 
depolymerization and then purified."
"The resulting monomers are then 
converted back into pure polyamide 6 (PA6) through polymerization."
"This 
recycled PA6, loopamid®, serves as the raw material for completely new 
clothing in a circular production model."
"BASF is thus offering a solution to close the loop for polyamide 6 in 
clothing exclusively with textile waste, which can be reused as a valuable 
feedstock, thereby reducing the consumption of fossil raw materials, for 
example."
"loopamid® ensures that textiles remain in their own cycle and 
garments containing PA6 can be recycled without restrictions."
"We want to 
inspire the industry to focus on sustainable textile production and 
introduce new business models that close loops in textile manufacturing."
"To this end, we work closely with our partners along the value chain."
"Our 
opportunities and risk management systematically records effects, 
opportunities and risks arising from our business activities for 
 
sustainability topics and how these impact our businesses in a 
positive or negative way."
"Decisions regarding investments, 
 
acquisitions and divestitures are made while taking comprehensive 
assessments of sustainability impacts into account."
"The entire 
Board of Executive Directors is responsible for sustainability topics, 
which should be driven forward by all employees."
"Therefore, BASF’s 
senior executives’ long-term variable compensation is also based 
on the achievement of our targets for reducing CO2 emissions."
"We pursue a holistic sustainability approach that covers the entire 
value chain – from our suppliers and our own activities to our 
 
customers – and contributes to environmental, social and 
 
governance key sustainability topics (ESG, see page 100 onward)."
"We have formulated commitments for our conduct and underpinned 
these with corresponding targets and measures (see page 41)."
"Based on our corporate strategy, we steer the global sustainability 
target for climate protection for 2030 via the most important key 
performance indicator (KPI) absolute CO2 emissions¹ (see page 40)."
"To this end, we have strengthened the necessary steering 
 
mechanisms and control systems at Group level, for example with 
internal reviews."
"Our transition plan to reduce greenhouse gas 
 
emissions includes the use of renewable energy, measures to avoid 
CO2 emissions and circular economy solutions (see page 102)."
"In 
addition to our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050,² we 
are pursuing further targets for a more sustainable portfolio, for 
 
responsible procurement, resource-efficient and safe production, 
 
engaged employees and diversity."
"Measuring sustainable value added 
We are aware that our business activities can have both positive and 
negative impacts on the environment and society."
"We aim to 
 
increase our positive contributions and minimize the negative 
 
impacts of our business activities."
"To achieve this, we need to 
 
measure how our actions and our products affect the environment 
and society."
"We want to offer our customers innovative products and solutions 
that support their sustainability goals."
"Our business units are 
 
therefore in close contact with our customers in order to better 
understand their sustainability needs and offer tailored BASF 
 
solutions."
"The insights from this dialog are considered in the 
 
implementation of research projects and in innovation processes."
"A significant steering tool for the product portfolio, based on the 
sustainability performance of our products, is TripleS."
"In 2022, we 
updated this method in order to further steer our product portfolio to 
transformation topics such as climate change and energy, resource 
efficiency and circular economy."
"With this update we have integrated 
the TripleS evaluation even more deeply into the assessment of our 
R&D development processes, also considering the requirements 
formulated within the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework by 
the E.U."
"Within the scope of the further development 
of our method, in 2023 we began to reassess the products in the 
relevant portfolio3 with regard to their applications and regional 
aspects."
"As a result, we categorize our product portfolio into five 
segments, taking sustainability-related aspects into account: 
Pioneer, Contributor, Standard, Monitored and Challenged (see 
graphic)."
The reassessment will be completed in 2024.
"We will take 
regulatory changes into account if they have a material impact on 
our portfolio and therefore also on our segmentation."
"The allocations 
by segment and sales are therefore provisional."
"Our Sustainability Concept

Greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e).
"The allocation to the segments is provisional, as the reassessment of our 
portfolios has not yet been completed."
"The new KPI sales of Sustainable-Future Solutions summarizes 
the total sales of Pioneer and Contributor products."
"Products 
allocated to these segments make a positive sustainability 
contribution in the value chain."
"For example, polyurethane catalysts, 
which reduce energy consumption and material use, and high-
performance insulation materials, which save energy for end users."
"In line with our corporate strategy, we have set ourselves the target 
of making sustainability an even greater part of our innovative power."
"By 2030, more than 50% of BASF’s sales relevant to TripleS1 are to 
be attributable to Sustainable-Future Solutions (2023: 41.4%)."
"With 
TripleS, we are steering our product portfolio and our research and 
development units toward sustainable solutions."
"According to our 
updated methodology, in 2023, around €1  billion of our annual 
expenditure on research and development contributed to potential 
Sustainable-Future Solutions."
"If, during the reassessment of our portfolio, we identify products 
with sustainability concerns, we classify them either as “Monitored,” 
or in case of significant concerns, as “Challenged,” as we did in the 
past."
"A description of possible measures is mandatory for both 
 
categories."
"In the case of Challenged products, we develop our own 
action plans."
"These include research projects and reformulations to 
optimize products or replacing the product with an alternative."
"To 
systematically align our portfolio with contributions to sustainability, 
we are generally phasing out all Challenged products within five 
years of their initial classification."
"Of BASF’s €68.9 billion in sales in 2023, €55.5 billion is relevant for 
the TripleS evaluation."
"We have analyzed €52.8 billion of this as part 
of TripleS by the end of 2023.2 The relevant portfolio comprises 
BASF  Group’s sales from sales products to third parties in the 
 
business year concerned."
"This excludes business that is not 
 
product-related, such as licenses or services."

"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – especially SDG 2 (Zero 
hunger), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 6 (Clean water and 
 
sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (Decent 
work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption 
and production) and SDG 13 (Climate action)."
"To prioritize the SDGs 
relevant to BASF, in 2023, internal experts once again assessed the 
 
impacts and positive contributions of our products, our corporate 
targets and strategic action areas."
"In 2023, we updated our materiality analysis from 2022."
"The 
 
results do not only set the framework for reporting, but also help us 
to better understand the complex and sometimes diverging 
 
requirements and expectations that our stakeholders have of us and 
to define strategically relevant topics for our long-term business 
success."
"As part of the update in 2023, we reviewed whether new 
topics had been identified or the topics from the previous year had 
significantly changed in priority."
"We used a big data tool to review 
the relevance of sustainability topics for various stakeholder groups."
"We also included the expertise of external stakeholders, with whom 
we are in constant contact, and of employees in this review."
"A sustainability aspect is considered material in the sense of double 
materiality if it has been classified as having both impact materiality 
and financial materiality."
"To assess impact materiality, both actual 
and potential positive and negative impacts of our company’s 
 
activities were considered along the value chain."
"To this end, the 
scale, scope and likelihood of occurrence of these impacts were 
assessed."
"For the analysis of financial materiality the topics were 
classified based on their potential financial impacts on BASF."
"At the 
 
beginning of 2024, we will review the methodology of our materiality 
analysis again to ensure that it meets the requirements of the 
 
European Sustainability Reporting Standards, for example, in terms 
of double materiality."

Accelerator unit plays a key role in achieving our climate protection 
targets by accelerating and implementing projects related to 
low-emission production technologies, circular economy and 
 
renewable energy."
"The Corporate Finance unit reports to the Chief 
Financial Officer, while the other two units report to the Chairman 
of the Board of Executive Directors."
"Sustainability topics are discussed and managed by the Board of 
Executive Directors."
"When making its decisions, the Board of 
 
Executive Directors considers the results and recommendations 
from sustainability evaluations of business processes."
"It makes 
 
decisions with strategic relevance for the Group and monitors the 
implementation of strategic plans and target achievement."
"The 
 
Supervisory Board is regularly briefed on the development of 
 
individual sustainability topics by the Board of Executive Directors."
"The Chief Human Rights Officer is responsible for further embedding 
human rights aspects in decision-making processes."
"He reports 
 
directly to the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors (see 
page 154)."
"We systematically evaluate sustainability criteria, including the 
 
effects of climate change, as an integral part of decisions on 
 
investments, acquisitions and divestitures in property, plant and 
equipment and financial assets."
"In this way, we not only assess 
 
economic dimensions, but also the potential impacts on areas such 
as the environment, human rights or the local community."
"We 
 
evaluate both the potential impacts of our activities here as well as 
how we are affected."
"If we identify potential negative impacts, for example, in planned 
 
investments, these are presented transparently in the internal 
 
decision-making process together with possible mitigation 
 
measures."
"In our Sustainable Finance Roundtable, experts from departments 
such as Finance, Corporate Strategy, Investor Relations and 
 
Communications discuss new legal or capital market-driven 
 
requirements."
"The interdisciplinary group analyzes the steadily 
growing requirements, assesses the impacts on BASF and drives 
forward the necessary change processes as well as the concrete 
implementation of measures."
"The Sustainability Reporting and Controlling Committee is the 
 
central decision-making body for questions relating to internal and 
external reporting and the controlling of sustainability topics."
"This 
committee of managers from the relevant Corporate Center and 
operating units facilitates rapid decisions to ensure that external and 
internal requirements for sustainability-related information and data 
are met immediately and in the best possible way."
"Parts of our business 
 
activities, such as the use of certain new technologies or our 
 
environmental impacts, are often viewed by stakeholders with a 
critical eye."
"We take questions from our stakeholders seriously, 
 
initiate dialogs and participate in discussions (see page 140 
 
onward)."
"Our stakeholders include customers, employees, 
 
investors, suppliers, the communities surrounding our sites, and 
 
representatives from industry, academia, politics and society."
"We are in ongoing exchange through a variety of formats of our 
strategic stakeholder engagement."
"We are involved in networks, lobbying groups and associations in 
order to jointly promote sustainability topics."
"In our own independent 
exchange formats, we discuss our contribution to a socially just 
 
climate transformation (just transition) with representatives from 
business, science, politics and civil society."
"For example, we 
discussed solutions and challenges on the path to climate neutrality 
with our stakeholders at the BASF Sustainability Lab in 2023."
"In-depth, context-related discussions take place in topic-specific 
committees such as the Human Rights Advisory Council and the 
Nature Advisory Council."
"We promote continuous exchange between local residents and our 
site management with community advisory panels."
"We also involve 
key stakeholders in the decision-making process about future 
 
investments at an early stage in order to work together on viable 
solutions."

business and impacts that our activities may have as well as 
the measures we take."
"The 
 
knowledge and skills of our highly qualified employees is our most 
valuable resource and the source of our innovative strength."
"In 
2023, approximately 10,000 employees worldwide were working in 
research and development (R&D)."
"Our research and development expenses amounted to 
€2,130 million in 2023 (2022: €2,298 million)."
"R&D activities in our 
operating divisions, which are mainly application and customer-
related, accounted for 83% of this figure."

"Global industrial production rose 
by 1.4% (2022: +2.9%)."
"Global chemical production rose by 1.7% 
(2022: +2.1%), albeit with marked variation between different 
regions."
"While chemical production grew by 7.5% in China, it shrank 
by 3.9% in the rest of the world."
"The average price for a barrel of Brent crude oil remained 
 
considerably below the prior-year level at $82 per barrel 
 
(2022: $101 per barrel)."
"The annual average gas price in 
 
Northwestern Europe was €40.52 per MWh ($12.83 per mmBtu), 
around two-thirds below the prior-year level, but still more than 
twice as high as the average annual price for 2015 to 2020 and 
more than five times as high as in the United States."
"Trends in the global economy in 2023
Macroeconomic development in 2023 was dampened overall."
"However, there was significant regional variation."
"While gross 
 
domestic product growth in the United States accelerated 
 
considerably in the third quarter after a moderate first half of the 
year, gross domestic product in the European Union (E.U.) largely 
stagnated."
"In the United States, private demand was supported by 
the depletion of savings, rising employment and growing wages."
"Despite solid labor markets, consumers in the E.U."
"were reluctant to 
spend in view of the rise in electricity and gas prices and the 
 
uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine."
"Economic development in 
Asia was mixed."
"In China, a dynamic start to the year in the first 
quarter was followed by weak growth in the rest of the year."
"Domestic demand in China remained subdued due to the economic 
uncertainty surrounding the real estate crisis and exports suffered 
 
as a result of the weakness of the global economy."
"In Japan, the 
economy picked up temporarily due to the weaker exchange 
 
rate, growing private consumption and high demand for cars 
 
domestically and abroad."
"In our customer industries, existing order backlogs continued to 
 
be processed after the disruptions in the supply chains had largely 
receded."
"This catch-up effect led to high growth rates, particularly in 
the automotive industry, which had previously been affected by 
significant supply problems."
"In contrast, demand for consumer 
goods such as furniture and consumer electronics fell considerably 
following the boom in demand during the coronavirus lockdowns."
"In 
the construction industry, the sharp rise in interest rates in many 
countries was increasingly reflected in falling demand."
"Economic Environment 
1 
Global economic growth in 2023 was weighed down in many countries by high inflation and rising interest 
rates."
"Due to both front-loading and catch-up effects from the coronavirus pandemic, demand for goods 
increased much slower than demand for services."
"Industrial production and demand for chemicals were 
therefore extremely weak."
"For the outlook on the economic environment in 2024, see page 167 onward
1	 All information relating to past years in this section can deviate from the previous year’s report due to statistic revisions."
"Where available, calendar-adjusted macroeconomic growth rates are reported."
Figures for 2023 not yet available in full are estimated.
"The oil price in particular was supported on the 
supply side by several production cuts by the OPEC+ countries."
"As in 
 
the previous year, there were considerable differences between the 
traditional tourist destination countries and the economies that are 
more oriented toward industry and goods exports."
"While GDP in 
Spain increased by more than 2%, France and Italy only achieved 
GDP growth of less than 1%."
"Conversely, in Germany, gross domestic product decreased 
 
slightly by 0.1% after adjustment for calendar variations."
"Private 
consumption fell due to the high inflation rate and the resulting 
 
decline in the purchasing power of private households."
"In contrast 
 
to the other major E.U."
"countries, government spending also fell 
considerably, due to the absence of pandemic-related extra 
 
spending."
"The weak global economy was ultimately reflected in a 
decline in exports, although this was also offset by a sharper decline 
in imports."
"Foreign trade therefore made a positive contribution to 
the growth of the German economy overall."
"Due to the decline in 
 
production in the energy-intensive industries and in the construction 
industry, German industrial production declined by around 1%."
Growth in the Eastern E.U.
"countries also slowed significantly 
(2023: +0.5%, 2022: +4.2%)."
"Although consumer price inflation 
decreased slightly compared with the previous year, at around 11% 
it was considerably higher than in Western E.U."
"In addition to the loss of purchasing power, these countries 
were particularly affected by the weakness of the manufacturing 
sector due to their above-average industrial share."
"In the United Kingdom, GDP only grew weakly, by 0.5% 
 
(2022: +4.3%), as private consumption only increased slightly 
against the backdrop of high inflation rates and as rising interest 
rates increasingly restricted the spending flexibility of private 
households."
"In the United States, economic performance was considerably 
better than we had expected at the beginning of the year."
"At 2.5%, 
GDP grew more strongly in 2023 than in the previous year (+1.9%)."
"Growth was mainly driven by private services consumption and a 
demand for motor vehicles and leisure goods."
"Private households 
continued to deplete the savings they had accumulated during the 
coronavirus pandemic."
"Industrial construction, which benefited 
 
from government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, also 
contributed to growth."
"Conversely, production in the manufacturing 
industry declined slightly by 0.5%."
"In 2023, the economy in China recovered only hesitantly from the 
coronavirus-related restrictions in 2022."
"After low growth in 2022 
(+3.0%), the growth target of 5% was achieved."
"However, domestic 
demand for goods grew only modestly and goods exports were weak 
due to the ailing global economy."
"The crisis in the housing sector 
continued despite government support measures, and youth 
 
unemployment remained high."
"Against this backdrop, Chinese 
 
consumers were particularly reluctant to spend on consumer 
 
durables."
"In most of the other emerging markets of Asia, particularly India 
(2023: +6.5%, 2022: +7.3%) and Indonesia (2023: +5.1%, 
 
2022: +5.3%), growth remained at a high level against the backdrop 
of solid domestic demand."
"At 4.7%, the entire country group grew 
at a slower rate than in the previous year (+5.7%)."
"In Japan, 
 
gross domestic product grew at an above-average rate of 
 
1.8% (2022: +0.9%) due to a weak yen, declining imports and 
 
rising automotive exports, increasing investments and a moderate 
rise in private consumption."
"In South Korea, however, growth 
 
was weaker than in the previous year due to weak export demand 
from China and low demand for information technology goods 
(2023: +1.4%, 2022: +2.6%)."
"In South America, growth in Brazil (2023: +3.0%, 2022: +3.0%) was 
supported by high production growth in agriculture."
"In Argentina, 
economic development declined in an environment of very high 
 
inflation rates and a rapidly falling currency (2023: -1.7%, 
 
2022: +5.0%)."
"All in all, the countries in the region grew by 1.4% in 
2023, considerably slower than in the previous year (2022: +3.7%)."
"Trends in key customer industries
Global demand for goods grew only weakly in 2023."
"The high 
 
inflation rates in many countries reduced private purchasing power 
and dampened growth in consumption overall."
"Demand for 
 
consumer durables continued to decline as consumers had 
front-loaded purchases during the coronavirus lockdowns."
"Rising 
interest rates and the high level of economic uncertainty also 
 
reduced companies’ willingness to invest."
"However, catch-up 
 
effects led to high rates of growth in the automotive industry."
"Global industrial production expanded by only 1.4% overall in 2023 
(2022: +2.9%)."
"Industrial production in the advanced economies 
 
declined by 0.4% (2022: +1.6%); in the emerging markets, by 
 
contrast, industrial production grew by 2.8% (2022: +3.9%)."
"In the 
E.U., industrial production declined by 1.7%; in North America, it

only rose by 0.9%, while in Asia it grew by 2.9% overall."
"Despite the 
weak economy in China, the growth in global industrial value 
 
creation came almost exclusively from there (total global growth 
contribution +1.4 percentage points, 1.3 percentage points of which 
came from China)."
"The E.U.’s global contribution was negative at 
around -0.2  percentage points."
"All the other regions only 
 
contributed little to global industrial growth overall."
"Global automotive production grew dynamically by 9.4% or 
7.7 million units in 2023 to a total production of 90.1 million passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles (2022: +6.7%, 82.3 million units), 
thus reaching the pre-coronavirus pandemic level again."
"High growth 
was achieved in all regions."
"At 12.5%, growth was highest in the 
E.U.; in North America (+9.5%) and Asia (+9.0%), rates of growth 
were somewhat slower."
"In terms of unit sales, growth was highest in 
Asia, the world’s largest vehicle market with 51 million units."
"A total 
of 4.3  million more vehicles were produced, thereof almost 
 
2.5  million in China and 1.1  million in Japan."
"However, absolute 
growth was also very high in the E.U."
"and North America, with 
around 1.6 million and 1.4 million vehicles respectively."
"Growth in the production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) was 
significantly higher than that of the market as a whole: A total of 
2.3 million more BEVs were produced; this corresponds to growth in 
this segment of around 28% compared with the previous year."
"Consequently, electric vehicles’ share of all vehicles produced rose 
from around 10% in 2022 to around 12% in 2023."
"The real estate crisis in China had a 
 
substantial impact on global growth in residential construction, as 
Chinese residential construction accounts for around a quarter of 
the global residential construction market."
"While residential 
 
construction in all major economic areas contracted by around 
 
3.5% overall on the basis of partially estimated figures, moderate 
growth continued to be recorded in the construction of other 
 
buildings (+2.9%)."
"Growth in industrial construction was particularly 
high in the United States, which benefited from subsidy offers for the 
semiconductor industry."
"Infrastructure construction continued to 
expand dynamically worldwide (+6.8%)."
"However, the global 
 
construction industry expanded by only 1.8% overall in 2023 
 
(2022: +2.6%)."
"In the consumer goods industry, production stagnated in 2023 
(-0.1%) after growing by 2.9% in the previous year."
"In the furniture 
industry, production declined by more than 6%, while it declined 
 
by just under 3% in the textile industry."
"By contrast, the production 
of chemicals for the manufacture of care products grew moderately 
by around 2%."
"The electronics industry only grew slightly (2023: +0.8%, 2022: 
+4.9%)."
"Production fell in communication electronics, while it 
stagnated in electronic components, computers and peripheral 
devices overall and there was a moderate increase in classic 
entertainment and other electronics."
"The energy and raw materials sector expanded by around 0.9% in 
2023 (2022: +3.6%)."
Oil and gas production stagnated overall.
"Oil 
production cuts by the OPEC+ countries were more than offset by 
higher production in North America, resulting in a slight increase in 
oil supply overall."
"The production of liquid gas also increased 
 
slightly, while Russian gas exports via pipeline fell significantly."
"The 
low production growth in industry and the warm weather reduced 
demand for gas."
"The weak global industrial economy was also 
 
reflected in only slight production growth in other industrial 
 
non-energy raw materials."
"Production in health and nutrition almost stagnated in 2023, at 
 
0.7% (2022: +2.7%)."
"In the pharmaceutical industry, production 
stagnated as well: Growth in the E.U."
"and North America was offset 
by a decline in Asia."
"Production in the food industry declined in 
 
the E.U."
"and in North America against the backdrop of high food 
inflation rates."
"Conversely, production rose moderately in Asia."
"At 3.1%, agriculture grew more strongly than in the previous year 
(+1.9%)."
"While production in Asia saw growth of 3.5%, growth in 
North and South America accelerated following the long periods of 
drought in 2022, from -1.6% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023."
"Agricultural 
production in Eastern Europe also grew again by nearly 4% 
 
following the war-related decline of 1.2% in the previous year."
"58

Trends in the chemical industry
Global growth in the chemical industry was very weak overall in 
2023 (2023: +1.7%, 2022: +2.1%), but varied greatly from region to 
region."
"While the chemical industry in China grew dynamically by 
7.5%1 on the basis of official figures, it shrank by 3.9% in the rest of 
the world as a whole."
Production losses were especially severe in the E.U.
"Following a 
decline of 5.2% in 2022, production recorded a further decline of 
7.6% in 2023."
"In Germany, production fell even more sharply by 
9.7% (after -12.1% in 2022)."
"These sharp declines primarily reflect 
base effects from the previous year."
"In view of the overall weak 
 
demand for industrial goods, the correspondingly low demand for 
intermediate inputs from the chemical industry and ongoing import 
pressure from China, production in the E.U."
"and Germany remained 
largely at the low level reached in the fourth quarter of 2022."
"The 
decline in production in the second half of 2022 due to energy costs 
could not be compensated for in this weak environment."
"In addition, 
gas prices in Northwestern Europe remained high by international 
standards, even though they had dropped below pre-Ukraine war 
levels by 2023."
"In the United Kingdom, chemical production decreased by 
 
8.4% (2022: -4.5%)."
"Despite low energy prices internationally, chemical production in the 
United States also essentially trended sideways over the course of 
the year and closed the year with a decline in production of 1.0% 
(2022: +2.2%)."
"One major reason for the weak development was 
the low domestic demand for equipment for private households and 
from the construction industry."
"In contrast, chemical production in Asia expanded by 4.6%."
"This 
varied widely by country."
"In China, the world’s largest chemical 
market, production expanded by 7.5% (2022: +6.6%).1 In India, 
production largely stagnated."
"Conversely, Japan (-6.6%), South 
Korea (-10.0%) and Taiwan (-10.5%) recorded sharp declines in 
production."
Chemical production in the Middle East also decreased by 1.5%.
Almost all countries in the region recorded negative growth rates.
"At 7.7%, Turkey saw the sharpest decline."

Price trends for key commodities
Demand for oil increased by 2% in 2023, remaining slightly below 
the growth rate of global GDP
."
"The main driver of the additional 
 
demand was China, which accounted for almost half of the 
 
growth in demand."
"Demand from the transportation sector 
 
increased sharply after the end of the zero-COVID policy."
"Furthermore, Chinese oil reserves increased considerably compared 
with the previous year."
"There were contrasting developments on the supply side of the 
 
oil market: While the OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia in 
particular, reduced their production in order to stabilize the oil price 
in the weak economic environment, production in the United States 
increased considerably."
"Despite the sanctions against Russia, the 
Russian oil supply remained largely unchanged."
"As a result, the oil 
price fell from $101 per barrel of Brent crude in 2022 to $82 per 
barrel in 2023."
"The price of oil fluctuated over the course of the year 
between $75 per barrel in June and $94 per barrel in September."
"Over the course of the year, the average monthly price for the 
 
chemical raw material naphtha ranged between $550 per metric ton 
in June and $719 per metric ton in February."
"At $643 per metric ton, 
the annualized average price of naphtha in 2023 was around 16% 
lower than in 2022 ($770 per metric ton)."
"At the same time, 
 
the infrastructure for the supply of liquid gas was expanded in 
 
Northwestern Europe."
"Gas storage levels were therefore above their 
respective seasonal long-term averages throughout the year."
"The average gas price in Northwestern Europe in 2023 was 
 
€40.52 per MWh ($12.83  per mmBtu)."
"In the previous year, it 
 
averaged €124.16 per MWh ($38.01 per mmBtu) due to the abrupt 
interruption in pipeline supplies from Russia."
"Fluctuations in the 
price of gas were also considerably lower than in the previous 
 
year."
"The average price of gas in the United States was $2.54 per mmBtu, 
likewise considerably below the prior-year level ($6.36 per mmBtu)."
"Gas prices in China averaged around $12.77 per mmBtu nationally 
(2022: $12.21 per mmBtu)."

Continued high inflation and higher interest rates as well as 
increasing geopolitical tensions led to economic uncertainty 
and dampened demand in many sectors."
"As a result, the 
global economy as well as global industrial and chemical 
production grew in part at a considerably more moderate 
pace than in the previous year."
"In this market environment, 
BASF’s business also largely fell short of expectations: Sales, 
EBIT before special items and ROCE declined considerably 
overall compared with the 2022 business year."
"By contrast, the 
Agricultural Solutions and Surface Technologies segments 
increased their EBIT before special items considerably and 
slightly, respectively, in this challenging market environment."
"This 
sales development was mainly driven by considerably lower prices 
and volumes."
"Lower raw materials prices in particular led to lower 
prices in almost all segments."
"Considerable price increases in the 
 
Agricultural Solutions segment were unable to compensate for this."
"Sales volumes fell significantly in all segments as a result of weak 
demand from many of our customer industries."
"Currency effects, 
mainly relating to the Chinese renminbi, also weighed down sales 
performance."
"Portfolio effects, mainly in the Industrial Solutions 
segment and especially due to the sale of the kaolin minerals 
 
business as of September 30, 2022, also had a negative impact on 
sales."
"EBIT before special items decreased in 
the Chemicals segment, primarily due to lower margins and 
 
volumes, as well as lower contributions from shareholdings 
 
accounted for using the equity method."
"Earnings were lower in 
 
the Materials segment, largely as a result of lower polyamide and 
ammonia margins."
"The Nutrition  & Care and Industrial Solutions 
segments’ EBIT before special items was considerably lower than 
the prior-year figure, mainly as a result of lower volumes and 
 
margins."
"Conversely, the Agricultural Solutions segment strongly 
increased EBIT before special items, primarily as a result of price 
increases and a one-time payment that was received."
"The slight 
earnings growth in Surface Technologies was attributable to the 
considerably higher EBIT before special items in the Coatings 
division due to price and volume increases, which more than 
compensated for the significant decline in earnings of the Catalysts 
division."
"EBIT before special items attributable to Other improved 
considerably, mainly as a result of higher income from other 
businesses and lower corporate research costs."

a   EBIT before special items for 2019 has been restated to reflect the reclassification of income from non-integral 
companies accounted for using the equity method to net income from shareholdings."
"Special items1 in EBIT amounted to -€1,566  million in 2023 
 
compared with -€330 million in the previous year."
"Special expenses 
resulted in particular from other charges due to impairments totaling 
around €1.1 billion."
"These comprised impairments on property, plant 
and equipment in the Surface Technologies segment, especially in the 
battery materials business, on plants in the Agricultural Solutions 
segment, and on tangible and intangible assets in the Materials 
 
segment."
"Special charges from divestitures amounted to €59 million 
after a special income of €174 million in 2022."
"Integration costs of 
€17 million resulted mainly from the integration of the BASF Shanshan 
companies acquired in 2021."
"1	 Special items may arise from the integration of acquired businesses, from restructuring measures, gains or losses resulting from divestitures and sales of shareholdings, impairments and other expenses and income that arise outside of ordinary business activities."
"This figure includes 
income from integral companies accounted for using the equity 
method, which declined by €194 million to €192 million."
"This decline 
was mainly attributable to the €175  million lower earnings 
 
contribution by BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, China."

"We use the indicator return on capital employed (ROCE) to 
 
measure our rate of return."
"Wintershall Dea’s earnings contribution 
in 2023 amounted to -€130 million and included special items of 
-€164 million for impairments and reversals of impairments as well 
as for provisions as part of the planned adjustment of the corporate 
structure."
"Compared with the previous year, the €202 million decrease in the 
financial result was partly due to the €105 million lower interest 
result."
"Higher interest expenses for financial indebtedness, primarily 
as a result of higher interest rates, were only partially offset by higher 
interest income."
"In addition, the other financial result decreased by 
€97 million, mainly due to higher net expenses in connection with 
bonds in foreign currency and related hedging instruments."
"Overall, income before income taxes amounted to €1,420 million in 
2023, after €1,190 million in the previous year."
"Income tax expenses 
were €1,041 million (2022: €1,581 million)."
"The tax rate of 73.3% was 
mainly due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets on loss 
carryforwards as well as their nonrecognition, particularly in Germany."
"The decrease in noncontrolling interests by €82  million to 
€154  million primarily resulted from lower earnings contributions 
from the BASF Shanshan companies in China."
Net income was €225 million compared with -€627 million in 2022.
Earnings per share amounted to €0.25 (2022: -€0.70).
"Investors, analysts and rating agencies use them to 
assess our performance."
These are not defined by IFRS.
"As such, 
the methods of calculation can differ from those used by other 
companies."
"Alternative performance measures for the results of 
operations are EBIT before special items, EBITDA before special 
items, EBITDA, the EBITDA margin before special items and 
 
adjusted earnings per share."
"Other APMs are net debt,1 free cash 
flow1 and capital expenditures (capex).2
From the 2024 reporting year onward, we will use EBITDA before 
special items and free cash flow as the new most important key 
performance indicators for short and medium-term steering of the 
BASF Group."
"A detailed explanation of how these key performance 
indicators are calculated can be found in “Our Steering Concept” 
from page 37 onward."
"EBITDA before special items in 2023 was €3,092 million below the 
2022 figure at €7,671 million; EBITDA decreased by €3,568 million to 
€7,180  million."
"The EBITDA margin before special items was 
11.1% in 2023 compared with 12.3% in the previous year."
"b   Due to the share buyback program terminated in February 2023, the weighted average number of  
outstanding shares in the 2023 business year was 892,640,562 and 901,754,219 in the 2022 business year."
"Compared with earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share is 
firstly adjusted for special items."
"Amortization, impairments and 
 
reversals of impairments on intangible assets are then eliminated."
"Amortization of intangible assets primarily results from the purchase 
price allocation following acquisitions and is therefore of a temporary 
nature."
"The effects of these adjustments on income taxes and on 
noncontrolling interests are also considered."
"This makes adjusted 
earnings per share a suitable measure for making comparisons over 
time and predicting future profitability."
"In 2023, adjusted earnings per share amounted to €2.78 compared 
with €6.96 in the previous year."

"Lower current assets 
were the main reason for the decline."
"Noncurrent assets declined by €1,127  million compared with 
 
December 31, 2022, to €45,923 million."
"The decrease of intangible 
assets amounted to €1,056 million and was mainly attributable to 
amortization of €612  million and impairments of €267  million."
Currency effects of €291  million also contributed to the decline.
Additions of €142 million had an offsetting effect.
"Property, plant and equipment increased by €1,113 million, mainly 
due to additions of €5,864 million, particularly in connection with the 
construction of our Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China."
"Depreciation 
amounted to €4,062  million and included impairments of 
 
€883  million."
"A currency effect of €555  million counteracted the 
 
increase in property, plant and equipment."
"Compared with the end of the previous year, the carrying amounts 
of integral investments accounted for using the equity method 
 
declined by €302 million to €2,054 million."
"This resulted primarily 
from a lower carrying amount of BASF-YPC Company Ltd., Nanjing, 
China, due to dividend payments and currency effects."
"The €263  million decrease in deferred tax assets largely resulted 
from valuation allowances on deferred taxes in Germany."
"Noncurrent other receivables and miscellaneous assets amounted to 
€1,339 million, €471 million below the figure of December 31, 2022, 
which was mainly attributable to lower defined benefit assets."
"Due to our active working capital management, current assets 
decreased by €5,950 million compared with December 31, 2022, in 
particular as a result of the reduction in inventories by €2,152 million."
"All segments contributed to this, in particular Materials, 
 
Nutrition & Care and Chemicals."
"We reduced trade accounts receivable by €1,641 million compared 
with the previous year, primarily in the Surface Technologies, 
 
Materials and Nutrition & Care segments."
"Other current receivables and miscellaneous assets were 
€2,087  million below the prior-year figure, which was mainly 
 
attributable to lower precious metal trading items and lower tax 
 
refund claims."
"The value of marketable securities decreased by €179  million 
 
compared with December  31, 2022, while cash and cash 
 
equivalents increased by €109 million to €2,624 million."
"Retained earnings were €2,937  million 
 
below the figure as of December 31, 2022."
"This resulted from the 
dividends paid to the shareholders of BASF SE for 2022, which 
amounted to €3,035  million, while the net income amounted to 
€225  million."
"Other comprehensive income decreased by 
€1,349  million, in particular as a result of currency effects and 
 
actuarial losses."
"At 47.3%, the equity ratio was slightly below the prior-year level 
(48.4%)."
"Noncurrent liabilities increased by €1,769 million compared with 
the 2022 year-end."
"This was mainly attributable to the €1,914 million 
increase in noncurrent financial indebtedness."
"The increase 
 
primarily resulted from the issue of three eurobonds with a nominal 
value totaling €1.5 billion and the taking up of loans amounting to 
around €1.8 billion."
"The reclassification of a 500 million eurobond 
and two loans totaling €760  million from noncurrent to current 
 
financial indebtedness as well as exchange rates and interest had 
an offsetting effect."
"The €133 million increase in other noncurrent liabilities compared 
with the prior-year figure largely resulted from higher lease liabilities."
"The rise in obligations due to 
lower discount rates in all relevant currency zones was 
 
largely offset by the return on plan assets and lower defined benefit 
assets."
Tax and other provisions were almost on prior-year level.
"Current liabilities decreased by €4,569 million to €15,871 million 
compared with December  31, 2022, largely as a result of the 
considerable decrease in trade accounts payable by €1,693 million 
and current financial indebtedness by €1,662 million."
"The decrease 
in financial indebtedness was mainly due to the scheduled 
repayment of a U.S."
"dollar bond and a eurobond as well as a GBP 
bond with an aggregate carrying amount of about €2.1  billion."
"Furthermore, commercial paper at BASF SE were reduced by 
around €650 million."
"This was partially offset by the aforementioned 
reclassifications of a bond and two loans."
"Current provisions were €584  million below the prior-year figure, 
largely as a result of lower provisions for bonus payments."
"Slightly 
higher provisions for rebates had an offsetting effect."
"Other liabilities declined by €437 million year on year, mainly due to 
lower advance payments received and lower negative fair values of 
derivatives."
Tax liabilities decreased by €194 million.
"Net debt amounted to €16,590 million on December 31, 2023, and 
was therefore almost on a level with the prior year-end."
"In addition, obligations exist 
in connection with initiated or planned investment projects 
 
(2023: €11,064 million), primarily in connection with the construction 
of the new BASF Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China."
"We preferably meet our external financing needs on the 
 
international capital markets."
"BASF continues to strive for a solid A rating, which ensures 
 
unrestricted access to financial and capital markets."
"Our financing 
measures are aligned with our operational business planning as well 
as the company’s strategic direction and also ensure the financial 
flexibility to take advantage of strategic options."

"Moody’s rating of 
 
A3/P-2/outlook stable from September  4, 2023, also remained 
 
unchanged."
"Standard & Poor’s adjusted its rating of A/A-1/outlook 
negative to A-/A-2/outlook stable on August 2, 2023."
"We have solid financing, both for ongoing business and for 
 
investment projects initiated or planned."
"Corporate bonds form the 
basis of our medium to long-term debt financing."
"These are issued 
in euros and other currencies with different maturities as part of our 
€20 billion debt issuance program."
"The goal is to create a balanced 
maturity profile, diversify our financing and optimize our debt capital 
financing conditions."
"For short-term financing, we use BASF SE’s global commercial 
 
paper program, which has an issuing volume of up to $12.5 billion."
"As of December 31, 2023, no commercial paper were outstanding 
under this program."
"A firmly committed, syndicated credit line of 
€6 billion with a term until 2026 covers the repayment of outstanding 
commercial paper."
"It can also be used for general company 
purposes."
This credit line was not used at any point in 2023.
"In 2023, BASF Integrated Site (Guangdong) Co."
"Ltd., China, signed 
a syndicated bank term loan facility totaling 40  billion Chinese 
 
renminbi with a maturity of 15 years for the construction of the 
Verbund site in Zhanjiang."
"Of this amount, 1 billion Chinese renminbi 
(€127 million) was utilized as of December 31, 2023."
"Our external 
financing is largely independent of short-term fluctuations in the 
credit markets."
"To 
minimize risks and leverage internal optimization potential within the 
Group, we bundle the financing, financial investments and foreign 
currency hedging of BASF SE’s subsidiaries within the BASF Group 
where possible."
"Foreign currency risks are primarily hedged 
 
centrally using derivative financial instruments in the market."
"Our interest risk management generally pursues the goal of reducing 
interest expenses for the BASF  Group and limiting interest risks."
"Interest rate hedging transactions are therefore conducted with 
banks in order to turn selected liabilities to the capital market from 
fixed to variable interest rates or vice versa."
"The improvement 
was primarily due to cash inflow from net working capital."
"Net 
income increased by €852  million year on year to €225  million."
"Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets were €740  million above the prior-year figure, in 
particular due to impairments."
"The non-cash-effective equity results 
improved by €4,577  million."
"In the previous year, these included 
 
the negative earnings contribution of -€4,853 million from Wintershall 
Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany."
"The adjusted earnings for the 
aforementioned noncash items therefore decreased by €2,985 million 
compared with the previous year."
"In 2023, dividends received from investments accounted for using 
 
the equity method amounted to €622 million following €1,629 million 
in the previous year."
"The main reason for the decline was the 
 
€716 million decrease in dividend payments from Wintershall Dea AG."
"The reduction in inventories in 2023 released cash amounting to 
€1,896  million."
"In contrast, €1,991  million was tied up in an 
 
inventories buildup in the previous year."
"The change in trade 
 
accounts receivable led to a cash inflow of €1,443  million, an 
 
increase of €1,223  million compared with the previous year."
"The 
cash outflow from the trade accounts payable change amounted 
 
to €1,544 million, compared with an inflow of €451 million in the 
previous year."
"Funds amounting to €1,918  million were released 
from other operating assets, an increase of €1,621 million compared 
with 2022."
"The increase in cash released was mainly the result of a 
stronger reduction in precious and industrial metal trading items and 
tax receivables."
"The change in other operating liabilities and pension 
provisions led to a cash outflow of €730  million, an increase of 
€246 million compared with the previous year."
"Cash flows from investing activities totaled -€4,991  million in 
2023, after -€3,778 million in the previous year."
"Payments made for 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets rose by 
€1,020 million to €5,395 million, mainly due to investments in the 
new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China."
"In 2023, cash flows from 
 
investing activities included payments made for acquisitions of 
€5  million."
"As in the previous year, these related to an adjusted 
 
purchase price payment for Solvay’s polyamide business."
"Payments 
received for divestitures in the amount of €32 million resulted from 
minor transactions."
"In the previous year, payments received in the 
amount of €691 million resulted primarily from the sale of shares in 
the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm and the sale of the kaolin 
minerals business."
"Cash flows from financing activities amounted to -€2,905 million."
"In addition to the payment of dividends in the amount of 
 
€3,094  million (2022: €3,248  million), BASF bought back own 
shares worth €70 million (2022: €1,331 million)."
"This was partially 
offset by net additions to financial and similar liabilities of 
 
€259 million (2022: €565 million)."
"Free cash flow, which remains after deducting payments made for 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets from cash 
flows from operating activities, represents the financial resources 
remaining after investments."
"It amounted to €2,715 million in 2023 
following €3,333 million in the previous year."
Net working capital and miscellaneous items have been redefined.
Net working capital now comprises inventories and trade accounts receivable less trade accounts payable.
The prior-year figures have been restated accordingly.
"This was the result 
of lower sales in all segments."
"Sales performance in the Chemicals, 
Materials, Nutrition & Care and Agricultural Solutions segments in 
particular was weaker than initially expected."
"Sales also declined 
considerably in Other, after we had expected slight sales growth in 
February 2023."
"The decline in sales resulted mainly from 
 
significantly lower prices than anticipated, primarily as a result of 
lower raw materials prices."
"Prices declined in all segments except 
for Agricultural Solutions."
"Contrary to our expectations, sales 
 
volumes decreased sharply in all segments, especially due to lower 
demand."
"Portfolio effects had a slightly negative impact, as 
 
expected."
"At €3.8  billion, EBIT before special items was outside both the 
forecast range of €4.8 billion to €5.4 billion from February 2023 and 
the adjusted range of €4.0  billion to €4.4  billion from July 2023."
"Developments in the segments varied: In the Chemicals and Materials 
segments, EBIT before special items declined considerably as 
 
forecast."
"The Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care segments 
 
recorded a considerably sharper decline in earnings than initially 
expected."
"In contrast, the development in the Agricultural Solutions 
and Surface Technologies segments and in Other were better 
 
than assumed."
"Agricultural Solutions exceeded our expectations 
 
and considerably increased earnings."
"Other also recorded a 
 
considerable increase in earnings, despite our expectations of 
 
a considerable decline."
"Surface Technologies slightly increased EBIT 
before special items and thus exceeded our forecast of a slight 
 
decline in earnings."
"Our expectations for ROCE were accurate in the Chemicals, 
 
Materials and Nutrition & Care segments."
"In the other segments, 
ROCE was below our expectations."
"Overall, ROCE for the BASF 
Group amounted to 4.5%, below the cost of capital rate of 9% for 
2023 and below the range we had forecast in February 2023 of 
between 7.2% and 8.0%."
"The adjusted range of 6.5% to 7.1% in 
July 2023 was also not reached."
"This ROCE development was 
 
attributable to the declines in earnings in the segments, which was 
partly due to unexpected impairments in the fourth quarter of 2023."
"A considerably lower cost of capital basis was unable to 
 
compensate for this."
"The main driver for this was the reduced production volume due to 
persistently weak demand."
"We continued to use electricity from 
 
renewable sources and purchase green electricity certificates."
The figure forecast in February 2023 was around €6.3 billion.
"The 
Chemicals and Surface Technologies segments as well as Other 
spent considerably less in 2023 than originally planned."
"Sales, earnings and ROCE forecast for the segments
Sales in the Chemicals segment declined considerably in 2023, 
after we had expected a slight decline in sales at the beginning of 
the year."
"Prices declined in both operating divisions as expected, 
albeit to a more considerable extent than anticipated."
"In addition, 
volumes decreased considerably due to a slowdown in demand."
We had initially assumed volume growth in the segment.
"The 
 
segment’s EBIT before special items and ROCE declined 
 
considerably, as forecast."
"Contrary to our assumption of slight sales growth, sales in the 
 
Materials segment were considerably below the prior-year level."
"Here, too, this was mainly due to demand- and raw materials prices- 
related price and volume decline after we had assumed a price 
 
increase and slight volume growth at the beginning of 2023."
"EBIT 
before special items and ROCE declined considerably as expected."
"Compared with the previous year, sales in the Industrial Solutions 
segment decreased considerably, contrary to our expectation of a 
slight decline."
"This was mainly due to the sharp decline in sales 
volumes in the Performance Chemicals division as a result of weak 
demand."
"In February, we forecast volume growth for the division."
"As 
expected, lower volumes in the Dispersions & Resins division, lower 
prices in both divisions and the negative portfolio effect from the 
 
divestiture of the kaolin minerals business also had a negative 
 
impact on sales."
"The segment’s EBIT before special items decreased 
significantly instead of only slightly as forecast."
"Both divisions 
 
contributed to this with considerably lower earnings."
"We had 
 
assumed a considerable increase in EBIT before special items for 
the Performance Chemicals division in our forecast."
"Contrary to our 
expectation of a slight decline, ROCE was also considerably below 
the previous year as a result of earnings development."
"Sales in the Surface Technologies segment were considerably 
below the prior-year figure."
"We had originally assumed a slight 
 
decline in sales."
"While price developments in both divisions were as 
forecast, the Catalysts division was unable to increase volumes as 
expected."
"However, EBIT before special items rose slightly; we had 
initially expected a slight decrease."
"This was attributable to the 
 
expected considerable earnings growth in the Coatings division, 
which even more than compensated for the anticipated decline in 
earnings in the Catalysts division."
"ROCE was considerably lower 
due to impairments on property, plant and equipment, particularly in 
the battery materials business."
"We had expected a slight decline in 
ROCE in February."
"Despite our assumption of sales on a level with the previous year, 
sales in the Nutrition & Care segment decreased considerably."
"The 
divisions recorded declines in volumes, contrary to our expectations."
Prices decreased as assumed.
"In line with sales performance, EBIT 
before special items declined significantly due to volumes and 
 
margins, after we had assumed only a slight decline."
"ROCE was 
considerably below the previous year, as forecast."
"Sales decreased slightly in the Agricultural Solutions segment and 
did not increase slightly as originally forecast."
"The expected price 
increases were not able to fully compensate for the unforeseen 
 
decline in sales volumes driven by a change in market dynamics."
"EBIT before special items increased considerably, primarily as a 
 
result of price increases and the receipt of a one-time payment."
"At the beginning of the year, we had only expected a slight 
 
improvement."
"ROCE was slightly lower, contrary to our assumption 
of a slight increase."
"This was mainly driven by impairments on 
 
production facilities in Europe as well as charges for measures in the 
context of the cost savings program focusing on Europe."
"Sales in Other were significantly lower compared with the prior-year 
figure due to lower sales in commodity and energy trading."
"We had 
forecast a slight increase in February 2023."
"Contrary to 
 
expectations, EBIT before special items increased considerably."
"This was mainly due to a higher contribution from other businesses 
compared with the previous year and lower expenses for corporate 
research."
"It supplies the other segments 
 
with basic chemicals and intermediates, contributing to the

 CO2 reduction in the  
cement industry 
With over 50 years of expertise in gas treatment, 
 
BASF is opening up new markets and making important 
contributions to reducing CO2 emissions."
"For example, 
 
a cement production facility at Heidelberg Materials will 
be the first to use a large-scale CO2 capture plant in 
which a process based on OASE® blue, jointly developed 
by BASF, Linde and Heidelberg Materials, will be 
 
used."
"From 2025, around 70,000 metric tons of CO2 per 
year will be captured, purified and liquefied in this first 
plant of its kind for capturing and recycling CO2 in 
cement production at the Lengfurt site in Bavaria."
"As 
cement production is associated with considerable CO2 
emissions, we and our partners are making an important 
contribution to reducing emissions."
"The use of the 
 
special OASE®-based process is open to all companies 
in the cement industry."
"In 
the Petrochemicals division sales declined by €3,127  million to 
€7,418 million, while sales in the Intermediates division decreased 
by €1,398 million to €2,951 million."
"As a 
result, prices in the Petrochemicals division fell significantly in all 
business areas."
"In the Intermediates division, increased capacities of 
Chinese competitors led to additional price pressure, which meant 
that price levels declined in the butanediol and derivatives business 
in particular."
"Weak demand weighed down the segment’s volume development 
significantly."
"Compared with the previous year, volumes in the 
 
Petrochemicals division decreased, particularly for steam cracker 
products, styrene monomers and in the propylene value chain."
"In the Intermediates division, volumes decreased considerably in all 
business areas."
"Currency effects, largely relating to the Chinese renminbi and the 
U.S."
"dollar, also had a negative impact on sales."

"The decline in EBIT before special items in 
both operating divisions was primarily attributable to the lower 
margins and volumes, and lower contributions from shareholdings 
accounted for using the equity method."
"Reduced fixed costs and 
lower raw materials and energy prices had an offsetting effect in 
both divisions."

"In the Monomers division, prices fell in all 
business areas, especially in the ammonia and polyamide 
 
value chains."
"In the Performance Materials division, prices 
 
decreased in all business areas."
"Declining demand over the course of the year led to significantly 
lower volumes, especially in Europe."
"Volume growth in the 
 
Monomers division in Asia Pacific, mainly as a result of considerably 
higher isocyanate volumes, had an offsetting effect."
"Negative currency effects, mainly relating to the Chinese renminbi, 
also weighed down the sales performance of the segment."
"At €826 million, income from operations (EBIT) before special 
items of the segment was €1,013 million below the figure of 2022."
"EBIT before special items declined considerably in the Monomers 
division due to lower polyamide and ammonia margins."
"The slight 
decline in earnings in the Performance Materials division was driven 
by lower margins and volumes."
"Considerably reduced fixed costs in 
both divisions, primarily as a result of lower production costs, were 
unable to compensate for this."

million to €4,921  million, while they declined by €885  million to 
€3,088 million in the Performance Chemicals division."
"Lower raw materials prices in particular led to considerably lower 
prices overall."
"Price levels in the Dispersions  & Resins division 
 
decreased in almost all business areas."
"In the Performance 
 
Chemicals division, prices decreased mainly for plastic additives."
"In addition, slightly negative currency effects, largely relating to 
 
the Chinese renminbi and the U.S."
"dollar, burdened sales 
 
performance."
"Portfolio effects also dampened sales performance slightly, mainly 
as a result of the divestiture of the kaolin minerals business in the

"At €625 million, income from operations (EBIT) before special 
items of the segment was €466 million below the prior-year figure."
"Earnings in the Performance Chemicals division decreased in 
 
particular due to lower volumes and margins, negative currency 
 
effects and the missing earnings contributions from the divested 
kaolin minerals business."
"In the Dispersions & Resins division, the 
decline in earnings was mainly a result of volume-related lower 
margins."
"Reduced fixed costs, primarily due to lower personnel costs had a 
positive effect in both operating divisions."
EBIT declined by €436 million compared with 2022 to €660 million.
"In 2023, this included special income, mainly due to a payment in

 An innovative surface film for aviation 
With NovaFlex Sharkskin, BASF has developed a surface film that mimics the fine structure of a shark’s 
skin."
"The film optimizes the aerodynamics on flow-related parts of the aircraft, meaning that less fuel is 
needed and CO2 emissions are reduced."
"Applying NovaFlex SharkSkin film to a Boeing 777-300 
reduces the aerodynamic drag by more than 1%, saving 1,250 metric tons of CO2 per aircraft per year."
Using the technology at its highest expansion level could reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 3%.
"The Catalysts division recorded a sales decrease of €5,245 million to 
€11,818  million."
"The increase in sales in the Coatings division, by 
€166 million to €4,387 million, could not compensate for this."
"At €7,578  million, sales in 
 
precious metal trading and precious metal sales in the mobile 
 
emissions catalysts business1 were below the previous year 
(€12,336 million)."
"Considerable price increases and a slight volume 
growth in the Coatings division only partially compensated for this."
"The Coatings division raised prices in all business areas, while sales 
volumes increased particularly in the automotive OEM coatings and 
surface treatment businesses."
"This was mainly driven by the higher 
level of automotive production as a result of resolved supply chain 
problems and an increase in inventories at car manufacturers."
"Negative currency effects, largely relating to the Chinese renminbi, 
dampened the segment’s sales performance."
"Portfolio effects, particularly in the Catalysts division as a result of 
the divestiture of the production site in De Meern, Netherlands, as 
 
of August 31, 2023, had a slightly negative impact on sales."
"The considerable 
earnings growth in the Coatings division, which resulted mainly 
 
from price and volume-related margin increases, more than 
 
compensated for a considerable decrease in EBIT before special 
items in the Catalysts division."
"This was mainly a result of a sharp fall 
in lithium prices."
"In addition, lower contributions from precious metal 
trading reduced earnings in the division."
"Higher margins in the 
 
automotive and refining catalysts businesses could only partially 
offset this."
"EBIT declined by €247 million compared with the previous year to 
€366  million."
"This included special charges amounting to 
 
€576 million."
"In the Catalysts division, these comprised impairments 
on property, plant and equipment, in particular in the battery 
 
materials business, as well as charges resulting from the carve-out 
of the BASF Environmental Catalyst and Metal Solutions unit."
"In the 
 
Coatings division, special charges arose in particular from measures 
to increase efficiency."
"We also offer solutions for 
 
technical applications, for example."
"We strive to expand our 
 
position as a leading provider of ingredients for consumer 
goods in the areas of nutrition, home and personal care

 Virus-resistant tomato seed varieties for less food 
loss 
Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is an aggressive and persistent plant virus that causes 
severe crop losses in tomatoes worldwide."
"After discovering the virus, BASF quickly identified 
 
genetic sources of resistance and applied state-of-the-art breeding methods to be able to offer 
resistant and competitive varieties."
"The first resistant tomato varieties were made available under the 
Nunhems® brand in 2020 and BASF has since expanded the range to more than 20 varieties for 
different markets and consumer preferences."
"Using these resistant varieties in combination with 
appropriate hygiene protocols offers a solution that benefits both growers and the food supply chain."
"Considerably higher prices in almost all regions and 
indications were not fully able to compensate for lower volumes and

  Combined Management’s Report – Regional Results
Regional Results
Europe
Sales at companies located in Europe declined by 22.9% to 
€27,631 million compared with the previous year."
"This was primarily 
due to a sharp decline in sales in the Chemicals and Materials 
segments."
"Sales also declined significantly in the Surface 
Technologies, Industrial Solutions and Nutrition  &  Care segments 
and in Other."
"Conversely, the Agricultural Solutions segment 
recorded a considerable increase in sales."
"The decline in sales in Europe was attributable in particular to lower 
volumes related to reduced demand in all segments."
"Considerably 
lower prices, mainly in the Materials, Chemicals and Surface 
Technologies segments, contributed to the decline in sales."
"Higher 
prices in the Agricultural Solutions segment and in the Coatings 
division had an offsetting effect."
"Negative currency effects in all 
segments and portfolio effects, especially in the Industrial Solutions 
segment, had a slightly negative impact on sales."
"North America
Sales at companies located in North America declined by 21.9% to 
€19,003 million compared with 2022."
"In local currency terms, they 
were 20.2% below the prior-year figure."
"This was mainly due to 
significantly lower sales in the Surface Technologies segment."
"Chemicals, Materials, Other, Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care 
also recorded considerable declines in sales."
"In the Agricultural 
Solutions segment, sales decreased slightly."
"Lower prices driven by raw materials costs in the Chemicals segment 
and lower precious metal prices in Surface Technologies were the 
main factors affecting sales performance in North America."
"In addition, 
lower sales volumes in all segments as a result of weak demand 
reduced sales."
"Currency effects had a slightly negative impact on 
sales."
"In addition, sales were reduced by slightly negative portfolio 
effects, especially in the Industrial Solutions segment following the 
sale of the kaolin minerals business as of September 30, 2022."
"Asia Pacific
Sales at companies located in Asia Pacific declined by 19.6% 
compared with the previous year to €17,142 million."
"In local currency 
terms, sales declined by 14.0%."
"This was largely due to a 
considerable decline in sales in the Surface Technologies segment."
"Sales in the Materials, Chemicals, Industrial Solutions and 
 
Nutrition  & Care segments were also significantly below the 
 
prior-year figure."
"In the Agricultural Solutions segment, sales 
decreased slightly."
"The sales performance was primarily the result of lower price levels, 
particularly in the Surface Technologies, Chemicals and Materials 
segments."
"In 
addition, 
currency 
effects 
dampened 
sales 
performance."
"The decline in sales volumes was primarily driven by 
the Catalysts division in the Surface Technologies segment."
"Chemicals and Materials increased volumes slightly; the same was 
true for the Coatings and Nutrition  &  Health divisions."
"Portfolio 
effects, particularly in the Industrial Solutions segment, reduced 
sales slightly."
"South America, Africa, Middle East
Sales at companies located in South America, Africa and the Middle 
East decreased by 7.6% in local currency terms and by 12.4% in 
euros to €5,126 million."
"Almost all segments recorded considerably 
lower sales."
"The Surface Technologies segment improved sales 
slightly."
"Lower sales volumes overall and negative currency effects were the 
main reasons for the decline in sales in the region."
"Considerable 
volume growth in Surface Technologies was unable to offset the 
negative volume development in the other segments."
"Slightly lower 
prices overall also weighed down sales performance, despite the 
price increases in Agricultural Solutions and Surface Technologies."
"That is why we have firmly anchored sustainable and responsible conduct into 
our corporate purpose, our strategy, our targets and our operational business."
"The impacts of our business activities on the areas of 
 
environmental, social and governance are important aspects 
 
of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 173)."
"We contribute to sustainability and to the United Nations’ 
 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many ways (see 
 
page 49)."
"For instance, our innovations, products and 
 
technologies help to use natural resources more efficiently, meet 
the demand for food, enable climate-smart mobility, reduce 
 
emissions and waste, or increase the capabilities of renewable 
energy."
"At the same time, we cause CO2 emissions, use water and 
source raw materials from suppliers, which may involve a potential 
risk of violating environmental, labor or social standards."
"This is 
why we are constantly working to broaden our positive 
 
contributions to key sustainability topics (see page 49) along our 
value chain and reduce the negative impacts."
"We are committed to doing business in a responsible, safe and 
resource-efficient way."
"Our actions are guided by our corporate 
values and our global Code of Conduct."
"With our comprehensive 
management and monitoring systems, we want to ensure that we 
act in line with the applicable laws and uphold our responsibility 
 
to the environment and society."
"We require our business partners 
to comply with prevailing laws, regulations and internationally 
 
recognized principles."
"To discuss critical issues and, if needed, 
 
develop solutions together, we seek dialog with our stakeholders."
"We are also involved in numerous sustainability initiatives to 
 
drive forward sustainability both in general and specifically in 
 
relation to our value chains."
"We see it as part of 
our corporate obligation to preserve the natural foundations of life for future generations."
"Our core  
business – production, processing and transportation of chemicals – therefore demands a responsible  
approach."
Our aim is to minimize the impact we have on the environment along the entire value chain.
"This 
also includes protecting the climate and using increasingly scarce resources as efficiently as possible."
"That is why we have established comprehensive 
management and control systems."
"Our Responsible Care 
Management System comprises the global directives, 
 
standards and procedures for environmental protection, health 
and safety."
"Responsible Care Management System
BASF is actively involved in the International Council of Chemical 
 
Associations’ global Responsible Care® initiative."
"Our Responsible 
Care Management System covers the environmental protection, 
health and safety aspects that we have identified as material (for more 
information on health and safety, see page 143 onward)."
"Environmental protection is particularly relevant for the procurement 
and transportation of our raw materials, the production at our plants, 
activities at our sites and warehouses, as well as distribution of our 
products."
"Our global 
network enables information and insights to be shared across 
 
the BASF Group on an ongoing basis."
Our policies and requirements are continuously updated.
"This is why 
we also maintain dialog with government institutions, associations 
and international organizations."
"We set ourselves ambitious goals 
for environmental protection (see page 41)."
"We regularly review our 
performance and progress with audits."
"In the 120 audits conducted 
in 2023, we took a risk-based approach."
"We assess the potential 
risks and weaknesses of all our major activities – from research and 
development to production and logistics – and the potential effects 
of these on the environment."
"Worldwide, 132 BASF production sites 
are certified in accordance with the international environmental 
 
management standard ISO 14001 (2022: 132)."
"We also establish appropriate provisions for 
 
environmental protection measures and the remediation of active and 
former sites."

"The transformation of BASF toward climate neutrality is a 
challenge."
"We are determined to follow this path and become 
a pioneer in low-emission chemistry."
"At the same time, we are working to 
significantly reduce our CO2 emissions2 along the value chain."
"This 
creates opportunities for our business activities: Thanks to our 
transformation toward climate neutrality, we can increasingly offer 
our customers products with a reduced product carbon footprint 
(PCF)."
"However, emissions from our production, our energy 
 
procurement and our upstream and downstream value chain have a 
negative impact on the climate."
"Climate protection is therefore very 
important to us and is an important part of our corporate 
 
strategy."
"Climate scenarios are incorporated into the strategies of 
our business units."
"We continuously analyze short and long-term 
opportunities and risks for our business operations arising in 
 
connection with the topics of energy and climate protection as part 
of our opportunity and risk management (for more information, see 
page 182 onward)."
We are pursuing ambitious climate protection targets.
"In addition 
to the targets for reducing our emissions from production processes 
(Scope 1)1 and the purchase of energy (Scope 2)1, we set 
ourselves a target for reducing our specific raw materials-related 
emissions (Scope 3.1)3 in the reporting year (see “Global targets”)."
"Based on increased transparency and data availability, we will be able 
to steer our upstream emissions, which make up the majority of our 
total emissions along the value chain, in a more targeted manner in 
the future."
"We have extended our long-term target of achieving 
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and are striving toward 
this target for Scope 3.1 in addition to Scope 1 and 2 (see page 104)."
"To reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and demand for fossil raw 
materials, we are focusing on the following measures: 
	
– Renewable energy: We are increasingly meeting our electricity 
needs from renewable sources (see “Energy supply”)."
"– Circularity: We are increasingly using renewable and recycled 
raw materials as well as raw materials based on the use of CO2 in 
order to move from linear value creation to closed material cycles 
(see “Raw materials” from page 121 onward)."

Future adjustment of the baseline in line with the TfS guideline possible depending on the availability of further primary data.
"We only consider external offsetting measures for our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions1 as a temporary solution in the medium term if 
our activities do not make the desired contribution to reducing 
emissions."
"We bundle measures to achieve our Scope 3.1 target3 
primarily in purchasing-specific measures (see box on “Managing 
our emissions in the value chain,” page 106)."
"It conducts regular audits to monitor the 
 
implementation of and compliance with internal guidelines and legal 
requirements by our sites and Group companies."
"The Corporate 
Strategy & Sustainability unit develops the BASF Group’s climate 
targets and strategic levers for achieving them."
"The Global 
 
Procurement unit, together with Corporate Development, is 
 
responsible for purchasing processes and procurement guidelines 
with regard to our raw materials-related targets."
"Global Procurement 
reports to the Chief Financial Officer; the Corporate Sustainability 
and Net Zero Accelerator units report to the Chairman of the Board 
of Executive Directors."
"This enables us to lay the foundation for 
 
integrating climate protection-relevant aspects into strategic 
 
decision-making processes such as investments, acquisitions and 
core business activities (see page 50)."
"Group-wide Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions have been anchored in the BASF Group’s 
 
steering and compensation systems as the most important 
 
nonfinancial key performance indicator since 2020, giving them 
even more weight (see page 40)."
"By reducing our own CO2 emissions and those upstream in the 
value chain, we contribute to our customers achieving their climate 
protection targets."
"To increase transparency and target our CO2 
reduction measures to those areas where they bring the greatest 
added value, we continuously determine the Product Carbon 
 
Footprint for around 45,000 sales products (see “Product 
 
Carbon Footprints”)."
"In addition, we offer our customers solutions 
that help prevent greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy 
and resource efficiency."
"We are committed to reporting transparently on our climate 
 
protection targets and progress, as well as on the impact of climate 
change on BASF."
"In this context, we support the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
"Since 2019, BASF’s annual report has included an overview 
 
showing the sections and subsections in which TCFD-relevant 
 
information can be found (see page 21)."
"We also participate in the 
program established by the international nonprofit organization CDP 
for reporting on data relevant to climate protection and have done 
so since 2004."
"BASF achieved a score of A- in CDP’s 2023 
 
climate change questionnaire, again attaining Leadership status."
1	 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties).
"The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e)."
"Companies at the leadership level are distinguished by factors such 
as the completeness and transparency of their reporting."
"All parts of society must work together to effectively protect the 
 
climate."
"This is why we support various national and international 
initiatives and are involved in partnerships."
"For example, we engaged 
in close dialog with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to 
derive science-based climate protection targets for the chemical 
 
sector."
"This 
 
corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990."
"Our long-term goal is net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.1 
In 2023, the BASF Group’s emissions from production and energy 
purchases1 amounted to 16.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents 
(2022: 18.4  million metric tons)."
"The decline compared with the 
previous year as a result of a weak economy led to persistently low 
production volumes and therefore lower emissions in 2023."
"The 
share of electricity from renewable sources was increased compared 
with the previous year, to 20%, and, together with measures to 
 
increase energy and process efficiency, made a relevant 
 
contribution to reducing emissions."
"By 2030, we 
want to reduce these in relation to the purchasing volume specifically 
 
by 15% from the 2022 baseline."
"This does not initially include raw 
materials-related emissions from battery materials, which we intend to 
further expand in the coming years."
"Battery materials make 
 
a significant contribution to reducing CO2 emissions and thus facilitate 
the transformation of the transportation sector."
"Required raw materials 
such as lithium, nickel and cobalt will not be able to be replaced by 
more sustainable alternatives in the foreseeable future."
"Accordingly, 
we cannot reduce the associated emissions significantly in the short 
term."
"As soon as recyclable solutions come into play with the increase 
in available end-of-life batteries, we will include these raw materials in 
our target definition (for more information on our battery recycling 
activities, see page 125)."
"10.8 million MWh of fossil fuels and avoided 2.2 million metric tons 
of CO2 emissions in 2023.3 To achieve the highest possible energy 
yield with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions, we 
 
continuously optimize our combined heat and power plants."
"In 
2023, internally generated power in the BASF Group had a carbon 
footprint of around 0.26 metric tons of CO2 per MWh of electricity 
and was below the national grid factor at most BASF sites."
"The Verbund system is also key to carbon-optimized energy supply 
at our sites."
"It helps us realize synergies and manage value chains in 
a resource-efficient way."
"For example, waste heat from one plant’s 
production process is used as energy in other plants."
"We will 
 
continue to invest in the creation and optimization of Verbund 
 
structures and drive forward the consolidation of production at 
highly efficient sites."
"In 2023, specific Scope 3.1 emissions1 amounted to 1.61 kilograms 
of CO2 per kilogram of raw material purchased (2022: 1.58²)."
"This 
increase is attributable to the decline in production and the 
associated reduced use of raw materials in Europe."
"In the long term, we strive to reduce Scope 3.1 emissions to an 
unavoidable minimum by 2050, thereby expanding our long-term 
net-zero target to include these greenhouse gas emissions."
"Despite 
all our efforts, there will be residual share of emissions in 2050 that 
cannot be avoided using technical or economic approaches."
"These 
emissions must be offset by measurements outside our value 
chains."
"One option is to sequester carbon into the soil through 
farming (carbon farming, see page 36)."
"Total energy consumption includes fuel 
demand in our own central power and steam generation plants, 
primary energy requirements in our process plants, and net power 
and steam imports."
"To generate our own steam and power, we mainly use natural 
 
gas (78.8%) and substitute fuels (17.8%)."
"The latter are residues 
from chemical production plants that cannot be reused in the BASF 
Verbund."
"In 2023, we covered 51% of our electricity demand with 
our own gas and steam turbines in highly efficient combined heat 
and power plants."
Future adjustment of the baseline in line with the TfS guideline possible depending on the availability of further primary data.
2  The value for 2022 was adjusted due to increased data availability.
This mainly affects our electricity supply.
"In 2023, 
 
electricity from renewable sources as a share of total electricity 
consumption rose compared with the previous year to 20% 
 
(2022: 17%1 )."
"Our electricity consumption will increase significantly 
in the coming years due to the planned gradual electrification of 
 
our steam generation and the switch from natural gas-based to 
electricity-based, low-emission production processes, for example 
in our steam crackers (see page 107)."
"Nevertheless, we aim to 
source more than 60% of our power needs from renewable sources 
by 2030."
"In the transformation of our power supply, we are pursuing a 
 
make & buy approach."
"Firstly, BASF is investing in its own 
 
renewable power assets."
"Secondly, we are purchasing green power 
on the market through long-term supply agreements with plant 
 
operators, power purchase agreements or renewable energy 
 
certificates, depending on the region and market regulations."
"Profitability and additionality are key purchasing criteria: This means 
that the electricity purchased is primarily sourced from new 
 
renewable energy facilities."
"In 2023, we successfully advanced our plan for a power supply from 
renewable sources."
"The Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, 
 
a joint project with Vattenfall and Allianz, was officially inaugurated in 
fall 2023 and should be fully operational in 2024."
"With 139 turbines 
and a capacity of 1.5  gigawatts, it is one of the largest offshore 
 
wind farms in the world."
"We have signed a memorandum of 
 
understanding with Vattenfall for a shareholding in the wind farms 
Nordlicht 1 and 2 as part of a further project."
"It is envisaged that 
49% of the shares will be sold to BASF."
"Construction is due to start 
in 2026, subject the final investment decision, expected in 2025."
"With a total capacity of 1.6  gigawatts, the wind farm should be 
completely operational in 2028."
"We plan to use just under half of the 
electricity generated to supply our production sites in Europe, 
 
particularly Ludwigshafen, Germany."
"The planned 
wind farm in Zhanjiang in the province of Guangdong will have a 
capacity of 500 megawatts and is scheduled to go into operation in 
2025, subject to approval."
"We have also extended our long-term 
supply contract with the State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC) 
and secured a supply of 1,000 gigawatt hours of green electricity 
per year from 2025."
"In 2023, we also concluded further long-term 
supply agreements for green power at other sites in Asia, such as 
the Verbund site in Nanjing, China, and our sites in South Korea."
"In 
North America, for example, we were able to secure around 
 
250 megawatts of solar generation capacity through virtual power 
 
purchase agreements in 2022."
"Further long-term supply contracts 
exist with X-ELIO, providing capacity of 48 megawatts of solar 
 
power to supply the Freeport, Texas, site and with EDF Energy 
Services, providing 35 megawatts of wind energy for the Freeport 
and Pasadena sites in Texas."
"In some regions, we have also 
 
acquired green power certificates."
"The aim is to gradually replace 
these temporary measures with our own power assets or long-term 
supply agreements."
"105
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Energy and Climate Protection
In 2023, we built a stationary long-term sodium sulfur-based storage 
system (NAS®) at our Schwarzheide site in Germany."
"It supports the 
power supply of individual systems via the plant’s own solar park."
"Together with NGK Insulators Ltd., BASF Stationary Energy Storage 
GmbH makes NAS batteries and develops them further."
"Alongside electricity, steam generation is an important component 
of our energy supply."
"In the future, new technologies should make a 
significant contribution to reducing CO2, for example by recovering 
energy from the waste heat of our production and infrastructure 
 
facilities."
"In this context, we are examining various concepts such 
 
as using electric heat pumps and e-boilers as well as electrifying 
steam drives."
"Climate-smart technologies
To further reduce CO2 emissions, we are also developing 
 
completely new technologies for emission-free and low-emission 
 
production."
"They will need large volumes of electricity from 
 
renewable sources in order to realize their full potential."
"The main 
focus here is on basic chemicals, which are often still emissions- 
intensive to produce."
"This applies, for example, to steam crackers, 
which use high levels of energy to break down crude petroleum into 
olefins and aromatics."
"We made significant progress here in 2023 
with the construction of a demonstration plant for electrically heated 
steam cracker furnaces (see box on page 107)."
"Another important 
basic material in the chemical industry is hydrogen, which we have 
so far mainly used as a raw material."
"One common but emissions- 
intensive way of obtaining hydrogen is steam reforming."
"We are 
 
already testing an alternative process – methane pyrolysis – in 
 
Ludwigshafen, Germany."
"This process is virtually emission-free if 
 
renewable energy is used and requires considerably less electricity 
compared with other methods, such as water electrolysis."
"We 
 
successfully tested a new reactor concept at the pilot plant, 
 
which went into operation in 2021, thus overcoming the first 
 
important technical hurdle for further scaling."
"In recent 
years, we have been able to considerably increase the data 
availability and thereby transparency of our Scope 3.1 emissions."
"With our new target and dedicated measures, we want to control 
upstream emissions in a more targeted manner in the future."
"We launched the Supplier CO2 Management Program in 2021 
to achieve transparency regarding these emissions."
"The goal 
 
is to obtain a more accurate data base and better manage and 
 
reduce emissions in the supply chain."
"In a first step, we have 
 
requested the Product Carbon Footprints of our raw materials 
since 2021 and support our suppliers in determining these, for 
example, by sharing our knowledge of valuation and calculation 
methods with them."
"Since the start of the program, we have 
asked more than 1,600 suppliers, covering around 70% of our 
raw materials-related greenhouse gas emissions."
"After around 
two years, we have more than 800 validated Product Carbon 
Footprints for our raw materials."
"In a second step, we will 
 
now work with our suppliers on solutions to reduce product- 
related emissions."
"To this end, we are building up a team of 
 
experts in our procurement organization, supported by 
 
interdisciplinary experts from the operating divisions and the Net 
Zero Accelerator unit."
"We are also further developing our purchasing processes and 
establishing the Product Carbon Footprint as a relevant criterion 
for raw materials in the purchasing guidelines."
"In addition to 
reducing our raw materials-related emissions (Scope 3.1), we are 
taking targeted measures to reduce Scope 3 emissions along the 
entire value chain."
"In order to reduce emissions from the use 
 
of sold products (Scope 3.11), for example, we rely on product 
adaptations: For example, climate-damaging blowing agents for 
foaming polyurethane foams can now be largely dispensed with in 
the downstream value chain."
"We also want to reduce emissions 
resulting from the disposal of our products (Scope 3.12)."
"This is 
possible, for example, through the increased use of renewable 
raw materials (see page 122) or circular solutions (see page 46)."
"Both ensure that less and less CO2 pollutes the atmosphere 
throughout the life cycle of our products."

"Case study
Electrification of our steam crackers
Many everyday products would not exist without steam crackers."
"They split petroleum into olefins and aromatics – both important 
groups of substances for numerous chemical value chains."
"The cracking reaction requires high temperatures of around 
 
850 degrees Celsius, which until now have been achieved by 
burning natural gas."
"Heating concepts that use electricity from renewable sources 
could reduce process-related emissions by at least 90% in the 
 
future."
"The prototype is completely integrated into one of the 
two existing steam crackers at the site."
"In addition, we expect new hydrogen applications in the 
future, such as energy use, and thus a trend toward increasing 
 
demand for hydrogen."
"Access to large quantities of low-emission or 
emission-free hydrogen at competitive prices is therefore becoming 
increasingly important for BASF."
"Another focus area of our technological development is carbon 
capture and storage (CCS)."
"For example, we are currently part of an 
industrial CCS project at the Antwerp site in Belgium (Kairos@C) as 
the first phase of the Antwerp@C project, which could enable BASF 
to avoid the emission of up to 1 million metric tons of CO2 into the 
atmosphere every year from production."
"Together with Yara, we are 
also evaluating the development and construction of a world-scale 
production plant for low-emission blue ammonia using CCS in the 
United States."
"Approximately 95% of the CO2 generated from 
the production process is to be captured and permanently stored 
 
in the ground."
"Energy efficiency and specific greenhouse gas emissions
Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are closely linked to 
 
capacity utilization at our plants and its product portfolio."
"Specific 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 amounted to 0.584 metric tons 
of CO2 equivalents per metric ton of sales product,3 an increase of 
1.2% compared with the previous year (2022: 0.577 metric tons)."
"This was mainly due to persistently lower and inconsistent capacity 
utilization at our plants, which resulted in a decline in plant efficiency."
"In contrast, the use of renewable power had a positive impact on 
specific greenhouse gas emissions."
"Since 1990, we have been able 
to lower our overall greenhouse gas emissions from BASF opera-
tions by 57.8% and even reduce specific emissions (per 
 
metric ton of sales product) by 74.5%."
"Through our operational excellence projects, we aim to make our 
plants and processes even more efficient and resource saving, 
thereby avoiding CO2 emissions."
"Certified energy management 
systems according to DIN EN ISO 50001 at all relevant production 
sites4 play a particularly important role here."
"These help us to 
 
identify and implement further potential for improvement in energy 
efficiency."
"This not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions 
 
and saves valuable energy resources but also increases our 
 
competitiveness."
"In 2023, 78 production sites worldwide had 
 
certified energy management systems, representing around 89% of 
our primary energy demand."
"A global working group provides ongoing support to the sites and 
Group companies in implementing and maintaining certified energy 
management systems."
"All energy efficiency measures are recorded 
in a global database, analyzed and made available to BASF sites as 
examples of best practices."
"In 2023, we implemented more than 500 measures to reduce

Corporate carbon footprint
BASF has published a comprehensive corporate carbon footprint 
every year since 2008."
"This reports on all emissions along the value 
chain – from raw materials extraction to production and disposal."
"We are continually working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
both in our own production and, together with our partners, along 
the value chain (see “Strategy and governance”)."
"In 2023, our greenhouse gas emissions according to the 
 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 
 
emissions1 were 17.851 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents 
(2022: 19.149 million metric tons²)."
"Of this amount, 87% were 
Scope 1 emissions (2022: 87%²) and 13% were Scope 2 emissions 
 
(2022: 13%²)."
"Carbon dioxide was by far the largest component and 
accounted for 98% of emissions (2022: 98%)."
"For 2023, we calculated Scope 3 emissions of around 85 million 
metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2022: 94 million metric tons²).³ There 
was a further reduction in total emissions along the BASF value chain 
in 2023 due to lower production volumes."
"The largest contribution to emissions along the value chain in 2023 
was in category 3.1 (purchased raw materials and technical goods 
and services) at 47  million metric tons of CO2 equivalents 
 
(2022: 53  million metric tons²)."
"Scope 3 emissions in category 10 (“Processing of sold products”) are not reported according to 
the standard for the chemical sector."
Only direct use phase emissions are reported in the customer category (Scope 3.11).
Excluding greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading activities.
"3	 In 2023, we changed the calculation of Scope 3 emissions in categories 3.1 and 3.12 due to increased availability of primary and secondary data."
This did not lead to any significant changes in the results.
"For more information on the calculation method, see basf.com/corporate_carbon_footprint

Significant changes in these values are reflected accordingly in our calculations.
c   Primary energy used in BASF’s plants as well as in the plants of our energy suppliers to cover energy demand for production processes.
Purchased renewable power has a primary energy conversion efficiency rate of 100%.
"These Product Carbon Footprints (PCFs) include all greenhouse gas 
emissions – from raw materials extraction to the finished product 
leaving the factory gates (“cradle-to-gate”)."
"PCFs provide us with 
important information for assessing the climate impact of our 
 
products and guidance for implementing mitigation measures so 
that our customers can benefit from reduced CO2 emissions in the 
value chain."
"In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio of products with a 
 
certified reduced carbon footprint, including engineering plastics."
"We already offer some of our products, such as the intermediates 
neopentyl glycol and propionic acid, the isocyanates MDI and 
Lupranat®, the amino resin Kaurit® and the adhesive raw material 
acResin® with a net-zero carbon footprint."
"These lower PCFs 
 
are primarily made possible by the substitution of fossil raw 
 
materials."
"For instance, we use electricity from renewable sources 
instead of electricity from fossil fuels to produce low-PCF and 
 
zero-PCF products."
"We also use – in whole or in part – renewable, 
waste-based or recycled raw materials such as castor oil, 
biomethane or pyrolysis oil from plastic waste."
"These alternative 
resources often have a better carbon footprint compared with fossil 
raw materials."
"The alternative resources are allocated to the end 
product using the mass balance approach (see box on page 124)."
"The digital methodology we have developed to calculate PCFs 
meets general life cycle analysis standards such as ISO 14040, ISO 
14044 and ISO 14067, as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol 
Product Standard."
"In 2023, we received certification from 
 
TÜV Rheinland, which confirms that our calculation method and 
 
reporting fully comply with the requirements of Together for 
Sustainability (TfS)."
"We make our automated PCF calculation 
 
approach available to interested industry players through 
partnerships."
a   BASF reports separately on direct and indirect emissions from the purchase of energy.
"Scope 1 emissions encompass both direct emissions from production and generation of steam and electricity, as well as direct emissions 
from the generation of steam and electricity for sale."
Scope 2 emissions comprise indirect emissions from the purchase of energy for BASF’s use.
"b   Emissions of N2O, CH4 and HFC have been translated into CO2 emissions using the Global Warming Potential, or GWP, factor."
"GWP factors are based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007, errata  
table 2012 for the 2018 reporting year, and IPCC 2014 for the 2022 reporting year."
HFC (hydrofluorocarbons) are calculated using the GWP factors of the individual components.
c   The comparative figure for 2022 has been adjusted to reflect updated data.
d   Market-based approach.
"Under the location-based approach, Scope 2 emissions were 3.588 million metric tons of CO2 in 2022 and 3.317 million metric tons of CO2 in 2023."
e   Includes sales to BASF Group companies.
"as a result, emissions reported under Scope 2 can be considered twice in some cases."
f    Emissions are reported separately from Scope 1 and Scope 2 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
"This also took place as part of TfS, where we were involved 
in the creation of a uniform guideline for calculating the carbon 
footprint of products in the chemical industry."
"This will enable the 
climate impact of products to be directly compared and evaluated 
based on a standardized approach."
"A digital solution for sharing 
PCF data between companies is currently in the pilot phase and 
should be implemented in 2024."
"Harmonizing the approaches used to calculate PCFs allows us to 
better manage greenhouse gas emissions that arise during the 
 
extraction of raw materials or the manufacture of precursors."

"This raises 
 
awareness of potential risks and impacts such as water scarcity for 
the population."
"Based on the assessments conducted until the end 
of 2023, we did not identify a significant impact on water availability 
and quality resulting from our activities at any site."
"Another important part of our sustainable water management is 
 
the continuous analysis and implementation of measures for

"For example, process optimizations such as the use 
of modified valves or the recycling of low-temperature cooling water 
at the General Lagos site in Argentina are leading to water savings 
of 15%."
"At our Verbund site in Freeport, Texas, we commissioned 
 
a membrane bioreactor for treating wastewater in 2023, which 
 
improved the capacity and performance of the wastewater 
 
treatment plant."
"In the future, the treated wastewater is to be 
 
recycled, thereby reducing the need for freshwater."
"Depending on 
the local situation, we also implement measures together with other

"Water use in 2023 totaled 6,722  million cubic meters 
 
(2022: 6,917  million cubic meters)."
"Put in relation to total water 
abstraction, this means that we use every liter we abstract around 
four times, or cover 79% of our water demand with reuse."
"We 
predominantly use water for cooling purposes (88% of total water 
abstraction), after which we discharge it back to our supply sources 
with no product contact."
"We reduce our water abstraction for 
cooling purposes mainly by using recooling plants."
"Around 12% of 
our total water abstraction is used in production plants, for example, 
for extraction or dissolution processes or for cleaning."
"Here, too, we 
reduce our demand for water by reusing wastewater."
"Most of the 
water used for production purposes is discharged back to water 
bodies after being treated in our own or third-party wastewater 
treatment plants."
"The BASF Group’s water consumption describes the amount 
 
of water that is not discharged back into a water body, meaning 
 
that it is no longer available to other users."
"Consumption is mainly 
attributable to the evaporation of water in recirculating cooling 
 
systems."
"A smaller amount is from the water contained in our 
 
products."
"Water consumption in 2023 amounted to around 
 
67 million cubic meters (2022: 69 million cubic meters)."
"In 2023, around 25% of our production sites were located in water 
stress areas (2022: 25%)."
"These sites accounted for 1% of BASF’s 
total water abstraction (2022: 1%1)."
"In water stress areas, we 
 
mainly source water from third parties (79%) and largely cover our 
demand with freshwater."
"Water consumption in water stress areas 
accounted for 15% of BASF’s total water consumption in 2023 
(2022: 17%) and was primarily attributable to evaporation in cooling 
processes."
"Wastewater in water stress areas accounted for less 
than 1% of BASF’s total wastewater."
"The share of wastewater from 
cooling processes in water stress areas is lower than for the BASF 
1	 Aqueduct 3.0 was used to identify sites in water stress areas to determine pro rata water abstraction and water consumption."
"Cooling water is rarely used for once-through 
cooling here."
"Instead, it is generally recirculated to reduce water 
demand."
"Production wastewater in water stress areas is primarily 
treated at third-party facilities."
"The supply, treatment, transportation and recooling of water is 
 
often associated with a high energy demand."
"We are constantly 
working to optimize our energy consumption and the amount of 
water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our operations and 
 
the environment."
"Both internal audits and the 
 
responsible local authorities regularly assess whether the analyses 
and safety precautions at our sites comply with internal and legal 
requirements."
"A total of 1,352 million cubic meters of water were 
discharged from BASF production sites in 2023 (2022: 1,400 million 
cubic meters)."
"Including 148  million cubic meters of wastewater

(2022: 10,600  metric tons)."
"Our wastewater contained 13 metric 
tons of heavy metals (2022: 15 metric tons1)."
"Phosphorus emissions 
amounted to 220 metric tons (2022: 230 metric tons¹)."
"Our approach is to reduce wastewater volumes and contaminant 
loads at the source in our production processes and to reuse 
 
wastewater and material flows internally as far as possible."
"To treat 
wastewater, we use both central measures in wastewater treatment 
plants and the selective pretreatment of individual wastewater 
streams before these are sent to the wastewater treatment plant."
"We use different methods depending on the type and degree of 
contamination – including biological processes, chemical oxidation, 
membrane technologies, precipitation or adsorption."
"In order to 
avoid unanticipated emissions and the pollution of surface water 
 
or groundwater, we have water protection concepts for our 
 
production sites in place."
"This is mandatory for all production 
 
sites as part of our Responsible Care Management System 
 
(see page 131)."

such as investors, customers, legislators, suppliers, insurers and 
nongovernmental organizations."
"We actively seek out partnerships 
with relevant interest groups and organizations worldwide, for 
 
example in the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD), to expand our knowledge, to raise awareness about 
 
biodiversity and to drive necessary actions forward (see page 140)."
"We align our biodiversity measures with the impact of our business 
activities along the value chain."
"Our focus here is on three areas: 
supply chains, sites and production, and product impacts."
"For this 
purpose, we are guided by the risk mitigation hierarchy: We try to 
avoid having an impact on nature."
"If this is not feasible, we want to 
reduce these impacts, support the restoration of nature or contribute 
to the transformation of value chains toward better environmental 
sustainability."
"This page:
BASF is working with farms in the United Kingdom to show how 
agricultural use and the protection of biodiversity can be reconciled."
"Planting wildflower strips and creating habitats for birds and insects 
have led to a long-term improvement in biodiversity and soil health."
"“
Based on the discussions in our 
Nature Advisory Council, we want 
to further improve our activities to 
protect biodiversity."

Currently, there is no standardized, globally accepted indicator for the 
loss of biodiversity (in contrast to greenhouse gas emissions as a key 
indicator of climate change)."
"In addition, impacts must be considered 
primarily in a local context."
"We therefore use indicators such as nitrogen 
emissions to water to measure drivers of biodiversity loss and species 
occurrence to assess the status of ecosystems."
"For example, we 
regularly examine the fish population in the Rhine around the 
Ludwigshafen site using electrofishing."
"With this method, the animals 
are temporarily stunned with a weak electric field for documentation 
purposes and removed with a fishing net before being returned to the 
water."
"In 2023, species diversity was found to be the same as in 2021."
"We use various methods to measure our sustainability performance 
that implicitly and explicitly consider relevant opportunities and risks 
for biodiversity."
"Examples of this include the BASF Eco-Efficiency 
Analysis as well as AgBalance® in the context of agricultural 
 
products and the corresponding biodiversity calculator."
"Newly developed assessment methods help us to better understand 
influences on biodiversity."
"We regularly test various analysis tools 
available on the market."
"Taking into account the LEAP (Locate, 
Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) methodology developed by TNFD, we 
are systematizing our existing strategic approach."
"Based on this 
understanding, we seek dialog with partners and enter into strategic 
cooperations, through which we drive forward measures to protect 
biodiversity around the world (e.g., Wildlife Habitat Council)."
"An internal working group addresses strategic aspects and the 
identification of impacts, dependencies, opportunities and risks 
arising from biodiversity."
"In 2023, for instance, a survey of BASF’s 
divisions was conducted on the importance of biodiversity aspects 
and their perceived economic relevance."
"This revealed significant 
differences: High importance and economic relevance are particularly 
evident in units nits that provide solutions for agriculture or source 
renewable raw materials."
"Another result of this working group was the 
establishment of the new Nature Advisory Council (see box)."
"Responsibility to our sites and production
Our risk management regularly examines the risks to our business 
activities from the loss of biodiversity."
"Moreover, when making 
 
decisions about investing in the construction of new sites or 
 
expanding existing ones, we conduct systematic assessments of 
sustainability aspects, such as the potential impact on forests and 
biodiversity."
"When managing our sites and plants, we aim to ensure the 
 
preservation of biodiversity by minimizing negative impacts on the 
environment (biodiversity loss drivers: pollution, overexploitation)."
"We therefore keep emissions from our production to air, water and 
soil as low as possible, avoid and reduce waste and manage 
 
contaminated sites carefully (see page 110 onward)."
"BASF is 
 
committed to the goals of Operation Clean Sweep® and is 
 
constantly working on measures to prevent plastic production waste 
from entering the environment."
"We use databases such as the 
 
Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) to examine the 
proximity of production sites to internationally recognized protected 
areas."
"We have been documenting the results in our environmental 
database since 2021."
"This allows us to raise awareness of 
 
biodiversity at a local level, assess and, if necessary, reduce 
 
potential impacts of our sites on these areas."
"In 2023, 5% of our 
production sites were adjacent to a Ramsar site1 and 1% were 
 
adjacent to a category I, II or III protected area as defined by the 
 
International Union for Conservation of Nature.2 None of our 
 
production sites were adjacent to a UNESCO protected area."
"The aim is to obtain constructive feedback and specific advice on 
 
nature-related topics and our strategic approach as well as our 
 
contributions to a sustainable future."
"The Nature Advisory Council is currently made up of four members from 
the fields of science, relevant value chains and multilateral organizations."
"Future meetings will 
 
address other important drivers of biodiversity loss and how they relate to 
BASF’s strategy."
"Restoration), based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, to 
analyze how many of our production sites are located adjacent to 
endangered species (amphibians, birds, mammals)."
"The results 
show that some of our production sites are located in areas with 
high or very high STAR values."
"We took a closer look at the drivers 
at these locations (e.g., tourism, fishing, invasive species or the 
 
occurrence of diseases)."
"These were generally not related to 
 
chemical production."
"We are implementing local measures to protect biodiversity at a 
number of sites."
"In Breuil-le-Sec, France, for example, a team has 
 
 
 
  117
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Environmental
been working on increasing the site’s biodiversity since 2014."
"Fallow 
land and an orchard were planted, nesting boxes were built 
 
for swallows and animal and plant species were regularly 
 
counted and monitored."
"The site has been certified by the local 
nongovernmental organization CPIE (Centre Permanent d’Initiative 
pour l’Environnement) for its measures to protect biodiversity."
It serves as a reference site for BASF in France.
"Furthermore, we 
 
use recooling plants at our sites."
"This allows us to reuse water 
 
several times as cooling water and reduce our water consumption."
"Recooling also reduces thermal emissions when we return the 
cooling water to the waterways."
"This ensures that our activities have 
a minimal impact on the habitats of plants and animals."
"We are 
constantly working to optimize our energy consumption and the 
amount of water we use, and to adapt to the needs of our business 
and the environment (see page 112)."
"We are committed to complying with the provisions of the 
 
international Nagoya Protocol when using biological resources."
"This 
supplementary agreement to the U.N.’s Convention on Biological 
Diversity regulates access to genetic resources and benefit sharing."
"It sets out obligations (for example, compensation payments) for the 
users of genetic resources such as plant­
based raw materials."
"We use internal control mechanisms to monitor compliance with 
these standards."
"Management of our product impact 
BASF offers products and solutions for a wide range of industries."
"We want to ensure that our products meet our customers’ 
 
standards in terms of quality and, through appropriate use, pose no 
risk to humans, animals or the environment (see page 146)."
"It is important to consider the 
 
potential impacts of product use on biodiversity, for example, with 
regard to the biodiversity loss driver of pollution."
"We evaluate our products and solutions in crop protection and 
seeds, for example, throughout the entire research, development 
and registration process."
"After they have been approved for the 
market, we continue assessing them regularly for potential risks and 
impacts to the ecosystems in which they are used."
"We have initiated 
various projects and offer trainings to prevent misuse of our 
 
products (see page 149)."
"All types of land development, such as agriculture and forestry, play 
a role in changing biodiversity (driver of biodiversity loss: land-use 
change)."
"Activities such as tillage, drainage, fertilization and the use 
of crop protection products can affect flora and fauna, for example, 
by influencing food sources."
"Minimizing these impacts while 
 
ensuring the necessary productivity is one of the biggest challenges 
farmers are facing."
"Our Agricultural Solutions division focuses on four areas to help 
farmers to find the right balance between productivity and 
 
sustainability."
"The focus areas are more climate-smart farming, 
more sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart stewardship 
(see box on page 36)."
"In this context, we work with farmers to create 
balanced agricultural systems which enable productive and efficient 
farming of high-quality food products and at the same time promote 
biodiversity in the agricultural landscape."
"For example, we advise 
them on soil cultivation practices and look for suitable ways to 
 
improve biodiversity in farmlands."
"Our many years of experience in 
sustainability measurement and evaluation in agriculture are 
 
particularly useful here."
"Our modern seed solutions and crop 
 
protection products also enable better yield on existing farmlands 
and thus help protect natural habitats."
"With our AgBalance® method, we can measure and compare the 
impacts of different agricultural practices on the environment 
 
according to the principle of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)."
"Using the 
corresponding biodiversity calculator, we can assess the impact on 
biodiversity."
"Axalion® is one example of BASF’s more environmentally friendly 
crop protection products."
"The insecticidal active ingredient received 
its first approval in Australia at the end of 2022 and has been 
 
sold there under the name Efficon® since April 2023."
"Approval was 
also granted in South Korea in 2023."
"Axalion® enables farmers to 
control a wide range of piercing and sucking pests that are harmful 
to crops."
"At the same time, it is highly compatible with beneficial 
insects such as pollinators."
"The active ingredient thus supports 
farmers in managing the challenges they face around productivity 
and environmental protection."
"We have laid down our expectations of our 
 
suppliers with regard to environmental, labor and social standards in 
the supply chain as well as our commitment to preserving 
 
biodiversity in the Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159)."
BASF procures various renewable raw materials.
"Just as for fossil 
raw materials, we consider how renewable resources impact 
 
aspects of sustainability along the value chain."
"Alongside positive 
effects like avoiding greenhouse gas emissions (driver of biodiversity 
loss: climate change), these can also have negative effects, for 
 
example, through the drivers of biodiversity loss overexploitation 
and land-use change, depending on the raw material."
"Through our 
sourcing practices, we aim to preserve ecosystems and enable 
sustainable land development that supports the livelihoods of the 
people who depend on them (see page 122)."
"There is a high risk especially for palm and palm kernel oil that forest 
areas are cleared to create farmland."
"To anchor sustainability topics 
more firmly in procurement we established the BASF Palm 
 
Commitment in 2011, which was updated in 2015, and is 
 
implemented through our Palm Sourcing Policy."
"Third-party 
 
certification with standards such as the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO) standard enables us to take biodiversity criteria into 
account when purchasing raw materials (see page 122)."
"We are committed to the environmental sustainability of other supply 
chains through our own initiatives."
"One example is our rambutan 
program."
"It was launched in 2014 in close collaboration with 
 
partners in Vietnam to source botanical ingredients for cosmetic 
products from certified organic rambutan gardens."
"In cooperation 
with local farmers and NGOs, BASF’s program promotes the 
 
preservation of biodiverse habitats, as well as good agricultural 
practices, gender equity and fair working conditions."
"Our position on forest protection sets out our commitment to 
 
preserving biodiversity in areas of High Conservation Value such as 
High Carbon Stock forest areas and peatlands in the procurement 
of renewable raw materials."
"In 2023, BASF again participated in the 
“Forests” assessment conducted by the international organization 
CDP and achieved a score of A-, once more giving it Leadership 
status."
"The assessment is conducted based on detailed insights 
into the palm value chain and activities that impact ecosystems and 
natural habitats."
"For more information on the CDP forests questionnaire, see basf.com/en/cdp
Partnerships for biodiversity
Engaging in ongoing dialog with a variety of stakeholders is 
 
important to BASF."
"On the one hand, we want to share our 
 
knowledge and on the other hand, learn from other to improve our 
own practices."
"To this end, we established a Nature Advisory 
Council (NAC) in 2023 (see page 117)."
"We cooperate with several organizations including the Roundtable 
on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Sustainable Palm Oil Forum, the 
 
Brazilian Coalition on Climate, Forests and Agriculture and the High 
Carbon Stock Approach Steering Group."
"BASF is a member in the 
forum of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) initiative, which provides recommendations for reporting on 
nature-related risks and activities."
"We are an active advisory 
 
member of the working group for chemical sector guidelines that 
TNFD established at the beginning of 2023."
"Our involvement in 
 
organizations such as the Alliance to End Plastic Waste and the 
 
Alliance for Water Stewardship (see page 113) helps to preserve 
biodiversity in bodies of water."
"Together with international partners and based on the dialog with 
stakeholders in the food value chain, we are driving forward 
measures to promote sustainable agriculture."
"In the United States, 
for example, BASF is a member of the Honey Bee Health Coalition, 
which aims to preserve healthy honey bee populations and support 
healthy populations of native and managed pollinators in productive 
agricultural systems and thriving ecosystems."
"BASF France SAS 
 
is part of the Entreprises pour l’Environnement network, which 
 
launched the Act4nature campaign with the main objective of 
 
protecting and enhancing biodiversity."
"We have been working with farms in the United Kingdom on pilot 
projects since 2002 to demonstrate how the protection of 
 
biodiversity can be reconciled with the complex challenges farmers 
face."
"Local farmers grow a variety of annual crops to establish 
 
demonstration plots."
"Data collected and analyzed on one of 
the farms between 2009 and 2019 by a team of local agronomists 
and ornithologists on behalf of BASF shows that farmland bird 
species considered threatened by U.K."
"experts (26 on the Red List 
and 19 on the Amber List) benefit greatly from sustainable 
 
agriculture combined with high-quality ecological habitats."
"For more than 10 years, we have been working with different 
 
farmers and experts from the BASF FarmNetwork Sustainability, an 
 
association of farms in Europe, to integrate more connected 
 
biodiversity areas into agricultural production."
"By creating and 
 
maintaining new habitats and linking habitats for living, breeding and 
feeding, biodiversity can be sustainably promoted in modern, 
 
conventional agriculture."
"External scientists accompany the project 
and examine the effectiveness of the biodiversity measures."
"The 
 
results are published annually in a report."
"Based on the insights 
gained from working together, an advisory board of experts from 
agriculture, nature conservation and environmental protection 
 
developed a biodiversity checklist and published it in 2021."
"This 
summarizes 10 ecologically effective measures to promote 
 
biodiversity."
"Since 2021, BASF has supported farmers participating 
in its #wirzahlenBiodiversität (“We pay biodiversity”) program 
financially and with professional advice."
"BASF also offers various e-learning modules on biodiversity and 
agriculture to support farmers in implementing the necessary and 
effective measures in practice."
"The interactive training sessions are 
available to all interested farmers free of charge."
"We 
want to use these resources efficiently and responsibly."
"As 
part of our activities to achieve greater sustainability, we are 
turning to recycled and renewable raw materials to replace 
fossil raw materials and reduce emissions along the value 
chain."
"Our focus is on a secure supply and a stable supply 
chain, in which our suppliers source and produce raw 
materials in line with environmental and social requirements."
"At the same time, our chemical products are raw materials 
for our customers and we want to increasingly offer them 
with a reduced carbon footprint."
"Fossil raw materials continue to be among our most important raw 
materials and sourcing and producing them causes greenhouse gas 
emissions, which contribute to climate change."
"We are trying to 
 
reduce these emissions by using recycled and renewable raw 
 
materials."
"However, these alternatives can also pose sustainability 
challenges, such as risks in the supply chain."
"We see one solution in 
a transition to a circular economy in which we want to decouple 
growth from resource consumption with process and product 
 
innovations."
"BASF’s Verbund concept is key to making the use of raw materials 
in our own processes as efficient as possible: Intelligently linking and 
steering our plants and processes creates efficient value chains."
By-products from one plant are used as feedstocks elsewhere.
"This 
saves raw materials and energy."
"At the same time, the Verbund 
 
offers numerous opportunities to use renewable and recycled raw 
materials."
"Going forward, we want to better leverage this potential."
"The Corporate Center unit Corporate Development sets binding, 
Group-wide purchasing guidelines for the procurement of raw 
 
materials."
"They are supplemented by specific internal requirements, 
for example, on sourcing palm-based raw materials or certain 
 
mineral raw materials."
"We use a multistage control process to 
 
ensure compliance with these requirements."
"We systematically 
 
record short and long-term opportunities and risks caused by our 
purchase of raw materials as part of our general opportunity and risk 
 
management (see page 182 onward)."
"Alongside economic, environmental and social criteria, we also 
consider aspects such as product safety and supply security when 
selecting suppliers and raw materials."
"Our expectations of our 
 
suppliers are laid down in our Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 
159)."
"We take a closer look at suppliers in critical supply chains, for 
example, for mineral raw materials and renewable resources as well 
as a number of pigments."
"Upstream stages of the value chain are 
assessed for serious sustainability risks and, if necessary, suitable 
remedial measures are introduced."
"In addition, we develop and test 
approaches in joint initiatives with suppliers and other partners to 
make the supply of raw materials more sustainable."
"Examples 
 
include our cooperative ventures and investments for recycling 
 
lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles (see page 125) and our joint 
activities on certified sustainable supply chains for renewable raw 
materials such as palm, palm kernel and castor oil."
"Resource efficiency and stewardship are also becoming increasingly 
important for our customers."
"That is why we are constantly working to 
switch to more sustainable raw materials and reduce the 
 
resources consumed in the manufacturing of our products, for 
 
example 
through 
more 
efficient 
processes 
and 
innovative 
 
technologies."
"This enables us to offer our customers more 
 
sustainable solutions, for example with a smaller carbon footprint or 
better biodegradability."
"Our products also improve resource 
 
efficiency and sustainability at many points along the value chain."
"For example, BASF additives increase the service life and 
 
mechanical recyclability of plastics, which saves fossil resources, 
 
reduces CO2 emissions and enables a circular economy."
"We use liquid gas and natural gas as fuels to generate 
energy and steam, and as raw materials to produce key basic 
 
chemicals such as ammonia or acetylene."
"Naphtha is mainly fed into 
our steam crackers, where it is split into products such as olefins 
and aromatics."
"The olefins ethylene and propylene are both 
 
important feedstocks for BASF’s numerous value chains."
"We use 
aromatics such as benzene or toluene to manufacture engineering 
plastics, among other products."
"Thanks to a high degree of forward 
and backward integration, we can produce feedstocks for our 
 
value chains efficiently while conserving resources within the BASF 
 
Verbund."
"This increases supply security and strengthens our 
 
resilience to fluctuations in the supply chain."
"We source key raw 
materials from different suppliers to minimize supply risks."
"This also 
applies to natural gas, for which we are further diversifying our 
 
supplier structure due to the changed supply situation in Europe."
"For example, we have signed a long-term supply agreement for 
 
 
 
 
  121
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Raw Materials
liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States starting in 2026."
"In the following years, the agreed delivery volume can cover about 
one third of BASF’s expected natural gas demand in Europe."
"In addition, we have reduced our demand through technical 
 
optimizations in the BASF Production Verbund and converted 
 
further power plants to bivalent operation – they can thus be 
 
operated with natural gas or heating oil."
"We are also continuously 
evaluating whether fossil and petrochemical resources can be 
 
replaced with nonfossil or recycled alternatives."
"Renewable resources 
In addition to fossil resources, we employ renewable raw materials, 
mainly based on vegetable oils, fats, grains, sugar and wood."
"In 2023, we purchased around 1 million metric tons of renewable 
raw materials."
"We use these to produce ingredients for the 
 
detergent and cleaner industry and natural active ingredients for 
 
the cosmetics industry, for example."
"We further use renewable 
feedstocks such as biomethane and bionaphtha in our Verbund as 
an alternative to fossil resources."
"The mass balance approach 
 
allows us to attribute the amount of renewable raw materials used to 
a wide variety of end products (see box on page 124)."
"Our aim is to continuously increase the share of renewable raw 
materials in our value chains."
"Just as for fossil raw materials, we also 
consider economic criteria, aspects of supply security, process and 
product safety and the availability of various raw materials as well as 
the potential impact on sustainability along the value chain."
"Alongside positive effects such as reducing greenhouse gas 
 
emissions, these can also have negative effects, depending on the 
raw materials."
"We therefore take the protection of biodiversity and 
ecosystems into account when sourcing renewable raw materials 
and also include social factors such as working conditions and food 
security in our risk analyses."
"We carefully weigh up advantages and 
disadvantages, for example with life cycle analyses."
"At the same 
time, we seek dialog with our stakeholders to identify conflicting 
goals."
"We also take into consideration recognized certification 
 
standards in our decisions, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO)."
"For our biomass balance portfolio, we source 
 
renewable raw materials that are certified according to recognized 
standards such as the International Sustainability and Carbon 
 
Certification (ISCC) or the organization for sustainably produced 
biomass REDcert."
"As part of our commitment to greater sustainability, we focus on 
supply chains that are relevant quantitatively and are involved where 
there is currently a lack of certification standards."
"We are also 
 
working on product innovations and on enhancing our production 
processes to improve the profitability and competitiveness of 
 
renewable resources."
"For example, we are developing innovative 
 
processes such as biocatalysis and fermentation for the production 
of vitamins and enzymes, and driving forward white biotechnology 
for the production of chemical components from renewable 
 
resources."
"Palm oil, palm kernel oil and their derivatives are some of our most 
important renewable raw materials."
"We mainly use these to produce 
ingredients for the cosmetics, detergent, cleaner and food 
 
industries."
"We aim to ensure that palm-based raw materials come 
from certified sustainable sources."
"We have been a member of the 
RSPO already since 2004 and are involved in other national and 
 
international initiatives, such as the German Forum for Sustainable 
Palm Oil and the High Carbon Stock Approach organization."
"Based 
on our Group-wide Supplier Code of Conduct (see page 159), we 
have outlined our expectations of suppliers in the palm-based value 
chain in an additional sourcing policy (BASF Palm Sourcing Policy)."
"This addresses aspects such as forest and peat conservation, 
 
respect for human and labor rights, smallholder inclusion, and 
 
certification and traceability standards."
"As part of our supplier and 
risk management, we have used the internet platform palmoil.io to 
monitor deforestation activities and other possible breaches of 
 
regulations at our suppliers’ sites."
It replaces the previously published Palm Progress Report.
"We purchased 159,798 metric tons of palm oil and palm kernel oil in 
2023 (2022: 191,714)."
"We again met our own voluntary 
 
commitment to source only RSPO-certified palm oil and palm kernel 
oil."
"This avoided more than 225,000 metric tons of carbon 
 
emissions compared with the procurement of conventional palm oil 
and palm kernel oil."
"As part of our voluntary commitment, we also 
aim to procure the main derivatives1 based on palm oil and palm 
kernel oil entirely from certified sustainable sources by 2025."
"In 
 
addition, we maintained the RSPO supply chain certification of our 
sites for cosmetic ingredients."
"At the end of 2023, 25 production 
sites worldwide were certified by the RSPO (2022: 25)."
"We source most of our palm-based raw materials from Malaysia and 
Indonesia."
"As of the end of 2023, we were able to trace around 96% 
of our global palm footprint2 to oil mill level (2022: 97%)."
"Smallholders account for around one-third of the total volumes 
produced there."
"We are involved in local initiatives to expand our 
supplier base for RSPO-certified palm oil products while 
 
strengthening smallholder structures and sustainable production 
methods at local level."
"Since 2018 we have been working together 
with The Estée Lauder Companies, the RSPO and civil society 
 
organization Solidaridad in Indonesia."
"122
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Raw Materials
and palm kernel oil."
"Upon completion of the project, the declared 
goal of certifying one-third of the participants of the program 
 
according to the RSPO Smallholder Standard was almost achieved 
(313 certifications)."
"In 2023, BASF partnered with a leading natural 
cosmetics manufacturer and the Indonesian nonprofit organization 
Kaleka to support smallholders in Central Kalimantan."
"The aim is to 
promote regenerative agricultural methods as well as to help 
 
establish political framework conditions and regulations."
"We are also 
involved in a local project in Sumatra through the Forum for 
 
Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP)."
"Also important for BASF, albeit at a much smaller scale, is castor oil."
"We use castor oil to manufacture products such as plastics and 
 
ingredients for paints and coatings, as well as products for the 
cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries."
"With the objective of 
 
establishing a certified sustainable supply chain for castor oil, we 
launched the Sustainable Castor Initiative – Pragati in 2016 together 
with the companies Arkema and Jayant Agro and with Solidaridad."
"The initiative aims to improve the economic situation of castor bean 
farmers in India and, at the same time, raise awareness of 
 
sustainable farming methods."
"Over 80% of the world’s castor beans 
are produced in India, mainly by smallholders."
"As part of Pragati, 
smallholder farmers receive training on topics such as cultivation 
methods, efficient water use, health and the safe use of crop 
 
protection products based on a specially developed sustainability 
code, SuCCESS."
"Since the project was initiated, more than 
 
7,000 smallholders and over 27,000 hectares of land have been 
certified for sustainable castor cultivation."
"Yields from this land were 
36% higher than average amounts for the region published by the 
local government for the 2022/2023 harvest cycle."
"In addition to 
 
SuCCESS, the Sustainable Castor Association (SCA), which was 
launched in 2019 by the founders of the Pragati initiative, has also 
developed a sustainability code for the wider supply chain."
"This will 
allow castor beans obtained from the program to be further 
 
processed into certified castor oil and derivatives and to be 
 
introduced into the downstream supply chain."
"In 2023, we again 
sourced certified sustainable castor oil from the program after our 
Düsseldorf-Holthausen site in Germany became the first chemical 
company in the world to be certified in 2021."
"The site supplies 
customers with the first certified products based on certified 
 
sustainable castor oil."
"We are also driving the market transformation toward certified, 
 
sustainably sourced oleochemicals for another renewable raw 
 
material: coconut oil."
"We use coconut oil to manufacture 
 
ingredients for products such as detergents, cleaning agents and 
cosmetics."
"BASF is the world’s first chemical company to offer 
 
certified sustainable ingredients for personal care products based 
on coconut oil."
"Following our production site in Cassina Rizzardi, 
 
Italy, we successfully certified another site in Zona Franca, Spain, 
under the Rainforest Alliance Mass Balance Coconut scheme 
 
in 2023."
"Plants also form the basis of many other products in our portfolio for 
cosmetics."
"These include our biopolymers, which we have been

  Combined Management’s Report – Raw Materials
Recycled feedstocks
Recycling is playing an increasingly important role due to limited 
 
resources, growing sustainability requirements in the markets, and 
regulatory developments."
"In a challenging environment with limited 
availability of alternative raw materials, we still aim to process 
250,000 metric tons of recycled and waste-based raw materials in 
our production plants annually from 2025, replacing fossil raw 
 
materials."
"A focal point of our activities here is the chemical recycling of 
 
plastics."
"This technology complements mechanical recycling and 
can help to reduce the amount of plastic waste that is disposed of 
in landfills or thermally recovered."
"Chemical recycling breaks down 
plastics into their building blocks or converts them into basic 
 
chemicals."
Different methods are used to achieve this.
"In our ChemCycling® project, our technology partners use the 
 
pyrolysis process to extract pyrolysis oil from mixed plastic waste or 
end-of-life tires, which are not mechanically recycled as of yet."
"We 
feed the pyrolysis oil into the BASF Verbund as a substitute for fossil 
raw materials and manufacture new products from it using the mass 
balance principle (see page 124)."
"Our customers can process these 
mass balanced products in the same way as conventional products."
"Our portfolio of Ccycled® products now comprises around 
 
240 products, which our customers use for a wide range of applica-
tions – from food packaging and transport cases for temperature- 
sensitive drugs to high-performance plastics for the automotive 
 
industry and functional textiles."
"In order to expand our customer 
portfolio with mass balanced Ccycled® products, we signed a new 
cooperation agreement with our partner Pyrum in 2023."
"This 
 
provides for a conditional loan of initially €25 million."
"It is intended to 
serve as startup financing for the planning, project development 
 
and construction of at least three new Pyrum plants, each with an 
annual capacity of 20,000 metric tons of end-of-life tires."
"BASF 
 
intends to use the pyrolysis oil produced in the new plants as a 
 
recycled raw material in production."
"Good to know
The mass balance approach
Many BASF value chains start in syngas plants or steam crackers, 
where fossil resources, mostly natural gas and naphtha, are 
converted into hydrogen and carbon monoxide or important basic 
chemicals such as ethylene and propylene."
"These are used to 
create thousands of products in the BASF Verbund."
"In addition to fossil raw materials, we feed alternative raw materials 
into the Verbund that come from bio-based and chemically 
 
recycled sources, such as bionaphtha, biomethane and pyrolysis 
oil."
"These alternatives are used in place of fossil feedstocks for our 
mass balance products."
"As fossil, bio-based and recycled 
 
feedstocks are processed simultaneously, the raw materials 
 
cannot be directly physically assigned to resulting derivatives."
"However, through monitoring by independent third parties such as 
TÜV Nord on the basis of recognized certification systems, such 
as REDcert2 or ISCC PLUS, it can be verified that an adequate 
amount of alternative raw materials has been used for the amount 
of mass balance sales product."
"This ensures that fossil raw 
 
materials are saved with every sale of these certified products."
"Mass balanced products are identical in quality to conventionally 
produced products, but the use of alternative raw materials 
 
contributes to sustainability, for example, through fewer carbon 
emissions and lower demand for fossil raw materials."
"This method 
has already been applied to over 1,400 BASF products including 
engineering 
plastics 
such 
as 
polyamide 
as 
well 
as 
 
superabsorbents, dispersions and intermediates."

In addition, BASF continues to drive forward the recycling of foams 
from used mattresses."
"Using a process developed by BASF, the raw 
materials can be recovered from flexible polyurethane foams to 
produce new mattresses."
"Thanks to this new process, in 2023, our 
cooperation partner NEVEON was able to produce new 
 
polyurethane foams from the polyol recovered for the first time 
 
on a metric ton scale."
"The mattresses produced with this material 
 
contain 80% recycled content in the polyol component."
"Approximately 100 mattresses produced using this process are 
used exclusively in BASF’s own business hotel René Bohn in 
 
Ludwigshafen, Germany."
"We have many years of experience and a high degree of 
 
specialization in recycling precious metals such as platinum, 
 
palladium and rhodium."
"They are used in mobile emissions catalysts 
as well as in process and chemical catalysts."
"We primarily use the 
precious metals recovered in this way as feedstocks to manufacture 
new products for the automotive, chemical, electronics and green 
hydrogen industries."
"The carbon footprint for recycled precious 
metals is up to 90% lower than for primary metals from a mine."
"With the rapidly growing market for electric vehicles, there is also an 
increasing need for recycling lithium-ion batteries."
"As a leading 
producer of battery materials with local production capacities in the 
three main markets – Asia, Europe and North America – BASF has 
in-depth expertise in battery chemistry and process technology."
"We 
are utilizing these competencies to address battery recycling as an 
additional growth market in cooperation with partners along the 
value chain (see page 32)."
"In this way, we want to ensure that 
 
valuable metals remain in the production cycle for as long as 
 
possible."
"This conserves resources and significantly reduces the 
carbon footprint of cathode active materials compared with the 
 
industry standard."
"At our site in Schwarzheide, Germany, a new 
plant for the production of black mass from spent lithium-ion 
 
batteries and battery production waste will be built in the course of 
2024, as well as a prototype plant for a metal refinery, which is 
scheduled for completion in early 2024."
"This will allow for the 
 
development of new operating procedures and optimization of 
technology to deliver superior recovery rates of metals, such as 
 
lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, from the black mass."
"In 
 
addition, we will produce cathode active materials from recycled 
metals on a commercial scale at our U.S."
"site in Battle Creek, 
 
Michigan, from 2024."
"This will reduce the carbon footprint of 
 
cathode active materials by around 25% compared with the use 
 
of primary metals."
"These are used in the lithium-ion battery cells 
from our partner Nanotech Energy."
"Together with Nanotech Energy, 
American Battery Technology Company (ABTC) and TODA 
 
Advanced Materials Inc."
"(TODA), we are aiming to establish a local 
battery value chain in a closed cycle."
"For more information on circular economy, see page 46
Mineral raw materials
We procure a number of mineral raw materials, which we use to 
produce automotive and process catalysts or battery materials for 
electromobility, among other products."
"We are continually improving 
our products and processes to minimize the use of primary mineral 
raw materials."
"Responsible sourcing of mineral raw materials is important to BASF 
as we are aware of the challenges in the supply chain and our due 
diligence."
We have implemented the E.U.
"Conflict Minerals 
 
Regulation."
"This defines supply chain due diligence for tin, tantalum, 
tungsten and their ores as well as gold (3TG) imported into the E.U."
from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs).
"In addition, BASF is committed to responsible and sustainable 
 
global supply chains for other mineral raw materials."
"These include 
cobalt, a key component in the production of battery materials."
"We 
have organized our cobalt supply chain according to established 
sustainability guidelines such as the OECD Due Diligence Guidance 
for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals."
"Our goal is to not 
purchase cobalt from artisanal mines as long as responsible labor, 
social and environmental standards cannot be verified."
"Together with BMW Group, Samsung SDI Co."
"Ltd., Samsung 
 
Electronics Co."
"Ltd., Volkswagen AG, Stihl AG & Co."
"KG and GIZ, 
we have been involved in the cross-industry Cobalt for Development 
initiative since 2018."
"It aims to improve working and living conditions 
for artisanal miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"To achieve 
this, the initiative offers programs such as training on important 
 
environmental, social and governance aspects of responsible 
 
mining practices."
"In 2023, mining cooperatives continued to receive 
trainings on topics such as occupational safety and environmental 
management."
"Furthermore, together with local nongovernmental 
organizations and Bon Pasteur/the Good Shepherd International 
Foundation, GIZ is supporting local communities to develop stable 
sources of income as an alternative to mining."
"Residents are trained, 
for example, in farming during the dry season, learning a trade, 
starting a business and using financial resources effectively."
"As a 
result, households have increased their income by 36% and are 
better able to cope with crises or shortages."
"Around 3,000 people 
are already benefiting from this."
"The pilot project has also financed 
the construction and equipment of a school, provided educational 
training for teachers and developed teaching materials."
"Today, 600 
children are taught in a new school building."
"BASF is currently exploring an investment to develop a nickel-cobalt 
refining complex in Indonesia together with Eramet, a global mining 
and metallurgy company, to supply cathode active materials to the 
growing electric vehicle market."
"BASF has not yet decided whether 
this project will be implemented."
"Part of the evaluation process is 
 
an intensive review and assessment of environmental, social and 
 
governance risks (ESG)."
"We are also involved in various German and international initiatives 
to strengthen sustainability and innovation in the value chain for 
batteries."
"For example, we are a partner in a consortium led by the 
system change consultancy Systemiq that has received funding of 
€8.2 million from the German Federal Ministry of Economics and 
Climate Action to develop a digital product passport for batteries."
This aims to address the requirements of the E.U.
"Battery Regulation 
and both capture data that maps information about the origin of raw 
materials and create the basis for an efficient circular economy."
"125

Close cooperation with the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) is also 
intended to ensure global compatibility of the digital battery passport."
"Cofounded by BASF in 2017, the GBA has over 150 members and 
promotes dialog between business, governments and civil society."
"It develops the steering tools aiming to establish a sustainable and 
responsible battery circular economy by 2030."
"Following the 
 
publication of the Greenhouse Gas Rulebook in 2022, the GBA 
 
unveiled a revised edition in 2023 as the result of a public 
 
consultation."
"As the first framework of its kind, it contains around 80 
specifications and rules for the globally harmonized – and therefore 
comparable – accounting of greenhouse gas emissions along the 
battery value chain."
"As an impartial platform, GBA strives to facilitate 
a consensus between the relevant stakeholders."
"The aim of this and 
further rulebooks is to create transparency for comprehensive and 
standardized reporting of ESG topics on the basis of broad 
 
acceptance."
"Together with BMW Group, Mercedes-Benz AG, Fairphone B.V., 
Daimler Truck AG and Volkswagen Group, we have also been a 
member of the Responsible Lithium Partnership since 2021."
"It 
advocates for the responsible use of natural resources in Chile’s 
Salar de Atacama, home to the world’s largest lithium reserves and 
a significant portion of global production."
"To this end, GIZ was 
 
commissioned to organize a local multistakeholder platform on the 
water-related opportunities and risks of lithium and copper mining 
and other economic activities and to promote action plans."
"BASF 
participated in a study organized by BMW together with experts 
from the University of Alaska and the University of Massachusetts to 
investigate hydrological conditions in the Salar de Atacama."
"The 
results of this study are incorporated as an important component of 
the Responsible Lithium Partnership’s work."
"Another mineral raw material that BASF processes is mica.1 As a 
base for effect pigments, it is mainly used in the production of 
 
coatings and seed coatings."
"BASF is conscious of its social 
 
responsibility with regard to mica sourcing and applies high 
 
standards which, among other things, exclude child labor."
"Suppliers 
are asked to source mica in accordance with our Supplier Code of 
Conduct."
"As an active member of the Responsible Mica Initiative 
(RMI), we advocate for the eradication of child labor and 
 
unacceptable working conditions, specifically in India’s mica supply 
chain."
"The initiative focuses on labor standards, strengthening local 
communities and legal frameworks."
"As RMI’s most recent progress 
report shows, activities in the relevant regions of India have already 
led to improved income and living conditions."
"These include 
 
improved access to clean drinking water through the installation of 
pumps and filtration systems and improved access to health care 
through doctors’ visits in villages and enrollment in public health 
 
insurance plans."
"In colloquial language, mica minerals are referred to as mica."

safety measures."
"In order to maintain a high level of safety at our plants worldwide 
over their entire life cycles, we carry out implementation checks in all 
our plants at regular intervals based on risk potential to verify the 
implementation of our safety concepts."
"This also applies to the 
timely completion of the prescribed (process) safety assessments 
and the resulting safety measures."
"We regularly update our plants’ 
safety concepts, taking into particular account new findings, 
 
technological opportunities and regulatory developments."
"We use the number of High Severity Process Safety Incidents 
 
(hsPSI) per 200,000 working hours as a reporting indicator."
"We have 
set ourselves the target of reducing High Severity Process Safety 
Incidents to a rate of no more than 0.10 per 200,000 working hours 
by 2030.1 In 2023, we recorded 0.05 hsPSI per 200,000 working 
hours worldwide."
"The rate of all process safety incidents in the 
BASF  Group was 0.3 in 2023 (2022: 0.3)."
"We investigate every 
 
incident in detail, analyze causes and use the findings to derive 
suitable measures."
"We share the findings in our global network in 
the interest of continuous improvement."
"“ 
We focus our targets on high-severity 
incidents in order to focus more 
strongly on people."
"Gert Van Bortel
To reduce process safety incidents, we focus in particular on 
 
technical measures, digital solutions and on a leadership culture that 
places even greater emphasis on process safety and dealing openly 
with mistakes."
"In addition, we are continually refining and expanding 
our training methods and offerings to increase risk awareness and 
strengthen our safety culture."
"In 2023, for example, a program to 
reduce process incidents at our site in Pudong, China, focused on 
the topic of tightness and the prevention of leaks and covered this in 
training courses."
"Similar to a flight simulator, OTS systems can be used 
to simulate the processes of complex chemical plants."
"In this way, new employees can familiarize themselves with their field of 
work in a practical manner."
"They can train how to operate the plant, which 
valves need to be opened or closed under which conditions and which 
trends in the process control system are particularly important to keep an 
eye on."
"An OTS can also be used to simulate conditions that rarely occur 
in day-to-day work – such as exceptional malfunctions."
"The simulator is 
therefore also suitable for training experienced employees."
"By using OTSs, we want to further increase the operational safety of 
 
our plants and rectify faults faster and better."
"Several of our operating 
divisions use simulators."
"The Petrochemicals division is currently 
 
developing OTSs for all of its plant clusters at the Verbund site under 
 
construction in Zhanjiang, China, in close cooperation with the Global 
Engineering Services unit."
"The advantage of considering an OTS at the 
same time as planning new projects is that weak points can be identified 
and rectified before construction begins."
"In Nanjing, China; Port Arthur, Texas; Ludwigshafen, Germany; and 
 
Antwerp, Belgium, the simulators have already been in successful use at 
selected plants for several years."
"Should an emergency nevertheless arise, 
 
we have established structures and processes that enable 
effective crisis management."
"Strategy and governance
We want to be as prepared as possible for crisis situations at global, 
regional and local level – from process safety incidents to goods 
spillages and emergencies – through extensive emergency 
 
preparedness and emergency response regulations and measures."
"That is why our emergency and crisis management focuses on 
the protection of our employees, contractors and neighbors, the 
safety of our plants and sites, and the protection of the environment."
"To ensure rapid and effective crisis management, we have defined 
appropriate structures and processes and laid them down in binding 
Group-wide requirements."
"Our sites and Group companies are 
 
responsible for implementing and complying with these internal 
 
requirements and the legal specifications."
"The Environmental 
 
Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate 
Center conducts regular audits to monitor this."
"Unusual incidents are recorded and reported centrally in accordance 
with a standardized Group-wide procedure (e-Rapid Incident 
 
Report)."
"The aim is to identify risks at an early stage and, if 
 
necessary, initiate appropriate remedial and communication 
 
measures."
"All incidents are followed up on to identify potential for 
improvement, which is integrated into existing concepts as needed."
"Organization and responsibilities
Incidents are initially handled by the local crisis organization or local 
emergency response team."
"We have implemented precautionary 
organizational measures with clearly defined responsibilities and 
procedures at all sites for this purpose."
"The employees responsible 
receive regular training."
"This includes safety and emergency drills, 
which vary in scope and the number of people involved."
"Depending 
on the situation, we also involve business partners and our sites’ 
communities, such as local authorities or neighboring companies, 
both in drills and in the event of an emergency."
"Additional teams 
may be called in for emergencies, depending on the extent of the 
damage and how it develops."
"The Global Crisis Management Support Team (GCMS), led by a 
member of the Board of Executive Directors is activated in the event 
of a crisis situation."
"It provides the strategic direction for crisis 
 
management and is supported by issue-specific and specialist 
working groups."
"We are involved in external networks, which quickly provide 
information and assistance in emergencies."
"These include the 
 
International Chemical and Environmental (ICE) initiative and 
 
the German Transport Accident Information and Emergency 
 
Response System (TUIS), in which BASF plays a coordinating role."

"We have defined our regulations for Responsible 
Care audits in a global Corporate Requirement."
"The Board of 
 
Executive Directors is regularly informed about the results of the 
audits."
"Newly acquired sites and companies are generally audited 
for the first time after the integration phase is complete, generally 
within one to two years depending on complexity and number of 
sites."
"During our audits, we create a safety and environmental 
 
profile that shows if we are properly addressing the hazard potential."
"If this is not the case, we agree on corrective measures to be 
 
implemented within a certain time frame depending on the identified 
hazard potential."
"We monitor this in follow-up audits, among other 
things."
"In the BASF Group in 2023, 120 environmental and safety audits 
were conducted at 72 sites (2022: 115 audits at 73 sites)."
"The sites 
were audited based on their individual risk profile."
"Auditing of the 
sites acquired in 2020 from Solvay was interrupted due to local 
 
coronavirus restrictions in 2022 was continued and completed in 
the 2023 reporting year."
"In addition, eight sites were audited on 
 
occupational medicine and health protection (2022: 16)."
"We want to attract and retain talents for our 
 
company and support them in their development."
"To do so, 
we strive to cultivate a working environment that inspires and 
connects people."
"It is founded on a culture of open leadership 
based on mutual trust, respect and dedication to top 
performance."
That is why we rely on our employees and leaders.
"We help 
them to develop the necessary skills to support our customers in the 
best possible way and provide them with the tools they need to do 
so."
"We promote a working atmosphere based on mutual trust with 
attractive working conditions, in which employees can develop their 
individual skills and potential."
"We want to further strengthen our 
employee engagement and innovative power through the inclusion 
of diversity."
"This also positions us to meet the challenges of an 
 
increasingly rapidly changing environment."
"Nevertheless, attracting and retaining qualified employees presents 
us with an increasing number of challenges and risks."
"By offering 
various learning and development opportunities as well as attractive 
compensation and benefits, and with our commitment to supporting 
a balance between personal and professional life, we want to 
maintain our reputation as an attractive employer."
"In order to 
continue to attract and retain talents for our company in the future, 
we work continuously on BASF’s attractiveness as an employer."
"We 
systematically record short and long-term opportunities and risks as 
part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 182 
onward)."
"Number of employees 
As of December 31, 2023, the number of employees increased to 
111,991 employees compared with 111,481 employees as of 
 
December 31, 2022."
"The rise was primarily due to staff increases in 
Asia Pacific, especially for the new Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China."
"This was partially offset by retirements and departures due to 
dormant employment as well as measures in connection with 
 
the cost savings program focusing on Europe."
"We employed 
3,045 apprentices (2022: 3,049), of which 21.3% were women."
"A total of 2,305 employees were on temporary contracts (of which 
43.4% were women)."

Employee engagement
BASF can rely on the engagement of its employees."
"Employee 
surveys and pulse checks are used as feedback tools to actively 
involve employees in shaping their working environment."
"The results 
are communicated to employees, the Board of Executive Directors 
and the Supervisory Board, among others."
"We have performed regular global employee surveys since 2008, 
and since 2019, we have also recorded the employee engagement 
level as an index score based on the answers to five key questions."
"Overall, more than 84,400 employees worldwide participated in 
 
the 2023 survey (participation rate: 74%1)."
"The survey revealed 
 
an engagement index of 79%, which constitutes a drop of two 
 
percentage points compared with the previous year (2022: 81%)."
"Our aim is to get this score back above 80%, the target defined in 
the BASF strategy."
"We support our leaders in addressing topics that 
help to strengthen employee engagement together with their teams 
in a decentralized way."
"In addition, in 2023, we launched the 
centrally coordinated initiative “Learn from the Best.” As part of 
 
the initiative, BASF units from all regions that have achieved 
 
exceptionally high levels of employee engagement are presented."
"These examples serve not just as inspiration for others, but also 
promote cross-unit exchange."
"What we expect from our leaders
Our leaders and their teams should contribute to BASF’s success."
"This is why we promote high-quality leadership and measure its 
impact."
"We understand impactful leadership as leaders that serve 
as role models by having – in line with our corporate values – a 
positive influence on the engagement and development of their 
employees, and by developing and implementing business 
 
strategies together with their teams."
"These aspects are part of the 
standard global nomination criteria for leadership positions."
"Our leadership culture is based on BASF’s corporate values 
 
(see page 33) and our specific expectations of leaders’ conduct are 
derived from these: The CORE Leadership Values serve as the 
guiding principles for all leaders and set out our expectations of 
leadership conduct."
"They are aligned with BASF’s strategic goals 
and reflect our company’s leadership vision."
"By offering a wide range of targeted training and development 
 
opportunities for leaders at all levels, we help to ensure the future 
viability of BASF."
"We offer our leaders opportunities for each phase 
of their career as well as various formats that enable them to learn 
from one another and from external experts."
"We aim to develop 
leaders who lead their teams with professional competence, 
 
optimism, empathy and trust, and in this way, create a competitive 
advantage for BASF."
"In order to further anchor the CORE Leadership Values in day- 
to-day work, the focus topic Care and Coach for Performance 
was defined for our leadership training in 2023."
"We gave leaders 
impetus to work on the topic of resilience and to further strengthen 
their role as coaches (see page 135)."
"These virtual training courses 
and inspirational events provided senior executives in particular with 
opportunities for self-reflection, global exchange, practicing and 
consolidating competencies and skills."
"To identify and develop the best talent at an early stage, we also 
 
use potential assessments."
"Among other things, we identify 
 
indicators for future leadership success and compare the skills 
 
already developed by the talents with the requirements for 
 
management tasks with greater responsibility."
"This enables us to 
offer even more targeted development opportunities and help 
 
to further increase the quality and number of our potential leaders."
"Regular feedback plays an important role in the development of 
leaders."
"In 2023, we did not make it mandatory to use our global 
feedback tool FEEDback&forward."
"Nevertheless, 800 leaders 
 
voluntarily used the tool and obtained valuable feedback from their 
teams."
This corresponds to around 10% of our leaders.
"In 2024, we 
will make using our leadership feedback tool mandatory again."
"Competition for talent
Attracting and retaining the best employees is crucial to our 
 
success."
"Having an attractive and compelling total offer package for 
employees is becoming increasingly important considering the 
strong global competition for the best qualified employees and 
leaders."
"This is why we are constantly working on measures to 
better appeal to talents worldwide and are increasingly using digital 
platforms such as our country-specific career websites as well as 
global and regional social networks."
"Our talent search activities in 2023 were based on a mix of 
 
face-to-face events and digital offerings."
"For example, we are 
 
represented at digital trade fairs and conferences."
"This virtual 
 
contact enables a demand-oriented, flexible and location- 
independent approach."
"As a result, we were able to continue to 
 
attract and recruit talented employees."
"In 2023, we introduced a new digital recruitment tool in Europe, 
North America and South America."
"On this basis, we have 
 
established a global recruiting process."
"The new system offers 
 
improved user-friendliness and is designed to speed up the 
 
recruitment process."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) features enable people 
applying to BASF to match their CV with all job offers."
"The solution 
is scheduled for launch in Asia Pacific in 2024."
"We want to ensure the availability of qualified employees and 
 
safeguard existing knowledge today and in the years to come."
"At 
the BASF SE site in Ludwigshafen, Germany, we perform analyses 
to make the demographic situation for different operational job 
 
profiles transparent for the responsible leaders."
"On this basis, we 
offer specific measures for succession planning, knowledge sharing 
and moderated knowledge transfer."

skilled workers in production and technical areas in Ludwigshafen, 
Germany, we increasingly used social media channels to alert 
 
qualified specialists to career prospects at BASF in 2023."
"We also 
cooperated with the German employment agency, for example, to 
target skilled workers at informational events and to recruit suitable 
candidates for BASF who are currently available on the labor market 
or will be in the near future."
"We once again achieved high scores in a number of employer 
 
rankings in 2023."
"For example, in a study conducted by Universum, 
young scientists ranked BASF as the sixth most attractive employer 
in Germany (2022: seventh)."
"In North America, BASF was named as 
one of the top 50 companies for diversity for the 11th consecutive 
year by Fair360 (formerly DiversityInc)."
"In Asia, Top Employer 
 
recognized BASF China as one of the best employers for the 13th 
time in succession."
"The BASF Group hired 9,168 new employees in 2023."
"The 
 
percentage of employees who resigned during their first three years 
of employment – the early turnover rate – was 1.4% worldwide in 
2023."
"This turnover rate was 0.8% in Europe, 3.0% in North 
 
America, 1.9% in Asia Pacific and 2.3% in South America, Africa, 
Middle East."
"The voluntary turnover rate, or the proportion of employees who left 
the company voluntarily, amounted to 3.5% globally."
"This rate was 
2.2% in Europe, 7.1% in North America, 4.7% in Asia 
 
Pacific and 5.2% in South America, Africa, Middle East."
"As of December 31, 2023, the BASF Group was training 3,045 people 
in various occupations."
"We spent a total of around €130 million on 
vocational training in 2023."
"The skills and 
 
competencies of our employees are critical for profitable growth 
and lasting success."
"For this reason, we want to further modernize 
our learning culture and step up our efforts to promote continuous, 
self-directed learning and learning from others."
"Employee 
 
development at BASF is underpinned by the principle that 
 
development opportunities and support are open to all employees."
"We understand development as continuous learning by building 
 
individual experience and skills, further training or changing jobs."
"A 
trust-based relationship between employees and leaders as well as 
regular feedback through continuous meaningful conversations are 
crucial to employee development."
"These regular conversations can 
be initiated by both leaders or employees and take different forms – 
leaders and employees can agree on this in the annual employee 
dialog."
"Employees also define their individual learning objectives together 
with their leader as part of the continuous conversations."
"These are 
to be adapted to the specific requirements of the position concerned 
and future needs."
"Learning can take place in various formats and at 
different locations – at work, as social or formal training – depending 
on individual and workplace demands."
"Our learning opportunities are available for a variety of employee 
development needs: starting a career, expanding knowledge, 
 
personal growth and leadership development."
"In 2023, we focused 
some offers on strengthening resilience (see page 135)."
"In 
 
addition, the many academies in the divisions and service units offer 
training on specific professional content."
"Since 2023, we have been 
offering Campus Events for newcomers in all regions to welcome 
them to BASF, share general information such as our strategy and 
give them the opportunity to network with each other."
"To achieve our ambitious digitalization goals, we are focusing on 
digital skills development of our leaders and employees, as well as 
on agile transformation."
"One example of this is our training course 
on the current development of generative AI applications."
"We offer 
content on this topic for various target groups in the form of self-led 
learning paths, training courses and individual or group coaching."
"In this way, we want to enable BASF employees to gain an 
 
understanding of data, data analysis and AI."
"After all, in order to 
exploit the full potential of AI solutions, it is essential to combine new 
technologies with the experience and expertise of employees."
"Employees can gain practical experience using the chatBASF AI 
assistant."
"Our employees’ compensation is based on global 
compensation principles according to position, market and 
 
performance."
"As a rule, compensation comprises fixed and variable 
components as well as benefits that often exceed legal 
 
requirements."
"In many countries, these benefits include company 
pension benefits, supplementary health insurance and share 
 
programs."
"We regularly review our compensation systems at the 
global and local levels."
We are committed to the U.N.
"Global 
 
Compact’s goal of paying employees a living wage to support them 
and their families by 2030."
"Since 2022, we have been conducting 
 
a global analysis to determine whether we pay employees such a 
wage and to close any gaps."
We want our employees to contribute to the company’s success.
"This is why the compensation granted to the vast majority of our 
employees includes variable compensation components, with which 
they participate in the success of the BASF Group as a whole and 
are recognized for their individual performance."
"The same principles 
essentially apply for all employees worldwide."
"The amount of the 
variable component is determined by economic success as well as 
the employee’s individual performance."
"We use the BASF Group’s 
return on capital employed (ROCE) to measure economic success 
for the purposes of variable compensation."
"This links variable 
 
compensation to our ROCE target.1 Individual performance is 
 
assessed as part of a globally consistent performance management 
process."
"In numerous Group companies, our “plus” share program 
ensures employees’ long-term participation in the company’s 
 
success through incentive shares."
"In 2023, for example, around 
26,700 employees worldwide (2022: around 27,100) participated in 
the “plus” share program."
"Good to know
Resilience helps in difficult times
Resilient teams and companies with a resilient culture are better 
able to overcome challenges and recover from them more quickly."
"Resilient people can deal with difficulties more easily and use them 
as an opportunity for growth."
"For this reason, and in a challenging 
and increasingly rapidly changing environment, we focused on 
promoting resilience in the learning opportunities for leaders and 
 
in various opportunities for employees in 2023."
"Under the motto 
“Care and Coach for Performance,” we offered our senior 
 
executives various training modules and learning opportunities in 
virtual formats."
"These also included training on how leaders can 
apply a coaching-oriented leadership style and make better use of 
their emotional intelligence."
"As role models and coaches, leaders 
can better promote the strengths of their team members and 
support them in their development."
"In addition, we have provided leaders and employees with a wide 
range of resources and independent learning opportunities to 
 
inform themselves and develop their own skills."
"These included 
 
in particular strategies and rituals for self-care and caring for 
 
employees."
"It is important to us to enable teams to perform at their 
best, even in challenging situations, without neglecting their own 
health."
"This training portfolio was supplemented by tailored 
 
initiatives from our Corporate Health Management (see page 145), 
as well as by regional and local offerings."
"In North America, we 
offer digital solutions that enable affected employees to take 
 
advantage of offers to improve their mental health, regardless of 
their location or working hours."
"Over the past five years, BASF has 
built up a network of employees in the United Kingdom and Ireland 
who act as first aiders for mental health issues (Mental Health First 
Aiders)."
"They complement Corporate Health Management and 
can provide confidential advice and professional support to those 
who need it."
An adjustment of compensation-relevant ROCE (in the first 12 months after closing) therefore only occurs in cases of exceptionally high special items resulting from acquisitions and divestitures.
"BASF offers senior executives the opportunity to participate in a 
long-term incentive (LTI) program1 in the form of a performance 
share plan."
"The four-year program takes into account the 
 
development of the total shareholder return."
"It incentivizes 
 
the achievement of strategic growth, profitability and sustainability 
targets."
"To take part in this program, participants must hold BASF 
shares, the amount of which is based on their individual fixed 
 
compensation."
"In 2023, around 93% of the people eligible to 
 
participate in the long-term incentive program around the world 
 
did so, holding between 30% and 70% of their fixed annual 
 
compensation in BASF shares."
"The share price-based compensation program (BASF option 
 
program, BOP), which had existed since 1999, was offered for the 
last time in 2020."
"Due to the maximum program term of eight years, 
exercise gains from the BOP program can still accrue until 
 
June 30, 2028."
"In the previous year, these amounted to €11,400 million."
"The decline 
was mainly due to the lower additions of bonus provisions, currency 
effects, particularly from the U.S."
"dollar and the Argentine peso, as 
well as lower pension expenses."
"A higher wage and salary level as 
well as a higher average number of employees had an offsetting 
effect."
"We 
want to strengthen their identification with the company and our 
position in the global competition for qualified personnel."
"We want to 
achieve this with a wide range of offerings aimed at employees in 
different phases of life."
"We have formulated global guidelines for 
more flexibility that regulate where, when and how employees can 
work."
"These opportunities have become an integral part of our 
 
employees’ day-to-day work, job permitting."
"These include flexible 
working hours, part-time employment, remote working, and 
 
time-off options."
"Desk-sharing concepts support the new form of 
collaboration and create areas to withdraw as well as interaction 
spaces for sharing ideas and being creative together."
"There are also 
external and internal coworking opportunities that employees can 
take advantage of."
"We want to support employees in achieving a better work-life 
 
balance, for example in relation to childcare or caring for relatives, by 
offering additional services."
"We are continually working to expand 
these options."
"Childcare is essential for many parents and enables them to return 
to work more quickly."
"The BASF SE nursery LuKids is one of the 
largest company childcare facilities in Germany with a total of 260 
places and offers demand-oriented all-day care."
"It is supplemented 
by flexibly bookable emergency childcare places via other providers 
and children’s holiday programs."
"We also offer employees at other 
sites in Germany and North America, for example, support with 
childcare or childcare solutions for emergencies."
"At many sites worldwide, we offer our employees professional 
 
support with stressful situations in their personal and professional 
lives."
"In Germany, this is done by the BASF Stiftung’s social and life 
counseling service, for example, and is increasingly also offered at 
sites outside of Ludwigshafen."
"As part of our global Corporate Health Management, we support 
employees in strengthening their mental and physical health and 
adapting their health behavior accordingly, among other things (see 
page 145)."

Mutual respect and open dialog
Openness is one of BASF’s corporate values."
"That is why our 
stakeholder dialog is based on honesty, respect and mutual trust."
This also applies to dialog with our employees.
"Our employees have the opportunity to form, join and support 
 
legally recognized trade unions or employee representatives."
"These 
are entitled to represent employees and their interests in collective 
bargaining."
"BASF upholds these rights and has anchored this in the 
Group-wide guideline on compliance with international labor norms."
"Trust-based cooperation with employee representatives is an 
 
important component of our corporate culture."
"Our open and 
 
continual dialog lays the foundation for balancing the interests of the 
company and its employees, even in challenging situations."
"In 2023, 
this underpinned our efforts to manage the effects of the war of 
 
aggression in Ukraine and the corresponding increases in energy 
prices, as well as the current restructuring programs."
"In the case of 
organizational changes or if restructuring leads to staff downsizing, 
for example, or in the case of other codetermination-relevant topics, 
we involve employee representatives at an early stage to develop 
socially responsible implementation measures."
"Our actions are 
aligned with the respective legal regulations and the agreements 
reached, as well as operational conditions."
"By focusing our discussions on the local and regional situations, we 
aim to find tailored solutions to the different challenges and legal 
conditions for each site."
"The BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European 
Works Council) addresses cross-border matters in Europe."
"In South 
America, we foster continual dialog with employee representatives 
in the Diálogo Social."
"We are also committed to social dialog with employee representatives 
where freedom of association is not guaranteed under national law to 
the same extent as in European legal systems."

BASF strives to foster an inclusive working environment with room for diversity and where people 
encounter mutual respect, trust and appreciation."
"We connect people with different backgrounds, views 
and perspectives on an equal footing."
"Promoting and valuing diversity across all hierarchical levels is an 
integral part of our strategy and is also embedded in our corporate values."
"Employees should be able to contribute their individual 
 
perspectives and skills in an inclusive working environment."
"As a 
global company, we serve many different customer needs."
"We want 
to reflect, value and promote this diversity among our employees in 
order to increase their creativity, motivation and sense of belonging 
to BASF."
"Promoting diversity has positive consequences for BASF, for 
example through having an inclusive working environment and a 
more diverse workforce."
"Negative consequences could arise if our 
employees lose their sense of belonging, we are no longer perceived 
as an attractive employer or not all customers feel that we appeal to 
them."
"We systematically record short and long-term opportunities 
and risks as part of our general opportunity and risk management 
(see page 182 onward)."
"We expect our leaders to create an inclusive working environment 
and promote diversity."
"This is why it is one of our focal points in our 
leadership development."
"For example, our leaders learned about 
promoting openness as part of the CORE Leadership Values online 
training series."
"This training supports them in what they can 
 
specifically do to make the work environment more inclusive for all 
employees and how they can live up to their role model function and 
develop further in this respect."
"In addition, we expect all employees to create an environment 
 
in which different aspects of diversity and individual strengths are 
valued."
"With the Diversity Moments format, we offer teams concise 
information, everyday examples and reflection exercises on the 
topic of diversity and inclusion."
"In 2023, as part of the global 
 
employee survey (see page 133), we again used the inclusion 
 
index as a relevant point of reference for the inclusion of our 
 
employees and provided our leaders with suggestions for follow-up 
measures."
"In Brazil, there is an initiative to attract, retain and include people 
with disabilities in BASF."
"Among other things, we are focusing on 
improving the accessibility of our Brazilian sites and our internal and 
external communication channels."
"With further measures as part of 
the initiative, we want to ensure that we consider more people 
 
with disabilities in the recruitment process and offer them specific 
training opportunities."
"The project team works closely with leaders, 
the HR department and the local network of employees with 
disabilities."
"Our aim is to create a suitable framework to help maintain the 
 
employability of our personnel at all stages of life and ensure the 
availability of qualified employees over the long term."
"As we are convinced that better decisions are made by considering 
diverse perspectives, we set up a Shadow Board for BASF sites in 
Africa and the Middle East in 2023."
"The Shadow Board is made up 
of younger employees and advises the leadership team on strategic 
and operational topics."
"Using this reverse monitoring approach, 
we want to broaden and enrich the perspectives of the leadership 
team and bridge the gap between hierarchical levels and between 
generations."
"We also promote diversity in the selection and development of our 
leaders."
"We have set a global target to promote female leadership 
and aim to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions 
to 30% by 2030."
"We have made important progress toward this and 
continually review our target."
"In the BASF Group, the global 
 
proportion of female leaders with disciplinary responsibility was 28.4% 
at the end of 2023 (2022: 27.2%)."
"To enable our management to monitor progress toward this target, 
we have developed a global dashboard that is used to regularly 
 
review the status of implementation."
"The systematic advancement 
of women is an integral part of our process for selecting senior 
 
executives and is regularly addressed in strategic dialogs with the 
divisions at the level of the Board of Executive Directors and in the 
Board’s strategic talent discussions."
"In addition, we offer various 
opportunities to help female executives strengthen their network 
and increase their visibility at senior executive level."
"We focus on our female employees as role models on our social 
media channels and with various initiatives such as career fairs and 
networking events aimed specifically at women."
"As a signatory to the United Nations’ Women’s Empowerment 
 
Principles (WEPs), we are committed to promoting gender equality."
"We are also involved in other external initiatives to promote inclusion 
of diversity and equal opportunities in the workplace, such as the 
Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) initiative."
"In addition, we are an 
active member of the Charta der Vielfalt (German diversity charter), 
which aims to promote diversity and inclusion with a holistic 
approach."
"Through continuous dialog, we 
leverage the expertise of our stakeholders in global networks,

"The aim of 
the GBA is to develop standards and tools to steer a sustainable 
value chain for batteries."
"In 2019, we cofounded the Alliance to 
End Plastic Waste (AEPW) to drive forward solutions that reduce 
and avoid the disposal of plastic waste in the environment, in 
 
particular in the ocean."
"Together with other companies and the 
 
European CSR Europe network, we have worked on the topic of 
responsible social transition to climate neutrality (just transition)."
"We have contributed to both the development of a European 
 
road map and an associated toolbox."
"In order to involve our stakeholders more intensively and to deepen 
specific sustainability topics, we use our own independent advisory 
bodies."
"In 2023, for example, we introduced the Sustainability Lab 
as a new stakeholder engagement format."
"This is a further 
 
development of the Stakeholder Advisory Council (SAC), which 
brought together members of the SAC and the BASF Board of 
 
Executive Directors in Ludwigshafen, Germany, for the 10th time in 
fall 2022."
"With the Sustainability Lab, BASF is establishing a format to shed 
light on individual topics and issues related to sustainability from 
different perspectives."
"Around 100 external and internal experts 
discuss the complex challenges of climate change."
"The Sustainability Lab will meet every two years to 
discuss a specific topic."
"We address current and important issues regarding specific topics 
with councils."
"The trustful exchange within the Human Rights 
 
Advisory Council helps us to better understand our role and 
 
responsibilities, particularly in challenging situations concerning 
 
human rights (see page 155)."
"In 2023, BASF founded the new advisory council for topics 
 
relating to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, the 
 
Nature Advisory Council (NAC), to obtain an independent societal 
perspective on our activities related to nature and biodiversity topics 
(see page 117)."
We have a particular responsibility toward our sites’ neighbors.
"Our globally binding requirements for community 
advisory panels are based on the grievance mechanism standards 
in the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights."
"We keep track of their implementation through the existing 
global database of the Responsible Care Management System."
"We also involve key stakeholders in the decision-making process 
about future investments at an early stage."
"For example, we are 
working with partners, local authorities and nongovernmental 
 
organizations to analyze whether and how we can build a refinery 
complex for nickel and cobalt in Indonesia in a responsible manner."
"Our political advocacy is conducted in accordance with transparent 
guidelines and our publicly stated positions."
"The same applies to our 
activities in associations."
"Our Industry Associations Review 
compares the energy and climate protection positions of BASF and 
the most important associations of which we are a member, with 
explanations on our approach."
"BASF does not financially support political parties, for example, 
through donations in cash or in kind."
"This is codified in a global 
 
guideline."
"In the United States, employees at BASF Corporation have 
exercised their right to establish a Political Action Committee (PAC)."
"The BASF Corporation Employee PAC is an independent, federally 
registered employee association founded in 1998."
"It collects 
 
donations from employees for political purposes and independently 
decides how these are used, in accordance with U.S."
"Through our activities, we 
aim to strengthen the communities surrounding our sites worldwide, 
contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and have a long-term positive impact on the environment 
 
and society."
"By contributing our expertise and resources, we are 
pursuing three global goals: Strengthening public health, promoting 
skills (e.g., for economic participation and employability) and 
 
protecting natural resources."
"Our aim is to contribute to improving 
people’s quality of life and make a positive contribution to society."
"One example of our contribution to public health is the ­
cooperation 
with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and 
Promega."
"Swiss TPH is researching and developing novel 
­
insecticides to combat mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria."
"The collaboration began in September 2022 and is expected to 
span a three to five-year study."
"Its focus is on proteolysis-targeting 
chimera (PROTACs), small therapeutic molecules that degrade 
specific proteins within cells."
"This innovative approach holds great 
potential for effectively and cost-efficiently combating insect-borne 
diseases."
"With the support of BASF in molecular research and 
funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, preliminary results 
from this collaboration are anticipated by 2025."
"Education is key to personal success and the future viability of 
 
society."
"That is why BASF is committed to working with partners at 
numerous sites to achieve greater educational equality, especially 
for disadvantaged children and young people."
"Science education 
and education for sustainable development are particularly 
 
important to us."
"For 26 years now, children and young people in 
 
45 countries have been able to take part in experiments in 
 
BASF Kids’ Labs."
"The Virtual Lab program was expanded this year 
to include the ProtAct17 app."
"The mobile app is designed to teach 
children aged 8 and up to protect the environment and to take 
 
action in line with the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals."
"ProtAct17 imparts knowledge in an age-appropriate and 
 
interactive way, arouses curiosity and the spirit of research and 
 
addresses current and future challenges for the environment, 
 
economy and society."
"Above all, the app shows what – albeit 
small – possibilities young researchers have for taking action."
"Supported by 
more than 100 BASF employees, the young people looked at how 
they can tackle challenges in their communities."
"For example, they 
discussed how to reduce the risk of forest fires in Greece and how 
to manufacture resource-saving products from alternative raw 
 
materials in Indonesia."
"We aim to create long-term value for BASF and society with new 
business models and cross-sector partnerships."
"Our intrapreneurship 
program, Starting Ventures, helps people from low-income areas to 
improve their economic opportunities and their quality of life."
"The 
program also provides access to new markets and partners, and 
contributes to reaching the SDGs."
"Eight new Starting Ventures 
 
projects were selected for implementation in December 2022."
"BASF 
is tackling challenges on the ground together with local partners 
 
and contributing to the SDGs with entrepreneurial ideas, technical 
expertise and time resources."

LUnited project."
"The aim of the project is to find gaps and potential 
for action to further promote engagement in and around the city of 
Ludwigshafen."
"In 2023, BASF supported the German National 
Garden Show in Mannheim as a partner."
"A special experience space 
with an interactive exhibition illustrated BASF’s contribution to 
 
sustainable solutions."
"Around 130,000 people took advantage of 
this program."
"We also ran experimentation programs for families 
and school classes on the topics of sustainability, climate and 
energy."
"The experiments gave older school classes an insight into 
technical professions."
"In an outdoor area shared with John Deere, 
we held 12 action and dialog days on the topic of experiencing 
agriculture."
"In the area of international development cooperation, we support 
the independent charitable BASF Stiftung with donations for its 
international projects in cooperation with various organizations."
"The 2023 year-end donation campaign in favor of BASF Stiftung 
supported the United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, so that 
more children in Afghanistan can get access to education."
"BASF topped up the donations made by employees of participating 
German Group companies to a total of around €335,000."
"In 2023, BASF also supported those affected by humanitarian 
 
disasters."
"Following the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria and 
 
the payment of €500,000 in emergency aid, BASF launched an 
employee donation campaign in which more than €844,000 was 
donated worldwide."
"BASF doubled the amount to more than 
€1.6  million, which is available for reconstruction in the affected 
 
regions."
"In addition, €300,000 in emergency aid went to the German 
Red Cross for people affected by the earthquake in Morocco."
"The figure includes all consolidated companies with employees, including joint operations."

"Potential risks arise as a result, which we aim to minimize 
through comprehensive preventive measures."
"We systematically 
record opportunities and risks in the area of occupational safety and 
health protection as part of our general opportunity and risk 
 
management (see page 178 onward)."
"We set binding global standards for occupational safety and health 
protection."
"Our health and safety management covers all employees

our safety culture."
"Occupational safety
We have adjusted our targets and reporting based on the critical 
review of our targets and key performance indicators for 
occupational safety in 2022."
"Since 2023, we are focusing on work 
process-related high-severity injuries."
"These continue to be based 
on established industry standards, with a stronger focus on people."
"In 2023, we achieved 
an HSI rate of 0.03."
"We have set ourselves the goal of reducing 
high-severity work process-related injuries to a rate of no more than 
0.05 HSI per 200,000  working hours by 2030.1 By focusing on 
high-severity work process-related injuries, we want to make our 
employees’ working environment even safer."
"“ 
We encourage and  
promote risk-
conscious and safe  
working practices."
"Dr. Johannes Heinemann
Despite our efforts, there was one fatal work-related injury in 2023 
(2022: 1), in which two people lost their lives."
"Two contractors 
 
suffered fatal injuries in a car accident on a business trip in Brazil."
"BASF is assisting the authorities in determining the circumstances 
and cause of the accident."
"To prevent work process-related injuries, we encourage and 
 
promote risk-conscious behavior and safe working practices, 
 
learning from incidents and regular dialog."
"That is why we are 
 
constantly refining and enhancing our global requirements and 
training."
"In addition to the legally required briefings, BASF requires new 
 
employees and contractors to complete compulsory health and 
safety training."
"Employees at our production sites also receive 
 
regular training on the safe handling of chemicals and the correct 
use of personal protective equipment."
"We do everything we can to prevent injuries and use our findings to 
take appropriate measures to prevent these from happening again, 
as far as possible."
"These include regular campaigns and 
 
informational events to raise employees’ awareness."
"Leaders play a key role in the safety culture as role models, which is 
why environmental protection, health and safety are discussed 
 
with newly appointed senior executives."
"Senior executives with 
particular responsibility for such topics, for example, in production, 
also receive specific further training to be able to meet their 
 
responsibilities."
"To further improve our processes and methods, we evaluate trends 
in data, analyze accidents and potential incidents, and share 
 
knowledge and best practices within our global network of experts 
and as part of safety initiatives."
"The BASF health checks form the foundation of our 
global health promotion program and are offered to employees at 
regular intervals."
"We also systematically raise employee awareness of health topics 
with offerings tailored to specific target groups."
"One example is the 
Global Health Campaign."
"In 2023, we chose a decentralized 
 
approach in which the regions and sites could focus on locally 
 
relevant health aspects."
"In North America, for example, the focus 
was on mindfulness in the professional and private environment."
"The Take a Moment campaign focused, among other things, on 
dealing with shift work and mental health."
"Specific health campaigns 
were offered at a total of over 459 sites in 2023."
"We measure our performance in health protection using the 
 
Health Performance Index (HPI)."
"It comprises five components: 
 
recognized occupational diseases, medical emergency drills, first 
aid, preventive medicine and health promotion."
"Each component 
contributes a maximum of 0.2 to the total score, meaning that the 
highest possible score is 1.0."
"We aim to achieve a value of more 
than 0.9 every year."
"With an HPI of 0.96, we once again achieved 
this in 2023 (2022: 0.96)."
"In 2023, 44 work-related illnesses among BASF employees 
 
worldwide were documented as recognized occupational diseases 
(2022: 38)."
"The main recognized occupational diseases are 
 
occupational asthma, hearing loss, skin diseases, musculoskeletal 
disorders and cancer."
Another focus in 2023 was on influenza prevention.
"BASF 
 
employees could be vaccinated against seasonal flu at many sites 
around the world."
"At the Ludwigshafen site in Germany, for 
 
example, around 3,850  employees participated in the influenza 
 
vaccination campaign."

New Medical Center for  
comprehensive medical care 
In 2023, BASF opened a new Medical Center in Ludwigshafen, Germany."
"The aim is to secure our employees’ health and ensure that they remain 
able to work despite the rising average age by strengthening medical care 
at the site in the long term."
"Alongside examination and training rooms and offices, it houses 
 
state-of-the-art medical diagnostic facilities."
"In addition to the clinic, the 
Medical Center accommodates eight external specialist and medical 
 
facilities, a physiotherapy practice and a pharmacy."
"With the exception of 
the occupational and emergency medicine section reserved for BASF 
 
employees, all facilities are also available to our neighbors in the 
 
surrounding districts of Ludwigshafen."
"Occupational medicine has a long history at BASF: A document from 
 
1866 shows that the first factory doctor was employed at BASF just one 
year after the company was founded."
"This also marks the beginning of the 
first company medical service in the chemical industry in Germany, long 
 
before statutory obligations existed."
"We continuously work on ensuring our products pose 
no risk to people or the environment when they are used 
responsibly and in the manner intended."
"A thorough safety 
and risk assessment enables us to serve markets with safe 
and sustainable products that meet regulatory requirements 
while responding to trends."
"Strategy and governance
As a chemical company, we have products in our portfolio with 
physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties that 
may have negative effects on people and the environment if handled 
incorrectly."
"We are committed to continuously minimizing these 
 
effects and to the ongoing further development of the safety and 
sustainability of our products."
"This commitment to product safety is 
enshrined in our Responsible Care® charter and the initiatives of the 
International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA)."
"We aim to 
comply with all relevant national and international laws and 
regulations."
"At the same time, we strive to meet the requirements of 
our customers worldwide with our products and contribute to the 
development of a sustainable future in many areas (see sustainable 
portfolio management on page 48)."
"We systematically record short 
and long-term opportunities and risks in the area of product safety 
as part of our general opportunity and risk management (see page 
177 onward)."
"Our global requirements define rules, processes and responsibilities, 
for example, to ensure uniformly high product safety standards 
worldwide."
"Our sites and Group companies are responsible for 
 
implementing and complying with internal and legal requirements."
"This is regularly audited by the Environmental Protection, Health, 
Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center."
"BASF’s 
global network of experts shares information, insights and best 
practices around product safety on an ongoing basis."
"Before our products are launched on the market, they undergo 
various tests and assessments – depending on legal requirements 
and their application profile."
"Our aim here is to identify potential 
hazard characteristics as well as health and environmental risks at 
an early stage."
"Based on the results, we derive precautionary 
 
and protective measures and develop recommendations for safe 
handling – from production to application and disposal."
"We document environmental, health and safety data and the 
 
assessments thereof for all of our substances and products in a 
global database."
This information is continuously updated.
"The 
database forms the basis for communicating this information in our 
safety data sheets, for example, which we make available to our 
customers in around 40 languages."
"These include information on 
the physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties 
of products, potential hazards, first aid measures, measures to be 
taken in the case of accidental release, and disposal."
"Our global 
emergency hotline network enables us to provide information 
around the clock."
"We 
take into account any national or regional modifications within the 
GHS framework, such as the E.U.’s regulation on the classification, 
labeling and packaging of substances and mixtures (CLP 
 
Regulation, Classification, Labelling, Packaging)."
"If necessary, we advise our customers on product safety."
"We set 
guidelines on the safe transport of dangerous goods for our logistics 
service providers worldwide (see page 130)."
"We also train our 
 
employees worldwide on the proper handling and use of selected 
products with particular hazard potential."
"In associations and together with other manufacturers, BASF 
 
supports the establishment of voluntary global commitments to 
prevent the misuse of chemicals."
"We are also involved at 
 
national and international level in various initiatives to further develop 
risk assessments, such as that of the European Centre for 
 
Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC)."
"Global chemicals regulations
Most of the products we manufacture are subject to statutory 
chemicals regulations."
"We are bound by the relevant regional and 
national chemicals regulations, which continue to grow in number 
worldwide."
"Examples include REACH in the E.U., UK REACH in the 
United Kingdom, KKDIK in Turkey, K-REACH in South Korea and 
TSCA in the United States."
"BASF Group companies work closely 
together with a global network of experts to ensure that BASF 
 
complies with the applicable regulations."
"In Europe, the European Commission has developed a road map 
that will bring about far-reaching changes to the regulation of 
chemicals in Europe in the coming years: the European Green Deal 
and, as part of this, the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability (CSS)."
"BASF supports the objectives of the Green Deal in principle but sees 
a need for adjustment, greater clarity and predictability, particularly 
in regulatory matters."
"It is necessary to strike a balance between 
achieving the ambitions of the CSS and safeguarding the long-term 
competitiveness and future viability of the European chemical 
industry."
"As part of the ongoing clarification process, we therefore 
seek dialog with all relevant stakeholders and advocate for a 
science-based and innovation-driven development of the regulatory 
framework."
"Animal welfare in environmental and toxicological testing
Before launching products on the market, we subject them to a 
 
variety of tests, including environmental and toxicological tests using 
state-of-the-art knowledge and technology."
"If these tests include 
animal studies, this is generally required by law and necessary to 
reliably evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products."
"We develop and are continuously optimizing alternative 
methods to experimentally assess the safety and tolerance of our 
products without animal studies."
"In addition, we are involved in 
networks such as the European Partnership for Alternative 
 
Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) to further develop alternative 
methods across sectors."
"Our aim is to replace, reduce or refine animal studies to minimize the 
impact on them."
"For example, we use an OECD-certified alternative 
testing strategy developed jointly with Givaudan for animal-free 
testing of allergic skin reactions."
"We also use other alternative 
methods wherever possible."
"In 2022, BASF SE’s Experimental 
Toxicology and Ecology became the first institute in the world to be 
certified for Good In Vitro Method Practices (GIVIMP)."
"GIVIMP is a 
standard published by the OECD."
"It increases the quality of data 
generated by in vitro test methods and confidence in newly 
developed nonanimal testing methods."
"Management of nano- and biotechnology
Nanotechnology and biotechnology offer solutions for key societal 
challenges – such as environmental and climate protection and 
health and nutrition."
"For example, nanomaterials can improve 
 
battery performance and biocatalytic methods can increase process 
resource efficiency."
"We want to harness the potential of both 
 
technologies."
Using them safely and responsibly is our top priority.
"Safe handling of nanomaterials is stipulated in our Nanotechnology 
Code of Conduct, for instance."
"With regard to the safety 
 
assessment and regulatory compliance of nano and particulate 
materials, BASF participated in the NanoHarmony, MACRAME and 
Nanomet projects funded by the European Union in 2023."
"The 
 
results were documented and communicated in publications with 
BASF’s involvement."
"Furthermore, the findings will be incorporated 
into the OECD Test Guidelines Programme in order to develop valid 
and standardized test methods for the safety assessment of 
 
nano- and particulate materials."
"Strategy and governance
Our aim is to ensure the high quality of our products, processes and 
services in order to best meet our customers’ needs and set 
 
ourselves apart from our competitors."
"Quality defects can have 
 
potential negative effects on people and the environment."
"We 
 
prevent these with our quality management."
"We systematically 
 
record opportunities and risks in the area of quality as part of our 
general opportunity and risk management (see page 177 onward)."
"Our quality management supports BASF’s strategy and focuses on 
our customers by taking their needs as well as those of consumers 
and other stakeholders into account."
"Our quality management 
 
system comprises central requirements and processes along the 
value chain, which are defined by the Environmental Protection, 
Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate Center."
"Local implementation of these is the responsibility of our business 
units and sites."
"Quality management is monitored on a decentralized 
basis via a comprehensive internal audit system in accordance with 
ISO standards."
"Quality Management System
Our Quality Management System is based on the plan-do-check-
act approach and focuses on planning, implementation, evaluation 
and action."
"It is risk-based, process-oriented and focused on the 
satisfaction of our customers and stakeholders."
"Mandatory 
 
elements are set out in global requirements."
"These include 
 
requirements 
for 
core 
processes 
such 
as 
nonconformity 
management, handling of product recalls and change management."
"Our quality management includes the consistent handling of 
 
incidents that relate to product quality."
"A core element in this context 
is accessibility for and communication with affected customers and 
stakeholders in order to be able to react as quickly as possible 
 
and initiate appropriate measures such as product recalls or 
 
withdrawals."
"In further steps, we systematically work through the 
incidents and identify and eliminate causes."
"This includes all our 
customers and products, in particular products with inherent hazard 
potential, which entail specific documentation requirements."
"We are 
committed to handling the data of our customers and suppliers with 
particular care."
"During the current reporting year, only individual 
product quality incidents relating to individual items or batches of 
items are known to us."
"These were addressed, processed and 
monitored directly by our operating divisions."
"A key focus in the implementation of our quality management is on 
interlinking our targets and business-related requirements with the 
opportunities and risks identified by our operating divisions."
"This 
decentralized approach allows us to adapt our quality management 
to the requirements of BASF’s diverse business areas in the 
 
individual operating divisions."
"We apply quality management 
 
methods commonly used in the chemical industry, including 
 
management of change, quality assurance and control and 
 
development processes."
"In addition to appropriate documentation 
and the systematic development of expertise through training, our 
approach also includes regular internal audits."
"The results of these 
audits are taken into account alongside other indicators in the 
 
continuous review of the management systems."
"If necessary, we 
revise their strategic and organizational alignment."
"As part of World Quality Week, we draw our employees’ attention to 
the importance of quality."
"In 2023, we offered a range of activities 
based on the theme “Quality: realizing your competitive potential,” to 
exchange ideas internally and with customers, learn from each other 
and for levers to improve our quality performance."
"External certification
We pursue a decentralized certification approach for our business 
units and Group companies."
"This takes into account local needs, 
internal and legal requirements, and our customers’ requirements."
"Our Responsible Care audit system complies with the ISO 19011 
standard and is certified according to ISO 9001."
"Worldwide, 
 
132 BASF production sites are partially or fully certified in 
 
accordance with ISO 14001 (2022: 132)."
"In addition, 59 sites 
 
worldwide are partially or fully certified in accordance with 
 
ISO 45001 (2022: 59)."
"Several BASF sites also have an 
 
ISO 17020-accredited inspection body for user inspection or an 
 
ISO 17025-accredited analytical laboratory for environmental 
 
emissions analyses."
"Based on our customers’ requirements, Quality 
Management Systems at our production sites are generally certified 
according to external international standards such as ISO 9001,

focus here is sustainability, with four key areas: more climate-smart 
farming, more sustainable solutions, digital farming and smart 
 
stewardship (see box on page 36)."
"Strategy
Misuse of our crop protection and seed products can have a 
 
negative impact on human health and the environment."
"We are 
 
therefore focusing our smart stewardship activities on education 
and continuously improving our solutions for farmers."
"Alongside 
aspects such as efficacy and productivity, this also includes safe 
use by our customers and impact on the environment."
"We consider 
the entire life cycle of our products – from research and development 
to their proper use and disposal."
"Crop protection products and seeds are highly regulated at national 
and international level, which brings with it strict requirements for 
registering and re-registering active ingredients and crop systems."
"Regulatory approval is only granted after comprehensive proof has 
been provided showing that our products are safe for humans, 
 
animals and the environment when used in the manner intended."
"We are also

"The main advantages compared with conventional 
backpack spraying are optimized use of crop protection products, 
reduced risk of product contact during spraying and high efficiency 
in application and collection of information."
"BASF supports the 
training of drone pilots with various programs."
"“
As part of our smart stewardship 
activities, we focus on digital  
and technological solutions  
in particular."
Our products and technologies help them master this complex task.
"We are committed to the 
responsible and ethical use of our products throughout their entire life cycle."
"In our use of biotechnology, we are guided by 
the respective code of conduct set out by CropLife International and 
adhere to the relevant standards and legal regulations governing 
production and marketing."
"Potential risks of our products are assessed and minimized 
 
throughout the research, development and registration process, 
and on an ongoing basis following market registration."
"We regularly 
conduct scientific studies and tests, including on modes of action, 
(eco)toxicological properties and possible residues."
"This ensures 
that, as far as possible, our registration dossiers address all 
 
questions on potential environmental and health effects."
"We adapt our portfolio to the specific requirements of regional 
 
markets as customer requirements, crops, soils, climate conditions, 
plant diseases and farming practices vary around the world."
"Consequently, product registrations differ from country to country."
"Distribution generally requires registration and approval of our 
 
products in accordance with the respective national regulations."
"Crop protection
BASF adheres to the International Code of Conduct issued by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) for the management of crop protection products."
"These are only marketed once they have been approved by 
 
the competent authorities."
"We no longer sell WHO Class 1A or 1B 
 
products (high acute oral and dermal toxicity), even if formal 
 
approvals exist."
"Depending on availability, we offer our customers 
alternatives."
"All of BASF’s crop protection products can be used safely under 
local farming conditions if the information and directions on the label 
are followed."
"We record all product incidents relating to health or the environment 
that come to our attention in a global database."
"If necessary, we 
take appropriate measures on the basis of this information to 
 
minimize preventable incidents."

These include updating the instructions for use on product labels."
"We communicate these changes and general recommendations on 
the safe use of our products through channels such as our global 
training and education activities."
"One of the ways we meet our commitment to product stewardship 
is by offering a wide range of courses and training on the safe storage, 
handling, use and disposal of our products."
"This ranges from on-site 
events to handouts and digital offerings and is aimed at farmers, 
retailers, advisors and other users."
"In India, for example, BASF 
launched the Suraksha Hamesha program."
"Suraksha Hamesha 
means “safety all the time.” The program creates a platform for 
 
educating farmers and other users of crop protection products 
about the nine steps of responsible use of crop protection products 
and personal protection."
"Through Suraksha Hamesha, BASF has 
trained over 36,000 agricultural workers in India in 2023."
"BASF also 
involves government agencies and the central government’s farm 
extension teams to support and promote farm safety."
"In addition, 
we reached over 10 million people through digital information and 
training and informed them on safety in agriculture."
"As part of our smart stewardship activities, we particularly make use 
of the possibilities offered by digital and technological solutions to 
enable our customers to handle our products responsibly."
"In 
 
Thailand, for example, 143 drone pilots were trained in the safe use 
of crop protection products as part of the “We make it fly” program 
since 2021."
"Approximately 20,000 switched from backpack 
 
spraying to the safe drone application in 2023."
"We also work closely together with associations such as CropLife 
International and CropLife Europe to promote the safe and proper 
use of crop protection products."
"For example, we support 
 
stewardship initiatives of both associations and various programs on 
the proper disposal and recycling of product containers."
"Technological innovations developed together with industry partners 
also help to make using crop protection products easier and safer."
"Examples include the closed transfer systems easyconnect in 
 
Europe and the Wisdom system in South America."
"Seeds
Our biotechnology activities and our research and development 
 
capabilities comprise advanced breeding techniques, analytics, 
technology platforms and trait validation."
"To offer tailor-made, more 
sustainable crop solutions, our gene identification work focuses on 
those plant characteristics that enable higher yield and better 
 
quality, disease resistance and tolerance of environmental factors 
such as drought."
"We apply state-of-the-art scientific methods such 
as genetic engineering and selective genome editing."
"Genome 
editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas and other pioneering tools 
in modern biosciences offer numerous opportunities for innovative 
solutions, for example, in the fields of health, agriculture and 
 
industrial applications."

With these tools and our expertise in plant breeding, we can quickly 
and specifically modify desired plant characteristics and introduce 
new varieties."
"We want to use this technology to gain new 
 
knowledge and thus improve agricultural applications, and therefore 
support transparency through dialog and information sharing."
"BASF is a member of Excellence Through Stewardship (ETS), a 
global industry initiative for seed companies."
"This initiative promotes 
the adoption of Quality Management Systems for seeds and 
 
product stewardship programs covering the entire life cycle."
"It also 
has independent auditors verify compliance with its guidelines in a 
 
multiyear audit cycle."
"BASF completed all required audits for the 
three-year cycle prior to 2023."
"BASF will conduct the next 
 
third-party ETS audits in 2024 as part of the next cycle."
"Strategy and governance
As a scientific, technology-intensive company, BASF is confronted 
with crime, terrorism, sabotage, espionage and other security risks 
in a rapidly changing business environment."
"We consider the 
 
protection of our employees, sites, plants, information and 
 
communication systems and our intellectual property against 
 
interference by third parties to be vitally important."
"We systematically 
record physical and transitory risks from corporate, information and 
cybersecurity as part of our general opportunity and risk management 
(see page 178 onward)."
A global team is responsible for our corporate security.
"To ensure 
rapid and effective implementation of security measures, we have 
defined appropriate structures and processes and laid them down in 
binding Group-wide requirements."
"Our sites and Group companies 
are responsible for implementing and complying with these internal 
requirements and the legal specifications."
"The Environmental 
 
Protection, Health, Safety and Quality (EHSQ) unit in the Corporate 
Center conducts regular audits to monitor this."
"Responsibility for information and cybersecurity lies with the Chief 
Financial Officer, who is also the Chief Digital Officer."
"The Chief 
 
Information Security Officer is responsible for the strategic direction."
"A global cybersecurity team is tasked with protecting BASF’s IT 
 
(information technology) and OT (operational technology) systems 
against hacker attacks and ensuring information security."
"In order to 
initiate and monitor suitable security measures, the organization is 
structured according to a global best practice framework (Identify, 
Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover)."
"Our IT security management 
system, which is certified in accordance with DIN EN ISO/IEC 
27001:2017, is the main tool for managing information and 
cybersecurity in the BASF Group."
"It is crucial to ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and IT infrastructure 
while demonstrating compliance with applicable laws and regulations."
"We want to use the system to meet regulatory compliance 
requirements for our critical infrastructure."
"The Environmental 
Protection, Health, Safety and Quality unit in the Corporate Center 
conducts regular audits to monitor this."
"Corporate security
One cornerstone of corporate security is site security."
"The tasks 
performed by our security teams range from access controls at our 
sites to defense against industrial espionage."
"Aspects of human 
rights relevant to site security are a component of the global code 
of conduct and qualification requirements for our internal and 
 
external security personnel."
"For investment projects and strategic plans, we analyze the 
 
potential safety and security risks, and define appropriate safety and 
security concepts."
"Our guiding principle is to identify risks for the 
company at an early stage, assess them and derive appropriate 
safeguards."
"We inform business travelers and transferees about appropriate 
protection measures prior to and during travel in countries with 
 
elevated security risks."
"We continuously adjust our travel 
 
recommendations."
"With a globally standardized travel search 
system, we are able to locate and contact employees in affected 
areas following serious incidents."
"Information and cybersecurity
Information security and cybersecurity are becoming increasingly 
important for our company."
"In addition to protecting data and IT 
 
infrastructure, they form the basis for successful digitalization and 
the implementation of new business models."
"BASF applies the 
“security by design” principle to critically review and optimize IT 
 
applications from a cybersecurity perspective as early as the design 
phase."
"We are continually improving our ability to prevent, detect 
and react to security incidents with various measures and training 
offers."
"Around the world, we work to sensitize our employees about 
 
protecting information and know-how."
"In 2023, we continued to 
raise employees’ risk awareness with regular mandatory online 
 
training for all employees and complementary offerings such as 
 
seminars, case studies and interactive training."
"Our global network 
of information protection officers comprises around 600 employees."
"They support the implementation of our uniform requirements and 
hold events and seminars on secure behaviors."
"Around 
 
70,000 employees were trained on the basics of cybersecurity and 
information protection in 2023."

by our activities."
"We accept the resulting obligations and opportunities along the supply chain in accordance 
with our scope of influence."
"For many years, we have engaged in constructive dialog on human rights with 
other companies, nongovernmental organizations, international organizations and multistakeholder  
initiatives to better understand different perspectives and address conflicting goals."
"Strategy and organization 
 
We see human rights due diligence as a continuous, all- 
encompassing task that we can only perform by working together 
as a team throughout the entire organization."
"That is why we have 
embedded our responsibility for human rights into BASF’s Code of 
Conduct and set this out in our Policy Statement on Human Rights."
Our standards apply worldwide.
"All employees and leaders are 
 
responsible for ensuring that we act in accordance with our Code of

"We attach great importance to this topic and have set up our 
 
organization accordingly."
"The head of our legal and compliance 
 
organization also acts as Chief Human Rights Officer and 
 
oversees the overarching risk management."
"He regularly reports to 
the Board of Executive Directors on our human rights-related

"Our compliance organization is responsible for the 
 
overarching governance of human rights due diligence at BASF."
"In 
 
addition, several specialist units are responsible for managing 
 
specific human rights topics."
"At the same time, we rely on a systematic, integrated, risk-based 
approach and established monitoring and management 
 
systems."
"We achieve positive effects through our commitment to 
compliance with international standards in our cooperation with 
partners and through our local societal engagement."
"Potential 
 
negative impacts on human rights and labor and social standards 
arise from our global business activities, including in countries 
 
with increased risk, and from our complex supply chains."
"We 
 
systematically record opportunities and risks as part of our general

decision-making 
processes, 
for 
example 
for 
investments, 
 
acquisitions and divestitures."
"In our Human Rights Expert Working Group, steered by our 
 
compliance department, experts from various areas of our company 
work closely together to holistically assess and refine our approach 
to human rights due diligence."
"In this way, we want to ensure that 
we approach our human rights responsibility in a comprehensive 
way and that we can continually improve our performance."
"It provides support and advice in challenging and critical situations, 
 
on the development of internal processes, and on the creation of 
information and training offerings, among other things."
"In 2023, 
 
for example, a mandatory guideline with additional due diligence 
steps was introduced to further protect the rights of third-party 
workers in higher-risk countries."
"International labor and social standards 
Our aim of acting responsibly toward our employees is embedded in 
our global Code of Conduct and our Policy Statement on Human 
Rights 
through 
our 
voluntary 
commitment 
to 
respecting 
 
international labor and social standards."
"This guideline concretizes the topics in 
our global Code of Conduct under “Human rights, labor and social 
standards” as these relate to our employees and leaders worldwide."
"An additional guideline specifies that these topics must also be 
considered and applied when working with agency workers and 
freelancers."
"Regular training courses on these topics are held for the 
managing directors and employees of the BASF Group."
"This forms the basis for our global, risk-based management 
 
process: We regularly monitor changes to the national law of all the 
countries in which BASF operates and evaluate our adherence to 
international labor and social standards."
"If the national law contains 
no or lower requirements, action plans are drawn up to close these 
gaps."
"If conflicts with national law or practices arise, we strive to act 
in accordance with our values and internationally recognized 
 
principles without violating the law of the country concerned."
"As part 
of the management process, we regularly follow up on and 
 
document the results of the comparison between national law and 
our guideline, as well as measures to implement the guideline."
"This 
is part of our central due diligence system."
"We monitor our voluntary commitment to international labor and 
social standards as part of our management process."
"Individual 
 
elements of the guideline are also reviewed as part of internal control 
processes such as Responsible Care audits at BASF Group 
 
companies."

"Our labor and social standards also include respect in the 
 
workplace."
"To promote awareness of respectful behavior at work, 
we launched an initiative against sexual harassment and 
 
discrimination in September 2023, initially at the Ludwigshafen site."
"Its aim is to draw attention to the issue in order to better investigate 
and prevent incidents and ensure that all employees are treated with 
respect."
"BASF strengthens cooperation between the specialist 
 
departments and with the internal advice centers."
"We set up a 
specific risk management to ensure BASF’s compliance with the 
specific environmental treaties covered by the German Supply Chain 
Due Diligence Act (Minamata, Stockholm, Basel)."
"In addition, aspects 
of human rights topics are part of the global qualification requirements 
for security personnel and are incorporated into standard agreements 
with contractors."
"As part of our Responsible Care Management, we aim to ensure 
that we also fulfill our duty of care towards local residents and that 
their human rights, such as the right to access clean water, are 
 
respected."
"To this end, we enter into dialog with residents at our 
sites through community advisory panels in order to promote trust in 
BASF’s activities."
"Globally binding requirements for these panels are 
based on the grievance mechanism standards in the United Nations’ 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (see page 140)."
"Cooperation along our value chains
As an international company, we are a part of society in the 
 
countries in which we operate and have business relationships with 
partners around the world."
"In our supply chains, we are confronted 
with risks in the areas of working conditions, environmental 
 
protection, health and safety, particularly in countries with an 
 
increased human rights risk and when purchasing higher-risk 
 
product categories."
"We have trustful working relationships with our partners (suppliers, 
contractors, joint venture partners and customers), expect them to 
comply with internationally recognized human rights standards and 
to expect the same of their partners further along the value chain."
"We work to ensure that our partners meet their respective 
 
responsibilities."
"We have defined these expectations as binding in our Supplier Code 
of Conduct, which is also part of our purchasing conditions (see 
page 159)."
"We are in close contact with our business partners, 
especially in higher-risk areas and regions, and monitor the 
implementation of relevant standards and necessary measures for 
improvement."
"We use recognized assessment methods and audits 
to verify this."
"If this or other sources (e.g., media reports, compliance 
hotline) lead to anomalies or violations, we take this very seriously, 
respond and require our suppliers to implement corrective measures 
immediately and put an end to the violations."
"For example, in March 2023, authorities in Uruguaiana, Brazil, 
 
recorded a case of unacceptable working conditions and underage 
labor in our supply chain."
"The affected workers were temporarily 
 
employed by subcontractors of BASF contractors in the fields of 
two rice farms that produced seeds for BASF."
"We deeply regret the 
way in which the workers of our contractors’ subcontractors were 
treated and strongly condemn all practices that violate human rights."
"We immediately approached the relevant authorities and evaluated 
the processes."
"The work was stopped immediately and the contract 
with one of the contractual partners was terminated, as it became 
clear that it was not possible to work constructively on the incidents 
with this partner."
"BASF has also taken additional preventive and 
training measures to avoid such incidents even more effectively in 
the future (see page 160)."
"At the beginning of 2023, an internal audit of our joint venture 
 
operations in Korla, China, was carried out to verify compliance with 
the BASF Code of Conduct and the requirements embedded in it to 
respect human rights as well as key labor and social standards."
"This 
investigation, as well as past audits, did not reveal any evidence of 
human rights violations in the two joint ventures."
"We have obtained 
written confirmation from key suppliers, including our joint venture 
partners, that they accept our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"Nevertheless, reports from spring 2024 on the joint venture partner 
in Korla contain serious allegations that indicate activities that are 
not compatible with BASF’s values."
"Consequently, we will accelerate 
the process already started at the end of 2023 to divest our shares 
in the two joint ventures in Korla for strategic reasons, subject to 
negotiations and the required approvals from the relevant authorities."
"In 2023, we continued our work with our upstream supply chain, 
where we usually have no direct contractual relationships, less 
transparency and less influence."
"We work together with partners and civil society and we are active 
in cross-sector initiatives."
"These include the Global Battery Alliance 
and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil."
"Projects often start on 
the ground to build specific expertise for sustainable and 
responsible supply chains."
"The local initiatives also include the 
 
Sustainable Castor Initiative – Pragati in India, the Responsible 
Lithium Partnership Initiative in Chile, the Responsible Mica Initiative 
in India and the Cobalt for Development pilot mining project in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo (see page 126)."
"In 2022, BASF, 
Syngenta and Arisa also worked together on a multistakeholder 
 
initiative in the vegetable seeds business in India."
"The initiative, 
WISH (Wage Improvements in Seed Hybrids), addresses the fight 
against child labor and the payment of an appropriate wage in the 
Indian vegetable seed industry."
"The first phase of the project 
 
examined where to start in order to improve local conditions."
"In the 
next step, the project partners will use various instruments such as 
training and further education, networking, the involvement of 
 
interest groups, advocacy work at local and international level and 
the dissemination of best practices."
"The project team’s aim is to 
achieve significant changes in several key areas by 2025."
"Information offers on this were held in our operating 
 
divisions."
"In addition, managing directors of BASF’s Group 
 
companies and employees in all regions were informed about and 
sensitized to human rights topics through presentations and 
 
discussion formats tailored to specific target groups."
"In Brazil, the 
Compliance Week was held on the theme of “Everyone for the 
 
Protection of Human Rights.” The topic of human rights was also 
integrated even more strongly into the existing compliance training 
program."
"Our grievance mechanisms, including our globally standardized 
hotline and reporting system, were also used intensively in 2023 
(see page 203)."
"All complaints were reviewed and forwarded 
 
to the relevant departments for in-depth investigation."
"If justified, 
 
appropriate measures were taken."
"We have not received any reports 
of human rights violations within the meaning of the German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act through our grievance mechanisms."
"We 
report on our global targets, monitoring systems and measures to 
integrate human rights topics into our business activities in 
 
publications such as this report and online."
"These raw materials and precursors are the building 
blocks for our value creation and thus high-quality products 
for our customers."
"Our objective is to create competitive 
advantages 
through 
our 
professional 
procurement 
 
structures, to establish stable and reliable supply chains, 
and, at the same time, meet high ethical and environmental 
standards."
"Together with our suppliers, we want to improve 
 
sustainability in the supply chain and minimize risks."
"With active supplier management, we aim to minimize 
purchase-related risks such as supply shortages and price 
fluctuations, ensure our competitiveness and seamless production 
processes."
"Alongside economic and qualitative criteria, we also take 
 
environmental, social and ethical aspects into account in the 
 
cooperation with our suppliers2 in order to minimize risks in the 
 
supply chain and live up to our responsibility by establishing 
 
standards and initiatives."
"Our sustainability-oriented supply chain 
management is an integral part of our opportunity and risk 
 
management (see page 177 onward)."
"Procurement guidelines and targets are set centrally by the 
 
responsible Corporate Center unit Corporate Development and are 
binding for all employees with procurement responsibility worldwide."
"We use a multistage control process to ensure compliance with 
these requirements."
"Our expectations of our suppliers are laid down 
in the globally binding Supplier Code of Conduct (see “What we 
expect from our suppliers”)."
We have defined our standards in a global requirement.
"In principle, this applies both to our 
own business operations and to direct and indirect suppliers."
"As 
part of the new statutory due diligence obligations, we have updated 
our purchasing conditions, adapted clauses for new contracts, 
 
revised existing contracts and proactively informed our suppliers."
"Our established supply chain management tools, such as our 
 
Supplier Code of Conduct or the systematic risk-oriented 
 
assessment and auditing of suppliers, remain important elements 
and have been updated accordingly."
"Our risk-based approach aims to identify and evaluate sustainability 
matters in our value chains in the best possible way."
"We count on 
reliable and long-term supply relationships in order to jointly improve 
our sustainability performance, for example through projects 
 
(see page 122) or by helping to address shortcomings."
"We regularly 
 
review and document progress based on the risk level."
"Procurement 
employees receive regular training in sustainability-oriented supplier 
management and responsible procurement."
"In 2023, around 
 
330 employees received such training, covering the requirements 
arising from the GSCA."
"In our supplier relationships, we focus on the potential to reduce 
upstream, 
raw 
materials-related 
carbon 
emissions, 
thus 
 
contributing to our new raw materials-related climate protection 
target defined in 2023 (see page 102)."
"With our Supplier CO2 
Management Program launched in 2021, we aim to increase the 
transparency and reduce the carbon footprint of our value chain 
together with our suppliers (see page 108)."
"In line with our strategy and our values we promote and value 
 
diversity, the sense of belonging and inclusion in our value chain."
"We 
have been involved in supplier diversity programs in North and 
South America for many years."
"We seek targeted contact with 
 
underrepresented supplier groups through interest groups and work 
to integrate them into our supply chain."
"In addition, we promote the 
exchange of information on sustainability topics in webinars and 
workshops and establish partnerships to enable dialog between 
customers and suppliers."
"For more information on suppliers, see basf.com/suppliers
1	 We understand relevant spend as procurement volumes with relevant suppliers."
"We define relevant suppliers as Tier 1 suppliers showing an elevated sustainability risk potential as identified by our risk matrices, our purchasers’ assessments or other sources."
2	 BASF considers all direct suppliers to be Tier 1 suppliers that provide services to the BASF Group in the respective business year.
"These are suppliers that provide us with raw materials, investment goods, consumables and services."
"Suppliers can be natural persons, companies or legal persons under public law."

Global targets
In 2023, we acquired raw materials, goods and services for our own 
production worth approximately €41 billion from our more than 
70,000 suppliers."
"Of this, around 90% were procured locally.1
We actively promote sustainability in the supply chain with our 
 
ambitious targets: By 2025, we aim to have conducted sustainability 
evaluations for 90% of the BASF Group’s relevant spend."
"In addition, 
we aim to have 80% of suppliers improve their sustainability 
 
performance upon reevaluation by 2025."
"In 2023, 89% of the 
 
relevant spend had been evaluated."
"Of the suppliers reevaluated in 
2023, 82% had improved."
"Both global targets are embedded in the 
target agreements of employees responsible for procurement."
"Consequently, we require our suppliers to comply with 
the applicable laws in full and to adhere to internationally recognized 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards."
"We also 
expect them to make an effort to enforce these standards with their 
suppliers."
"In addition, we require our suppliers to support and 
 
comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct – or to demonstrate and 
ensure their commitment to the principles specified in the Code of 
Conduct, for example in their own code of conduct."
"Our global Supplier Code of Conduct is founded on internationally 
recognized guidelines, such as the principles of the United Nations’ 
Global Compact, the U.N."
"Guiding Principles on Business and 
 
Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) 
 
conventions, and the topic areas of the Responsible Care® initiative."
"Topics covered by the Code of Conduct include compliance with 
human rights, the exclusion of child and forced labor, adherence to 
labor and social standards, antidiscrimination and anticorruption 
policies, and protecting the environment."
"The Code of Conduct is 
available in the most relevant languages for our suppliers and 
 
integrated into electronic ordering systems and purchasing 
 
conditions across the Group."
"We expanded our Supplier Code of 
Conduct to include requirements from the GSCA and informed our 
existing suppliers of these changes in 2023."
"Around 5,000 new 
suppliers committed to the Code of Conduct in 2023."
"BASF conducts audits and assessments to ensure that suppliers 
comply with the applicable laws, rules and standards."
"We reserve 
the right to discontinue business relationships for nonadherence to 
international principles."
"The same applies to failure to correct 
 
violations, or for displaying patterns of noncompliance with these 
standards."
"Our Code of Conduct expressly points out that potential 
violations of laws, rules or standards can be reported – including 
anonymously – to our compliance hotlines."
"Each case is 
 
documented and investigated, and appropriate measures are taken 
as necessary."
"Selection and evaluation of our suppliers
New suppliers are selected and existing suppliers are evaluated not 
only on the basis of economic criteria, but also ESG standards in 
particular."
"As such, selection, evaluation and auditing are important 
parts of our sustainable supply chain and risk management."
Processes and responsibilities are defined in a global requirement.
"Due to the large number of suppliers, they are evaluated based on 
risk."
"Both country and industry-specific risks as well as our ability to 
exert influence are taken into account."
"Observations from our 
 
employees in procurement, concerns reported through the 
 
compliance hotline and information from internal and external 
 
databases, such as Together for Sustainability (TfS) assessments 
(see box on page 160), are also used."
"We are aware of problems in specific supply chains (see pages 122 
and 125)."
"We have suppliers with a high potential sustainability risk 
evaluated by third parties, either through sustainability evaluations or 
on-site audits."
"The list of suppliers to be assessed is updated every 
year."
"Sustainability evaluations and on-site audits are mainly 
 
conducted according to the TfS framework."
"A total of 89 raw 
 
materials supplier sites were audited on sustainability standards on 
our behalf in 2023."
"We received sustainability evaluations for 
 
579 suppliers."
"We also take into account other certification systems 
and external audits, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil, when assessing our suppliers."
"Audit results
We carefully analyze the results of our assessments, which are 
summarized in audit reports with specific plans for corrective 
 
measures, and document them in a central database."
"We regularly 
review the implementation of the measures and verify them in a 
 
follow-up audit."
"Over the past few years, we have identified some 
need for adjustment at our suppliers with respect to environmental, 
social and governance standards, for example in waste 
 
management, or deviations in occupational health and safety 
 
measures and standards under labor law."
"Follow-up audits 
 
performed in 2023 identified improvements in these areas."
"In this reporting year, we recorded one case of undignified working 
conditions and underage labor."
"In March 2023, representatives of 
local authorities identified unacceptable working conditions on two 
rice farms which produced seeds for BASF in Uruguaiana, Brazil."
"The affected workers were temporarily employed by subcontractors

of BASF contractors in the fields."
"Immediately after becoming aware 
of this, we approached the relevant authorities proactively and 
 
without delay and evaluated the processes on-site."
"The work was 
stopped immediately and the contract with one of the farms was 
terminated as it was not possible to work constructively on the 
 
incidents with this partner."
"We have also strengthened our 
 
regulations and started to introduce additional preventive measures."
"In particular, we have reaffirmed to our seed multipliers their 
 
obligations under applicable labor laws and compliance with human 
rights requirements in writing, including with regard to potential 
subcontractors."
"We have strengthened our training with a focus on 
respect for human rights."
"In addition, we plan to carry out more 
risk-based controls of our contractors and their subcontractors, as 
well as training sessions."
"At the beginning of 2023, an internal audit of our joint venture 
operations in Korla, China, was carried out."
"This investigation, as 
well as past audits, did not reveal any evidence of human rights 
violations in the two joint ventures."
"We have obtained written 
confirmation from key suppliers, including our joint venture partners, 
that they accept our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"Nevertheless, 
reports from spring 2024 on the joint venture partner in Korla contain 
serious allegations that indicate activities that are not compatible 
with BASF’s values."
"Consequently, we will accelerate the process 
already started at the end of 2023 to divest our shares in the two 
joint ventures in Korla for strategic reasons, subject to negotiations 
and the required approvals from the relevant authorities."
"Sibanye-Stillwater and the other South 
 
African platinum suppliers have agreed to conduct future audits in 
accordance with the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance 
(IRMA) mining standard and are in the process of conducting an 
IRMA self-assessment."
"We discuss the status and results in our 
 
regular exchanges."
"We maintain dialog and a regular exchange with Nornickel to 
 
continuously monitor the situation and audit results, and we are in 
contact with civil society groups."
"Nornickel continues to work on 
implementing management systems according to internationally 
 
recognized industry standards that allow for third-party verification 
of mining and responsible sourcing, such as IRMA."
"The current 
conditions continue to impact our business relationship, while 
 
auditing according to the aforementioned standards is currently not 
possible."
"Supplier development
If supplier assessments identify deviations from standards, we 
require suppliers to develop and implement corrective measures 
 
within a reasonable time frame in a clearly defined follow-up 
 
process."
We support them in their efforts.
"For example, we trained 
102 employees from 88 Chinese suppliers in 2023 as part of a 
 
partnership with the East China University of Science and 
Technology in Shanghai, China."
"An important part of supplier 
development were also the webinars on the topic of sustainability 
and the implementation of corrective measures held by TfS in 
various languages, with a total of over 2,100 participants."
"In 
addition, the new TfS Academy online learning platform is aimed at 
buyers and suppliers."
It covers the entire spectrum of ESG topics.
"There are currently over 390 courses available in 11 different 
languages."
"We review our suppliers’ progress according to a 
defined time frame based on the sustainability risk identified, or 
after five years at the latest."
"In the case of serious violations of the 
standards defined in our Supplier Code of Conduct or international 
principles, we reserve the right to impose commercial sanctions."
These can go as far as the termination of the business relationship.
"In 2023, this happened in three cases."
"1	 In 2012, an extended strike at a platinum mine in Marikana, South Africa, culminated in a violent confrontation between mine workers and armed South African police."
"Employees of the former mine operator, Lonmin, were among the fatalities."
Ownership of the Marikana mine was transferred to Sibanye-Stillwater in 2019.
"For more information on the supplier relationship with the Sibanye-Stillwater mine, see basf.com/en/marikana

"The 
initiative was established in 2011 to improve sustainability in the 
supply chain."
"The focus is on the standardization, simplification 
and mutual recognition of supplier audits and assessments."
"Suppliers are evaluated by independent experts in on-site audits 
or online assessments."
"The latter are conducted by EcoVadis, a 
ratings agency specialized in sustainability evaluations."
"At the 
end of 2023, TfS had 50 members with a combined procurement

contribution to avoiding CO2 emissions."
"We systematically analyze the 
sustainability performance of all BASF products using our TripleS 
method (see page 48)."

– Manufacture of plastics in primary form
The description of the economic activities by the E.U."
"Commission 
for the four other environmental objectives not related to the 
climate was published in November 2023."
"According to these 
 
requirements, 
the 
following 
economic 
activity 
under 
the 
 
environmental objective of pollution prevention and control will 
 
be additionally relevant for BASF for the first time from 2023 within 
the meaning of the E.U."
"To avoid double counting, assignment to an enabling activity is only 
made if a taxonomy-eligible product or project had not already been 
included under another activity."
"BASF products also enable the 
production of technologies for renewable energy or low-emission 
mobility."
"taxonomy focuses on the 
 
manufacture of technologies and thus excludes precursors, we 
have classified these activities as taxonomy-non-eligible under the 
E.U."
"In addition to our core business, the production of chemical 
 
products, we have identified further activities that we have analyzed 
for their materiality in terms of their share of sales, investments or 
operating expenditures."
"In determining the materiality, we were 
guided by the materiality concept established in financial reporting 
and also assessed the economic activity “acquisition and ownership 
of buildings” as relevant in the environmental objective of climate 
change mitigation for the 2023 reporting year."
"The remaining 
 
immaterial activities neither exceed the value limit we have set for 
each economic activity, nor do the immaterial activities in total 
 
exceed the defined value limit for each reportable indicator (KPI)."
"Immaterial activities include activities in the sectors forestry; 
 
water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation; 
transport; 
information 
and 
communication; 
professional, 
 
scientific and technical activities; and accommodation activities."
"For 
the purposes of the templates set out in Annex XII to the Delegated 
Regulation 2021/2178, we would like to point out that we conduct 
activities in the areas of electricity generation, cogeneration of 
 
power and heat/cool, and production of heat/cool from fossil gas."
"As shown, these are not material in terms of sales, investments and 
operating expenditures."
"BASF does not conduct any nuclear energy 
activities."
"Furthermore, BASF does not report any taxonomy-eligible activities 
under the environmental objective of climate change adaptation."
"This is firstly to avoid double counting with economic activities 
 
already recorded under the climate change mitigation objective."
"Secondly, in accordance with the notice issued by the 
 
E.U."
"Commission, a prerequisite for taxonomy eligibility under the 
adaptation objective is the submission of an investment plan for 
implementing adaptation solutions, which is not present on the part 
of BASF within the meaning of the E.U."
"BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – E.U."
"Taking into account 
all six environmental objectives, taxonomy-eligible sales revenue 
accounted for 12.2% of total sales in 2023."
"The largest contributions 
were from the activities “manufacture of plastics in primary form” 
and “manufacture of organic basic chemicals.” Both activities 
 
are assigned to the environmental objective of climate change 
 
mitigation."
"Taxonomy-eligible 
capital 
expenditures 
(including 
 
acquisitions and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U."
"taxonomy) accounted for 23.1% of the total investments reported in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Capital expenditures on the 
“manufacture of organic basic chemicals” and in the “manufacture 
of batteries” contributed significantly here."
"These activities also 
contribute to the environmental objective of climate change 
 
mitigation."
"Operating expenditures include uncapitalized costs that 
relate to research and development,1 maintenance and repair, and 
short-term lease expenses."
"The definition of operating expenditures 
follows the E.U."
"Taxonomy Regulation and they are not reported in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements in this form."
"All of the capital 
expenditures and operating expenditures of a production facility with 
 
taxonomy-eligible activity are counted as taxonomy-eligible."
"Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditures accounted for 12.4% of 
total operating expenditures."
"As in the previous year, the contribution to climate 
change mitigation and harm to other environmental objectives were 
reviewed in a three-step process."
"The first step involved a two-part 
analysis based on BASF’s internal product databases:
	
– The manufacture of products was analyzed with respect to the 
use of critical substances in accordance with Appendix C2 of the 
E.U."
"Commission’s Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 to avoid 
significant harm to the environmental objective of pollution 
prevention or control according to the E.U."
"This also 
included use in the production process."
"The amendment to the 
Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2023/2485 published by the E.U."
Commission in November 2023 was also taken into account.
"BASF voluntarily applied the full supplement, including Annex 1, 
point 28, for the 2023 financial year in order to ensure a continuous 
conformity assessment with regard to Appendix C for years 
subsequent to 2024."
"Experts assessed and documented in each 
case that no other suitable alternative substances or technologies 
are available on the market."
"– Plastics in primary form were analyzed with respect to the 
 
share of renewable raw materials in the product."
"They were 
 
only considered further if this share was at least 5% and thus 
potentially made a substantial contribution to climate change 
mitigation through partial or complete production from renewable 
raw materials."
"Shares allocated using mass balance approaches 
(see page 124) were not taken into account here because 
 
their acceptance under the E.U."
"taxonomy has not yet been 
 
definitively clarified."
"For this reason, BASF products based on 
chemically recycled raw materials were not considered further in 
the assessment either."
"Mechanical recycling did not play any role 
for BASF here."
"In the second step, it was assessed whether the potentially 
taxonomy-aligned products make a substantial contribution to 
 
climate change mitigation in accordance with the activity-specific 
criteria."

was based on a digital solution developed by BASF to determine 
product-specific CO2 emissions (see page 109)."
"Finally, in the third step of the process, it was assessed whether the 
products identified cause significant harm to the other environmental 
objectives."
"This included an analysis of risks arising from climate 
change using climate risk and vulnerability assessments."
"At sites 
with material climate risk, the existence of adaptation solutions was 
additionally analyzed and evaluated."
"The avoidance of significant 
harm to water and marine resources1, biodiversity and ecosystems2, 
and pollution prevention and control were taken as given for 
 
production plants in Europe based on comprehensive and uniform 
regulatory requirements and additionally ensured through data 
 
queries."
"The conformity of non-European plants was assessed on a 
case-by-case basis."
"This was based on joint assessments by 
local and central experts using the evidence of local production 
 
requirements submitted."
"The criteria for the minimum social safeguards as a further pillar 
 
of taxonomy alignment in accordance with Article 18 of the 
 
E.U."
"Minimum social safeguards were ensured by a 
systematic, integrated and risk-based approach to safeguarding our 
human rights due diligence obligations (see page 154), by global 
labor and social standards (see page 155), and by the Supplier 
Code of Conduct (see page 159), among other things."
"Taxonomy-aligned sales revenue accounted for 1.6% of the 
 
total sales revenue defined and reported in the BASF Group’s 
 
Consolidated Financial Statements in 2023 (see page 227)."
The “manufacture of batteries” made the largest contribution (1.2%).
"Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures (including acquisitions 
 
and excluding goodwill in accordance with the E.U."
"taxonomy) 
 
accounted for 5.2% of the total investments reported in the 
 
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"At 4.1%, capital expenditures 
(additions to property, plant and equipment) on the “manufacture of 
batteries” contributed significantly here (additions to property, plant 
and equipment)."
"We are also investing in a plant for the production 
of CO2-free hydrogen, which will be commissioned in the coming 
years."
"This already meets the criteria for taxonomy alignment in 
2023 and is accordingly recognized as an investment in accordance 
with Annex  I, section 1.1.2.2."
"a) of the Delegated Regulation 
2021/2178."
"Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures accounted 
for 1.8% of total operating expenditures, with the largest contribu-
tion from the economic activity “manufacture of organic basic 
chemicals” (0.9%)."

amendments to Appendix C, BASF is able to report the

taxonomy for the first time in 2023.
"The taxonomy-aligned figure is, as before, significantly lower than 
the taxonomy-eligible figure due to various factors."
"Only a small 
proportion of plastics in primary form contain a share of renewable 
raw materials above the threshold value."
"Additionally, the proportion 
of taxonomy-aligned activities is reduced by the fact that many 
plants exceed the benchmarks used by the E.U."
"In addition, plants that are 
not subject to emissions trading and thus cannot be assessed 
 
using the specified criteria were generally classified as not 
 
taxonomy-aligned."

"We expect that 
this weak phase will continue in the first half of 2024 and that growth 
will only accelerate somewhat over the course of the year."
"Overall 
macroeconomic growth in the E.U."
"is expected to remain at a low 
level in the year’s average."
"By contrast, we expect a slowdown on 
average over the year in North America and Asia."
Uncertainty about future developments remains high.
"The 
 
purchasing power of private households is on the rise due to wage 
increases in the previously resilient labor markets of Northwestern 
Europe and the United States."
"However, interest rates are likely to 
remain high despite decreasing inflation rates in the United States 
and Europe."
"This has a negative impact on growth in capital 
 
expenditures and construction investments and dampens the ability 
of private households to spend on interest-sensitive consumer 
goods."
"Recovery in China is extremely volatile, particularly with 
 
regard to the stability of the real estate sector and the development 
of the labor market."
"The geopolitical situation remains tense, 
 
especially in light of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East."
"In our 
forecast, we assume that these conflicts will not escalate further in 
2024, but we also do not anticipate a fundamentally positive 
 
turnaround."
"Trends in the global economy in 2024
We expect GDP growth to remain largely unchanged in the 
 
European Union (E.U.) (2024: +0.8%, 2023: +0.5%)."
"As catch-up 
effects in tourism are weakening and demand for goods is expected 
to stabilize, we forecast growth rates to converge more strongly 
 
in Western Europe."
"While Germany is expected to grow by 0.3% 
again in 2024 following the slight decline in GDP (2023: -0.1%), we 
anticipate growth in France (+0.8%) and Italy (+0.5%) to remain 
largely unchanged."
"In Spain, however, the economy is likely to 
 
cool (2024: +1.4%, 2023: +2.5%)."
"GDP growth in the Eastern 
 
E.U."
"countries is expected to accelerate somewhat as the high 
 
inflation rates and interest rates should decrease noticeably 
 
(2024: +2.1%, 2023: +0.5%)."
"In the United Kingdom, we expect growth to remain weak 
 
(2024: +0.4%, 2023: +0.5%), as the higher interest rate level is 
 
increasingly reflected in mortgage interest rates for private 
 
households."
"In view of the high home ownership rate and shorter 
fixed-interest periods, this effect is generally stronger in the United 
Kingdom than in other European countries."
"Following strong growth in 2023 (+2.5%), we expect a slowdown in 
the United States (2024: +1.8%)."
"Here too, the persistently high 
level of interest rates will slow down growth in private consumption 
as well as capital expenditures and construction investments."
"Furthermore, the depletion of savings built up during the coronavirus 
crisis is increasingly unable to support consumption."
"The 
 
forbearance of student loan repayments, which was introduced 
during the coronavirus pandemic, ended in fall 2023 and is now 
placing an additional burden on private household budgets."

"The sharp rise in  
interest rates over the course of 2023 is expected to dampen growth in the United States and Europe and the catch-up 
effects in services consumption are anticipated to weaken."
"We expect that the demand structure will gradually  
normalize and that the share of goods consumption in private consumption will rise again."
"We expect growth of 2.2%

We expect economic recovery in China to continue."
"Due to the 
higher starting point, however, growth in 2024 will slow compared 
with the previous year (2024: +4.5%, 2023: +5.2%)."
"The 
 
international economic environment remains weak and exports are 
therefore not expected to provide any strong growth stimulus 
 
overall."
"Domestic demand continues to be burdened by the crisis in 
the real estate sector and tight public budgets at provincial level."
"Private household consumption is expected to grow only moderately 
in this environment."
"In the other emerging markets of Asia, we expect stable growth 
overall (2024: +4.9%, 2023: +4.7%) against the backdrop of largely 
constantly growing domestic demand and the gradual recovery in 
export demand from China."
"In India, growth momentum is expected 
to slow slightly, mainly due to a slowdown in investment growth in 
an environment of higher interest rates (2024: +6.2%, 2023: +6.5%)."
"We expect weaker growth in Japan (2024: +0.8%, 2023: +1.8%), 
as exports are growing more slowly now that the recovery effects in 
the automotive industry have come to an end and import prices for 
raw materials and precursors have risen due to the weaker yen."
"By 
contrast, the growth rate of private consumption should remain 
stable, as real incomes are rising moderately."
"Growth in South America is expected to weaken in 2024 (2024: 
+1.0%, 2023: +1.4%)."
"Growth in the region is being supported by 
declining inflation rates in most countries and falling interest rates in 
many countries."
This is offset by narrower fiscal leeway.
"Particularly 
in Argentina, further consolidation measures are required to fight 
hyperinflation and stabilize the currency and to restructure public 
 
finances."
"Industrial production is expected to grow again 
slightly in the advanced economies (2024: +0.4%, 2023: -0.4%)."
"Growth in the emerging markets is expected to accelerate slightly 
(2024: +3.5%, 2023: +2.8%)."
"We are forecasting weak growth of only +1.1% for the entire 
 
transportation industry1 (2023: +9.5%)."
"We expect global 
 
production volumes of passenger cars and light commercial 
 
vehicles to only stagnate (-0.5%) after the strong growth of the 
 
previous year (+9.4%), which was impacted by catch-up effects."
"Global automotive production will therefore remain at a level of 
around 90 million vehicles."
"The share of battery electric vehicles 
(BEVs) in the total production volume is expected to increase further 
from around 12% in 2023 to 15% in 2024."
"Developments will differ 
from region to region: A slight overall decline is expected in Asia."
"While Chinese car production is expected to stagnate at a high level, 
declines are anticipated for Japan and South Korea."
"In contrast, we 
are forecasting further slight growth for North and South America."
We expect production in the E.U.
"and the United Kingdom to 
 
decline."
"However, Western Europe also saw the strongest growth in 
the previous year."
"The energy and raw materials sector is expected to grow slightly 
faster in 2024 than in 2023."
"The expected slightly higher industry 
growth and the associated increase in demand for energy and 
non-energy raw materials will contribute to this."
"In addition, a 
 
normalization of weather conditions after a warmer-than-average 
2023 is expected to increase demand for oil and gas to heat 
 
buildings."
"Growth in the construction industry is well below the long-term 
average due to high interest rates in Europe and the United States 
and the real estate crisis in China."
"While we expect a further decline 
in residential construction in 2024, particularly in Europe and the 
United States, nonresidential construction is likely to continue to 
grow."
"Investment in public and private infrastructure is likely 
 
to remain high, leading to continued dynamic growth in the 
 
infrastructure sector."
"Overall, we expect only slightly higher growth 
for the construction industry compared with the previous year."
"Consumer goods production is expected to grow at around the 
same rate as global GDP

"Demand for furniture, on the other hand, is 
expected to stagnate."
"However, we do not expect the furniture 
 
industry to shrink any further after the sharp decline in 2023."
"The electronics industry is expected to grow more strongly again 
in 2024 after stagnating in the previous year."
"While growth in 
 
traditional consumer electronics is likely to slow down, we again 
expect increases in computers and communication electronics due 
to the short product life cycles."
"Overall, however, the expected 
growth in 2024 remains below the average of previous years."
"We anticipate a recovery in growth in the health and nutrition 
 
sector."
"After the decline in pharmaceutical production in Asia in 
2022 and 2023, we expect a normalization in 2024."
"For the nutrition 
sector, we assume global growth in line with GDP growth."
"Due to 
the stronger growth in the pharmaceutical sector, we are forecasting 
slightly higher growth than GDP for the health and nutrition sector."
"Production in agriculture will presumably grow more moderately in 
2024."
"However, regional trends vary greatly."
"For Western Europe, 
 
moderate growth in agricultural production is expected again after 
the hot summer of 2023 if weather conditions normalize."
"Growth in 
Eastern Europe is expected to remain stable, provided that 
 
production in Ukraine can be maintained at the current level."
"In 
North America, growth is expected to increase slightly."
"By contrast, 
we expect agricultural production in South America to grow slightly 
slower overall."
"However, this varies widely by country: While growth 
in Brazil is expected to weaken after the strong previous year, we 
anticipate that it will pick up in the other countries in the region."
"For 
Asia, which accounts for 65% of global agricultural production, we 
are forecasting a slight slowdown in growth in the agricultural sector 
overall."
"Outlook for the chemical industry 
Global chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) is expected 
to grow by 2.7% in 2024, faster than in the previous year 
 
(2023: +1.7%)."
"We anticipate weak growth in production in the 
 
advanced economies following the sharp decline in the previous 
year (2024: +0.8%, 2023: -4.9%)."
"Growth in the emerging markets 
is expected to slow slightly (2024: +3.5%, 2023: +4.8%)."
"In China, the world’s largest chemical market, we are forecasting 
lower but still high growth in chemical production of 4.0% 
 
following the strong growth in the previous year (2023: +7.5%)."
"We 
expect growth stimulus to come primarily from the consumer goods 
and electronics industries."
"Following the considerable decline in 
 
chemical production in the other emerging markets of Asia, we 
 
expect a gradual recovery (2024: +3.0%, 2023: -2.4%)."
"The main 
growth driver is India with expected growth of 4.5%."
We anticipate gradual stabilization in the E.U.
"This trend was already evident in 
the course of 2023."
"The considerable fall in gas prices and the slow 
 
recovery in demand for goods due to gains in purchasing power are 
expected to support demand for chemicals in Europe."
"Demand for chemicals is also expected to recover slightly in the 
United States (2024: +1.1%, 2023: -1.0%) following the previous 
year, which was characterized by destocking and weak industrial 
growth."
"We anticipate slight growth for most customer industries in 
the manufacturing sector."
"Further growth is also expected for the 
automotive industry in North America."
"However, developments 
 
remain uncertain against the backdrop of high interest rates and the 
associated risk of recession, particularly with regard to the 
 
construction sector."
"For Japan, we are forecasting stagnation in chemical production 
after the sharp decline in the previous year (2024: 0.0%, 
 
2023: -6.6%)."
"Following very strong growth in the previous year, 
 
automotive production is expected to fall."
"Although the other 
 
customer industries are compensating for this decline overall, they 
are unlikely to provide any additional growth stimulus."
"In South America, chemical production will presumably grow 
 
slightly (2024: +1.3%; 2023: -4.7%)."
"We expect to see slowly 
 
increasing demand from the consumer goods industries and 
 
growing automotive production."
"Demand for chemical products 
from the agricultural sector is also expected to continue to grow."
"In addition, 
we will continue to forecast Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions for the BASF Group."
"The main reason for this will be 
the expected persistently high interest rates, which will continue to 
dampen growth in the United States and Europe."
"The positive trend 
in service consumption will no longer be a significant factor."
"Global 
economic growth is only expected to accelerate somewhat later in 
the year, meaning that we expect the global economy to grow by 
2.3% overall in 2024 (2023: +2.6%)."
"In Europe, the comparatively 
very high energy prices and unfavorable framework conditions for 
industrial value creation continue to slow down economic 
development."
"We expect that demand for industrial goods will normalize only 
gradually and that the share of goods in private consumption will rise 
again only slowly."
"For this reason, we only expect very moderate 
growth in most of our customer industries."
"Conversely, we expect 
weak growth overall in the automotive industry following strong 
growth in 2023, which was characterized by catch-up effects."
"Recovery in China remains extremely uncertain, particularly with 
regard to the real estate sector and the development of the labor 
market."
We do not expect any significant growth stimulus in the E.U.
"We are forecasting a gradual slowdown in the United States as a 
result of high interest rates."
"The geopolitical situation remains critical 
against the backdrop of the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and 
other geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States 
and China."
"In our forecast, we assume that these conflicts will not 
escalate even further in 2024, but we also do not anticipate a 
fundamentally positive turnaround."
"All in all, global industrial 
production will likely expand by 2.2% overall (2023: +1.4%)."
"Global chemical production is expected to grow faster in 2024, by 
2.7% (2023: +1.7%)."
"This will be driven primarily by the expected 
growth in the Chinese chemical industry."
"Our planning assumes an 
average oil price of $80 for a barrel of Brent crude and an exchange 
rate of $1.10 per euro."
Volume and margin growth in all segments will contribute here.
"Rising 
fixed costs due to inflation but also in connection with the construction 
of our new Verbund site in China will weigh down earnings in some 
segments."
"The Nutrition & Care, Industrial Solutions and Chemicals 
segments are expected to considerably increase EBITDA before 
special items."
"We anticipate slight earnings growth in the Materials 
segment."
"In the Surface Technologies segment, we are forecasting 
earnings at the prior-year level."
"EBITDA before special items in the 
Agricultural Solutions segment will likely decrease slightly."
"We forecast the BASF  Group’s free cash flow to be between 
€0.1  billion and €0.6  billion (2023: €2.7  billion)."
"This is based on 
expected cash flows from operating activities from €6.6 billion to 
€7.1 billion, minus expected payments made for property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets2 in the amount of €6.5 billion."
"The 
high investment-related cash outflow is mainly due to investments in 
the new Verbund site in China, which will reach their absolute peak 
in 2024."
"The BASF Group’s free cash flow comprises the cash flows of the 
segments and additionally includes transactions that are not 
allocated operationally as well as adjustments of other noncash 
effects."
"For 2024, we expect a considerable decline in cash flows in 
all segments compared with 2023."
"The investment-related cash 
outflow for the construction of the new Verbund site in China will 
primarily affect the Chemicals segment."
"In the other segments, the 
expected decline in cash flows is likely to result primarily from a 
lower cash inflow from the reduction in working capital compared 
with the strong previous year."
"For more information on the calculation of free cash flow and segment cash flow, see page 37

CO2 emissions forecast for the BASF Group
CO2 emissions are expected to be between 16.7 million metric tons 
and 17.7  million metric tons in 2024."
"We anticipate additional 
emissions compared with the previous year from higher production 
volumes based on rising demand."
"We will counteract this increase 
with targeted measures to reduce emissions, such as increasing 
energy efficiency and optimizing processes as well as continuing the 
shift to electricity from renewable energies through the shareholding 
in the Hollandse Kust Zuid offshore wind farm, for example."
“At prior-year level” indicates no change (+/-0.0%).
"Forecast for the segments
In the Chemicals segment, we anticipate a considerable increase in 
income from operations before depreciation, amortization and 
special items (EBITDA before special items) in 2024 despite the 
continued difficult environment."
"Expected volume growth in both 
divisions will contribute to this."
"However, higher fixed costs, mainly 
in connection with the construction of the new Verbund site in 
Zhanjiang, China, and scheduled turnarounds, will have an offsetting 
effect."
"Compared with 2023, we expect a considerable decline in 
the segment cash flow: This will be caused by expected turnarounds 
as well as higher investment expenditure."
"Compared with 2023, we anticipate a slight growth in EBITDA 
before special items for the Materials segment."
"This will be 
attributable to targeted volume and margin growth in both divisions."
"However, in the Monomers division, EBITDA before special items is 
expected to decrease slightly overall."
"The main reason for this will be 
considerably higher fixed costs, as positive one-time effects from 
the previous year will not occur."
"Compared with the prior-year figure, 
we expect a considerable decline in the segment cash flow, 
particularly as a result of a lower cash inflow from working capital."
"The Industrial Solutions segment is expected to considerably 
increase EBITDA before special items compared with 2023."
"This will 
be driven by higher volumes and margins in both divisions, in 
particular as a result of the expected global economic recovery in 
the second half of 2024."
"However, margin growth for Dispersions & 
Resins will be dampened by increasingly competitive market 
conditions."
"Despite the increase in earnings, segment cash flow is 
anticipated to be considerably below the previous year, as planned 
growth will lead to more cash being tied up in receivables and 
inventories."
"The Surface Technologies segment’s EBITDA before special items 
in 2024 is expected to be at the prior-year level."
"A slight increase in 
earnings in the Catalysts division as a result of expected volume 
growth in the battery materials business should offset the expected 
slight decline in earnings in the Coatings division."
"Cash flow in both 
 
 
 
  171

  Combined Management’s Report – Outlook 2024
divisions is expected to decline considerably."
"In the Catalysts 
division, planned investments and a higher amount of cash tied up 
in working capital, especially in the battery materials business, is 
expected to lead to lower cash flow."
"Cash flow in the Coatings 
division will probably decline, mainly as a result of higher expenditure 
on efficiency measures."
"In the Nutrition & Care segment, we expect a considerable increase 
in EBITDA before special items, in particular due to higher volumes 
and margins."
"Both divisions are aiming for volume growth above the 
market average."
"Higher fixed costs, mainly as a result of the 
construction of our new Verbund site in China, are likely to dampen 
earnings development."
"Cash flow in both divisions is expected to be 
considerably below the prior-year level."
"In the Care Chemicals 
division, this will be mainly attributable to a higher amount of cash 
tied up in working capital compared with 2023."
"Cash flow in the 
Nutrition & Health division will decline mainly as a result of increasing 
investment expenditures for aroma ingredients in Ludwigshafen, 
Germany, and in Zhanjiang, China."
"In the Agricultural Solutions segment, we expect EBITDA before 
special items to decline slightly in 2024."
"This will be mainly driven by 
higher fixed costs due to inflation as well as negative currency 
effects, which can only be partially offset by higher sales volumes."
"In 
addition, the receipt of a one-time payment had a positive impact on 
earnings in 2023."
"Segment cash flow is expected to be considerably 
lower in 2024 compared with the prior-year figure, mainly due to a 
higher amount of cash tied up in working capital."
"For the period from 2024 to 2027, we are planning 
capital expenditures totaling €19.5 billion, including €6.8 billion for 
our growth projects – the new Verbund site in China, and the 
expansion of the battery materials business."
"The investment volume 
in the next four years will thus be considerably below that of the 
planning period 2023 to 2026 (€24.5 billion)."
"We aim to increase our per-share dividend 
each year or maintain it at the prior-year level."
"Information on the proposed dividend can be found on page 15
Financing
In 2024, we expect cash outflows in the equivalent amount of 
around €0.5  billion from the scheduled repayment of bonds."
"To 
refinance maturing bonds and to optimize our maturity profile, we 
continue to have medium to long-term corporate bonds and our 
global commercial paper program at our disposal."

The goal of BASF’s risk management is to identify and evaluate opportunities and risks as early as possible and to take appropriate measures to  
seize opportunities and limit risks."
"The aim is to avoid risks that pose a threat to BASF’s continued existence and to make improved managerial decisions to 
create value."
We define opportunities as potential successes that exceed our defined goals.
"We understand risk to be any event that can negatively impact 
the achievement of our short-term operational or medium-term strategic goals."
"Where possible, we use statistical methods to aggregate 
opportunities and risks into risk categories."
"In addition, we use a 
qualitative evaluation scale for opportunities and risks to assess 
both business and sustainability aspects that cannot be quantified."
"In this way, we achieve an overall view of opportunities and risks, 
allowing us to prioritize risks at Group level and take effective risk 
management measures."
"Overall assessment
For 2024, we anticipate that global economic growth will slow 
 
slightly as a result of higher inflation – albeit lower compared with 
2023 – and persistently high interest rates."
"General macroeconomic 
 
uncertainty will remain exceptionally high."
"A further escalation of current geopolitical conflicts could lead to 
disruptions in global supply chains and greater restrictions on the 
supply of energy, industrial raw materials and intermediates."
"The 
wars in Ukraine and the Middle East pose significant risks for market 
development and the supply of raw materials in Europe."
"Furthermore, there are risks to demand due to high interest rates 
and consumers’ reduced purchasing power."
"Opportunities will arise 
in particular from stronger growth in demand resulting from better 
macroeconomic development than assumed."
"In addition to the uncertainties surrounding market growth, material 
opportunities and risks for our earnings arise from margin volatility."
"To assess the opportunities and risks arising from the volatility of 
market growth, margins and currencies, we switched to forward- 
looking market-related assumptions in 2023 in order to reflect the 
specific expectations of the market."
"In previous years, this was 
 
based on historical volatilities with a greater fluctuation range."
"According to our assessment, there continue to be no significant 
individual risks that pose a threat to the continued existence of 
 
the BASF SE or the BASF Group."
"The same applies to the sum of 
individual risks, even in the case of a global economic crisis."
"Ultimately, however, residual risks (net risks) remain in all 
 
entrepreneurial activities that cannot be ruled out, even by 
 
comprehensive risk management."
"As a non-integral shareholding, income from Wintershall Dea AG, 
Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, is reported in net income from 
 
shareholdings."
"The opportunities and risks resulting from the 
 
shareholding in Wintershall Dea are therefore not included in the 
outlook for the EBITDA of the BASF Group."
"Opportunities and risks 
that have an impact on net income from shareholdings and cash 
flow from the shares in Wintershall Dea are monitored and tracked 
through BASF’s involvement in the relevant governing bodies as a 
shareholder."
"Its key features are as follows:
 
Organization and responsibilities
	
– Risk management and the internal control system is the 
 
responsibility of the Board of Executive Directors."
"It defines the 
basic requirements and processes as well as the organization of 
the risk management system."
"It also determines the processes for 
approving investments, acquisitions and divestitures."
"– The Board of Executive Directors is supported by the Corporate 
Center."
"Opportunity and risk management is thus 
 
integrated into the strategy, planning and budgeting processes."
"– BASF’s risk committee reviews the BASF Group’s risk portfolio 
 
at least twice a year to evaluate any adjustments to risk 
 
management measures and informs the Board of Executive 
 
Directors of these."
"– The management and control of specific opportunities and risks 
is largely delegated to the divisions, the service and research units 
and the regions, and is steered at a regional or local level."
"This 
also applies to sustainability-related topics relevant to BASF 
 
including the impact of climate change on BASF."
"A network of risk 
managers in the divisions, service and research units as well as in 
the regions advances the implementation of appropriate risk 
 
management practices in daily operations."
"Financial risks are an 
exception."
"The management of liquidity, currency and interest 
rate risks is conducted in the Corporate Finance department."
"The 
management of commodity price risks takes place in the Global 
Procurement unit or in authorized Group companies."
"– The BASF Group’s management is informed of short-term 
 
operational opportunities and risks that fall within an observation 
period of up to one year in the monthly Management’s Report 
 
produced by Corporate Finance."
"In addition, Corporate Finance 
provides information twice a year on the aggregated opportunity/
risk exposure of the BASF Group."
"Furthermore, any arising 
 
individual risks which have an impact of more than €10 million on 
 
earnings or risks qualitatively evaluated to have a material impact 
on our sustainability targets as well as reputational risks, must be 
reported immediately."
"The Supervisory Board is informed 
 
annually about short-term operational opportunities and risks as 
well as the risk management system and its further development."
"– As part of strategy development, the Corporate Development 
unit additionally conducts strategic opportunity/risk analyses with 
a five-year assessment period."
"These analyses are annually 
 
reviewed as part of strategic controlling and are adapted if 
 
necessary."
"Scenarios are also developed to map possible 
 
impacts beyond the five-year horizon, for example from 
 
climate-related developments."
"The Board of Executive Directors 
and Supervisory Board are informed annually about strategic 
 
opportunities and risks."
"– We also regularly consider exceptional situations at global, 
 
regional and local level – from process safety incidents and goods 
spillages to pandemics and cyberattacks – which are very rarely 
successful but can have a fundamental impact."
"In addition, a 
crisis organization exists to proactively create contingency plans 
where necessary and appropriate."
"The crisis management 
 
organization is activated in the event of a sudden crisis."
"The CCO regularly reports to the Board of 
Executive Directors on the status of implementation as well as on 
any significant results and provides a status report to the 
 
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee at least once a year, 
 
including any major developments."
"The Board of Executive 
 
Directors immediately informs the Audit Committee about 
 
significant incidents."
"For more information on compliance, compliance management and monitoring adherence to our 
compliance principles, see page 202 onward

Risk-specific monitoring and control systems, some of which 
are decentralized, have been set up for each area identified in the 
risk portfolio."
"The results of the monitoring processes are 
 
incorporated into regular risk reporting to the Risk Committee 
 
and the Board of Executive Directors."
"Compared with internal 
control systems in financial reporting, these monitoring and 
 
control systems in other subject areas have a lower degree of 
 
formalization."
"As a rule, however, they also include organizational 
security precautions such as compliance with the basic principles 
of transparency, dual control, segregation of duties and least 
privilege, deployment of sufficiently qualified employees and 
adequate IT systems."
"The design of internal controls depends on 
the subject area."
"It ranges from monitoring the development of 
specific key indicators and evaluating internal and external reports 
or benchmarking analyses to formalized committee meetings in 
which decisions are made on applications for investments or 
research projects, for example."
"In addition, the appropriateness 
and effectiveness of the topic-specific internal control systems is 
monitored by the Corporate Center units responsible for the 
respective topics."

"In addition, the Supervisory Board’s Audit 
Committee addresses the effectiveness and appropriateness of 
these systems as part of its monitoring activities."
"The suitability 
 
of the early risk detection system set up by the Board of Executive 
Directors in accordance with section 91(2) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act is assessed and evaluated by the auditors."
"Tools
	
– The Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC) 
 
Policy, applicable throughout the Group, forms the framework for 
risk management and is implemented by the operating divisions, 
the service and research units and the regions according to their 
specific business conditions."
"– A catalog of opportunity and risk categories helps identify all 
 
relevant financial and sustainability-related opportunities and risks 
relating to our targets as comprehensively as possible."
"We derive 
the sustainability-related opportunities and risks from the materiality 
analysis."
"– The positive contributions and negative impacts of our business 
activities on sustainability topics along the value chain, and the 
impact of sustainability topics on our business are assessed in a 
materiality analysis."
"Opportunities and risks for our business 
activities that could arise from material sustainability topics, or 
 
for sustainability topics that could arise from our business 
 
activities, can only rarely be measured in specific financial 
 
terms and mainly have a medium to long-term impact."
"Relevant 
sustainability topics are systematically considered in our 
 
strategic and operational risk management through our integrated 
risk catalog."
"To reflect these, risks for 
 
companies in connection with the transition to a low-emission 
economy (transition risks) as well as physical risks as defined 
 
by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), among other, were added to this catalog."
"– Because global climate policy ambitions and the implementation 
 
of the relevant measures play a decisive role in the ongoing growth 
 
of the chemical industry and its customer industries, we defined 
and quantified global long-term scenarios (up to 2050) with 
 
various global warming paths."
"To assess the impact of different 
global climate policy approaches on our business units, the 
 
scenarios were discussed by the business units in workshops."
"Feedback was incorporated into the ongoing development of 
 
the scenarios."
"A dataset of scenario-specific macroeconomic 
 
parameters will be provided to test the economic feasibility of 
 
investments and business strategies."
"Our decentralized specialists 
use a central decision tree to document reportable sustainability 
risks within the meaning of section 289b et seq."
"of the German 
Commercial Code."
"No reportable residual net risks within the 
meaning of section 289b et seq."
"of the German Commercial 
 
Code were identified for 2023."
"For more information on our sustainability management processes, see page 48 onward
	
– We use standardized evaluation and reporting tools for the 
 
identification and assessment of risks."
"The aggregation of 
 
opportunities, risks and sensitivities at division and Group level 
 
using a Monte Carlo simulation helps us to identify effects 
 
and trends across the Group."
"We base our sensitivities to oil 
 
and gas prices and currency developments on forward-looking 
 
assumptions in order to reflect specific market expectations 
 
and improve the quality of our forecasts."
"We also aggregate 
 
qualitatively assessed risks at Group level using a risk portfolio."
"– Our Group-wide Compliance Program aims to ensure adherence 
 
to legal regulations and the company’s internal guidelines."
"Our global employee Code of Conduct firmly embeds these 
 
mandatory standards into everyday business."
"Members of the 
Board of Executive Directors are also expressly obligated to follow 
 
these principles."
"Significant features of the internal control and risk  
management system with regard to the Group financial  
reporting process
The Combined Management’s Report and the Consolidated 
 
Financial Statements are prepared by a unit in the Corporate 
 
Finance department."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements are 
derived from the separate financial statements of the subsidiaries 
and joint operations, taking into account the relevant data for the 
joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the 
equity method."
"The BASF Group’s accounting process is based on 
a uniform accounting guideline that, alongside accounting policies 
based on the International Financial Reporting Standards applicable 
in the European Union, defines the significant processes and 
 
deadlines for the Group."
"There are binding directives for the internal 
reconciliations and other accounting operations within the Group."
"Standard software is used to carry out the accounting processes for 
the preparation of the individual financial statements as well as for 
the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"There are clear rules for the 
access rights of each participant in these processes."
"Employees involved in the accounting and reporting process meet 
the qualitative requirements and participate in training on a regular 
basis."
"There is a clear assignment of responsibilities between the 
specialist units, companies and service units involved."
"We strictly 
adhere to the principles of segregation of duties and dual control, or 
the “four-eyes principle.” Complex actuarial reports and evaluations 
are produced by specialized service providers or specially qualified 
employees."
"An internal control system for financial reporting continuously 
 
monitors these principles."
"To this end, methods are provided to 
 
ensure that evaluation of the internal control system in financial 
 
reporting is structured and uniform across the BASF Group."
"They 
also work in accordance with the international risk management 
 
standard, COSO II Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated 
 
Framework."
"176
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Opportunities and Risks
Material risks for the BASF Group regarding a reliable control 
 
environment for proper financial reporting are reviewed and updated 
on an annual basis."
Risks are compiled into a central risk catalog.
"Moreover, a centralized selection process identifies companies that 
are exposed to particular risks, that are material to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the BASF Group, or that provide service 
processes."
The selection process is conducted annually.
"Persons 
responsible for implementing the requirements for an effective 
 
control system in financial reporting are appointed at the relevant 
companies."
"– Identification and documentation of control activities
In order to mitigate the risks to the financial reporting processes 
listed in our central risk catalog, critical processes and control 
activities are documented."
"– Assessment of control activities
After documentation, a review is performed to verify whether the 
described controls are capable of adequately covering the risks."
"In the subsequent test phase, spot checks are carried out to test 
whether, in practice, the controls were executed as described and 
were effective."
"– Monitoring of control weaknesses
The responsible leaders receive reports on any control weaknesses 
identified 
and 
their 
resolution, 
and 
an 
interdisciplinary 
 
committee investigates their relevance to the BASF Group."
"The 
Board of Executive Directors and the Audit Committee are 
 
informed if control weaknesses with a considerable impact on 
 
financial reporting are identified."
"Only after material control 
 
weaknesses have been resolved does the company’s managing 
director confirm the effectiveness of the internal control system."
"Operational opportunities and risks
 
Market growth
The development of our sales markets is one of the strongest 
 
sources of opportunities and risks."
"For more details on our 
 
assumptions regarding short-term growth rates for the global 
 
economy, regions and key customer industries, such as the 
 
chemicals, automotive and construction sectors, see Economic 
Environment in 2024 on pages 167 to 169."
"We also consider opportunities and risks caused by deviations in 
assumptions."
"Macroeconomic opportunities arise from an easing 
 
of geopolitical conflicts and the resulting increase in the supply of 
energy, industrial raw materials and other intermediate goods."
"Increases in energy prices caused, for example, by the wars in 
 
Ukraine and the Middle East, and the even higher inflation rates 
 
resulting from this for manufacturer and consumer prices also pose 
a risk to the economy."
"Additional macroeconomic risks result from 
the escalation of geopolitical conflicts and a further intensification of 
the trade conflict between the United States, and, to some extent, 
the E.U."
"Weather-related influences can result in positive or negative effects 
on our business, particularly in the Agricultural Solutions segment."
"Margins
Opportunities and risks for the BASF Group primarily result from 
higher or lower margins in the Chemicals and Materials segments in 
particular."
"Declining margins for a number of products and value 
chains could further increase pressure on margins."
"Additional 
 
shortages of raw materials could have both a negative and positive 
impact on margins."
"This would have a corresponding effect on our 
EBITDA."
"The year’s average oil price for Brent crude was $82 per barrel in 
2023, compared with $101 per barrel in the previous year."
"For 2024, 
we anticipate an average oil price of $80 per barrel."
"Competition
We continuously enhance our products and solutions in order to 
remain competitive."
"We monitor the market and the competition, 
and try to take targeted advantage of opportunities."
"Regulation/policy
Risks for us can arise from intensified geopolitical tensions, new 
trade sanctions, a lack of global coordination for stricter emission 
limits for production plants and stricter energy and chemicals 
 
legislation as well as a lack of acceptance of new technologies in the 
E.U."
"Furthermore, risks can also arise from regulatory delays in the 
expansion of capacities and infrastructure for electricity from 
 
renewable sources, low-emission hydrogen and the necessary CO2 
infrastructure."
"However, political measures could also give rise to opportunities."
"Procurement and supply chain
Operational risks in procurement are a key topic for BASF, as they 
can impact the company’s supply capability and therefore its 
 
competitiveness."
"Operational 
risks 
in 
procurement 
include 
 
disruptions and delays in the delivery of raw materials due to 
 
weather conditions, supplier insolvencies, quality concerns or 
 
geopolitical events, for example."
"To counter these risks, BASF relies 
on comprehensive risk assessment and control along the entire 
supply chain, on global competition and close cooperation with 
suppliers."
"We take far-reaching measures to avoid such risks or 
minimize their effects."
"Investments/production
We try to prevent unscheduled plant shutdowns by adhering to high 
technical standards and by continuously improving our plants."
"We 
reduce the effects of an unscheduled shutdown on the supply of 
intermediate and end products through diversification within our 
global production Verbund."
"In the event of a production outage – caused by an accident, for 
example – our global, regional or local emergency response plans 
and crisis management structures are engaged, depending on the 
scope of impact."
"Every region has crisis management teams on a 
local and regional level."
"They not only coordinate the necessary 
emergency response measures, they also initiate immediate 
 
measures for damage control and resumption of normal operations 
as quickly as possible."
"Appropriate precautions are 
taken at the sites in the case of a potential change in risk associated 
with climate change."
"These 
optimization measures are designed to prevent production outages 
due to extreme heat waves."
"Short-term risks from investments can result from, for example, 
 
technical malfunctions or schedule and budget overruns."
"We counter 
these risks with stringent project management and controlling."
"Acquisitions/divestitures/cooperations
We constantly monitor the market in order to identify possible 
 
acquisition targets and develop our portfolio appropriately."
"In 
 
addition, we collaborate with customers and partners to jointly 
 
develop new, competitive products and applications."
Acquisitions and divestitures entail both opportunities and risks.
"These arise in connection with the conclusion of a transaction, or it 
being completed earlier or later than expected."
"They relate to the 
regular earnings contributions gained or lost as well as the 
 
realization of gains or losses from divestitures if these deviate from 
our planning assumptions."
"The correlation between variable compensation and the 
success of the company has the effect of minimizing risk."
"Another 
factor is the development of interest rates for discounting pension 
obligations."
"Furthermore, changes to the legal environment of a 
particular country can have an impact on the development of 
 
personnel expenses for the BASF Group."
"For countries in which 
BASF is active, we therefore constantly monitor the relevant 
 
developments in order to identify potential risks at an early stage 
and enable suitable measures to be taken."
"For more information on our compensation system, see page 135
	
For more information on risks from pension obligations, see page 180
Information technology
BASF employs a large number of IT systems."
"We use technologies 
such as artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things to 
develop new business models, corporate concepts and strategies 
and to respond appropriately to changing customer behavior."
"The 
global cybersecurity team is tasked with protecting these IT systems 
and the data and business processes they handle."
"In a connected, 
ever-evolving world, the challenge of protecting BASF against 
 
attackers is becoming ever greater and more complex."
"The threat environment has changed in recent years, as attackers 
have become better organized, use more sophisticated technology 
and have far more resources available."
"A successful attack can, for example, negatively affect plant 
 
availability, delivery quality or the accuracy of our financial reporting."
"Unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as personnel records 
or customer data, competition-related information or research 
 
results, can result in legal consequences or jeopardize our 
 
competitive position."
"This could also cause monetary losses, a 
 
potential loss of reputation and even a loss of customers’ and 
 
partners’ confidence in the security of our products and services."
"To minimize such risks, BASF uses globally uniform processes and 
systems to ensure IT availability and IT security, which are based on 
the recognized ISO 27001 standard."
"These include stable and 
 
redundantly designed IT systems, backup processes, virus and 
 
access protection, encryption systems, and integrated and 
 
standardized IT infrastructure, applications and processes."
"The 
 
 
 
 
  178
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Opportunities and Risks
systems used for information security are constantly tested, 
 
continuously updated, and expanded if necessary."
"In addition, our 
employees receive regular training on information and data protection."
"IT-related risk management is conducted using Group­
-wide 
 
regulations for organization and application, as well as an internal 
control system based on these regulations."
"We employ modern security concepts to keep pace with advanced 
attackers."
"These range from efficient detection and professional 
 
response to defense against attacks and minimizing their potential 
impact."
Strong cybersecurity alliances are also crucial here.
"BASF 
works closely with security authorities and security associations, for 
example as a founding member of the German Cyber Security 
 
Organization (DCSO) and the Cyber Security Sharing and Analytics 
(CSSA) platform in Berlin, Germany."
"BASF has also established an information security management 
 
system and is internationally certified according to DIN EN ISO/IEC 
27001:2017."
"Compliance/legal
We constantly monitor current and potential legal disputes and 
 
proceedings, and regularly report on these to the Board of Executive 
Directors and Supervisory Board."
"In order to assess the risks from 
current legal disputes and proceedings and any potential need to 
recognize provisions, we prepare our own analyses and assessments 
of the circumstances and claims considered."
"In addition, in individual 
cases, we consider the results of comparable proceedings and, if 
needed, independent legal opinions."
"Risk assessment is particularly 
based on estimates as to the probability of occurrence and the range 
of possible claims."
"These estimates are the result of close cooperation 
between the relevant operating and service units together with 
 
Corporate Legal and Corporate Finance."
"If sufficient probability of 
occurrence is identified, we recognize a provision for the proceeding 
concerned."
"Should a provision be unnecessary, we continue to 
 
assess whether these litigations nevertheless represent a risk for the 
BASF Group’s EBITDA as part of general risk management."
"We use our internal control system to limit risks from potential 
 
infringements of rights or laws."
"For example, we try to avoid patent 
and licensing disputes whenever possible through extensive 
 
clearance research."
"As part of our Group-wide Compliance 
 
Program, our employees receive regular training."
"Tax
The recognized tax-related opportunities and risks only concern 
 
taxes that impact the BASF Group’s EBITDA in the short term."
"These arise when BASF has taken a position that differs from the 
opinion of a competent administrative authority."
"If a tax payment has 
already been made and could be reclaimed, we present this as an 
opportunity."
"Conversely, if a potential payment is outstanding in 
accordance with the administrative opinion, this is a risk."
"We 
 
primarily evaluate opportunities and risks with regard to their 
probability of occurrence and, if necessary, set up a provision for the 
relevant risk."
"If a provision is not necessary, we take this into 
 
account in determining EBITDA-relevant risks for the BASF Group."
"Financial opportunities and risks 
Detailed guidelines and procedures exist for dealing with financial 
risks."
"Among other things, they provide for the segregation of 
 
financial instrument trading and back-office functions."
"We continuously monitor activities in countries with transfer 
 
restrictions as a part of risk management."
"This includes, for 
 
example, regular analysis of the macroeconomic and legal 
 
environment, shareholders’ equity and the business models of the 
operating units."
"The chief aim is the management of counterparty, 
transfer and currency risks for the BASF Group."
"Exchange rate volatility
Our competitiveness on global markets is influenced by fluctuations 
in exchange rates."
"For BASF’s sales, opportunities and risks arise in 
particular when the U.S."
dollar exchange rate fluctuates.
"A full-year 
appreciation of the U.S."
"dollar against the euro by $0.01 would 
 
increase the BASF Group’s EBITDA by around €40  million, 
 
assuming other conditions remain the same."
"On the production 
side, we counter exchange rate risks by producing in the respective 
currency zones."
"Financial currency risks result from the translation of receivables, 
 
liabilities and other monetary items in accordance with IAS 21 at the 
closing rate into the functional currency of the respective Group 
company."
"In addition, we incorporate planned purchase and sales 
transactions in foreign currencies into our financial foreign currency 
risk management."
"If necessary, we hedge these risks using 
 
derivative instruments."
"Financing costs
Financing costs are determined in particular by net debt and interest 
rates."
"Interest rate risks result from possible changes in the relevant 
market interest rates and credit risk premiums."
"These can cause a 
change in the fair value of fixed interest rates and fluctuations in the 
interest payments for variable-rate financial instruments, which 
would positively or negatively affect earnings."
"We use interest rate 
swaps and, in individual cases, combined interest and currency 
derivatives to hedge market interest rate risks."
"The credit risk 
 
premiums are mainly influenced by our credit rating and the market 
conditions at the time of issue."
"In the short to medium term, BASF 
is largely protected from the possible effects on its interest result 
thanks to the balanced maturity profile of its financial indebtedness."
"Risks from metal and raw materials trading
Some of BASF’s divisions are exposed to strong fluctuations in raw 
materials prices."
"BASF uses commodity derivatives to hedge these 
market price risks."
"In addition, BASF holds limited unhedged 
 
precious metal and oil product positions for trading on its own 
 
account."
"The value of these positions is exposed to market price 
volatility."
"Adverse changes in market prices negatively affect the 
earnings and equity of BASF."
"These risks are continuously 
 
 
 
 
  179
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Opportunities and Risks
monitored by a central risk management system and limited by strict 
guidelines."
"Liquidity risks
Risks from fluctuating cash flows are recognized in a timely manner 
as part of our liquidity planning."
"We have access to extensive 
 
liquidity at any time thanks to our good ratings, our unrestricted 
 
access to the commercial paper market and committed bank credit 
lines."
"In the short to medium term, BASF is largely protected against 
 
potential refinancing risks by the balanced maturity profile of its 
 
financial indebtedness as well as through diversification in various 
financial markets."
"Risk of asset losses
We limit country-specific risks with measures based on country 
 
ratings, which are continuously updated to reflect changing 
 
environment conditions."
"We selectively use investment guarantees 
to limit specific country-related risks."
"We lower credit risks for our 
financial investments by engaging in transactions only with banks 
with good credit ratings and by adhering to fixed limits."
"We 
 
continuously monitor creditworthiness and adjust limits accordingly."
"We reduce the risk of default on receivables by continuously 
 
monitoring the creditworthiness and payment behavior of our 
 
customers and by setting appropriate credit limits."
"Risks are also 
 
limited through the use of individual hedging strategies, such as 
guarantees."
"Due to the global activities and diversified customer 
structure of the BASF Group, there are no major concentrations of 
credit default risk."
"Risks from pension obligations
BASF grants most employees company pension benefits from either 
defined contribution or defined benefit plans."
"We predominantly 
 
finance company pension obligations externally through separate 
plan assets."
"This particularly includes BASF Pensionskasse VVaG 
and BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V."
"in Germany, in addition to the 
 
large pension plans of our Group companies in North America, the 
United Kingdom and Switzerland."
"To address the risk of 
underfunding due to market-related fluctuations in plan assets, we 
have investment strategies that align return and risk optimization to 
the structure of the pension obligations."
"Stress scenarios are also 
simulated regularly by means of portfolio analyses."
"Adjustments to 
the interest rates used in discounting pension obligations lead 
 
immediately to changes in equity."
"To limit the risks of changing 
 
financial market conditions as well as demographic developments, 
BASF has, for a number of years now, offered its employees almost 
exclusively defined contribution plans for future years of service."
"Some of these contribution plans include minimum interest 
 
guarantees."
"If the pension fund cannot generate this, it must be 
provided by the employer."
"A sustained low interest rate environment 
could make it necessary to recognize pension obligations and plan 
assets for these plans as well."
"Through 
our market-oriented and broad portfolio, which we will continue to 
strengthen in the years ahead, for example, through investments in 
new production capacities, research and development activities or 
acquisitions, we aim to achieve volume growth that slightly exceeds 
this market growth."
"Should global economic growth see 
 
unexpected, considerable deceleration, for example, because of an 
ongoing weak period in the emerging markets, protectionist 
 
tendencies or bottlenecks in the energy markets, the expected 
growth rates could prove too ambitious."
"Additional risks arise from 
geopolitical tensions and outright military conflicts, which could 
 
impact supply chains and reduce efficiency in the international 
 
allocation of resources."
"Moreover, the ambitions of global climate policy and its 
 
implementation will significantly impact the structure of demand 
from our customer industries."
"This is shown by a comparison of 
 
climate policy scenarios that envisage limiting global warming to 
below two degrees Celsius with alternative scenarios that allow for 
more warming."
"In ambitious climate policy scenarios, the structure 
of demand changes due to the use of alternative energy sources 
and raw materials, high investment in resource-conserving 
 
technologies, and changing customer preferences."
"By contrast, 
macroeconomic growth rates typically vary little compared with 
scenarios with pathways with higher levels of warming."
"By contrast, 
 
 
 
  180
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Opportunities and Risks
fossil feedstocks and the production technologies and product 
segments based on fossil feedstocks will become less important."
"This requires further decarbonization of production processes and 
alternative sources of raw materials in order to remain competitive."
"Furthermore, we predict that many producers in countries 
rich in raw materials will expand their value chains in consumer- 
oriented sectors."
"In addition, the proliferation of large-scale digital 
marketplaces for chemicals could impact existing customer and 
supplier relationships."
"We expect a continuous rise in customer demand for sustainable 
solutions – for example, for products with a low carbon footprint, 
made from recycled, circular or bio-based raw materials that are 
biodegradable, or for products with other measurable sustainability 
benefits."
"However, an increase in customer demand for sustainable 
solutions is also highly dependent on regulation."
"Companies with a 
proven track record of providing more sustainable solutions will be 
able to achieve higher growth and profitability as a result."
"The expansion of sharing economy business models could have a 
long-term impact on demand in individual customer industries."
"At 
the same time, higher demands on product features can also create 
opportunities for innovation."
"We are therefore addressing these 
 
topics in research and investment offers for the sustainable transfor-
mation of BASF."
"To strengthen our competitiveness, we are continuously improving 
our production processes, streamlining our administration and 
 
simplifying processes."
"Our research and business focus is on highly 
innovative businesses and differentiation through sustainability 
 
advantages to make our customers and BASF more successful."
"Regulation/policy
We expect continued regulatory and societal pressure to achieve 
environmentally friendly energy production, emission-free energy 
consumption and a climate-neutral resource and raw material base."
"The political approaches to address these issues will vary greatly 
from region to region."
"We see 
risks but also opportunities in the setting of international standards 
for specific product categories or technologies."
"We explain our strategy in meetings with political decision-makers 
and social stakeholders."
"In doing so, we also inform ourselves of the 
changes we must undergo and advocate for a favorable and stable 
regulatory framework at both a national and international level."
"BASF is in a position to make significant contributions toward 
 
achieving the U.N."
"Sustainable Development Goals, particularly 
 
regarding climate neutrality, through new technologies, innovative 
products and processes and its broad product portfolio."
"Innovation
We expect the trend toward increased sustainability requirements in 
our customer industries to continue."
"Our aim is to leverage the 
 
resulting opportunities in a growing market with more sustainable 
innovations."
"The key areas are products with a lower or even 
 
net-zero carbon footprint, circular economy solutions, and safe and 
sustainable products."
"To be successful in these fields, we have 
launched specific research and investment opportunities for the 
 
sustainable transformation of BASF."
"Furthermore, in order to steer 
our innovation portfolio toward increased sustainability, we also 
 
began applying the Sustainable Solution Steering method, revised in 
2023, to the evaluation of innovation projects and integrated it at an 
early stage of our research and development processes."
"There are technical and commercial risks of failure associated with 
every single research and development project."
"We address this by 
maintaining a balanced and comprehensive project portfolio as well 
as through professional, milestone-based project management."
"Further risks may arise from increasing state protectionism and the 
demand for localization of intellectual property in order to achieve 
technological independence."
"Through our Know-How Verbund in 
research and development, we ensure that critical intellectual 
 
property is generated and protected in countries with high 
 
intellectual property standards."
"We expect that the digital disruption of established processes will 
lead to a considerable increase in efficiency and effectiveness in 
some fields through the use of artificial intelligence, among other 
things."
"BASF is therefore committed to taking a leading role in the 
digital transformation of the chemical industry."
"Possible applications 
of digital technologies and solutions are evaluated along the entire 
value chain and implemented throughout the company, for 
 
example, in production, logistics, research and development, 
 
business models and corporate governance."
"Strategic risks include structural changes on the global 
markets, climate change and political developments."
"Supply 
 
security for raw materials, energy and services is increasingly 
 
affected by trade disputes, protectionism, sanctions and 
 
geopolitical conflicts."
"To counter these risks, BASF relies on close 
cooperation with strategic suppliers and continuous monitoring of 
markets and trends."
"We are also seeing an expansion of the regulatory framework 
 
affecting us and our suppliers (for example, the German Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act or the E.U."
"Corporate Sustainability Due 
Diligence Directive)."
"Potential noncompliance by our suppliers may 
lead to a reduced supplier base."
"All risks are continuously analyzed and appropriate strategies and 
measures developed to avert risks or minimize the impact on BASF."
"For more information on supplier management, see page 158 onward
 
Investments
We expect growth in chemical production in emerging markets to 
remain above the global average in the years to come."
"This will 
create opportunities that we want to exploit by expanding our local 
presence."
"In addition, regional value chains help mitigate risks from 
trade conflicts and barriers that pose a challenge to global markets 
and supply chains."
"Decisions on the type, scope and location of our investment 
 
projects are made on the basis of established comprehensive 
 
assessment processes."
"They take into account long-term forecasts 
for the market, margin and cost development, and raw materials 
 
availability, as well as country, currency, sustainability and 
 
technology risks."
"Opportunities and risks arise from potential 
 
deviations in actual developments from our assumptions."
"Mitigation 
plans are in place where risks are substantial."
"Investments in more sustainable technologies represent a long-term 
opportunity, even though they may not be competitive or profitable 
in the short term, depending on the market and the prevailing 
 
regulatory framework."
"The evaluation of opportunities and risks plays a significant role 
 
during the assessment of acquisition targets."
"A detailed analysis 
and quantification is conducted as part of due diligence."
"Examples 
of risks include increased staff turnover, delayed realization of 
 
synergies, or the assumption of obligations that were not precisely 
quantifiable in advance."
"If our expectations in this regard are not 
met, risks could arise, such as a need for impairment."
"Opportunities 
could also arise, for example, from additional synergies."
"We are also 
continuing to develop our portfolio through carve-outs and 
 
divestitures."
"In this context, risks could arise as a result of potential 
warranty claims or other contractual obligations, such as long-term 
supply agreements."
"For more information on our acquisitions and divestitures, see page 45
 
Personnel
BASF anticipates growing challenges in attracting and retaining 
qualified employees in the medium and long term."
"This is due to 
demographic change, particularly in North America and Europe."
"In 
addition, the chemical industry, which is heavily dependent on fossil 
raw materials, is increasingly viewed critically by the public."
"This 
 
increases the risk for the industry that job vacancies may not be 
filled or may be filled only after a delay, and therefore not enough 
qualified talent can be attracted, recruited and retained."
"We address these risks with opportunities to strengthen our 
 
employer branding and our reputation (for example, our “Change for 
the climate” campaign)."
"At local level, we are taking steps to 
strengthen employee engagement and we are implementing offers 
such as succession planning, knowledge management and 
initiatives to improve the balance between personal and professional 
life and promote healthy living."
"This increases BASF’s appeal as an 
employer and retains our employees in the long term."
"For more information on individual initiatives and our targets, see page 132 onward
 
Climate
Ongoing climate change also poses opportunities and risks for 
BASF."
"As an energy-intensive company, climate-related risks arise 
particularly from regulatory changes, such as in carbon prices 
 
through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation."
"In 
addition, BASF’s emissions footprint and intensity could lead to a 
negative perception and reduced appeal among external 
 
stakeholders such as customers, investors and skilled workers."
"To assess the changing physical risks for our sites from climate 
 
change, climate data based on the latest scenarios of the 
 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were compiled 
for our sites in cooperation with an external partner."
"This enables the 
sites to assess the potential physical impact of climate change in the 
coming decades."
"Here, we focus on a climate protection scenario, 
 
 
 
  182
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Opportunities and Risks
supplemented by two scenarios with medium and high levels of 
global warming.1 The most common potential impact is an increase 
in heat and drought."
"The sites are supported by this information in 
the development of their strategies."
"In the current reporting year, a 
specific analysis of physical climate risks was also carried out at 
selected sites."
"It is planned to expand this approach to all of BASF’s 
key sites in the next few years."
"In addition to climate-related risks, there are also opportunities."
"Our 
broad product portfolio includes, among other things, solutions for 
the circular economy and climate protection, such as insulation 
foams for buildings, materials for electromobility or bio-based 
 
products."
"Increased societal demands and the resulting regulations 
offer additional market opportunities for these products."
"We are 
working with numerous scientific and public organizations and 
 
initiatives on solutions for sustainable agriculture that meet 
 
economic, environmental and social demands over the long term."
"183
BASF Report 2023  
  Combined Management’s Report – Corporate Structure
BASF SE operates the BASF Group’s largest Verbund site in 
Ludwigshafen, Germany, and is therefore one the most important 
operating companies of the BASF Group."
"In addition to marketing 
its own production to third parties, BASF SE supplies its products to 
other BASF Group companies, which process them in downstream 
production or sell them on the local market."
"BASF SE also distributes 
products from other BASF Group companies."
"All divisions, with the 
exception of Coatings, are active within BASF SE."
"As the parent 
company, BASF SE is also responsible for various central tasks, 
such as Group management and large parts of the Corporate 
Center."
"In addition, extensive research activities are bundled here."
"As the top parent company, BASF SE directly or indirectly holds 
 
the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group: This is 
reflected above all in the financial assets and the financial result."
"Due to this distinct integration into the BASF Group, BASF SE is 
managed within the framework of the BASF Group’s steering 
 
concept and has not implemented a separate steering concept."
"Income from operations is the most suitable indicator for assessing 
business performance and is therefore BASF SE’s most important 
 
financial key performance indicator."
"In contrast to previous years, 
sales revenue is no longer a most important financial key 
 
performance indicator at BASF SE from this reporting year onward."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements 
of the BASF Group, however, take into account the Financial 
 
Statements of BASF SE, which are prepared in accordance with 
 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)."

Disclosures on BASF SE in Accordance with 
the German Commercial Code (HGB)
The Management’s Report of BASF SE is combined with the Management’s Report of the BASF Group for the first time for 
the 2023 business year."
"As the publicly listed parent company in the BASF Group, BASF SE takes a central 
 
position: Directly or indirectly, it holds the shares in the companies belonging to the BASF Group, and is also one of the 
largest operating companies."
"A complete overview of BASF SE’s operating business is provided by the Consolidated 
 
Financial Statements of the BASF Group."
"Sales decreased in the operating busi-
ness due mainly to lower sales volumes."
"The economic environment 
continues to pose exceptional challenges for the chemical industry."
"Against this backdrop, lower plant capacity utilization, impairments 
on intangible assets totaling €260  million and impairments on 
 
property, plant and equipment totaling €75 million, had an impact 
on BASF SE’s profit in 2023."
"Gross profit on sales declined by 
€272 million to €2,762 million."
"Contrary to our prediction of a considerable increase, income from 
operations decreased by €68  million to -€2,064  million."
"In the 
 
reporting year, income from operations continued to be negatively 
impacted by a high inflation rate on pension obligations."
"In contrast, 
expenses for variable compensation decreased."
"Selling expenses 
decreased by €410  million, due in particular to lower freight and 
shipping costs."
"Administrative costs were €121 million below the 
prior-year level."
"In addition, research expenses decreased by 
€220 million as a result of lower expenditure in the divisions and for 
exploratory research."
"The balance of other operating income and 
expenses declined by €547 million compared with the previous year 
to -€1,284 million."
"Out-of-period income decreased by €45 million, 
primarily due to lower reversals of provisions."
"Furthermore, 
 
€396 million higher expenses from agreed cost transfers from Group 
companies were recognized."
"In addition, €152  million higher 
 
expenses for restructuring measures and €65  million for portfolio 
measures were recorded in connection with the implementation of 
strategic measures."
"By contrast, the foreign currency result 
 
improved by €33 million."
"The financial result rose by €3,360  million compared with the 
previous year to €9,909  million."
"Dividends totaling €4,807  million 
from a Dutch subsidiary of BASF SE, which mainly included retained 
earnings, led to an increase in net income from shareholdings."
"This 
was offset by lower profit transfers, which were influenced in 
 
particular by a lower distribution of retained earnings from a Belgian 
Group company."
"The higher interest result was attributable to a 
positive result from plan assets and lower interest expenses from 
pension obligations."
"Income before income taxes increased by €3,292 million year on 
year to €7,845  million."
"Income tax expenses decreased by 
 
€293 million in the reporting year."
"Due to deferred tax assets and 
 
liabilities, €628  million lower expenses were recorded in the 
 
reporting year."
"By contrast, current income tax expenses increased 
by €335 million."
"Net income increased by €3,585  million compared with the 
 
previous year to €7,434 million in 2023."

by €493 million."
"In addition to scheduled depreciation, impairments 
of €260 million were recognized in the Materials segment."
"Property, 
plant and equipment increased by €38 million."
"Overall, investments 
were slightly higher than scheduled depreciation."
"Furthermore, 
 
impairments of €88  million were recognized, which related in 
 
particular to a plant in the Materials segment."
"Financial assets also 
increased by €235  million due to capital measures at foreign 
 
subsidiaries."
"Current assets and other assets decreased by €5,384 million."
"Receivables from affiliated companies declined by €4,805  million 
due to the repayment of financial investments within the Group, 
lower profit transfers and lower trade accounts receivable within the 
Group."
"The €346 million decrease in trade accounts receivable was 
partly attributable to the sale of accounts receivable as part of a 
factoring program launched in the 2023 business year."
"In addition, 
deferred taxes declined by €408  million and inventories by 
 
€284  million."
"This was offset by an increase of €780  million in 
 
liquid funds."
"This was 
 
partially offset by noncash expenses for deferred taxes as well as 
cash outflows from the decrease in operating liabilities."
"Investing activities generated cash of €543 million (previous year: 
€3,319 million)."
"Cash inflows from repayments of intragroup cash 
investments, the sale of marketable securities and capital decreases 
at subsidiaries exceeded cash outflows for investments in financial 
assets and property, plant and equipment in the reporting year."
"Investments in financial assets mainly related to capital increases at 
foreign subsidiaries."
"Financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of €11,935  million 
(previous year: €4,576  million)."
"This was mainly due to the 
 
repayment of financial liabilities within the Group and the dividend 
payment."
"Issuance of financial debts were offset by repayments of a 
comparable amount."
"In total, liquid funds rose by €977 million to €1,160 million."
"These 
comprise cash on hand and balances with banks."
"Financial position
Equity increased by €4,330  million."
"The net income of 
 
€7,434 million was offset by the dividend of €3,035 million paid for 
the 2022 reporting year, and effects amounting to €70 million from 
the share buyback."
Provisions decreased by a total of €299 million.
"Within this item, 
other provisions declined by €260 million, primarily as a result of 
lower provisions for variable compensation."
"Pension plan assets 
were offset against pension obligations, which resulted in a surplus 
of obligations."
"Overall, provisions for pensions decreased by 
€92 million as a result of this offsetting."
"The main reason for the 
€162 million increase in plan assets was an increase in fair values."
"Pension obligations increased by €70 million, in particular due to the 
effects of the pension adjustments."
"Provisions for taxes rose by 
€53 million."
"Liabilities and other items decreased by €9,635 million."
"Within this 
item, liabilities to affiliated companies decreased by €9,114 million, 
mainly due to the repayment of intragroup borrowings."
"In addition, 
trade accounts payable decreased by €391 million."
"Operating activities generated cash of €12,369 million in the 2023 
reporting year (previous year: €903  million), in particular from 
 
BASF SE’s function as the parent company of the BASF Group."
"At €7,434 million, net income was considerably above the prior-year 
level (previous year: €3,849  million)."
"Considering these assumptions, we expect a considerable 
 
improvement in income from operations in 2024 compared with the 
previous year."
"In 2023, income from operations was negatively 
 
impacted by lower plant capacity utilization, impairments on 
 
intangible assets and impairments on property, plant and equipment 
as well as a one-off cost transfer from a Group company."
"In addition, 
ongoing inflation led to high expenses for pension obligations."
"We 
do not expect the one-off effects to reoccur in 2024."
"Opportunities and risks, risk management system 
BASF SE is generally exposed to the same opportunities and risks 
as the BASF Group."
"BASF SE’s internal control and risk management system with regard 
to the financial reporting process (section 289(4) HGB) is based on 
a uniform accounting guideline that sets out accounting policies and 
the significant processes and deadlines on a Group-­
wide basis."

"This relates in particular to the reporting of 
significant nonfinancial information, which also became mandatory 
for the parent company of the BASF Group, BASF SE, as a result of 
the CSR Directive Implementation Act, which came into effect in 
2017."
"The integrated presentation was selected in the Management’s 
Report for the Nonfinancial Statement (NFS) to be issued in the 
 
reporting year in accordance with sections 289b to 289e of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"The table on this and the following

BASF SE."
"Within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements, the 
auditor KPMG checked pursuant to section 317(2) sentence 4 HGB 
that the NFS was presented in accordance with the statutory 
 
requirements."
"KPMG also conducted a limited assurance of the 
NFS."
"An assurance statement of the limited assurance can be found

relevant international auditing standards for sustainability reporting."

"BASF’s Board of Executive Directors is strictly 
separated from the Supervisory Board, which monitors the Board of 
Executive Directors’ activities and decides on its composition."
"A member of the Board of Executive Directors cannot simultaneously 
be a member of the Supervisory Board."
"As the central duty of 
company management, the Board of Executive Directors defines 
the corporate goals and strategic direction of the BASF Group as 
well as its individual business areas, including the sustainability 
strategy."
"In doing so, the Board ensures that the opportunities and 
risks associated with social and environmental factors for our 
company as well as the ecological and societal impacts of BASF’s 
activities are systematically identified and evaluated."
"In addition to 
long-term economic goals, the corporate strategy appropriately 
takes environmental and social objectives into account, too."
"The 
corporate planning defined on this basis comprises financial and 
sustainability-related goals."
"Furthermore, the Board of Executive Directors determines the 
company’s internal organization and decides on the composition of 
management positions on the levels below the Board."
"It also 
manages and monitors BASF Group business by planning and 
setting the corporate budget, allocating resources and management 
capacities, monitoring and making decisions on significant individual 
measures, and supervising operational management."
"The Board’s actions and decisions are geared toward the company’s 
best interests."
"It is committed to the goal of sustainably increasing 
the company’s value and developing the company over the long 
term, taking into account environmental and social goals as well as 
economic targets."
"The Board’s responsibilities include the 
preparation of the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 
of BASF SE and reporting on the company’s financial and 
nonfinancial performance as well as half-year and quarterly reporting."
"Furthermore, it must ensure that the company’s activities comply 
with the applicable legislation and regulatory requirements as well as 
internal corporate directives (compliance)."
"This includes the 
establishment of appropriate systems for control, compliance and 
risk management as well as establishing a company-wide 
compliance culture with undisputed standards (see page 202)."
"Board decisions are based on detailed information and analyses 
provided by the business areas and specialist units and, if deemed 
necessary, by external consultants."
"The chair of the Board of 
Executive Directors leads the Board meetings."
"Board decisions can 
generally be made via a simple majority."
"In the case of a tied vote, 
the chair of the Board of Executive Directors gives the casting vote."
"However, the chair of the Board of Executive Directors cannot 
enforce a decision against the Board of Executive Directors’ majority 
vote."
The chair of the Board also does not have the right to veto.
"Outside of matters that are assigned to the entire Board for 
consultation and decision-making, all members of the Board of 
Executive Directors are authorized to make decisions individually in 
their designated areas of responsibility."
"This includes its organization, values, 
corporate principles and guidelines as well as internal and external control and monitoring mechanisms."
"Effective and transparent 
corporate governance ensures that BASF is managed and supervised responsibly with a focus on value creation and sustainability."

"These must include at least three

"For the preparation of 
important decisions, such as those on acquisitions, divestitures, 
investments and personnel, the Board has various commissions at 
the level below the Board."
"With the support of the specialist units 
and independently of the affected business area, these committees 
thoroughly assess the planned measures and evaluate the 
associated opportunities and risks."
"Based on this information, they 
report and make recommendations to the Board."
"The Board of Executive Directors informs the Supervisory Board 
regularly, without delay and comprehensively, of all issues important 
to the company with regard to planning, business development, risk 
situation, risk management and compliance."
"Furthermore, the 
Board of Executive Directors coordinates the company’s strategic 
orientation with the Supervisory Board."
"The Statutes of BASF SE and the Supervisory Board have defined 
certain transactions that require the Board of Executive Directors to 
obtain the Supervisory Board’s approval prior to their conclusion."
"Such cases that require approval include the acquisition and 
disposal of enterprises and parts of enterprises, as well as the issue 
of bonds or comparable financial instruments."
"However, this is only 
necessary if the acquisition or disposal price or the amount of 
 
the issue in an individual case exceeds 3% of the equity reported in 
the most recent approved Consolidated Financial Statements of the 
BASF Group."
"For more information on risk management, see the Forecast report from page 173 onward
	
The members of the Board of Executive Directors, including their areas of responsibility and 
memberships in the supervisory bodies of other companies, are listed from page 205 onward."
"BASF aims to fill 
most Board positions with leaders from within the company."
"It is the 
task of the Board of Executive Directors to propose a sufficient 
number of suitable individuals to the Supervisory Board."
"BASF’s long-term succession planning is guided by the corporate 
strategy."
"Irrespective of these individual criteria, a holistic approach 
will determine a person’s suitability for appointment to the Board of 
Executive Directors of BASF SE."
"The standard age 
limit for members of the Board of Executive Directors is 63."
"The Supervisory Board determines the number of members on the 
Board of Executive Directors."
"It is guided by insights gained by 
BASF as a company with an integrated leadership culture and is 
determined by the needs arising from cooperation within the Board 
of Executive Directors."
"The Supervisory Board considers six to be 
an appropriate number of Board members given the current 
business composition, future responsibilities associated with 
development and the fundamental organizational structure of the 
BASF Group."
"The current composition of the Board of Executive Directors meets 
the competence profile and the requirements of the diversity 
 
concept in full."
"It must also be involved 
in making decisions that are of key importance for the company."
"This also includes the Board of Executive Directors’ consideration of 
sustainability topics with regard to corporate governance."
"The 
Supervisory Board is also responsible for auditing BASF SE’s and 
the Group’s Annual Financial Statements."
"As members of the 
Supervisory Board may not simultaneously be on the Board of 
Executive Directors, a high level of independence is already 
structurally ensured with regard to the supervision of the Board of 
Executive Directors."
"In addition to the SE Regulation, the relevant legal basis for the size 
and composition of the Supervisory Board is provided by the 
Statutes of BASF SE and the Agreement Concerning the Involvement 
of Employees in BASF SE (Employee Participation Agreement)."
"The 
latter also includes the regulations applicable to BASF for 
implementing the statutory gender quota for the Supervisory Board."
"The German Codetermination Act does not apply to BASF SE as a 
European stock corporation (Societas Europaea, SE)."
The Supervisory Board of BASF SE comprises 12 members.
"Six 
members are elected by the shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting via a simple majority."
"Six members are elected by the BASF 
Europa Betriebsrat (BASF Works Council Europe), the European 
employee representation body of the BASF Group."
"In accordance 
with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on June 18, 
2020, the period of appointment for newly elected members of the 
Supervisory Board was reduced from five to four years; and the 
Statutes were amended accordingly."
"This ensures that the maximum 
membership duration of 12 years up to which a Supervisory Board 
member can be classified as independent in accordance with the 
German Corporate Governance Code corresponds to a total of 
three election terms."
"Meetings of the Supervisory Board and its four committees are 
called by their respective chairs and independently, at the request of 
one of their members or the Board of Executive Directors."
"The 
shareholder and employee representatives of the Supervisory Board 
prepare for Supervisory Board meetings in separate preliminary 
discussions in each case."
"Resolutions of the Supervisory Board are 
passed by a simple majority vote of the participating Supervisory 
Board members."
"In the event of a tie, the vote of the chair of the 
Supervisory Board, who must always be a shareholder representative, 
shall be the casting vote."
"This resolution process is also applicable 
for the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of 
Executive Directors by the Supervisory Board."
"Resolutions can, as 
needed, also be made in writing or through electronic communication 
outside of the meetings, as long as no Supervisory Board member 
objects to this form of passing a resolution."
"The Supervisory Board 
meets regularly even without the Board of Executive Directors."
"The Supervisory Board has embedded the main reporting 
requirements in an information policy."
"The chair of the Supervisory 
Board is in regular contact with the Board of Executive Directors, 
especially with its chair, outside of meetings as well."
"A list of the members of BASF SE’s Supervisory Board indicating which members are shareholder or 
employee representatives and their appointments to the supervisory bodies of other companies can 
be found from page 207 onward."
"Alessandra Genco has deep 
expertise in accounting, including sustainability reporting, due to her 
studies in economics, her professional experience working for 
financial institutions and her current role as chief financial officer of a 
publicly listed international company."
"Both closely monitor current 
developments in the sustainability reporting and auditing sector and 
actively contribute this expertise to the Supervisory Board and Audit 
Committee."
"The sustainability topic is of such pivotal importance to 
BASF with its economic success, environment and social-related 
aspects that the entire Supervisory Board regularly discusses it in 
detail as a cross-cutting issue."
"This also applies to the significant 
issue of reducing CO2 emissions and the targeted conversion of 
business activities to emission-free energy supply and production 
processes with a lower emission rate."
"Meetings and meeting attendance
In the 2023 business year, meetings were held as follows:
	
– The Supervisory Board met five times."
– The Personnel Committee met four times.
– The Audit Committee met five times.
– The Nomination Committee met once.
– The Strategy Committee met once.
"With the exception of one meeting, at which two members were 
absent, all respective members attended all meetings of the 
Supervisory Board."
"With the exception of one meeting of the Audit 
Committee, at which one member was absent, and the meeting of 
the Strategy Committee, at which one member was absent, all 
respective members attended all meetings of the Supervisory 
Board’s committees."
"During the 2023 business year, the meetings 
of the Supervisory Board and its committees were held almost 
entirely as in-person meetings with the additional option of virtual 
attendance via electronic communication."
"Only the Audit Committee 
held one of its five meetings as completely virtual meetings."
"In December 2017, the Supervisory Board agreed for the first 
time on objectives for the composition, the competence profile and 
the diversity concept of the Supervisory Board."
"These objectives 
and the competence profile have since been continuously updated 
in the implementation of legal requirements and further developed, 
taking into account the recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"The guiding principle for the composition of the 
Supervisory Board is to ensure qualified supervision and guidance 
for the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE."
"– Availability: Each member of the Supervisory Board ensures that 
they invest the time needed to properly perform their role as a 
member of the Supervisory Board of BASF SE."
"The statutory 
limits on appointments and the recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code must be complied with when 
accepting further appointments."
"– Age limit and period of membership: Persons who have 
reached the age of 72 on the day of election by the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting should generally not be nominated for 
election."
"Membership on the Supervisory Board should generally 
not exceed three regular statutory periods in office, which 
corresponds to 12 years."
"– Independence: To ensure the independent monitoring and 
consultation of the Board of Executive Directors, the Supervisory 
Board should have an appropriate number of independent 
members on the board as a whole and an appropriate number of 
independent shareholder representatives."
"The Supervisory Board 
deems this to be the case if more than half of the shareholder 
representatives and at least eight members of the Supervisory 
Board as a whole can be considered independent."
"The 
Supervisory Board’s assessment of independence is based on 
the assessment criteria in the current respective version of the 
German Corporate Governance Code."
"Among other things, this 
means that members of the Supervisory Board are no longer 
considered independent if they have been a member of the board 
for 12 years or longer."
"The Supervisory Board has additionally 
defined the following principles to clarify the meaning of 
independence: The independence of employee representatives is 
not compromised by their role as an employee representative or 
employment by BASF SE or a Group company."
"Prior membership 
of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE does not preclude 
independence following the expiry of the statutory cooling-off 
period of two years."
"Material transactions between a Supervisory 
Board member or a related party or undertaking of the Supervisory 
Board member on the one hand, and BASF SE or a BASF Group 
company on the other, exclude a member of the Supervisory 
Board from being qualified as independent."
"A material transaction 
is defined as one or more transactions in a single calendar year 
with a total volume of 1% or more of the sales of the companies 
involved in each case."
"Furthermore, 
if a Supervisory Board member or a related party of a Supervisory 
Board member holds more than 20% of the shares in a company 
in which BASF SE is indirectly or directly the majority shareholder, 
the necessary independence is also not met."
"Only the 
employee representative Michael Vassiliadis is no longer considered 
independent as he has been a member of the Supervisory Board 
since August 2004, and therefore for over 12 years."
"Since the 2018 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Supervisory 
Board of BASF SE comprises four women, of whom two are 
shareholder representatives and two are employee representatives, 
and eight men."
"The Supervisory Board’s composition meets the 
statutory requirements."
BASF met this requirement in the reporting year.
"With 
 
Dr. Melanie Maas-Brunner, there was one female Board member."
"With six members of the Board of Executive Directors, this 
corresponds to a 16.7 percentage of women."
"In compliance with legal requirements of the FüPoG, the Board of 
Executive Directors decided on target figures for the proportion 
 
of women at the two management levels below the Board of 
Executive Directors of BASF SE."
"BASF views the further development and promotion of women as a 
global duty independent of individual Group companies."
"For this 
purpose, it has committed to ambitious targets on a worldwide 
scale."
"The new target is to increase the proportion of women in 
leadership positions worldwide to 30% by 2030."
"BASF will continue 
to work systematically on expanding the percentage of women in its 
leadership team."
"To achieve this, global measures will be 
implemented and enhanced continuously."
Each BASF SE share represents one vote.
"All of BASF SE’s shares 
are registered shares."
"Shareholders are obliged to have themselves 
entered with their shares into the company share register and to 
provide the information necessary for registration in the share 
register according to the German Stock Corporation Act."
"There are 
no registration restrictions and there is no limit to the number of 
shares that can be registered to one shareholder."
"Only the persons 
listed in the share register are entitled to vote as shareholders."
"Individual 
instructions are only forwarded to the company on the morning of 
the day of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"Voting rights can be 
exercised according to shareholders’ instructions by company-
appointed proxies until the beginning of the voting process during 
the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"There are neither voting caps to 
limit the number of votes a shareholder may cast nor special voting 
rights."
"Registered shareholders are also entitled to file motions pertaining to 
proposals for resolutions made by the Board of Executive Directors 
and Supervisory Board at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and to 
contest resolutions of the meeting and have them evaluated for their 
lawfulness in court."
"Shareholders who hold at least €500,000 of the 
company’s share capital, a quota corresponding to 390,625 shares, 
are furthermore entitled to request that additional items be added to 
the agenda of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2023 Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting was held again for the first time as an in-person meeting, 
i.e., with the shareholders physically present at the meeting venue."
"The 2023 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting resolved a series of 
amendments to the Statutes in connection with the format of the 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and the participation options."
"Accordingly, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized to hold 
the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders’ 
Meeting as a virtual meeting without the physical presence of 
shareholders or their proxies at the venue of the meeting."
"This 
authorization for a period of two years is valid until May 8, 2025."
"This means that shareholders can also be enabled to 
participate in an in-person Annual Shareholders’ Meeting or 
Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting online in the future."
"This also applies if the 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting or an Extraordinary Shareholders’ 
Meeting is held as a purely virtual event."
"The current Statutes of BASF can be found at basf.com/en/corporategovernance
Implementation of the German Corporate 
Governance Code (GCGC)
BASF advocates responsible corporate governance that focuses on 
sustainably increasing the value of the company."
"Only suggestion A.7, whereby the duration of the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting should not exceed six hours, was not 
complied with by BASF in 2023 due to the large number of questions 
asked at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"Each share 
entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
Restrictions on the right to vote or transfer shares do not exist.
"The 
same rights and duties apply to all shares."
"According to the Statutes, 
shareholders are not entitled to receive share certificates (issuance 
of share certificates)."
"There are neither different classes of shares 
nor shares with preferential voting rights."
"Accordingly, the Supervisory Board determines the 
number of members of the Board of Executive Directors (at least 
two), appoints the members of the Board of Executive Directors and 
can nominate a chair as well as one or more vice chairs."
"The 
members of the Board of Executive Directors are appointed for a 
maximum of five years."
"The maximum initial term of appointment is 
three years."
Reappointments are permissible.
"The Supervisory 
Board can dismiss a member of the Board of Executive Directors if 
there is serious cause to do so."
"Serious cause includes, in particular, 
a gross breach of the duties pertaining to the Board of Executive 
Directors and a vote of no confidence by the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board decides on appointments and 
dismissals according to its own best judgment."
"In the 
case of amendments to the Statutes, section 179(2) of the German 
Stock Corporation Act requires a majority of at least three-quarters 
of the subscribed capital represented."
"Pursuant to Article 12(6) of 
the Statutes of BASF SE, the Supervisory Board is authorized to 
resolve on amendments to the Statutes that merely concern their 
wording."
"This applies in particular to the adjustment of the share 
capital and the number of shares after the redemption of repurchased 
BASF shares and after an issue of shares from authorized capital."
"A right to subscribe to the new shares 
shall be granted to shareholders."
"This can also be achieved by a 
credit institution acquiring the new shares with the obligation to offer 
these to shareholders (indirect subscription right)."
"The Board of 
Executive Directors is authorized to exclude the statutory 
subscription right of shareholders to a maximum amount of a total of 
10% of share capital in certain exceptional cases that are defined in

Executive Directors was authorized to purchase up to 10% of the 
BASF shares in issue at the time of the resolution (10% of the 
company’s share capital) until April 28, 2027."
"In the cases specified under (c) and (d), the shareholders’ 
subscription right is excluded."
"The Board of Executive Directors is 
furthermore authorized to retire the shares bought back and to 
reduce the share capital by the proportion of the share capital 
accounted for by the retired shares."
"The purchase price for these own 
shares totaled around €1.4 billion."
"The shares were acquired by the 
banks commissioned by BASF  SE via the stock exchange in 
electronic trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra)."
"On 
February  24, 2023, the Board of Executive Directors announced 
that it would terminate the share buyback program ahead of 
schedule in view of the profound changes in the global economy 
and in line with the company’s priorities for the use of cash."
"All own 
shares repurchased in connection with this share buyback program 
in 2022 and 2023 were canceled, and the company’s share capital 
was reduced pro rata by the amount attributable to the canceled 
shares."
"By contrast, employees of BASF SE and its subsidiaries who are 
classed as senior executives will still receive a severance payment if 
their contract of employment is terminated by BASF within 
18 months of a change of control event, provided the employee has 
not given cause for the termination."
"The employee whose service 
contract has been terminated in such a case will receive a maximum 
severance payment of 1.5 times the annual salary (fixed component) 
depending on the number of months that have passed since the 
change of control event."
"A change of control is assumed when a 
shareholder informs BASF SE of a shareholding of at least 25% of 
the BASF shares or the increase of such a holding."
"The remaining 
specifications stipulated in sections 289a and 315a HGB refer to 
situations that are not applicable to BASF SE."
"This insurance 
policy provides for the level of deductibles of 10% of damages up to 
1.5 times the fixed annual compensation for the Board of Executive 
Directors as prescribed by section 93(2) sentence 3 AktG."
"Share ownership by members of the Board of 
Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board
No member of the Board of Executive Directors or the Supervisory 
Board owns shares in BASF SE and related options or other 
derivatives that account for 1% or more of the share capital."
"Furthermore, the total volume of BASF SE shares and related

Directors and the Supervisory Board accounts for less than 1% of 
the shares issued by the company."

2016 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, in line with 
the E.U."
"Regulation 537/2014 of April 16, 2014 (E.U."
"Statutory Audit 
Regulation)."
"Based on the results of the tendering process, the Audit 
Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that it once 
again propose KPMG for election."
"Owing to the German Financial 
Market Integrity Strengthening Act (FISG), KPMG was proposed for 
election by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting as BASF’s auditor for 
the last time for the 2023 business year."

the auditor responsible for the Consolidated Financial Statements 
since auditing the 2022 Financial Statements."
"Since the 2020 
Financial Statements, the auditor responsible for the Separate 
Financial Statements has been Dr. Stephan Kaiser."
"The total fee paid 
to KPMG and auditing firms of the KPMG group by BASF SE and 
other BASF Group companies for nonaudit services, in addition to 
the auditing fee, was €1.9 million in 2023."
"This represents around 
7.0% of the fees for auditing the financial statements."
"During its meeting on October 20, 2022, BASF SE’s Supervisory 
Board, acting on the recommendation of the Audit Committee and 
after conducting a tendering process in line with the E.U."
"Statutory 
Audit Regulation, resolved to propose to the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting in 2024 that Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft 
be elected as auditor for BASF SE’s Annual Financial Statements 
and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2024 business year."
"It is legally required to change the auditor starting from the 2024 
business year as KPMG will reach the maximum period for annual 
audits shortened by the Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act 
when auditing the 2023 Financial Statements."
"The decision was 
preceded by a public and discrimination-free tendering process for 
the selection of a new auditor in line with the relevant provisions of 
the E.U."
Statutory Audit Regulation.
"The selection process was 
conducted at an early stage in order to give the new auditor enough 
time to complete nonauditing services, in this way ensuring its 
independence and a seamless transition."
"Our Code of Conduct firmly embeds these mandatory 
standards into our employees’ day-to-day business."
"Members of the Board of Executive Directors are 
also expressly obligated to follow these principles."
"It describes our commitment to responsible conduct and 
 
expectations around how all BASF employees interact with 
 
business partners, officials, coworkers and the community."
"At the 
core of our Compliance Program is the global, standardized 
 
Code of Conduct."
"All employees and leaders are obligated to 
 
adhere to its guidelines, which cover topics ranging from corruption 
and antitrust laws to human rights, labor and social standards, 
conflicts of interest and trade control, and protection of data privacy."
"The online version of our Code of Conduct is aimed at our 
 
employees and also offers user-friendly features such as case 
 
studies, FAQs and additional references."
"We provide our employees 
worldwide with up-to-date content such as videos, links to specialist 
units and guidelines as well as direct contact to subject specialists on 
the internal online platform and the corresponding app."
"Other binding governance documents (policies, corporate 
 
requirements) are provided on an internal digital platform that offers 
our employees an advanced search function and context-based 
links to further information."
"The managing directors of BASF Group 
companies can find important information and assistance on 
 
ensuring compliance in their Group companies on an intranet page 
set up especially for them."
"Abiding by compliance standards is the foundation of responsible 
leadership."
This has also been embedded in our corporate values.
"We are convinced that compliance with these standards will play a 
key role in securing our company’s long-term success."
"Our efforts 
are principally aimed at preventing violations from the outset."
"We perform a systematic risk analysis to identify and assess 
 
material risks of compliance violations, including corruption."
"This is 
conducted at divisional and Group company level."
"The regular com-
pliance audits performed by the Corporate Audit department are 
another source of information for the systematic identification of 
risks, which are documented in the relevant risk or audit report."
"The 
same applies to specific risk minimization measures as well as the 
time frame for their implementation."
"One key element in violation prevention is compulsory training and 
workshops held as classroom or online courses."
"Within a 
 
prescribed time frame, all employees are required to take part in 
basic training, refresher courses and special tutorials dealing with, 
for example, antitrust legislation, taxes or trade control regulations."
"Course materials and formats are constantly updated, taking into 
account the specific risks of individual target groups and business 
areas."
"In 2023, employees around the world were asked to test and 
refresh their knowledge in a new interactive online training course."
"More than 88,700 employees completed this roughly 40-minute-long 
refresher course."
"For more information on the BASF Code of Conduct, see basf.com/code-of-conduct
Compliance culture at BASF
For corporate compliance to be a success, there must be an active 
culture of living these values and commitments within the company."
"The principles embedded in our Code of Conduct are established 
and recognized in our day-to-day business."
"We expect all 
 
employees to act in line with these principles."
"Our leaders play a key 
role here – they serve as an example of and communicate our values 
and culture both internally and externally."
"That is why special 
 
workshops on integrity as a leadership task were again held in 2023 
for newly appointed senior executives."
"Monitoring adherence to our compliance principles
BASF’s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) reports directly to the 
 
Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and manages the 
 
further development of our global compliance organization and our 
Compliance Management System."
"The CCO is supported in this 
task by the Corporate Compliance department and more than 
 
100 compliance officers and representatives worldwide in the 
 
regions and countries as well as in the operating divisions, service 
units and in the Corporate Center."
"Material compliance topics are 
regularly discussed in the compliance committees established at 
global and regional level."
"The compliance organization reports to 
the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee in at least one of its 
meetings each year on the status of the Compliance Program as 
well as any major developments."
"In the event of significant 
 
incidents, the Audit Committee is immediately informed by the 
Board of Executive Directors."
"We particularly encourage our employees to actively and promptly 
seek guidance if in doubt."
"They can consult their supervisors, 
 
specialist departments, such as the Legal department, and the 
compliance officers and representatives of the company."
"The 
 
internal platform and the corresponding app also help employees 
to access advice by enabling direct contact."
"In addition, our 
 
employees can contact our compliance hotline – including 
 
anonymously – to report potential violations of laws or company 
guidelines."
"An independent external company has been contracted 
to manage this global hotline so that reported cases are 
 
systematically recorded and processed worldwide in a single, 
 
uniform system."
"The central point of contact is a website that 
 
informs all employees worldwide about the hotline and the 
 
grievance procedure in their national language."
"In addition to local 
phone numbers, the website also offers an online contact option, 
which is available via PC or smartphone."
"The website is also 
 
available to the public."
"Each concern is documented according to 
specific criteria, properly investigated in line with standard internal 
procedures and answered as quickly as possible."
"The outcome of 
the investigation as well as any measures taken are documented 
accordingly and included in internal reports."
"In 2023, 643 reports were received by our external hotlines (2022: 
453)."
"Our updated training materials and the option to contact us 
online have contributed to the increased use of our hotline."
"The 
 
information received related to all categories of our Code of 
 
Conduct, including respect in the workplace, corruption, handling of 
company property and environmental, health and safety issues."
"We 
carefully investigated all cases of suspected misconduct that came 
to our attention and, when necessary, took countermeasures on a 
case-by-case basis."
"These included, for example, improved control 
mechanisms, additional informational and training measures, 
 
clarification and expansion of the relevant internal regulations, as 
well as disciplinary measures as appropriate."
"Most of the justified 
cases related to violations of our principles on respect in the 
 
workplace and personal misconduct in connection with the 
 
protection of company property or inappropriate handling of 
 
conflicts of interests."
"In such isolated cases, we took disciplinary 
measures in accordance with uniform internal standards and also 
pursued claims for damages where there were sufficient prospects 
of success."
"In 2023, violations of our Code of Conduct led to 
 
termination of employment in a total of 48 cases (2022: 34)."
"This 
relates to diverse employee groups, including executives."
"BASF’s Corporate Audit department monitors adherence to 
 
compliance principles, covering all areas in which compliance 
 
violations could occur."
"It checks that employees uphold regulations 
and make sure that the established processes, procedures and 
monitoring tools are appropriate and sufficient to minimize potential 
risks or preclude violations in the first place."
"In 2023, 64 audits of 
this kind were performed Group-wide (2022: 47)."
"Our compliance 
management system itself is also regularly audited by the internal 
Corporate Audit department, most recently in December 2022."
"Overall, the audit results speak for the effectiveness of the 
 
compliance management system."
"Building on our internal 
 
Compliance Management System (CMS) policy made available in 
September 2022, we stipulated additional supplementary guidelines 
in 2023 to describe the principles, core processes and roles in our 
system in a dedicated manner."
"A particular focus of our compliance 
activities is to draw attention to the increasingly stringent legal 
 
regulations, such as data protection or the German Supply Chain 
Due Diligence Act (see page 156), and to further develop our internal 
systems accordingly."
"We monitor our business partners in sales for potential compliance 
risks based on the global Guideline on Business Partner Due 
Diligence using a checklist, a questionnaire and an internet-based 
analysis."
The results are then documented.
"If business partners are 
not prepared to answer the questionnaire, we do not enter into a 
business relationship with them."
"A dedicated global Supplier Code 
of Conduct applies to our suppliers, which covers compliance with 
environmental, social and corporate governance standards, among 
other requirements."
"As part of our trade control processes, we also 
check whether persons, companies or organizations appear on 
sanction lists due to suspicious or illegal activities and whether there 
are business processes with business partners from or in countries 
under embargo."
"One focus of our activities in 2023 was on the 
continuous monitoring and implementation of the dynamically 
 
evolving sanctions law requirements in light of the war in Ukraine."

The Supervisory Board has not established a special sustainability committee.
"Sustainability is of such fundamental importance to the BASF Group that it is the focus 
of the work of the entire Supervisory Board and is discussed intensively in plenary 
sessions."
"As a material crosscutting issue, sustainability affects all the Supervisory 
Board’s supervision activities and is therefore considered in depth by the entire 
Supervisory Board."
"Sustainability expertise is therefore broadly embedded in the 
Supervisory Board and has long been a very important requirement for its work."
"For information on the composition of the committees and the tasks assigned to them by the Supervisory Board, see the

Audit Committee also maintains regular contact with the auditor between meetings, in 
particular regarding the progress of the annual audit, and reports back to the

Governance Report provides extensive information on the BASF Group’s corporate 
governance."

Independence and efficiency review
An important aspect of good corporate governance is the independence of Supervisory 
Board members and their freedom from conflicts of interest."
"The Supervisory Board 
bases the assessment of the independence of its members on the recommendations 
of the German Corporate Governance Code and the additional criteria for assessing 
the independence of Supervisory Board members contained in the Rules of Procedure 
of the Supervisory Board."
"The criteria used to assess independence are presented in 
the Corporate Governance Report on page 197."
"Based on these criteria, the 
Supervisory Board came to the conclusion that all of the six shareholder representatives 
and five of the six employee representatives – 11 of the 12 members of the Supervisory 
Board in total – are considered to be independent as of the end of 2023."
"Employee 
representative Michael Vassiliadis was formally classified as nonindependent due to 
the length of his membership on the Supervisory Board, which exceeds 12 years."
"Above and beyond this, the Supervisory Board does not see any indications that the 
Supervisory Board role is not performed completely independently."
"In cases where 
Supervisory Board members hold supervisory or management positions at companies 
with which BASF has business relations, we see no impairment of their independence."
"The scope of these businesses is not material and furthermore, they are conducted at 
arm’s length."
"The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its activities in the form of a 
self-assessment."
"In 2023, individual 
discussions were held between members of the Supervisory Board and the Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board."
"These discussions confirmed that the Supervisory Board 
works together professionally and with a high degree of trust."
"The composition and 
structure of the Supervisory Board continue to be regarded as effective and efficient."
The Audit Committee conducted a detailed self-assessment of its activities in 2023.
"This was based on a questionnaire sent to all members of the Audit Committee, the

BASF Report 2023  
  Corporate Governance – Report of the Supervisory Board
results and detailed suggestions of which were discussed in depth by the Audit 
Committee at its meeting on October 20, 2023."
"On this basis, the members 
judged the Audit Committee’s work to be efficient and appropriate."
"There was no 
fundamental need for improvement."
"As a suggestion, sustainable finance will be 
addressed and implemented as an additional topic in 2024."
"Furthermore, the auditor certified that the Board of Executive Directors had taken the 
measures incumbent on it under section 91(2) of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG) in an appropriate manner."
"In particular, it had instituted an appropriate early risk 
detection system that fulfilled the requirements of the company and is suitable for the 
early identification of developments that could pose a risk to the continued existence 
of the BASF Group."
"The results of the audit as well as the procedure and material 
findings of the audit of the financial statements are presented in the Auditor’s Report."
"On the basis of its audit, KPMG did not raise any objections 
 
to reporting and the satisfaction of the relevant statutory requirements."
"The auditor 
also audited the Compensation Report for the 2023 reporting year established in 
accordance with section 162 AktG, including the related disclosures."
"The auditor also 
provided the Supervisory Board with detailed explanations of the reports on the day 
before the accounts meeting."
"The chair of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of this 
preliminary review at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 21, 2024."
"On this 
basis, the Supervisory Board examined the Financial Statements of BASF SE for 
2023, the proposal by the Board of Executive Directors for the appropriation of profit, 
and the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements and Combined Management’s 
Report for the BASF Group and BASF SE."
"The results of the preliminary review by the 
Audit Committee and the results of the Supervisory Board’s own examination fully 
concur with those of the audit."
"The Supervisory Board sees no grounds for objection 
to the management or the reports submitted."
"At its accounts meeting on February  21, 2024, the Supervisory Board approved 
 
the Financial Statements of BASF SE and the Consolidated Financial Statements of 
the BASF Group prepared by the Board of Executive Directors making the 2023 
Financial Statements of BASF SE final."
"The Supervisory Board concurred with the 
proposal of the Board of Executive Directors regarding the appropriation of profit and 
the payment of a dividend of €3.40 per share."
"The Compensation Report is available at basf.com/compensationreport
Composition of the Supervisory Board
The composition of the Supervisory Board did not change in 2023."
"The mandates of 
all current Supervisory Board members run until the end of the current Supervisory 
Board period, that is, until the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 2024."
"At its meeting on 
November  30, 2023, the BASF Europa Betriebsrat (European Works Council) 
unanimously reelected the six current employee representatives from the Supervisory 
Board."
"Their new term of office begins at the end of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 
on April 25, 2024, and ends at the end of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in 2028."
"According to the Supervisory Board’s assessment, the current members meet the 
objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board in full with respect to 
 
the competence profile and the diversity concept."
"This also applies to the expertise on 
the sustainability topics important to BASF."
"They are a component of the Combined Management’s 
Report."
"Pursuant to section 317(2) sentence 6 HGB, the auditor checked 
that the disclosures according to section 315d HGB in conjunction 
with section 289f(2) HGB were made."
"The BASF Group Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 were prepared according to the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union, as well 
as the IFRSs in the version adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), 
London."
"We have established effective internal control and steering systems in order to ensure that the 
BASF Group’s Combined Management’s Report and Consolidated Financial Statements 
comply with applicable accounting rules and to ensure proper corporate reporting."
"The internal control and risk management system we have set up is specifically designed to 
enable the Board of Executive Directors to identify material risks early on and take appropriate 
defensive measures as necessary."
"The appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control 
and risk management system are continually audited throughout the Group by our Corporate 
Audit department."
"In addition, we have audited the 
management report of the Company and the Group (combined 
management report) of BASF SE for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not 
audited the content of those components of the combined 
management report specified in the “Other Information” section of 
our auditor’s report."
"The combined management report includes cross-references, 
marked as unaudited, that are not provided for by law."
"In 
accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited 
the cross-references and the information to which the cross-
references refer."
"In all
material respects, this combined management report is
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies
with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the
opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our opinion on
the combined management report does not cover the content of
the combined management report specified in the “Other
Information” section of the auditor’s report."
"The combined
management report includes cross-references, marked as
unaudited, that are not provided for by law."
"Our audit opinion
does not extend to the cross-references and the information to
which the cross-references refer."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our 
audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
combined management report."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are 
further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined 
Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are 
independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and 
professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional 
responsibilities 
in 
accordance 
with 
these 
requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the 
EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-
audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit 
Regulation."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the 
consolidated 
financial 
statements 
and 
on 
the 
combined 
management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed 
in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters."
"Recoverability of goodwill
For information on the accounting principles applied, the 
underlying assumptions used in the measurement and the 
disclosure on the impairment tests performed please refer to 
Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements from page 264."
"BASF Report 2023

Solely the original text in German language is authoritative.
"The financial statement risk
Intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements of 
BASF  SE include goodwill in the amount of EUR 7,499 million."
"Goodwill accounts for 9.7 % of total assets and thus has a material 
impact on the Parent Company’s net assets."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, irrespective of any 
indication of impairment."
"If any indications of impairment arise 
during the financial year, an event-driven goodwill impairment test 
is also carried out during the year."
"As a result of impairments on 
assets, an additional event-driven test was carried out on the 
battery materials cash-generating unit as at December 31, 2023."
"The goodwill impairment test involves the carrying amount being 
compared with the recoverable amount of each cash-generating 
unit."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss must be recognized."
"The recoverable amount is 
the higher amount of fair value less costs to sell and value in use of 
the cash-generating unit."
"Impairment testing of goodwill is complex and based on a number 
of assumptions requiring judgment."
"These include the forecasts for 
future cash inflows in the detailed planning period, the assumed 
growth rate for subsequent periods and the cost of capital."
"These 
assumptions have a material impact on the recoverability of 
goodwill."
"The growth forecasts of the Board of Executive Directors 
are associated with risks and can be revised in light of volatile raw 
materials prices and an unstable macroeconomic environment."
"Based on the impairment tests conducted, the Company did not 
identify any need to recognize impairment losses."
"There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that any 
existing impairment as at the reporting date was not identified."
"In 
addition, there is a risk that the disclosures in the notes on the key 
assumptions are not appropriate."
"Our audit approach
With the involvement of our valuation specialists, we assessed, 
among other things, the appropriateness of the key assumptions 
as well as the Group’s methods of calculation for both the event-
driven and the annual impairment test."
"We compared internal growth 
forecasts with industry expectations and those of significant 
competitors and we assessed whether the assumptions contained 
in the planning regarding the future development of margins and 
the amount of investments were appropriate."
"Our review of the 
appropriateness of the budgets approved by management also 
included a comparison of planning in past business years with the 
results actually achieved."
"For selected cash-generating units, we 
examined whether reasons for not reaching budgeted figures in the 
past were given appropriate consideration in current planning, to 
the extent that this was relevant."
"We assessed the appropriateness of the assumed growth rate for 
the period following the detailed planning period on the basis of 
industry-specific and macroeconomic studies."
"We evaluated the 
methodological appropriateness of the calculation and the 
appropriateness of the weighted average cost of capital."
"To this 
end, we calculated our own expected values for the assumptions 
and data underlying the weighted cost of capital rates and 
compared these with the assumptions and data used."
"For the cash-generating units battery materials and catalysts 
(excluding battery materials), we used our own calculations to 
assess the methodologically and mathematically appropriate 
implementation of the valuation method and analysed deviations."
"In order to take forecast uncertainty into account, we examined the 
impact of potential changes in the cost of capital, the EBITDA 
margin of the last detailed planning year on the recoverable 
amount by evaluating alternative scenarios as calculated by the 
Company (sensitivity analysis)."
"Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes on the 
key assumptions are appropriate."
"This also included an 
assessment of the appropriateness of the disclosures pursuant to 
IAS 36.134(f) on sensitivities in the event of a reasonably possible 
change in key assumptions underlying the evaluation."
"Our observations
The calculation method underlying both the event-driven and the 
annual impairment test of goodwill is appropriate and in line with 
the accounting policies to be applied."
"The assumptions and data of the Board of Executive Directors 
underlying the measurement are appropriate overall."
"The disclosures in the notes on the key assumptions are 
appropriate."

Other Information
The Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board are 
responsible for the other information."
"The other information also includes the remaining parts of the 
annual report."
"The other information does not include the 
consolidated financial statements, the combined management 
report information audited for content and our auditor’s report 
thereon."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report do not cover the other information, 
and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form 
of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in this 
regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of 
Executive Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility 
for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In 
addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the 
going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic 
alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements and this combined 
management report."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Independent Auditor’s Report
223
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud
may 
involve 
collusion, 
forgery, 
intentional 
omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the
Board of Executive Directors and the reasonableness of
estimates made by the Board of Executive Directors and related
disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and
in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may
cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern."
"– Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the
financial information of the entities or business activities within
the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the combined management report."
"We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"– Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report
with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with
[German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"– Perform audit procedures on the prospective information
presented by the Board of Executive Directors in the combined
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit
evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions
used by the Board of Executive Directors as a basis for the
prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of
the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not
express a separate opinion on the prospective information and
on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the
prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We 
describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in accordance 
therewith is further described below."

process."
"Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB."
"We 
exercise 
professional 
judgment 
and 
maintain 
professional 
skepticism throughout the assurance work."
"– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the
assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the
effectiveness of these controls."
"– Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether 
the 
file 
made 
available 
containing 
the 
ESEF
documents  meets the requirements of the Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as of the

other facts and circumstances are reviewed."
"In addition to BASF SE, the Consolidated Financial Statements 
include all material subsidiaries on a fully consolidated and all 
material joint operations on a proportionally consolidated basis."
"Companies of minor importance for the presentation of a true and 
fair view of the net assets, financial position and results of 
operations, are not consolidated, but rather are reported under 
other shareholdings."
"These companies are carried at amortized 
cost and are written down in the case of an impairment."
"The 
aggregate assets and equity of these companies amount to less 
than 1% of the corresponding value at Group level."
"Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using 
the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Associated companies are entities that are not subsidiaries, joint 
ventures or joint operations, and over whose operating and 
financial policies significant influence can be exercised."
"In general, 
this applies to companies in which BASF has an investment of 
between 20% and 50%."
"Equity-
accounted income from integral joint ventures or associated 
companies is reported as part of income from operations (EBIT)."
"Equity-accounted income from non-integral associated companies 
is reported in net income from shareholdings."
"B For more information, see Note 10 from page 253 onward
Consolidation methods: Assets and liabilities of consolidated 
companies are uniformly recognized and measured in accordance 
with the principles described herein."
"For companies accounted for 
using the equity method, material deviations in measurement 
resulting from the application of other accounting principles than 
those applied by BASF are adjusted."
"Transactions between consolidated companies as well as 
intercompany profits resulting from trade between consolidated 
companies are eliminated in full."
"Sales and material other balances 
and transactions between joint operations and fully consolidated 
Group companies are also eliminated."
"Material intercompany 
profits related to companies accounted for using the equity 
method are eliminated."
"Capital consolidation is conducted at the acquisition date 
according to the purchase method."
"Initially, all assets, liabilities and 
additional intangible assets that are to be capitalized are measured 
at fair value regardless of the scope of any noncontrolling interests."
"Subsequently, the cost of acquiring the company is compared with 
the proportional share of the fair value of the net assets acquired."
The resulting positive differences are capitalized as goodwill.
"Negative differences are reviewed once more, then recognized 
directly in the income statement."
"Non-controlling interests are measured at fair value on the date of 
acquisition proportional to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed (partial goodwill method)."
"The incidental acquisition costs of a business combination are 
recognized in the income statement under other operating 
expenses."
"B For more information, see Note 13 on page 263
Foreign currency translation: The cost of assets acquired in 
foreign currencies and revenue from sales in foreign currencies are 
determined by the exchange rate on the date the transaction is 
recognized."
"Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are valued 
at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date."
"Changes in 
assets and liabilities arising from foreign currency translation are 
recognized in the income statement."
"They are then reported under 
other operating income or expenses, other financial result, and, in 
the case of financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, in other comprehensive income."
"BASF Report 2023

Translation of foreign currency financial statements: The 
translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the 
functional currency of the consolidated companies."
For certain companies outside the eurozone or U.S.
"dollar zone, 
the euro or U.S."
"dollar is the functional currency (among others, 
BASF Tuerk Kimya Sanayi ve Ticaret Ltd."
"Sti., Istanbul, Turkey, 
and BASF Argentina S.A., Buenos Aires, Argentina)."
"All other balance sheet items are 
translated using closing rates on the balance sheet date; other 
expenses and income are translated at monthly average rates."
"The 
resulting translation differences are recognized in the income 
statement under other operating income or expenses."
"If necessary, 
financial statements in the functional currency are translated into 
the presentation currency according to the closing rate method."
"Selected exchange rates
EUR 1 equals
Closing rates

"Business combinations: In business combinations, the acquired 
assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on the date the 
acquirer effectively obtains control."
"The fair value of acquired 
assets and assumed liabilities at the date of acquisition, as well as 
the useful lives of the acquired assets, are largely based on 
projected cash flows."
"Actual cash flows can deviate significantly 
from those."
"Independent external appraisals are typically used for 
the purchase price allocation of material business combinations."
"Valuations in the course of business combinations are based on 
existing information as of the acquisition date."
"Specific 
estimates or assumptions used in individual accounting or 
valuation methods are disclosed in their respective sections of the 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"They are based 
on the circumstances and estimates on the balance sheet date 
and thus affect the amounts of income and expenses shown for 
the reporting periods presented."
"Although uncertainty is appropriately incorporated in the valuation 
factors, actual results can differ from these estimates."
"Furthermore, 
extraordinary challenges resulting from current geopolitical and 
economic developments are also considered."
"Current inflation 
developments were taken into account both in the measurement 
of pension provisions and other provisions as well as in the fixed 
asset impairment tests."

Climate and sustainability-related developments: The chemical 
industry is resource-intensive."
"BASF is committed to the Paris 
Climate Agreement: Using resources as efficiently and responsibly 
as possible and the concept of a circular economy are firmly 
embedded in BASF’s strategy and its actions."
"BASF pursues 
clearly defined goals to reduce CO2 as well regarding the use of 
renewable and recycled raw materials."
"In this context, BASF 
always strives to employ raw materials more efficiently and improve 
production processes as well as to continually seek ways to use 
non-fossil, renewable or recycled feedstocks."
"Despite the current 
global political situation, the path to climate neutrality is resolutely 
being pursued."
"For this reason, current developments and 
measures relating to climate change and sustainability do not lead 
to fundamentally changed expectations with regard to useful lives 
or recoverability of the majority of noncurrent assets."
"There is also 
no material need for adjustments to provisions for environmental 
and restoration obligations."
"In individual cases, however, plants 
may be shut down if necessary for reasons of environmental 
protection."
"Climate policies are also causing fundamental changes 
in the automotive industry, one of BASF’s key customer industries."
"The transition to electromobility will have a long-term negative 
impact on the emissions catalyst business."
"This development was 
reflected in a negative long-term growth rate used in the goodwill 
impairment test for the Catalysts (excluding battery materials) 
cash-generating unit without leading to an impairment."
"Other BASF 
businesses will benefit from this transformation; for example, 
demand for innovative lightweight components and battery 
materials will grow."
"Of these companies, four were in Europe (one of those in 
Germany), three in North America, two in South America, Africa, 
Middle East and two in Asia Pacific."
"Three companies with 
headquarters in Europe (one of those in Germany) were added to 
the scope of consolidation in connection with the expansion of the 
battery materials business."
"One company with headquarters in 
Asia Pacific was included for the first time due to its increased 
importance."
"Three companies, two of which with headquarters in Germany and 
one in South America, Africa, Middle East, merged."
"A list of the companies included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and of all companies in which BASF SE has a

3 Acquisitions and divestitures
Acquisitions
No material activities were acquired in 2023 or 2022."
"The compensation component agreed as part of the establishment 
of BASF Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Changsha, China, 
in 2021 was realized in the amount of €18 million in 2023 and 
2022 respectively."
"A purchase price adjustment for the polyamide business acquired 
in 2020 led to a payment of €5 million in 2023 (2022: €13 million)."
"Divestitures
In 2023, BASF sold the following activity:
– On August 31, 2023, BASF completed the sale of its production
site in De Meern, Netherlands, to IQatalyst B.V., Luxembourg, a
subsidiary of ASC Investment Sarl, Luxembourg."
"The transaction
mainly covered facilities for the production of nickel-based
catalysts, including the associated infrastructure and inventories."
The production site was part of the Catalysts division.
"The
purchase price was €13 million, and the after-tax disposal loss
was €4 million."
"Since then, BASF’s remaining shares in HKZ Investor
Holding B.V."
have been accounted for using the equity method.
"The 
proportional 
net 
income 
was 
presented 
in 
the
BASF Group’s income from operations."
"The integral investment
is not allocated to any division but reported under Other."
"The
disposal group of the wind farm investment was derecognized in
April 2022 when the shares were sold."
"The disposal gain
included the gain from the transition from full consolidation to the
equity method and was likewise presented in income from
operations."
"– On September 30, 2022, BASF closed the divestiture of its
kaolin minerals business to KaMin, a global performance
minerals company headquartered in Macon, Georgia."
"The
divestiture comprised the production hub with sites in Daveyville,
Toddville, Edgar, Gordon and related mines, reserves and mills
in Toomsboro and Sandersville in Georgia."
"The refinery catalysts
production located at the same site remained part of BASF
operations and was not included in the divestiture."
"The kaolin
minerals business was allocated to the Performance Chemicals
division."
"The disposal group of the kaolin minerals business was 
derecognized in September 2022 when the transaction closed."
"The adjustment of the disposed net assets led to a €6 million 
increase in disposal loss after taxes in 2023."
"– On October 31, 2022, BASF completed the sale of its
production site in Quincy, Florida, and the associated attapulgite
business in the Dispersions & Resins division to Clariant
Corporation, Louisville, Kentucky."
"The Quincy site employed
around 75 employees and manufactured clay-based mineral
products used in a variety of industrial applications."
"The
purchase price was $60 million."
"The following overview shows the effects of the divestitures in 
2023 and 2022 on the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The 
sales line item shows the year-on-year decline resulting from 
divestitures."
"The impact on equity related mainly to gains and 
losses from divestitures."
"Payments received from divestitures 
amounted to €32 million and related to various smaller transactions 
as well as to payments received in connection with outstanding 
purchase price receivables and the purchase price adjustment for 
a transaction from previous years."
"As a non-integral shareholding, Wintershall Dea is 
accounted for using the equity method."
The list of shares held is also published online.
"Activities that are not allocated to any of 
the divisions are recorded under Other."
"The same accounting rules are used for segment reporting as 
those used for the Group, which are presented in these Notes."
"Transfers between the segments are generally executed at 
adjusted market-based prices, taking into account the higher cost 
efficiency and lower risk of intragroup transactions."
"Assets, as well 
as their depreciation and amortization, are allocated to the 
segments based on economic control."
"Assets used by more than 
one segment are allocated according to the percentage of usage."
"Income from operations (EBIT) before special items was used for 
the internal steering of the segments and to complement the key 
performance indicator, return on capital employed (ROCE), up to 
and including 2023."
"It is determined based on EBIT, which is 
calculated from gross profit on sales, selling expenses, general 
administrative expenses, research and development expenses, 
other operating income and expenses, and income from integral 
companies accounted for using the equity method."
"To calculate 
EBIT before special items, this figure is then adjusted for special 
items."
"EBIT and EBIT before special items as well as EBITDA 
and EBITDA before special items are alternative performance 
measures that are not defined under IFRS and are to be 
considered complementary to the indicators defined by IFRS."
"It supplies the other segments with basic chemicals and 
intermediates, thereby contributing to the organic growth of the 
BASF Group."
"In addition to internal transfers, the segment mainly 
serves customers in downstream industries, especially in the 
chemical and plastics industries."
"The segment’s competitiveness is 
strengthened 
by 
technological 
leadership 
and 
operational 
excellence, process and product innovations as well as the 
development of sustainable technologies."
"The Materials segment is composed of the Performance Materials 
and the Monomers divisions."
"The segment offers advanced 
materials and their precursors for new applications and systems."
"Its product portfolio includes isocyanates and polyamides as well 
as inorganic basic products and specialties for plastics and 
plastics 
processing."
"In 
addition 
to 
specific 
technological 
knowledge, industry expertise and customer proximity, particularly 
products that contribute to the circular economy as well as 
sustainable production methods help differentiate BASF from its 
competitors in this segment."
"The Industrial Solutions segment consists of the Dispersions  & 
Resins and the Performance Chemicals divisions."
"This segment 
develops and markets ingredients and additives for industrial 
applications, such as polymer dispersions, resins, electronic 
materials, antioxidants and additives."
"As part of the sustainability 
strategy, this segment’s focus is on the creation of more efficient 
production structures and processes that better conserve 
resources."
"Its customers come from key industries such as 
automotive, plastics and electronics."
"The Surface Technologies segment bundles chemical solutions 
for surfaces in the Catalysts and Coatings divisions."
"Its portfolio 
range serves the automotive and chemical industries and includes 
catalysts, battery materials, automotive OEM and refinish coatings, 
surface treatment, and precious and base metal services."
"Innovations and solutions customized in collaboration with its 
customers in the field of sustainable mobility are growth drivers for 
this segment."
"The Nutrition & Care segment comprises the Care Chemicals 
division and the Nutrition & Health division."
"This segment produces 
ingredients for consumer applications in the areas of nutrition, 
home and personal care."
"Its customers include food and feed 
producers as well as the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and the 
detergent and cleaner industries."
"The segment’s competitiveness 
is strengthened, among other things, by focusing on trends in 
digitalized business models and sustainability in the consumer 
goods markets."
"An example of the latter is the expansion of the 
portfolio with bio-based and biodegradable products."
"The Agricultural Solutions segment consists of the division of the 
same name."
"As an integrated provider, its portfolio comprises 
fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and biological crop protection 
products, as well as seeds and seed treatment products."
"Furthermore, Agricultural Solutions offers farmers innovative and 
sustainable solutions based on digital technologies combined with 
practical advice."
Other is comprised of the remaining businesses.
"These include 
commodity trading, engineering and other services, as well as 
rental income and leases."
"Discontinued operations and certain 
activities remaining after divestitures are also reported here."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
242
The following activities are also presented under Other:
– The steering of the BASF Group by corporate headquarters."
"– Cross-divisional corporate research, which includes plant
biotechnology research, works on long-term topics of strategic
importance to the BASF Group."
"Furthermore, it focuses on the
development of specific key technologies, which are of
overriding importance for the divisions."
"– Trade with renewable energies as well as the activities of the Net
Zero Accelerator unit, which bundles cross-company projects to
achieve climate protection targets."
"– Foreign currency results not allocated to the segments and
measurement effects from the hedging of raw materials price
and foreign currency exchange risks; as well as gains and losses
from the long-term incentive programs (LTI programs)."
"– Remanent fixed costs resulting from organizational changes or
restructuring that are not allocated to a division; idle capacity
costs from internal human resource platforms; and consolidation
effects that cannot be allocated to a division."
"This resulted mainly from miscellaneous 
income and expenses, which in the previous year had included 
special income from the disposal of shares in the Hollandse Kust 
Zuid offshore wind farm."
"A special charge in the amount of 
€110  million arose in the current reporting year primarily for 
severance payments in connection with restructuring."
"Foreign 
currency results, hedging and other measurement effects were 
down by €62 million year on year, due mainly to lower gains on the 
valuation of commodity derivatives as well as expenses from the 
long-term incentive programs, following gains in the previous year."
"Improved income from other businesses as well as lower costs for 
corporate research had an offsetting effect."
"On December 31, 2023, the carrying 
amounts of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and 
investments accounted for using the equity method amounted to 
€10,362 million (2022: €10,937 million) in the United States."
"In China, sales to third parties in 2023 amounted to €8,950 million 
(2022: €11,216 million) according to location of companies and 
€8,893 million (2022: €11,022 million) according to location of 
customers."
"On December 31, 2023, the carrying amounts of 
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and investments 
accounted for using the equity method amounted to €7,802 million 
(2022: €6,457 million) in China."
"Pursuant to IAS 33, a 
potential dilutive effect must be considered in the diluted earnings 
per share for those BASF shares that will be granted in the future 
as part of BASF’s “plus” share program."
"This applies regardless of 
the fact that the necessary shares are acquired on the market by 
third parties on behalf of BASF and that there are no plans to issue 
new shares."
"The average number of outstanding shares declined compared 
with 2022 due to the share buyback program in effect until 
February 24, 2023."
"No dilutive effect arose from the issue of “plus” 
shares in 2023 or 2022."
"Control is considered to be transferred when 
the customer can direct the use of the goods or services and can 
obtain all substantial remaining benefits from them."
BASF primarily generates income from the sale of goods.
"Because 
the customer obtains control of the goods at a specific point in 
time, the corresponding sales revenue is recognized based on a 
given point in time."
"The 
transfer of risks and rewards takes into account the underlying 
terms of delivery (especially Incoterms) and is of particular practical 
significance."
"According to these principles, sales revenue from the 
sale of goods is generally recognized upon delivery."
"If products are 
delivered to a consignment warehouse, BASF normally retains 
control of the goods."
"Accordingly, sales revenue is not recognized 
until the customer collects the goods from the consignment 
warehouse."
"Long-term supply agreements usually contain variable 
prices, which depend, among other factors, on the development of 
raw materials prices, and variable volumes."
"Services rendered to customers by BASF are invoiced according 
to work completed and recognized as revenue accordingly."
"BASF generates a portion of its sales revenue from license 
agreements."
"Sales revenue from license agreements is recognized 
based on a point in time or a period of time depending on whether 
the licensee is being granted a right to use (revenue recognized at 
a point in time) or a right to access (revenue recognized over time) 
the intellectual property of BASF."
"Revenues from sales and usage-
based royalties are recognized when the underlying sale or usage 
occurs."
"Sales revenue from the sale of precious metals to industrial 
customers is recognized on delivery and the corresponding 
purchase prices are recorded as cost of sales."
"In the trading of 
precious metals and their derivatives with traders, where there is 
usually no physical delivery, revenues are netted against the 
corresponding costs."
"Commodity swaps that do not lead to a 
transfer of economic control are eliminated."
"If a consideration that is contractually agreed upon by a customer 
includes variable components, BASF estimates the amount of the 
consideration."
"Variable components are recognized as revenue 
only to the extent that it is highly probable that previously 
recognized sales revenue will not have to be cancelled as soon as 
there is no longer uncertainty about the actual amount of the 
consideration."
"Primarily 
rebates 
and 
other 
discounts 
are 
recognized as a reduction in revenue in accordance with the 
principle of individual measurement."
"BASF grants customers 
rebates, among other things, if the goods purchased by the 
customer exceed a contractually defined threshold within the 
period specified."
"Rebates are usually deducted from amounts 
payable by the customer."
"Taking into account the specific terms of 
the underlying contract, BASF uses the expected value method or 
the most likely amount to estimate a variable consideration 
amount."
"The method is selected based primarily on number of 
possible results such as the number of volume thresholds with 
rebates."
"All available information, particularly historical values, is 
used for making estimates."
"In some contracts, BASF grants the customer the right to return 
goods within a specific period of time, even if they meet the agreed 
specifications (sale with right of return)."
"The actual expected 
amount of the consideration BASF is entitled to receive in this case 
is estimated using the expected value method."
"Refund liabilities are 
recognized in the amount of considerations paid by the customer 
for goods that are expected to be returned."
"BASF also applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15.121 of not 
reporting information on remaining performance obligations 
resulting from a contract with a maximum expected original term of 
one year."
"Furthermore, information on performance obligations is 
not reported if the resulting revenue is recognized in accordance 
with IFRS 15.B16."
"Sales revenue for the 2023 fiscal year includes €238 million from 
performance 
obligations 
satisfied 
in 
prior 
periods 
(2022: 
€175 million)."
"This relates in particular to adjustments for sales and 
usage-based royalties as well as the reversal of over accruals for 
rebates and product returns from the previous year."
"BASF Report 2023

8 Functional costs
Under the cost of sales method, functional costs incurred by the 
operating functions are determined on the basis of cost center 
accounting."
"The functional costs particularly contain the personnel 
costs, depreciation and amortization accumulated on the 
underlying final cost centers as well as allocated costs within the 
cost accounting cycle."
"Operating expenses that cannot be 
allocated to the functional costs are reported as other operating 
expenses."
"B For more information on other operating expenses, see Note 9 from page 251 onward
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes all production and purchase costs of the 
company’s own products as well as merchandise that has been 
sold in the period, particularly plant, energy and personnel costs."
"Selling expenses
Selling expenses primarily include marketing and advertising costs, 
freight costs, packaging costs, distribution management costs, 
commissions and licensing costs."
"General administrative expenses
General administrative expenses include the costs of the 
Corporate Center, of general management, the Board of Executive 
Directors and the Supervisory Board."
"They also include the costs 
of managing operating divisions and business units as well as the 
costs of the supporting services in departments such as 
accounting, legal, taxes and controlling."
"Research and development expenses
Research and development expenses include the costs resulting 
from research projects as well as the necessary license fees for 
research activities."
The prior-year figures have been restated accordingly.

251
Income from the adjustment and release of provisions 
recognized in other operating expenses resulted in 2023 from 
the release of provisions for environmental measures in North 
America."
"As in the previous year, additional income resulted from 
release of provisions in connection with the restructuring of the 
Global Business Services unit."
"In addition, income resulted in both 
years from the adjustment to provisions for risks from lawsuits and 
damage claims, closures and restructuring measures, employee 
obligations, and various other individual items as part of the normal 
course of business."
"Provisions were reversed or adjusted if, based 
on the circumstances on the balance sheet date, utilization was no 
longer expected, or expected to a lesser extent."
"In both years, revenue from miscellaneous other activities 
primarily included income from rentals, catering operations, cultural 
events and logistics services."
"The rise in revenue over the previous 
year was largely compensated by higher production costs."
"In 2023, income from hedging transactions and LTI programs 
mainly included income from the valuation of virtual and physical 
power purchase agreements in North America."
"A decline in income 
from hedging transactions for the procurement of natural gas was 
attributable to lower prices."
"Moreover, this item in the previous 
year had included income from the release of provisions for the 
long-term incentive (LTI) programs in the amount of €24 million."
"In 
2023, by contrast, expenses were incurred for additions to these 
provisions."
"Gains on divestitures and the disposal of noncurrent assets in 
2023 were mainly from the sale of an office building in Europe and 
the divestiture of some smaller businesses."
"In 2022, this item 
primarily consisted of gains on the sale of 51% of shares in the 
company holding the interest in the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm 
and the sale of the production site in Quincy, Florida."
"B For more information, see Note 3 from page 240 onward
The rise in income from the reversal of valuation allowances for 
business-related receivables was particularly due to the reversal 
of valuation allowances relating to a transaction tax in Brazil."
"In both years, income from refunds and government grants was 
mainly attributable to grants for regional business developments in 
China and other funding measures in various countries."
"Additionally, reimbursements from the government in connection 
with a plant closure in 2019 occurred in 2023."
"Other income included income from the sale of CO2 certificates in 
the amount of €185 million in 2023."
"Income in both years related 
to gains from the sale of precious metals as well as multiple other 
items."
"In both years, additional expenses were largely 
attributable to restructuring measures to improve competitiveness 
in various operating divisions and site closures in Europe and North 
America."
"Expenses also resulted in 2022 from the adjustment of 
business activities in Russia."
"In both years, expenses from 
integration measures related almost entirely to the integration of 
the battery materials business, which had been acquired in 2021."
"Environmental protection and safety measures, costs of 
demolition and removal, and project costs not subject to 
mandatory capitalization were expensed if requirements for 
mandatory capitalization pursuant to IFRS were not met."
"Expenses 
for demolition, removal, and project planning totaled €407 million in 
2023 and €352 million in 2022, and related mainly to the site in 
Ludwigshafen, Germany, and the development of the new 
Verbund site in China in both years."
"Expenses for the battery 
materials business in Schwarzheide, Germany and Finland were 
also included in both years."
"Additionally, expenses of €123 million 
in 2023 and €59 million in 2022 arose from additions to 
environmental 
provisions 
which 
mainly 
concerned 
several 
discontinued sites in North America in both years."
"Depreciation, amortization and impairments of noncurrent 
assets and of the disposal groups in 2023 included impairments 
in the amount of €1,149 million."
"These comprised impairments on 
property, plant and equipment in the Surface Technologies 
segment, especially in the battery materials business, on plants in 
the Agricultural Solutions segment and on property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets in the Materials segment."
"In 2022, 
impairments amounted to €393 million relating primarily to plants in 
Ludwigshafen, Germany, and De Meern, Netherlands."
"Impairments 
to construction in progress from discontinued investment projects 
were also included in both years."
"B For more information, see Note 14 from page 264 onward
Costs from miscellaneous revenue-generating activities relate 
to the corresponding items presented in other operating income."
"Expenses from hedging transactions and LTI programs in 
2023 included expenses of €83 million and in 2022 of €61 million 
from hedging transactions, primarily attributable in both years to 
expenses for option premiums used to hedge natural gas 
purchases."
"Furthermore, expenses arose from changes in the fair 
value of currency derivatives and other hedging transactions."
"LTI 
programs led to expenses in the amount of €35 million in 2023."
"In 
the previous year, income resulted from the reversal of provisions 
for LTI programs."
"In both years, losses from divestitures and the disposal of 
noncurrent assets were mainly in connection with the divestiture 
of the site in De Meern, Netherlands."
"Additional expenses in 2023 
resulted from purchase price adjustments for divestitures in 
previous years as well as consulting costs."

Investments accounted for using the equity 
method and other financial assets
Accounting policies
Joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for using 
the equity method."
"The carrying amounts of shareholdings are 
adjusted annually based on the pro rata share of net income, 
dividends and other changes in equity."
"Should there be indications 
of a reduction in the value of an investment, an impairment test is 
conducted and, if necessary, an impairment is recognized in the 
income statement."
"In the case of publicly listed associated 
companies, share prices are included in the impairment test and 
form the basis of valuation if there is an indication for permanent 
impairment or reversal of an impairment."
"Furthermore, earnings 
and the carrying amount are adjusted when accounting policies 
deviate or as a result of purchase price allocations, which primarily 
affects Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany."
"Exploration and development expenses in the oil and gas 
business, for which the equity method is applied, are accounted 
for using the successful efforts method."
"Under this method, costs 
of successful exploratory drilling as well as successful and dry 
development wells are capitalized."
"Income from integral companies accounted for using the 
equity method decreased by €194 million in 2023."
"Of the 
decrease, €175 million related to the shareholding in BASF-YPC 
Company Ltd."
"(joint venture) and €28 million to Markor Meiou 
Chemical (Xinjiang) Co., Ltd., Korla, China (associated company), 
primarily due to lower sales prices and volumes."
"Lucura

"The company holds shares in the Hollandse 
Kust Zuid offshore wind farm and manages the power supply

Additional information on the BASF-YPC Company Ltd."
"The material non-
integral shareholding is the Wintershall Dea AG oil and gas 
company, in which BASF holds a 72.7% share."
"The remaining 
shares are held by LetterOne."
"Wintershall Dea is classified as an 
associated company because, in addition to BASF and LetterOne, 
independent members are also represented in the board 
responsible for decisions about relevant activities and BASF can 
thus only exercise significant influence."
"Income from non-integral companies accounted for using the 
equity method increased by €4,771 million in 2023 due primarily to 
a lower burden on earnings from Wintershall Dea AG."
"In 2022, 
expenses 
from 
the 
deconsolidation 
of 
Wintershall 
Dea 
shareholdings in Russia and impairments of assets primarily related 
to Russia were recognized in the total amount of €6,517 million 
(BASF interest after taxes)."
"In 2023, however, income was 
negatively impacted by the addition of restructuring provisions and 
the depreciation of the Argentine peso."
"Values in use were determined in the impairment test in December 
2023 for the assets held by Wintershall Dea for which purchase 
price adjustments exist at BASF level."
"The assumptions applied for 
production and cost trends as well as the price assumptions 
largely correspond with Wintershall Dea’s."
"This did not lead to any 
material impairments or reversals of impairments."
"KG, planned costs for the downsizing and ultimate 
closure of Wintershall Dea’s head offices, and the cash position."
"Currency effects particularly 
arose in 2022 at Wintershall Dea."
"With the deconsolidation of the 
Russian shareholdings held by Wintershall Dea, total differences 
arising from currency translation of €868 million were reclassified 
as earnings to the income statement in 2022."
"Changes in the scope of consolidation and disposals in 2023 
resulted from adjustments to the scope of consolidation at 
Wintershall 
Dea 
and 
the 
sale 
of 
the 
shareholding 
in 
Quantafuel  ASA, Oslo, Norway."

Income taxes
Accounting policies
In Germany, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 15.0% as well 
as a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% thereon are levied on all 
distributed and retained earnings."
"In addition to corporate income 
tax, income generated in Germany is subject to a trade tax."
"It 
varies depending on the municipality in which the company is 
represented."
"The weighted average tax rate was 14.6% in 2023 
(2022: 14.6%)."
"The 30% rate used to calculate deferred taxes for 
German Group companies remained unchanged in 2023."
"The 
income of foreign Group companies is assessed using the tax 
rates applicable in their respective countries."
"Deferred taxes are recorded for temporary differences between the 
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
according to IFRS and the carrying amounts for tax purposes as 
well as for tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits."
"These 
also comprise temporary differences arising from business 
combinations, with the exception of goodwill."
"Deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are calculated using the respective country-specific 
tax rates applicable for the period in which the asset or liability is 
realized or settled."
"Tax rate changes enacted or substantively 
enacted on or before the balance sheet date are taken into 
consideration."
"Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities 
provided they are related to the same taxation authority."
"Surpluses 
of deferred tax assets are only recognized provided that the tax 
benefits are likely to be realized."
"The valuation of deferred tax 
assets is based on the assessment of the ability to utilize tax loss 
carryforwards and unused tax credits."
"This depends on whether 
future taxable profits will exist during the period in which temporary 
differences are reversed and in which tax loss carryforwards and 
unused tax credits can be claimed."
"The assessment of 
recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on internal 
projections of the future earnings of the particular Group company."
"Changes in deferred taxes in the balance sheet are recorded as 
deferred tax expense or income unless the underlying transaction 
is recognized directly in equity or in income and expenses 
recognized in equity."
"For those effects which have been 
recognized in equity, changes to deferred tax assets and tax 
liabilities are also recognized directly in equity."
"Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for differences between the 
proportional IFRS equity and the tax base of the investment in a 
consolidated subsidiary if a reversal of these differences is 
expected in the foreseeable future."
"Deferred tax liabilities are 
recognized for dividend distributions planned for the following year 
if these distributions lead to a reversal of temporary differences."
"Provisions for German trade tax, corporate income tax and similar 
income taxes are calculated and recognized based on the 
expected taxable income of the consolidated companies less any 
prepayments that have been made."
"Provisions are set up for 
interest accrued."
"This interest is reported under other financial 
result, not tax expense."
"Other taxes to be assessed are considered 
accordingly."
"IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of the recognition and 
measurement policies from IAS 12 when there is uncertainty 
regarding income tax-related treatment of individual transactions."
"They are accounted for with the assumption that tax authorities will 
examine the questionable transaction and have all relevant 
information."
"The amount of risk provisions is calculated and 
reviewed with consideration for the results of past tax audits as 
well as the legal assessment of not yet audited transactions and 
the risk of a deviating tax-related interpretation by the tax 
authorities."
"The most probable value of the individual risks is 
recognized."
BASF falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules.
"The relevant Pillar Two legislation was enacted in Germany and will 
be applicable in the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024."
"BASF 
expects the application of the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules to 
result in an increase in taxes on income and earnings by a low to 
mid double-digit million euro amount since the relevant tax rate is 
under 15% in a small number of jurisdictions."
"The actual impact 
may differ from this projection."
"BASF applies the exception in IAS 12 whereby no deferred tax 
assets or liabilities are recognized in connection with Pillar Two 
income taxes under the OECD Model Rules; nor are any 
disclosures made on the matter."
"Tax expense and tax rate
The BASF Group tax rate amounted to 73.3% in 2023."
"It was 
impacted by non-recognition of deferred tax assets, especially in 
Germany."
"The higher tax rate from the previous year of 132.9% 
resulted 
mainly 
from 
non-tax-effective 
impairments 
of 
Wintershall  Dea  AG, which is accounted for using the equity 
method, particularly from the deconsolidation of its Russian 
exploration and production activities."
"The tax effects of various underlying matters are presented in the 
following reconciliation of income taxes and the effective tax rate."
"This reconciliation was changed with respect to the expected tax 
rate from the previous 15% (the applicable corporate income tax 
rate in Germany) to 30% (a tax rate combining corporate income 
and trade tax)."
"This is intended to better illustrate the effects of not 
recognizing deferred tax assets, because otherwise only the 
amounts relevant to corporate income tax would be included in the 
corresponding line."
"This change made a separate disclosure of 
trade tax and the solidarity surcharge superfluous."
"The prior-year 
figures were adjusted accordingly."
"Tax loss carryforwards
No deferred tax assets were recognized for tax loss carryforwards 
of €9,062 million (of which €4,113 million relate to German 
corporate income tax and €4,376 million to German trade tax) in 
2023 (2022: €3,260 million)."
"Of these, €2 million will expire in 2024, 
€0 million in 2025, €0 million in 2026, €56 million in 2027, 
€135  million in 2028, and €5  million in 2029 and thereafter."
"The 
remaining €8,863 million will not expire."
"Net surpluses of deferred tax assets for companies that reported 
tax losses in 2023 or 2022 totaled €254  million as of 
December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: €376 million)."
"Deferred 
taxes were recognized because, due to planned earnings, the use 
of temporary differences or loss carryforwards is expected."
"Tax liabilities
Tax liabilities primarily include assessed income taxes and other 
taxes as well as estimated income taxes not yet assessed for the 
current year."
"Income and expenses recognized in equity that were attributable 
to noncontrolling interests totaled -€74 million in 2023 and 
€6  million in 2022."
"These effects mainly resulted from currency 
translation in both years."
"Impairment testing for goodwill is performed once a year and 
whenever there is an indication of impairment."
"Goodwill 
impairments are not reversed."
"Acquired intangible assets (excluding goodwill) with defined 
useful lives are generally measured at cost less straight-line 
amortization and impairments."
"The useful life is determined using 
the period of the underlying contract or the period of time over 
which the intangible asset can be expected to be used."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are trade names 
and trademarks that have been acquired as part of acquisitions."
"These are measured at cost and tested for impairment annually, or 
if there is an indication that their value has declined."
"Internally generated intangible assets primarily comprise 
internally developed software."
"Such software and other internally 
generated intangible assets are measured at cost and amortized 
over their estimated useful lives."
"Impairments are recognized if the 
carrying amount of an asset exceeds the recoverable amount."
"In 
addition to those costs directly attributable to the asset, costs of 
internally generated intangible assets also include an appropriate 
portion of overhead costs."
"The expected useful lives and amortization methods of intangible 
assets are based on historical values, plans and estimates."
"Emission rights: Emission certificates, which are granted free of 
charge by the German Emissions Trading Authority (Deutsche 
Emissionshandelsstelle) or a similar authority in other countries, are 
recognized in the balance sheet with a value of zero."
"Emission 
rights purchased on the market are capitalized at cost and were 
reported as intangible fixed assets in 2022."
"Emission rights 
purchased on the market have been recognized under other 
receivables and miscellaneous assets since 2023."
"Emissions 
generated create an obligation to surrender the emission 
certificates."
"Intangible assets purchased on the market are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost."
"If the fair value is lower 
than the carrying amount on the balance sheet date, the emission 
rights are impaired."
"Depending on the type of intangible asset, amortization is reported 
under cost of sales, selling expenses, research and development 
expenses or other operating expenses."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less 
depreciation and impairment over their useful lives."
"The revaluation 
method is not applied."
"Low-value assets are fully expensed in the 
year of acquisition."
"The cost of self-constructed plants includes direct costs, 
appropriate allocations of material and production overhead costs, 
and a share of the general administrative costs of the divisions 
involved in the construction of the plants."
"Expenses related to the scheduled maintenance of large-scale 
plants are capitalized separately and depreciated using the 
straight-line method over the period until the next planned 
turnaround."
"Costs for the replacement of components are 
recognized as assets if an additional future benefit is expected."
The carrying amount of the replaced components is derecognized.
"Costs for maintenance and repair as part of normal business 
operations are recognized as an expense."
"Investment properties held to realize capital gains or rental income 
are immaterial."
"They are valued at the lower of fair value or cost 
less depreciation."
"The estimated useful lives and depreciation methods of property, 
plant and equipment are based on historical values, plans and 
estimates."
"The depreciation methods, useful lives and residual 
values are reviewed at each balance sheet date."
"Movable and 
immovable property, plant and equipment are principally 
depreciated using the straight-line method."
"Borrowing costs: If borrowing costs are directly incurred as part 
of the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, 
they are capitalized as part of the acquisition or production cost of 
that asset."
"A qualifying asset is an asset for which the process 
necessary to make it ready for its intended use or sale is longer 
than one year."
"Borrowing costs are capitalized up to the date the 
asset is ready for its intended use."
"Borrowing costs were 
calculated based on a rate of 1.75% (previous year: 1.25%) and 
adjusted on a country-specific basis, if necessary."
"All other 
borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the period in 
which they are incurred."
"Government grants: Government grants for the acquisition or 
construction of property, plant and equipment reduce the 
acquisition or construction cost of the respective assets."
"Other 
government grants or government assistance are recognized 
immediately as other operating income or treated as deferred 
income and released over the underlying period."
"Impairment tests
Impairment tests are carried out on intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment, and goodwill whenever certain triggering 
events indicate potential impairment."
"External triggering events 
include, for example, changes in customer industries, technologies 
used and economic downturns."
"Internal triggering events for an 
impairment test include lower product profitability, planned 
restructuring measures or physical damage to assets."
"In addition, 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually."
"Impairment tests entail a comparison of the carrying amount and 
the recoverable amount."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of 
fair value less costs to sell and the value in use."
"As a rule, value in 
use is determined using the discounted cash flow method."
"The 
estimation of cash flows and the assumptions used consider all 
information available on the respective balance sheet date about 
the future development of the operating business."
"Actual future 
developments may vary."
"Impairment testing relies upon the cash-
generating unit’s long-term earnings forecasts, which are based on 
macroeconomic trends."
"The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after taxes based on 
the capital asset pricing model, which is used in calculating the 
discount for cash flows, plays an important role in impairment 
testing."
"It comprises a risk-free interest rate, the market risk 
premium and an industry-specific spread for the credit risk."
"Additional important assumptions are the forecasts for the detailed 
planning period and the terminal growth rates used."
"An impairment of assets (excluding goodwill) is recognized if the 
recoverable amount of the asset is lower than the carrying amount."
"An impairment is recognized for the difference between the 
carrying amount and the recoverable amount."
"If the reasons for 
impairment of an asset (excluding goodwill) no longer exist, the 
write-downs are reversed up to the value of the asset, had an 
impairment not been recognized."
"Impairments and reversals of 
impairments are reported in other operating income and expenses."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
265
The goodwill impairment test is based on cash-generating units."
"At BASF, these largely correspond to the business units, or in 
individual cases the divisions."
"If there is a need for impairment, the 
existing goodwill is, if necessary, completely written off as a first 
step."
"If there is further need for impairment, this is allocated to the 
remaining 
assets 
of 
the 
cash-generating 
unit."
"Goodwill 
impairments are reported under other operating expenses."
"The respective recoverable amounts were determined using the 
value in use."
"Plans approved by company management and their 
respective cash flows for the next five years were used."
"For the 
period thereafter, a terminal value was calculated using a forward 
projection from the last detailed planning year as a perpetual 
annuity."
"Planning is based on experience, current performance and 
management’s best possible estimates on the future development 
of individual parameters."
"These include sales revenue (excluding 
precious 
metals), 
contribution 
margins, 
fixed 
costs 
and 
investments 
from 
which 
income 
from 
operations 
before 
depreciation and amortization and, based on this, the EBITDA 
margin are determined."
"Market assumptions regarding, for 
example, gas and raw materials prices, exchange rates, economic 
development, inflation expectations and market growth of the 
respective customer industries are included based on external 
macroeconomic and industry-specific sources."
"In addition, planning is also based on the strategies of the 
individual strategic business units which comprise the respective 
cash-generating units."
"The digitalization and sustainability trends 
identified in the strategies are thus taken into account in the 
respective impairment tests."
"Disposals of intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of 
€307 million primarily concerned fully amortized assets."
"In 2023, additions to accumulated amortization contained 
impairments of €267 million."
"These related mainly to other rights in 
the Materials segment and resulted from changed market 
conditions which meant that the economic advantage of access to 
a precursor no longer applied."
"The cost of capital after taxes used 
to determine the relevant value in use was 8.60%, which is 
10.08% before taxes."
"The fundamental transformation of the automotive industry will 
have a significant impact on the emissions catalyst business, which 
belongs to the Catalysts (excluding battery materials) cash-
generating unit."
"Because there were no material changes in 
planning assumptions from the previous year, the growth rate for 
perpetual annuity remained unchanged at -0.7%."
"In the planning 
period, the demand for catalysts is still expected to remain stable 
as a result of higher environmental standards."
"In the medium term, 
the transition from combustion engines to electromobility will lead 
to a steady decline in demand."
"Increased volatility in gas and raw materials prices can be 
expected during the year due to geopolitical conflicts."
"Average gas 
and raw materials prices are however expected to remain stable 
over the next three years."
"These and other macroeconomic factors 
such as the high, albeit declining, level of inflation in industrial 
countries will be accounted for in future business expectations."
"The calculation also takes 
into account capital structure and the beta factor of the respective 
peer group as well as the average tax rate of each cash-generating 
unit."
"Impairment tests were performed on the units assuming a 
weighted average cost of capital rate after taxes of between 6.47% 
and 8.56% (2022: between 5.97% and 7.75%)."
"This corresponds 
to a weighted average cost of capital rate before taxes of between 
8.12% and 11.33% (2022: between 6.96% and 10.80%)."
"An additional impairment test triggered by impairments recognized 
on plants was performed for the battery materials cash-generating 
unit on December 31, 2023, It did not lead to any impairments."
"The recoverable amount for the Catalysts (excluding battery 
materials) cash-generating unit exceeded the carrying amount by 
€598 million in 2023."
"A weighted cost of capital after taxes of 
8.14% (2022: 7.75%) and an EBITDA margin in the last detailed 
planning year were used as the basis for calculating the final value 
of 29.09% (2022: 29.60%) for the impairment test."
"The 
recoverable amount would be equal to the unit’s carrying amount if 
the weighted average cost of capital rose by 1.06 percentage 
points or the EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year as 
the basis for calculating the final value were 3.87 percentage 
points lower."
"A weighted cost of capital after taxes of 8.36% (2022: 7.49%) and 
an EBITDA margin in the last detailed planning year as the basis for 
calculating the final value of 11.84% (2022: 10.15%) were used for 
the annual impairment test of the battery materials cash-generating 
unit."
"The recoverable amount for this unit exceeded the carrying 
amount by €397 million."
"Investments were made at the following sites in particular: 
Zhanjiang, China; Ludwigshafen, Germany; Geismar, Louisiana; 
Antwerp, Belgium; Schwarzheide, Germany; and Chalampé, 
France."
"Investments also included modernization and 
expansion of the heating oil plant as well as modification of the 
acid chlorides and chloroformates plant in Ludwigshafen, Germany 
and construction and expansion of the ethylene oxide and 
polyethylene oxide production plants in Antwerp, Belgium."
"Government grants for funding investment measures reduced 
asset additions by €48 million."
"In 2023, impairments of €883 million and reversals of impairments 
of €6 million were included in accumulated depreciation."
"Impairments of €370 million were recognized for construction in 
progress und buildings (including right-of-use assets from 
buildings) as well as for technical equipment in the Surface 
Technologies segment."
"These impairments were due in particular 
to the delayed startup of production plants, as well as additional 
official requirements, and affected two sites in Europe, one of 
which was fully impaired."
"The value in use of the remaining partially 
BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
270
impaired plants was €448 million."
"A cost of capital rate after taxes 
of 8.36% was used in this impairment test."
"This corresponds to a 
cost of capital rate before taxes of 11.94%."
"Resulting from a 
deteriorated competitive situation, technical equipment at two sites 
in Europe in the Agricultural Solutions segment was written off in 
full in the amount of €334 million."
"Technical equipment in Europe 
allocated to the Materials segment was written off in full in the 
amount of €69 million due to reduced expected capacity utilization."
"Furthermore, an impairment relating primarily to buildings in the 
Surface Technologies segment was recognized in the amount of 
€26 million due to the planned closure of a site in North America."
The fair value of a building was used in the calculation.
"Impairments to construction in progress in the amount of 
€33 million mainly related to discontinued investment projects."
"Reversals of impairments in the amount of €6 million resulted 
primarily from the sale of a plant impaired at a site in Asia in 2020."
"Transfers related mainly to the reclassification of operation-ready 
assets from construction in progress to other asset categories."
"Currency effects reduced property, plant and equipment by 
€555  million and resulted especially from depreciation of the 
Chinese renminbi and the U.S."
Leases can be embedded within other contracts.
"If separation is 
required under IFRS, the embedded lease is recorded separately 
from its host contract and each component of the contract is 
accounted and measured in accordance with the applicable 
regulations."
"Leases in which BASF is a lessee mainly relate to real estate and 
transportation and technical equipment."
"Low-value assets are generally defined as leased
assets worth a maximum of €5,000."
"– Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the
remaining lease payments, taking into account the incremental
borrowing rate."
"– As a general rule, BASF separates non-lease components, such
as services, from lease payments."
"– A right-of-use asset is generally recognized at the same amount
as the lease liability."
"Differences may arise from the lease
payments made prior to the provision of the leased asset, less
any lease incentives received."
"– After capitalization the right-of-use asset is generally depreciated
over the lease term using the straight-line method."
"– A number of leases, particularly for real estate and barges,
include extension and termination options."
"Extension and
termination options are taken into account on recognition of the
lease liability only if BASF is reasonably certain that these
options will be exercised in the future."
"When contract terms are
being determined, consideration is given to all facts and 
circumstances that offer an economic incentive for exercising 
extension options or not exercising termination options."
"Changes in lease terms arising from the exercise of an extension 
option or non-exercise of a termination option are only 
considered 
if 
sufficient 
certainty 
exists."
"Estimates 
and 
expectations which are asserted at the commencement date of 
the lease liability and the right-of-use asset and pertain to future 
payments not yet determined on the date of provision are 
assessed continuously during the lease term."
"If subsequently 
improved or changed knowledge influences the expected 
payment profile over time, the lease liability is remeasured."
"– If an existing lease contract is modified, the lease liability and
right-of-use 
asset 
must 
be 
remeasured, 
provided 
the
modification changes the payment profile (pursuant to the
interest and principal plan) or the scope (either quantitatively or
time-related) of use of the asset."
"BASF entered a five-year rental agreement for a building with the 
sale of the site in Tarrytown, New York, in 2022."
"The lease liabilities 
for this sale-and-leaseback transaction amounted to €9 million as 
of December 31, 2023."
"BASF as lessor
BASF acts as a lessor for finance leases to a minor extent only."

Capital, reserves and retained earnings
Subscribed capital
BASF SE has only issued fully paid-up registered shares with no 
par value."
There are no preferential rights or other restrictions.
"The subscribed capital of BASF SE as of December 31, 2023, was 
€1,142 million, divided into 892,522,164 qualifying shares with no 
par value."
"The share capital and the number of shares decreased 
in 2023 due to the redemption of acquired treasury shares in 
connection with the share buyback program; the subscribed 
capital as of December 31, 2022, was €1,144 million, divided into 
893,854,929 shares."
"Share buyback / treasury shares
By way of a resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of 
May 29, 2022, the Board of Executive Directors was authorized to 
buy back shares until May 28, 2027, in accordance with 
section 71(1) no."
8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
"The buyback may not exceed 10% of the company’s share capital 
at the time the resolution was passed and can take place via the 
stock exchange, a public purchase offer addressed to all 
shareholders, or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit 
sales offers."
"The Board of Executive Directors is authorized to redeem the 
shares bought back without a further resolution of the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting and to reduce the share capital by the 
proportion of the share capital accounted for by the redeemed 
shares."
"The Board of Executive Directors can also redeem the 
shares without reducing the share capital so that the proportion of 
the other shares in relation to the share capital is increased 
through the redemption."
"In that event, the Board of Executive 
Directors is authorized to adjust the number of shares in the 
Statutes."
"Through buyback authorizations in 2023, BASF purchased a total 
of 1,332,765 shares (2022: 24,623,765 shares) or 0.15% (2022: 
2.68%) of the share capital at an average price of €52.56 per share 
(2022: €53.83  per share) up to the end of the share buyback 
program on February 24, 2023."
"All repurchased shares were 
redeemed and the share capital was reduced accordingly."
"BASF 
did not hold any treasury shares as of the balance sheet date or 
December 31, 2022."
"BASF’s expenditure in 2023 for the share buyback totaled 
€70  million."
"The amount was taken from other retained earnings 
and also reduced subscribed capital by €2 million."
"This reduction 
was reclassified to capital reserves."
"In principle, shareholders are entitled to a subscription 
right."
"However, the Board of Executive Directors is authorized, with 
the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude shareholders’ 
statutory subscription rights in the cases specified in the 
authorizing resolution."
"The Board of Executive Directors is 
authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to lay down 
the further contents of the share rights and the details of the 
execution of the capital increase."
"The 
proportionate amount of the share capital of those shares that are 
to be issued on the basis of conversion or option bonds granted 
during the term of this authorization under the exclusion of the 
subscription right, must be credited against the aforementioned 
ceiling of 10%."
"This authorization had not been exercised as of the 
end of the 2023 fiscal year."
"The debt instruments can be issued in exchange for contributions 
in cash, but also for contributions in kind, particularly shareholdings 
in other companies."
"To hedge the subscription right to conversion and option rights 
issued under the authorization, the share capital was increased 
conditionally by up to €117,565,184 with the option of issuing a 
maximum of 91,847,800 new registered BASF shares."
"The new BASF shares shall be issued at the conversion or option 
prices determined in each case in the terms and conditions of the 
debt instruments and/or the warrants in accordance with the 
above-mentioned authorization."
"The new BASF shares issued 
under this provision shall participate in profits from the beginning of 
the financial year in which they are issued."
"This authorization had 
not been exercised as of the end of the 2023 fiscal year."
"In 2023, the valuation of BASF shares in 
connection with the BASF “plus” share program led to a decline in 
capital reserves of €9 million, compared with an increase of 
€9 million in the previous year."
"The proportion of share capital accounted for by the redeemed 
treasury shares in 2023 was reclassified to capital reserves 
in 2023."
"Retained earnings
Retained earnings include earnings generated in the past and in 
2023 by companies included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"The acquisition of shares in companies that BASF already controls 
or that are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a 
joint 
arrangement 
is 
treated 
as 
a 
transaction 
between 
shareholders, as long as this does not lead to a change in the 
consolidation method."
"There were no material transactions of this 
type in 2023, as in the previous year."
"In connection with the share buyback, the amount in excess of the 
nominal value was deducted from retained earnings."
"Upon 
redemption of the shares, the previously openly deducted amounts 
were offset against share capital and retained earnings."
"Additionally, the value of share capital accounted for by the 
redeemed shares was reclassified from retained earnings to capital 
reserves."
"This resulted in a total reduction of retained earnings of 
€70 million in 2023 and €1,325 million in 2022."

"In 2023, the amount of €59 million from the remeasurement of 
defined benefit plans was reclassified to retained earnings."
"Payment of dividends
In accordance with the resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting on April 27, 2023, BASF SE paid a dividend of €3.40 per 
qualifying share from the retained profit of the 2022 fiscal year."
"With 892,522,164 qualifying shares as of the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting, this represented total dividends of €3,034,575,357.60."
"The remaining €814,148,142.03 in retained profits was allocated 
to retained earnings."
"The first category includes gains and losses from currency 
translation, the measurement of certain securities classified as debt 
instruments, and changes in the fair value of derivatives held to 
hedge future cash flows."
"Items that will not be reclassified to the 
income statement at a future date include effects from the 
remeasurement of defined benefit plans."
"Remeasurement of defined benefit plans
In 2023, changes in the value of defined benefit plans led to a 
decrease in other comprehensive income of €591 million (after 
taxes) of which €16 million related to investments accounted for 
using the equity method."
"In the previous year, there was a rise of 
€2,586 million (after taxes); of that amount, €83 million related to 
investments accounted for using the equity method."
"Deferred 
taxes amounted to €100 million in 2023 and to -€1,256 million 
in 2022."
"In the previous year, an increase resulted in the amount of 
€1,135 million; of that amount, €583 million related to investments 
accounted for using the equity method."
"These amounts included 
€12 million in deferred taxes in 2023 (2022: -€7 million)."
"In 2023, 
the difference resulted mainly from the depreciation of the Chinese 
renminbi and the U.S."
"dollar, and, in 2022, from the appreciation of 
the U.S."
dollar and the Brazilian real relative to the euro.
"With the deconsolidation of the Russian shareholdings held by 
Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/Hamburg, Germany, total differences 
arising from currency translation of €868 million were reclassified 
as earnings to the income statement in 2022."
"Measurement of securities at fair value
Measurement of securities at fair value in 2023 led to a decrease in 
other comprehensive income of €172 million (2022: -€16 million)."
"This was due to impairments of equity instruments measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income pursuant to IFRS 9 
in the amount of €180 million at Wintershall Dea AG, Kassel/
Hamburg, Germany, which is accounted for using the equity 
method."
"Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in hedging 
relationships (cash flow hedges) adjusted for deferred taxes in the 
amount of €8 million (2022: -€8 million) increased equity by a total 
of €570 million (2022: -€33 million)."
"In 2023, €588 million (2022: 
€37 million) was attributable to the hedging of future cash flows at 
shareholdings accounted for using the equity method."

Provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations
Economic and legal environment of the plans
In addition to state pension plans, most employees are granted 
company pension benefits from either defined contribution or 
defined benefit plans."
"Benefits generally depend on years of 
service, 
contributions 
or 
compensation, 
and 
take 
into 
consideration the legal framework of labor, tax and social security 
laws of the countries where the companies are located."
"To limit the 
risks of changing financial market conditions as well as 
demographic developments, employees have, for a number of 
years now, been almost exclusively offered defined contribution 
plans for future years of service."
"The Group Pension Committee monitors the risks of all pension 
plans of the Group with regard to the financing of pension 
commitments and the portfolio structure of existing plan assets."
"The organization, responsibilities, strategy, implementation and 
reporting requirements are documented for the units involved."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
282
In some countries – especially in Germany, in the United States, in 
the United Kingdom and in Switzerland – there are pension 
obligations subject to government supervision or similar legal 
restrictions."
"For example, there are minimum funding requirements 
to cover pension obligations, which are based on actuarial 
assumptions that differ from those pursuant to IAS 19."
"Furthermore, there are qualitative and quantitative restrictions on 
allocating plan assets to certain asset categories."
"This could result 
in annual fluctuations in employer contributions, financing 
measures and the assumption of obligations in favor of the pension 
funds to comply with regulatory requirements."
"The obligations and the plan assets used to fund the obligations 
are exposed to demographic, legal and economic risks."
"Economic 
risks are primarily due to unforeseen developments on commodity 
and capital markets."
"They affect, for example, pension adjustments 
based on the level of inflation in Germany and in the United 
Kingdom, as well as the impact of discount rates on the amount of 
the defined benefit obligation."
"The strategy of the BASF Group with regard to financing pension 
commitments takes into account country-specific supervisory and 
tax regulations."
"In some countries, pension benefits were granted for which the 
employer has a subsidiary liability."
"Pension benefits in a number of 
countries include minimum interest guarantees to a limited extent."
"If the pension fund cannot generate the income needed to provide 
the minimum guarantee, this guarantee must be provided by the 
employer under the subsidiary liability."
"To the extent that recourse 
to the employer is unlikely based on the structure and execution of 
the pension benefits as well as the asset situation of the pension 
fund, these plans are treated as defined contribution plans."
"Accounting policies
With regard to pensions and similar obligations, a distinction is 
made between defined benefit and defined contribution plans."
"In 
the case of defined contribution plans, current contributions are 
recognized as an expense."
"In the case of defined benefit obligations, provisions for pensions 
are calculated on an actuarial basis in accordance with the 
projected unit credit method."
"Assumptions relating to the following 
valuation 
parameters, 
among 
others 
are 
used: 
future 
developments in compensation, pensions and inflation, employee 
turnover, and the life expectancy of beneficiaries."
"Actuarial reports 
are used to calculate the amount of pension provisions."
"Obligations are discounted based on the market yields on high- 
quality corporate fixed-rate bonds."
"Pension provisions are 
recognized as a net deﬁned beneﬁt liability if the discounted benefit 
obligation exceeds the plan assets used to cover it."
"A plan asset surplus exists if a defined benefit plan’s assets 
exceed the plan’s obligations."
"IAS 19 requires the employer to test 
any such surplus for impairment."
"If no economic benefit (for 
example, reduced contributions or a refund) to the company is 
present, an asset ceiling must be reported."
"Such an asset ceiling 
was applied to the BASF Group’s Swiss pension plans in 2022 
and 2023."
"Similar obligations, especially those arising from commitments by 
North American Group companies to pay the healthcare costs and 
life insurance premiums of retired staff and their dependents, are 
reported under provisions for similar obligations."
"The assumptions used to ascertain the defined benefit obligation 
as of December 31 are used in the following year to determine the 
expenses for pension plans."
"The interest on the net defined benefit liability at the beginning of 
the year is recognized in the financial result."
"This is the difference 
between the interest cost of the defined benefit obligation and the 
standardized return on plan assets as well as the interest cost for 
the asset ceiling."
"Net interest expense of the respective fiscal year 
is based on the discount rate and the defined benefit obligation at 
the beginning of the year."
"The expected contribution payments 
and benefits paid over the course of the fiscal year are taken into 
account when determining net interest."
"The standardized return on plan assets is calculated by multiplying 
plan assets at the beginning of the year with the discount rate used 
for existing defined benefit obligations at the beginning of the year, 
taking into account benefit and contribution payments to be made 
during the year."
"BASF Report 2023

Description of the defined benefit plans
The following section describes the typical plan structure in the 
individual countries."
"Different arrangements may exist, in particular 
due to the assumption of plans as part of acquisitions; however, 
these do not have any material impact on the description of plans 
in the individual countries."
"Germany
For BASF SE and German Group companies, a basic level of 
benefits is provided by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG, a legally 
independent plan, which is financed by employer and employee 
contributions as well as the return on plan assets."
"BASF SE 
ensures the necessary contributions to adequately finance the 
benefits promised by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG."
"Some of the 
benefits financed via BASF Pensionskasse VVaG are subject to 
adjustments that must be borne by its member companies to the 
extent that these cannot be borne by BASF Pensionskasse VVaG 
due to the regulations imposed by the German supervisory 
authority."
"In 2004, the basic benefit plan was closed for newly 
hired employees at German BASF companies and replaced by a 
defined contribution plan."
"A new defined contribution plan was 
introduced as of July 1, 2021, for new hires in the German BASF 
companies."
"At BASF SE, occupational pension promises that 
exceed the basic level of benefits are financed under a contractual 
trust arrangement by BASF Pensionstreuhand e.V.; at German 
Group companies, these benefits are financed primarily via pension 
provisions."
"As of 2022, new employees receive a securities-based 
pension award while other employees are granted benefits 
primarily based on cash balance plans."
"Furthermore, employees 
are given the option of participating in various deferred 
compensation schemes."
"United States
Employees are granted benefits based on defined contribution 
plans."
"Effective 2010, the existing defined benefit plans were closed to 
further increases in benefits based on future years of service, and 
benefits earned in the past were frozen."
"There is no entitlement to 
pension adjustments to compensate for cost-of-living increases."
"The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the plans are 
based on the U.S."
"Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
(ERISA), which requires the plan sponsor to ensure a minimum 
funding level."
"Any employer contributions necessary to meet the 
minimum funding level are based on the results of an actuarial 
valuation."
"Furthermore, there are unfunded pension plans that are 
not subject to ERISA requirements."
"Additional similar obligations arise from plans that assume the 
healthcare costs and life insurance premiums of retired employees 
and their dependents."
"Such plans have been closed to new 
entrants since 2007."
"In addition, the amount of the benefits for 
such plans has been frozen."
"Switzerland
The employees of the BASF Group in Switzerland receive a 
company pension, which is financed through a pension fund by 
employer and employee contributions as well as the return on plan 
assets."
"The pension plans are accounted for as defined benefit 
plans, as the obligatory minimum pension guaranteed by law under 
the Swiss Pension Fund Act (BVG) is included in the scheme."
"All 
benefits vest immediately."
"According to government regulations, 
the employer is obligated to make contributions, so that the 
pension funds are able to grant the minimum benefits guaranteed 
by law."
"The pension funds are managed by boards, where 
employer and employees are equally represented, which steer and 
monitor the benefit plans and asset allocation."
"United Kingdom
Employees are granted benefits based on a defined contribution 
plan."
"The BASF Group also maintains defined benefit plans in the United 
Kingdom, which have been closed for further increases based on 
future years of service."
"Adjustments to compensate for increases 
in the cost of living until the beginning of retirement are legally 
required for beneficiaries of defined benefit plans."
"The financing of the pension plans is determined by the provisions 
of the regulatory authority for pensions and the relevant social and 
labor law requirements."
"The defined benefit plans are administered 
by a trust company, whose Board of Trustees, according to the 
trustee agreement and law, represents the interests of the 
beneficiaries and ensures that the benefits can be paid in the 
future."
"The required funding is determined using technical 
valuations according to local regulations every three years."
"Other countries
For Group companies in other countries, defined benefits are 
covered in some cases by pension provisions, but mainly by 
external insurance companies or pension funds."
"The majority of domestic pension obligations are subject to legally 
required regular adjustments to current pension payments based 
on interim inflation developments."
"The last pension adjustment was 
on January 1, 2022."
"As of December 31, 2023, a cumulative 
inflation rate of 15.00% since the last pension adjustment was 
assumed (December 31, 2022: 10.00%)."
"The long-term inflation 
assumption was adjusted in 2022 from 1.60% to 2.20% and left 
unchanged in 2023."
"The actuarial 
mortality tables for the pension obligations in United States were 
adjusted in 2022."
"A linear extrapolation of these amounts based on alternative 
changes in the assumptions as well as an addition of combined 
changes in the individual assumptions is not possible."
"In 2022, effects 
from plan adjustments were based on the conversion of a final 
salary plan to a defined contribution plan for future years of service 
in the Netherlands."
"As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average duration of the 
defined benefit obligation amounted to 12.9 years (previous year: 
13.2 years)."
"Company contributions for 
2024 are currently expected to be around €200 million."
"In 2023, 
two plans previously recognized as defined contribution plans at 
Belgian Group companies were included in the calculation of the 
defined benefit obligation and plan assets due to the fact that 
recourse to the employer was no longer unlikely."
"The resulting 
additional net obligation of €1 million is immaterial."
"Accordingly, plan assets are 
aligned with the long-term development of the obligations, taking 
into consideration the risks associated with the specific asset 
classes and the regulations relating to the investment of plan 
assets."
"The existing portfolio structure is based on the target asset 
allocation."
"In addition, current market assessments are taken into 
consideration."
"In order to mitigate risks and maximize returns, a 
widely spread global portfolio of individual assets is held."
"Liability-driven investment (LDI) techniques, such as hedging the 
risk of changes in interest rates and inflation, are used in some 
pension plans, especially in U.K."
"plans, and as of 2023, in 
Germany as well."
"Government bonds primarily relate to bonds from countries 
with very high credit ratings, such as the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Germany, France and Switzerland."
"Government bonds 
from emerging countries are also held to a limited extent."
"Corporate bonds mainly comprise bonds from creditworthy 
debtors, although particular high-yield bonds are also held to a 
limited extent."
"In connection with the continuous monitoring of 
default risk based on a given risk budget and on the observation of 
the development of the creditworthiness of issuers, the plan asset 
allocation may be adjusted in the case of a revised market 
assessment."
"Alternative 
investments 
largely 
comprise 
investments in private and infrastructure equity, absolute return 
funds and senior secured loans."
Almost all of the equities are priced on active markets.
"The 
category debt instruments includes promissory notes and 
debentures (Pfandbriefe) acquired through private placements with 
a market value in the amount of €262 million as of December 31, 
2023, and €138 million as of December 31, 2022."
"For such 
securities, especially those held by domestic pension plans, there 
is no active market."
"There is also no fungible market price for the 
additional amount of €4,380 million, especially in the category of 
alternative investments and real estate."
"The capital market 
compensates for this lack of fungibility with yield premiums 
depending on the maturity."
"Plan assets as of the balance sheet date did not include any 
significant volumes of securities issued by BASF Group companies 
in 2023 or 2022."
"The market value of the properties of legally 
independent pension funds rented to BASF Group companies was 
€115 million as in the previous year."

Other provisions
Accounting policies
Other provisions are recognized when there is a present obligation 
as a result of a past event and when there is a probable outflow of 
resources whose amount can be reliably estimated."
"Provisions are 
recognized at the probable settlement value."
"The probable amount required to settle noncurrent provisions is 
discounted if the effect of discounting is material."
"In this case, the 
provision is recognized at present value."
"Financing costs related to 
unwinding the discount of provisions in subsequent periods are 
shown in other financial result."
"Provisions for restoration obligations include expected costs for 
dismantling existing plants and buildings."
"If BASF is the only 
responsible party that can be identified, the provision covers the 
entire expected obligation."
"At sites operated together with one or 
more partners, the provision generally covers only BASF’s share of 
the expected obligation."
"The amount of the provision is determined 
based on the available technical information on the site, the 
technology used, legal regulations, and official requirements."
"The 
calculation 
accounts 
for 
expected 
significant 
changes 
in 
obligations."

Provisions for employee obligations primarily consist of variable 
compensation including associated social security contributions, 
as well as obligations for granting long-service bonuses."
"The latter 
are predominantly calculated based on actuarial principles."
"Provisions for obligations from sales and purchase contracts 
largely comprise obligations arising from rebates granted and other 
price discounts in the Agricultural Solutions segment, warranties 
and product liabilities, sales commissions and losses from onerous 
contracts."
"Provisions 
for 
restructuring 
measures 
include 
severance 
payments to departing employees or similar personnel expenses 
as well as expected costs for site closures, including costs for 
demolition and similar measures."
"Provisions are recognized for 
these expenses when the relevant measures have been planned 
and announced by management."
"Provisions for litigation, damage claims and similar obligations 
contain anticipated expenses from lawsuits in which BASF is the 
defendant party, as well as obligations under damage claims 
against BASF and fines."
"Actual costs can deviate from these 
estimates."
"B For more information, see Note 23 on page 290
Noncurrent provisions were discounted at a rate between 2.2% 
and 3.5% (2022: between 1.0% and 2.2%)."
"The increase in provisions for obligations from sales and 
purchase contracts resulted from higher accruals for rebate 
programs."
"The decrease in provisions for restructuring measures was 
mainly attributable to lower accruals for severance payments."
"Other includes interest on noncurrent tax provisions, as well as 
various other items."
"The following table shows the development of other provisions by 
category."
"Other changes include changes in the scope of 
consolidation, acquisitions, divestitures, currency effects and the 
reclassification of obligations to liabilities when the amount and 
timing of these obligations become known."
"federal and state lawsuits alleging property and resource 
damages and personal injuries from possible exposure to per- and 
polyflouroalkyl substances (PFAS)."
"Plaintiffs typically allege that 
exposure to AFFF has caused loss of use and enjoyment of 
property, diminished property value, remediation costs, and 
personal injuries including various types of cancers."
"The 
complaints name BASF as a defendant in connection with its 2009 
acquisition of Ciba Specialty Chemicals Inc."
"and the legacy Ciba/
BASF Lodyne fluorochemical product lines."
"BASF is a defendant in 
over 4,200 lawsuits as of January 2024 and is defending against 
these claims."
"At this time, BASF cannot predict the outcome of resolving these 
matters or what potential actions may be taken by regulatory 
agencies."
"An adverse outcome could be material to BASF’s 
financial results."
"Furthermore, BASF SE and its affiliated companies are defendants 
in or parties to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings on a 
recurring basis."

maximum amount."
"The risk of a claim being exercised against the

Obligations from purchase contracts resulted primarily from long-
term purchase obligations for raw materials as well as supply 
agreements for energy from renewable sources."

"For example, receivables are derecognized when they 
are definitively found to be uncollectible such as in the event of 
concluded 
insolvency 
proceedings."
"Financial 
liabilities 
are 
derecognized when the contractual obligations expire, are 
discharged or cancelled."
"Regular-way purchases and sales of 
financial instruments are accounted for using the settlement date; 
in precious metal trading, the trade date is used."
"The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date."
"If pricing on an active market is available, for example in the form 
of exchange prices, these are used as the basis for the 
measurement."
"Otherwise, the measurement is based on either 
internal measurement models using current market parameters or 
external measurements, for example, from banks."
"These internal 
measurements rely predominantly on the net present value method 
and option pricing models."
"These models incorporate, for example, 
expected future cash flows as well as discount factors adjusted for 
term and, potentially, risk."
"Depending on the availability of market 
parameters, BASF assigns financial instruments’ market values 
one of the three levels of the fair value hierarchy pursuant to 
IFRS 13."
"Reassignment to a different level during a fiscal year is 
only carried out if the availability of observable market parameters 
for identical or similar items changes."
"The 
differences are amortized over the terms of the contracts using the 
straight-line method."
"The classification and measurement of financial assets is based on 
the one hand on the cash flow condition (the “solely payments of 
principal and interest” criterion), that is, the contractual cash flow 
characteristics of an individual financial asset."
"On the other hand, it 
also depends on the business model used for managing financial 
asset portfolios."
"At BASF, derivatives, for
example, are allocated to this measurement category."
"In
general, BASF does not exercise the fair value option in IFRS 9,
which permits the allocation of financial instruments not to be
measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the
cash flow condition or the business model criterion to the above
category under certain circumstances."
"At
BASF, this measurement category includes trade accounts
receivable, as well as receivables reported under other
receivables and miscellaneous assets and certain securities."
"Initial measurement of these assets is generally at fair value,
which usually corresponds to the transaction price at the time of
acquisition or, in the case of trade accounts receivable, to the
transaction 
price 
pursuant 
to 
IFRS 
15."
"Subsequent
measurement effects are recognized in income using the
effective interest method."
"Impairments are recognized for expected credit losses at both
initial 
and 
subsequent 
measurement, 
even 
before 
the
occurrence of any default event."
"Counterparties are generally
considered to default when they become insolvent, become a
debtor in a creditor protection program or are in a finance-
related legal dispute with BASF, or more than half of BASF’s
receivables portfolio with them is more than 90 days overdue."
"In
these cases, individual impairments are recognized for the
financial assets measured at amortized cost that are then
considered to be credit impaired."
"If, however,
the credit risk has not increased significantly in this period,
impairments are generally only recognized as 12-month
expected credit losses."
"By contrast, under the simplified
approach for determining expected credit losses permitted by
IFRS 9, impairments for receivables such as lease receivables
and trade accounts receivable always cover the lifetime
expected credit losses of the receivable concerned."
"At BASF, the credit risk of a financial asset is assessed using 
both internal information and external rating information on the 
respective 
counterparty."
"A 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
counterparty’s credit risk is assumed if its rating is lowered by a 
certain number of notches."
"It is generally assumed that the 
credit risk for a counterparty with a high credit rating will not 
have increased significantly."
"Regional and, in certain circumstances, industry-specific factors 
and expectations are taken into account when assessing the 
extent of impairment as part of the calculation of expected credit 
losses and individual impairments."
"In addition, BASF uses 
internal and external ratings and the assessments of debt 
collection agencies and credit insurers, when available."
"Individual 
impairments are also based on experience relating to customer 
solvency and customer-specific risks."
"Factors such as credit 
insurance, which covers a portion of receivables measured at 
amortized cost, are likewise considered when calculating 
impairments."
"Bank guarantees and letters of credit are used to 
an immaterial extent."
"Expected credit losses and individual 
impairments are only calculated for those receivables that are 
not covered by insurance or other collateral."
"Impairments on 
receivables whose insurance includes a deductible are not 
recognized in excess of the amount of the deductible."
"A decrease in impairment due, for example, to a reduction in the 
credit risk of a counterparty or an objective event occurring after 
the impairment is recorded in profit or loss."
"Reversals of 
impairments may not exceed amortized cost, less any expected 
future credit losses."
"Furthermore, the assets in this measurement category
may not just be held with the intention of collecting the expected
contractual cash flows over their term, but also generating cash
flows from their sale."
"At BASF, trade accounts receivable that
are available for sale as part of a factoring agreement are
allocated to this category."
"Additionally, certain securities that are
reported as other financial assets or marketable securities are
allocated to this category."
"BASF does not exercise the option to
subsequently measure equity instruments through other
comprehensive income."
"Assets measured at fair value through
other comprehensive income are initially measured at fair value,
which usually corresponds to the transaction price of the
receivables and securities allocated to this category at the time
of acquisition."
Subsequent measurement is likewise at fair value.
"Changes in the fair value are recognized in other comprehensive
income and reclassified to the statement of income when the
asset is disposed of."
"Impairments on financial assets measured
at fair value through other comprehensive income are calculated
in the same way as impairments on financial assets measured at
amortized cost and recognized in profit or loss."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
292
The following measurement categories are used for financial 
liabilities:
– Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost generally
include all financial liabilities, provided these do not represent
derivatives."
"They are generally measured at fair value at the time
of initial recognition, which usually corresponds to the value of
the consideration received."
"Subsequent measurement is
recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost using the effective
interest method."
"At BASF, for example, bonds and liabilities to
banks reported under financial indebtedness are measured at
amortized cost."
"– Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or
loss contain derivative financial liabilities."
"These are likewise
measured at the value of the consideration received as the fair
value of the liability on the date of initial recognition."
"Fair value is
also applied as a measurement basis for these liabilities in
subsequent measurement."
"The option to subsequently measure
non-derivative financial liabilities at fair value is not exercised."
"Derivative financial instruments can be embedded within other
contracts, creating a hybrid financial instrument."
"If IFRS policies
require separation, the embedded derivative is accounted for
separately from its host contract and measured at fair value."
"If
IFRS 9 does not provide for separation, the hybrid instrument is
accounted for at fair value in its entirety."
"Financial guarantees of the BASF Group are contracts that 
require compensation payments to be made to the guarantee 
holder if a debtor fails to make payment when due under the terms 
of a transaction entered into with the holder of the guarantee."
"Financial guarantees issued by BASF are measured at fair value 
upon initial recognition."
"In subsequent periods, these financial 
guarantees are carried at the higher of amortized cost or the best 
estimate of the present obligation as of the reporting date."
"In cash flow hedges, future cash flows and the related income 
and expenses are hedged against the risk of changes in value."
"To 
this end, future underlying transactions and the corresponding 
hedging instruments are designated in a cash flow hedge 
accounting relationship for accounting purposes."
"The effective 
portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument, which 
often meets the definition of a derivative, and the cost of hedging 
are recognized directly in equity under other comprehensive 
income over the term of the hedge, taking deferred taxes into 
account."
"The ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the 
income statement."
"In the case of future transactions that lead to 
recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the 
cumulative fair value changes of the hedge in equity are generally 
charged against the cost of the hedged item on its initial 
recognition."
"For hedges based on financial assets, financial 
liabilities or future transactions, cumulative fair value changes of the 
hedges are transferred from equity to the income statement in the 
reporting period in which the hedged item is recognized in the 
income statement."
"The maturity of the hedging instrument is 
aligned with the effective date of the future transaction."
"When fair value hedge accounting is used, the asset or liability 
recognized is hedged against the risk of a change in fair value."
"The 
hedging instruments used, which often take the form of a 
derivative, are measured at fair value and changes in fair value are 
recognized in the statement of income."
"The carrying amounts of 
the assets or liabilities designated as the underlying transaction are 
also measured at fair value through the statement of income."
"25.2 Financial risks
Market risks
Foreign currency risks: Changes in exchange rates could lead to 
losses in the value of financial instruments and adverse changes in 
future cash flows from planned transactions."
"Foreign currency risks 
from financial instruments result from the translation at the closing 
rate of financial receivables, loans, securities, cash and financial 
liabilities into the functional currency of the respective Group 
company."
"Foreign currency contracts in various currencies are 
used to hedge foreign exchange risks from nonderivative financial 
instruments and planned transactions."
"The foreign currency risk exposure corresponds to the net amount 
of the nominal volume of the primary and the derivative financial 
instruments that are exposed to currency risks."
"In addition, 
planned purchase and sales transactions of the respective 
following year are included if they fall under the currency risk 
management system."
"Long and short positions in the same 
currency are offset against each other."
"The sensitivity analysis was conducted by simulating a 5% and 
10% appreciation of the respective functional currency against the 
other currencies."
"A 5% appreciation of the respective functional 
currency would have reduced BASF’s income before income taxes 
by €165 million as of December 31, 2023."
"A 10% appreciation of 
the respective functional currency would have resulted in a 
negative effect on BASF’s income before income taxes in the 
amount of €310 million."
"A 5% appreciation of the respective 
functional currency would have resulted in a negative effect on 
BASF’s income before income taxes in the amount of €156 million 
(-€293 million applying 10% appreciation) as of December 31, 
2022."
This only refers to transactions in U.S.
"Interest rate risks: Interest rate risks arise from changes in 
prevailing market interest rates, which can lead to changes in the 
fair value of fixed-rate instruments and in interest payments for 
variable-rate instruments."
"Interest rate swaps and combined 
interest rate and currency derivatives are used in individual cases 
to hedge these risks."
The derivatives are presented in Note 25.5.
"Interest rate risks are relevant to BASF’s financing activities but are 
not of material significance for BASF’s operating activities."
"The variable interest risk exposure, which also includes fixed rate 
bonds maturing in the following year, amounted to -€427 million as 
of December 31, 2023 (2022: -€2,441 million)."
"An increase in all 
relevant interest rates by one half of a percentage point would 
have raised income before income taxes by €2 million as of 
December 31, 2023."
"An increase in all relevant interest rates by 
one percentage point would have raised income before income 
taxes by €3 million as of the same date."
"An increase in all relevant 
interest rates by one half of a percentage point would have 
lowered income before income taxes by €7 million as of 
December 31, 2022 (an increase of one percentage point would 
have lowered income before income taxes by €15 million)."
"Because no interest derivatives were designated in hedge 
accounting relationships as of December 31, 2023, a change in 
interest rates would not have had an effect on shareholders’ 
equity."
"There were also no interest derivatives designated in a 
hedge accounting relationship as of December 31, 2022."
"Accordingly, the interest 
rates affected by the reform were phased out and replaced by new 
ones."
"Publication of all GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBORs as well 
as USD LIBORs with maturities of one week and two months was 
discontinued as of December 31, 2021."
"Publication of the 
remaining USD LIBORs was discontinued in 2023."
"With the discontinuation of publication of the remaining USD 
LIBORs, no financial liabilities or financial assets associated with 
contracts yet to be adjusted were identified as of December 31, 
2023."
"As of December 31, 2022, financial liabilities in the amount 
of €61 million and financial assets in the amount of €43 million 
associated with contracts yet to be adjusted were identified."
"No 
derivatives were identified that are associated with contracts yet to 
be adjusted in either year."
"Commodity price risks: Some of BASF’s divisions are exposed to 
strong fluctuations in raw materials prices."
"These result primarily 
from raw materials (for example naphtha, benzene, natural gas, 
LPG condensate) as well as from metals."
"BASF takes the following 
measures to reduce price risks associated with the purchase of 
raw materials:
– BASF uses derivatives to hedge the risks of raw materials prices."
"These are primarily options on crude oil, oil products and natural
gas."
"– The Catalysts division enters into both short-term and long-term
purchase contracts with precious and battery metal producers."
"It also buys metals on spot markets from various business
partners."
"The price risk from metals purchased to be sold on to
third parties, or for use in the production of catalysts and battery
materials, is hedged using derivative instruments."
"This is mainly
performed using forward contracts, which are settled by either
entering into offsetting contracts or by delivering the metal."
"– In the Agricultural Solutions division, the sales prices of products
are sometimes pegged to the price of certain agricultural
commodities."
"To hedge the resulting risks, derivatives on
agricultural commodities are concluded."
"In addition, BASF holds limited unhedged precious metal and oil 
product positions, which can also include derivatives, for trading 
on its own account."
"The value of these positions is exposed to 
market price volatility and is subject to constant monitoring."
"BASF Report 2023
Consolidated Financial Statements – Notes
294
By holding commodity derivatives and precious metal trading 
positions and unhedged oil product positions, BASF is exposed to 
price risks."
"The valuation of commodity derivatives and precious 
metal trading positions at fair value means that adverse changes in 
market prices could negatively affect the earnings and equity 
of BASF."
"BASF holds several physical power purchase agreements (physical 
PPAs) with terms of up to 25 years."
"Under the physical PPAs, 
BASF procures electricity and associated green electricity 
certificates, known as guarantees of origin (GoOs)."
"If BASF can 
consume in full the electricity provided through the physical PPAs, 
these fall under the own use exemption and are therefore not 
recognized as derivatives in the balance sheet even when 
electricity and green electricity certificates are purchased at a fixed 
price."
"Additionally, BASF also holds physical PPAs in the USA and 
Asia; the electricity from these PPAs cannot be consumed in full 
due to major deviations between supply profiles and consumption 
patterns."
"The electricity forward agreements embedded in them 
are not eligible for the own use exemption and are recognized as 
derivatives at fair value through profit or loss if electricity is 
purchased at a fixed price."
"In contrast to electricity, green 
electricity certificates obtained from physical PPAs recognized as 
derivatives can be stored and consumed at a later date."
"Thus, they 
continue to fall under the own use exemption even if purchased at 
a fixed price."
"In the event of adverse changes in energy market 
prices, valuation of the electricity forward agreements for physical 
PPAs can lead to negative effects on BASF’s earnings."
"Furthermore, BASF holds several virtual power purchase 
agreements (virtual PPAs) in the United States with terms of up to 
15 years."
"The electricity forward agreements embedded in virtual 
PPAs are recognized separately as derivatives at fair value through 
profit or loss."
"In the event of adverse changes in energy market 
prices, measurement of electricity forward agreements at fair value 
can lead to negative effects on BASF’s earnings."
"BASF performs value-at-risk analyses for all commodity derivatives 
and precious metal trading positions."
"Value at risk continuously 
measures the market price risk and quantifies the loss that is not 
exceeded by a specific confidence level during a defined holding 
period."
"BASF bases the value-at-risk calculation on a confidence 
interval of 95% and a holding period of one day."
"BASF applies the 
variance-covariance method to calculate value at risk."
"BASF uses value at risk in conjunction with other risk management 
tools."
"Besides value at risk, BASF sets volume-based limits as well 
as exposure and stop-loss limits."
"B For more information on BASF’s financial risks and risk management, see Opportunities and Risks 
from page 173 onward
Default and credit risk
Default and credit risks arise when customers and debtors do not 
fulfill their contractual obligations."
"BASF regularly analyzes the 
creditworthiness of the counterparties and grants credit limits on 
the basis of this analysis."
"Due to the global activities and diversified 
customer structure of the BASF Group, there is no significant 
concentration of default risk."
"The carrying amount of all 
receivables, loans and interest-bearing securities plus the nominal 
value of financial obligations stemming from contingent liabilities 
not to be recognized represents the maximum default risk 
for BASF."
"B For more information on credit risks, see Note 17 from page 275 onward
Liquidity risks
BASF promptly recognizes any risks from cash flow fluctuations as 
part of liquidity planning."
"BASF has ready access to sufficient liquid 
funds from the ongoing commercial paper program and confirmed 
lines of credit from banks."
"BASF Report 2023

25.3 Maturity analysis
The interest and principal payments as well as other payments for 
derivative financial instruments are relevant for the presentation of 
the maturities of the contractual cash flows from financial liabilities."
Future cash flows are not discounted here.
"Derivatives are included using their net cash flows, provided they 
have negative fair values and therefore represent a liability."
"Derivatives with positive fair values are assets and are therefore not 
taken into account."

All insignificant shareholdings are measured at cost (carrying amount: €536 million).
Fair value level 1 is applied to publicly listed shareholdings.

compensation program (LTI program), known as Strive!, which was 
launched in 2020."
"The share price-based compensation program 
known as “BOP” (BASF Option Program), which had existed since 
1999, was offered for the last time in 2020."

amount is converted into a preliminary number of virtual 
performance share units (PSUs) by dividing it by the average BASF 
share price in the fourth quarter of the previous year."
"Achievement of each strategic target is calculated for each year of 
the four-year performance period."
"Upon conclusion of the 
performance period, the average degree of target achievement for 
each strategic goal is equal to the arithmetic mean of the degrees 
of target achievement for the four years."
"plan is determined by adding 
the target achievement degree for the three strategic targets after 
having multiplied each by the corresponding weighting factor."
"To 
calculate the final number of PSUs, this weighted target 
achievement is multiplied by the preliminary number of PSUs."
"The 
payment amount upon conclusion of the four-year performance 
period is calculated by multiplying the final number of PSUs by the 
average BASF share price for the fourth quarter of the last year of 
the performance period, plus the accumulated dividend payments 
in the four fiscal years."
"The payment occurs in May of the following 
year and is capped at 200% of the target amount."

a two-year vesting period is over, options granted can be 
exercised until the end of the respective exercise period."
"During 
the exercise period, there are certain times (closed periods) during 
which the options may not be exercised."
"Each option can only be 
exercised in full, and one of the thresholds must be exceeded."
"If 
the other threshold is not exceeded, the other option right lapses."
"A participant’s maximum gain from exercising an option is limited 
to five times the original individual investment."
"Option rights are 
nontransferable and are forfeited if the option holders no longer 
work for the BASF Group or have sold part of their individual 
investment before the expiry of the two-year vesting period."

compensation."
"In view of this binding personal investment (in the 
form of BASF shares), an extended holding period of four years 
applies."
"Members of the Board of Executive Directors may only 
exercise their option rights four years after they have been granted 
at the earliest (vesting period)."
"As a result of a resolution by the Board of Executive Directors in 
2002 to settle option rights in cash, all outstanding option rights 
under the 2016 to 2020 programs were valued at fair value as of 
December 31, 2023."
"A proportionate provision was recognized for 
programs in the vesting period."
"The number of outstanding options declined from 9,328,238 in 
2022 to 7,731,844 in 2023, due mainly to the expiration of options 
from the 2015 BOP program."
"The 
exercisable 
options 
had 
no 
intrinsic 
value 
as 
of 
December 31, 2023, or December 31, 2022."
"The models used in the valuation of the option plans are based on 
the arbitrage-free valuation model according to Black-Scholes."
"The 
fair values of the options are determined using the binomial model."
"Volatility is determined on the basis of the monthly closing prices 
over a historical period corresponding to the remaining term of the 
options."
"The LTI provision for BOP decreased from €64 million as of 
December 31, 2022, to €50 million as of December 31, 2023, due 
to lower fair values and a lower number of outstanding option 
rights."
"In 2022, the amount of €1 million was utilized due to senior 
executives leaving the company, whereas in 2023, less than 
€1  million was utilized due to senior executives leaving the 
company."
"Income from the reduction in provisions totaled 
€13 million in 2023 and €46 million in 2022."
"BASF “Plus” Incentive Share Program
The “plus” incentive share program was introduced in 1999 and is 
currently available to employees in Germany, other European 
countries and Mexico."
"Simultaneous participation in both the “plus” 
program and an LTI program is not permitted."
"Employees who participate in BASF’s “plus” incentive share 
program and acquire shares in BASF as a personal investment 
from their variable compensation."
"For every 10 BASF shares 
purchased in the program, a participant receives one BASF share 
at no cost after one, three, five, seven and 10 years of holding 
these shares."
"As a rule, the first and second block of 10 shares 
entitles the participant to receive one BASF share at no extra cost 
in each of the next 10 years."
"The right to receive free BASF shares lapses if a participant sells 
the individual investment in BASF shares, if the participant stops 
working for a Group company or one year after retirement."
"Fair value is determined on the 
basis of the BASF share price, taking into account the present 
value of dividends, which are not paid during the term of the 
program."
"The weighted-average fair value on the grant date 
amounted to €45.88 for the 2023 program, and €47.74 for the 
2022 program."
"The fair value of the free shares to be granted is recognized as an 
expense with a corresponding increase in capital reserves over the 
term of the program."
"Personnel expenses for BASF’s “plus” incentive share program 
totaled €26 million in 2023 and €20 million in 2022."
"The STI performance bonus is based on the performance of the 
Board of Executive Directors as a whole and the return on capital 
employed (ROCE) of the BASF Group."
"Subject to certain 
conditions, ROCE is adjusted for special items from acquisitions 
and divestitures."
"The conditions for a ROCE adjustment were not 
met in 2023."
"Market valuation of the option rights of active and former members 
of the Board of Executive Directors led to expenses totaling 
€0.7 million in 2023, following income in the amount of €2.3 million 
in the previous year."
"In 2023, members of the Board of Executive Directors were 
allocated 214,253 performance share units (PSUs) under the LTI 
performance share program (2022: 166,001 PSUs)."
"Market 
valuation of the PSUs of members of the Board of Executive 
Directors resulted in an expense totaling €11.7 million in 2023 
(2022: €6.7 million)."
