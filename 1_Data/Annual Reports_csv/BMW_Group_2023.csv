The material topics covered in our non-financial reporting for the 
reporting year are derived from the materiality analysis which the 
BMW Group performed in 2022 in accordance with § 289 c and 
§ 315 c HGB and validated for the 2023 reporting year."
"The top-
ics that were categorised as material remain those where the ac-
tions of the BMW Group may have a significant sustainability im-
pact on the environment and society (inside-out) and which may
be of high business relevance to the BMW Group (outside-in)."

opportunity ↗ Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion as well as an at-
tractive workplace ↗ Employer Attractiveness and Employee Development
are also given high priority within the BMW Group."
"Our reporting
under the GRI standards also covers topics which are considered 
material from a double materiality perspective because they
have a significant environmental impact (inside-out) or are of
high business relevance to the BMW Group (outside-in)."
"This
concept must be applied from 2024 onwards in accordance with 
the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive."
"The topics cov-
ered in this context are responsible digitalisation ↗ Innovation, 
Digitalisation and Customer Orientation, Product and Road Safety
↗ Product Quality and Safety, Occupational Health and Safety ↗ Health 
and Performance and Sustainable Governance ↗ Performance 
Management."

cerning future developments that are based on the current status 
of the BMW Group’s assumptions and forecasts."
"Preparation of non-financial performance figures 
Certain non-financial performance figures reported by the 
BMW Group are based on a significant number of estimates and 
valuations."
"Some are complex and subjective in nature, or sub-
ject to uncertainty for other reasons."
"The BMW Group is also con-
tinuously updating the policies and procedures used to calculate 
its non-financial performance figures."
"It is not always practical to 
apply new policies and procedures to prior reporting periods."
"Alt-
hough the methodology used to calculate indicators is in line with 
standard practice, some indicators are not directly comparable 
with the values reported by other companies."
"The BMW Group is also required to ensure that third parties re-
port relevant data to the BMW Group correctly."
"These third par-
ties include independent dealerships - the overwhelming major-
ity of which report vehicle delivery figures to the BMW Group - 
and suppliers, which provide the BMW Group with data on the 
implementation of agreed measures designed to reduce carbon 
emissions."
"Statement on Corporate Governance 
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW 
AG prepare a yearly combined Statement on Corporate Govern-
ance in accordance with § 289 f and § 315 d HGB to report on 
corporate governance within the BMW Group."

Corporate Governance is published on BMW AG’s website at 
↗ www.bmwgroup.com/ezu."
"It also includes the Declaration of Com-
pliance pursuant to § 161 AktG."
"Editorial comments 
Key figures presented in the report have been rounded in accord-
ance with standard commercial practice."

may mean that figures do not add up exactly to the stated total 
and that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown."
"Summarised disclosures of fuel consumption, carbon emissions 
and electricity consumption are provided in the section 
↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures."
* See ↗ Glossary for a definition of deliveries.
2 The new definition of the term “employee” (see footnote 1) also has an impact on disclosures relating to the percentage of female employees.

Data also includes e-learning formats.
2 Deliveries including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.
"also for the period prior to full consolidation in the Group Financial Statements (2019: 538,612 units, 2020: 602,247 units, 2021: 651,236 units, 1 January to 10 February 2022: 96,133 units)."

"This is impressively demon-
strated by the fact that all-electric automobiles now make up nearly 15% of total sales."
"The record high achieved in 2023 for total deliveries across all drivetrain types, and the 
leading position of the BMW brand in the global premium segment further demonstrate 
that the BMW Group’s flexible drivetrain strategy is the right approach."
"Rigorous, far-
sighted decision-making have made this overall corporate success possible, ensureing 
that the Group remains resilient, especially in volatile times."
"We also achieved a great deal in terms of sustainability in 2023, as our vehicle fleet once 
again attained figures well within the EU’s target limit for fleet carbon emissions."
"2024 promises to be an exciting year for the BMW Group with a record number of product 
launches."
"We firmly believe that, thanks to the enthusiasm and precision of our strong 
workforce, we will master the challenges ahead and continue to set ourselves apart from 
the competition with our wide range of products across all brands and drivetrain types."
"The enthusiastic response to the presentation of the BMW VISION Neue Klasse at IAA 
Mobility in Munich clearly demonstrates that the BMW Group is on the right path."
"We continuously and thoroughly monitored the governance of the BMW Group based on in-
depth reports received from the Board of Management and provided its members with pru-
dent advice on the management and strategic development of the Group."
"We focused in 
particular on driving forward the Group’s electrification strategy and expanding it to include 
all segments and markets, as well as on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in 
the fields of digitalisation and sustainability."
"At each of the five plenary sessions of the Su-
pervisory Board (including one two-day meeting), we held detailed discussions with the 
Board of Management regarding the Group’s position."
"The Board of Management also kept 
the Supervisory Board well informed regarding any matters of significance outside the 
framework of formal meetings."
"Furthermore, I discussed matters personally and on a regu-
lar basis with the Chairman of the Board of Management."
"In addition, the Chairman of the 
Audit Committee maintained a direct line of contact with the Board of Management member 
responsible for Finance as well as with the external auditor’s representatives outside of 
meetings."
"We regularly dealt with internal Supervisory Board issues and personnel-related 
matters without the presence of the Board of Management."
"Our cooperation, both within 
the Supervisory Board and its committees and with the Board of Management, was con-
ducted in a spirit of trust, respect and constructiveness."
"Detailed documents on the main 
topics of each meeting were distributed to the members in advance."
"Moreover, the share-
holder and employee representatives regularly prepared for the meetings in separate pre-
liminary discussions."
"In its reports on the BMW Group’s position, the Board of Management kept us well in-
formed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group’s overall perfor-
mance."
"A regular topic of discussion at Supervisory Board meetings was the development 
of current sales trends based on figures analysed by brand, segment and market region, for 
both the BMW Group and its competitors."

cles and an overview of the Group’s key financial indicators and liquidity situation."
"Corporate strategy, including sustainability, remained high on the Supervisory Board’s 
agenda."
"Following an analysis of the current situation in the automotive industry and the 
ramifications of geopolitical developments, the Board of Management presented us with a 
detailed strategy for implementing the automotive transformation."
"The strategy covered the 
topics of electrification, digitalisation and sustainability, highlighting in particular the circular 
economy concept as a key element of the Group’s sustainable corporate approach."
"The 
BMW Group’s ambitious decarbonisation targets for2030 were also reaffirmed."
"With regard 
to digitalisation, the Board of Management has placed the NEUE KLASSE at the centre of 
its strategy, making it the benchmark for a holistic customer experience."
"The Board of Man-
agement also described the digitalisation of key business processes to the Supervisory  
Board."
"Further topics covered by the Board of Management’s extensive report were market 
strategies focusing particularly on China and Europe, the resilience of supply chains, and the 
holistic, Group-wide performance programme."

status of the investments in YOUR NOW."

management consultancy and the magazine “Automobilwoche”, which voted the Group 
number one in the automobile manufacturer category."
"Moreover, the Fair Pay Innovation 
Lab awarded the BMW Group a gold medal in the category “Fair Pay Leader”."

Group and its brands, we examined the objectives of the Group’s corporate ESG strategy in 
greater detail and looked at corporate communication regarding sustainability issues as well 
as their media coverage."
"We were also pro-
vided with reports on plans for new structures where no fossil fuels will be used (such as the 
plant in Debrecen, where production is scheduled to begin in 2025)."
"Based on a 
self-assessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board at 31 De-
cember 2023 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency 
profile."

nual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented changes to the structure and content of

the Board of Management for the financial year 2023, considering in particular the Group’s 
performance and the development of remuneration for senior executives and employees in 
Germany over the past few years."
"Based on a comparative study conducted by an external 
independent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that the 
remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2022 and the

The Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees."

tees."
"Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding 
Board as well as the various other committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate 
Governance on the BMW Group website."

tainability-related aspects, in addition to longer-term corporate planning."

The Audit Committee convened eight times in total.
"In March 2023, the focus was on preparing for the Supervisory Board meeting at which the 
financial statements for the financial year 2022 were discussed and examined."
"After verify-
ing the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory 
Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (“PwC”) be 
elected auditor at the Annual General Meeting 2023."
"There were no indications of conflicts 
of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor."
"The Commit-
tee therefore issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following its election at the Annual 
General Meeting in May 2023."
The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas.
"Moreover, it approved 
the scope of the non-audit services to be performed, and received regular reports from PwC 
regarding these services."
"At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the 
audit in depth on several occasions."
"In particular, it received a report from the relevant de-
partment on the Group’s experience with the audit of the financial statements for the finan-
cial year 2022 and on the results of the survey conducted within the Group for this purpose."
"Based on this report, the auditor’s description of the quality assurance measures under-
taken, and the Audit Committee’s own experience with the auditor, the audit was found be 
of good quality."
"The Audit Committee also examined the combined Non-financial Statement of BMW AG 
and the BMW Group for the financial year 2022, which was part of the BMW Group Report 
2022."
The Audit Committee had representatives from PwC explain the results of their audit.
"We have again engaged PwC to conduct a “limited assurance” audit of the Non-financial 
(Group) Statement for the financial year 2023, to the extent that it relates to parts of the 
management report that are not subject to a ”reasonable assurance” audit."
"Going beyond 
the formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the con-
tents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023."
"The Quarterly Statements were presented to us for discussion by the Audit Committee prior 
to their publication by the Board of Management."
"Representatives of the external auditors 
were also present when the Half-Year Financial Report was discussed in early August 
2023."
"At its meeting in July 2023, the Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropri-
ateness of the BMW Group’s internal control system (including the Corporate Audit func-
tion), the compliance management system and the risk management system."
"In the half-
yearly risk reports, we addressed the principal risks facing the BMW Group and their classifi-
cation."
"We focused particularly on geopolitical risks and the resulting risk scenarios, espe-
cially for supply chains and sales markets, as well as measures to mitigate these risks."
We also addressed the topic of climate-related risks.
"We regularly monitor the further devel-
opment of the internal control system for non-financial reporting with regard to the Group’s 
sustainability-related targets."

tax and customs control system from the responsible head of department."
"The Audit Committee received regular reports on the state and development of significant 
legal proceedings and internal investigations and, in individual cases, discussed product- 
and emissions-related proceedings with external legal advisors brought in for that purpose."
"In its role as a preparatory body, in the course of 2023 the Personnel Committee convened 
four times to deliberate on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of 
Management."
"The review of the appropriateness of the Board of Management’s remunera-
tion for the financial years 2022 and 2023 and the determination of the factors for the 
Board of Management’s variable remuneration for those years were the subjects of thor-
ough preparation within the Personnel Committee."
"The determination of financial and ESG 
targets for the Board of Management’s remuneration for the financial year 2024 was also 
discussed in great detail."
"In addition, the Personnel Committee prepared for the change of 
remuneration consultant in the financial year 2023."
"The renewal of the anticipatory resolu-
tion on the approval of loans and transactions by BMW Bank GmbH was also on the 
agenda."
"The Nomination Committee held one meeting in the financial year 2023 in which it dis-
cussed the composition of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"Taking 
into account the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board and the rec-
ommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Nomination Committee is-
sued recommendations for the Supervisory Board’s election proposals to the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting to be held in 2024."
"The Mediation Committee, which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the 
financial year under report."
"The Supervisory Board extended the mandate of Oliver Zipse, the Chairman of the Board of 
Management."
"Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Management on 11 May 2023 by mutual agreement as 
part of a succession arrangement following three decades of successful work at the BMW 
Group."
"As the Board of Management member responsible for Finance, he played a key role 
in shaping the development of the BMW Group with his profound expertise, entrepreneurial 
flair and vision."
"His work served to further cement the Group’s excellent reputation, both on 
the capital market and in the public eye."
"We are greatly indebted to Nicolas Peter for his out-
standing contribution."
"On 12 May 2023, Walter Mertl was appointed as member of the Board of Management re-
sponsible for Finance."
"He joined the BMW Group in 1998 and was most recently responsi-
ble for corporate controlling."
"Mr Mertl has embodied the Group’s commitment to sustainable 
profitability during the transformation for many years."
"On 31 October 2023, Pieter Nota left the Board of Management by mutual agreement, also 
in line with the BMW Group’s succession plans."
"After becoming the member of the Board of 
Management responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales in 2018, Mr Nota was a key fig-
ure in driving forward the sale of all-electric models and the digitalisation of the customer 
interface."
"He was also responsible for introducing a pioneering agency model for direct 
sales in selected markets."
"We wish to thank Pieter Nota for his excellent work and valuable 
inspiration."
"On 1 November 2023, Jochen Goller was appointed as member of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible for Customer, Brands and Sales."
"Mr Goller has been at the BMW Group 
since 1999 and has headed up activities in the China region since 2018."
"In Jochen Goller, 
we have appointed an internationally experienced sales manager with particular expertise in 
the Chinese market to the Board of Management."
"Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s committees  
There were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the past year on 
the shareholder representative side."
"The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Kurt Bock to 
the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years."
"He was sub-
sequently appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board, member of the Presid-
ing Board and of the Personnel Committee as well as member and Chairman of the Audit 
Committee."
"With regard to the employee representatives, in January 2023 Dr Martin Kimmich was ap-
pointed to succeed the departing long-serving First Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board, Manfred Schoch, for his remaining term of office."
"Dr Kimmich has been Chairman of 
the Munich Works Council and the BMW AG Works Council since 2022."
"Disclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members 
The attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 99%, and 100% for the meetings

"PwC initially conducted a 
review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man-
agement Report for the first half of 2023 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee."
"No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial 
Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance 
with the applicable provisions in all material respects."
"The Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW AG for the 
financial year ended 31 December 2023, including the Combined Management Report, on 
which PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Manage-
ment on 12 March 2024."
"These audit opinions were signed for the fifth consecutive finan-
cial year by independent auditor Petra Justenhoven (Wirtschaftsprüferin) and, for the second 
time, by Michael Popp (Wirtschaftsprüfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of 
the engagement."
"Immediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Com-
pany and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2023 and the Combined Man-
agement Report (including the Combined Non-financial (Group) Statement) to the Supervi-
sory Board."
"The auditor’s long-form audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory 
Board in a prompt manner."
"In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had 
already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance."
"At its meeting held on 13 March 2024, the Audit Committee diligently examined and delib-
erated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of 
the Supervisory Board on 14 March 2024."
"At the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation 
of the reporting documents submitted to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board."
"The representatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and 
answered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, partially without the presence of the members of the Board of Management."
"Both 
the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key 
audit matters and the related audit procedures."
"The representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system 
established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying at an early stage any de-
velopments that might threaten the Company’s going-concern status."
"They also confirmed 
that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system 
were identified with regard to the financial reporting process."
"In the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the con-
tents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to § 161 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board."
"Based on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory 
Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit."
"In accordance with the final result 
of this examination, no objections were raised."
"At our meeting held on 14 March 2024, we 
accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the fi-
nancial year 2023."
"The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 
2023 have therefore been adopted."
"We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore ap-
proved it."
"Based on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the 
Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 
in accordance with § 162 AktG."
"The Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined 
Non-financial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2023."
"Following an in-
depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC 
presented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the 
members of the Supervisory Board."
"Following a preparatory review con-
ducted by the Presiding Board as well as a further review at Supervisory Board level, the 
Statement on Corporate Governance drawn up by the Board of Management was also ap-
proved by the Supervisory Board."
"We there-
fore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to all of them."
"We are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW Group’s workforce will con-
tinue to pursue the BMW Group’s chosen path of sustainable and digitalised mobility in 
2024, and we eagerly await the launch of the NEUE KLASSE in 2025."
"D E A R  S H A RE H O L DE R S, 
L A D I E S A ND  GE NT L E M E N : 
You know your Company: we always think ahead."
"We deliver what we say we are going to do – systematically, without making excuses, con-
sistently and reliably."
"Becoming a little bit better every day – that is what I expect from the 
Company and from myself."
"That is how we move forward – bringing ambitious goals closer 
and gradually turning them into reality."
"Society likes to talk about the transformation of mo-
bility and the automotive industry."
"At the BMW Group, we call it continuous progress."
"That is what the BMW Group stands for, like no other company."
"It is one of the reasons why 
you, our shareholders, continue to stand by us."
Entrepreneur Herbert Quandt laid the foundation for this many years ago.
His family’s next generation and all of us who work at the Company are following his legacy.
"In his spirit, the Company and its employee representatives work together – negotiating 
firmly, but always focused on finding solutions for the future."
"That, too, is our lived BMW cul-
ture."
All these things make your Company strong and resilient.
"This is especially true in the cur-
rent conditions, where we face a variety of  extremely demanding requirements in individual 
regions of the world, with geopolitical uncertainty and entirely new challenges constantly 
emerging."
We provide a substantial response to all these things.
"More than 150,000 associates worldwide carry your Company forwards through their hard 
work and dedication every day."
"They all value your commitment and your loyalty to the 
BMW Group as shareholders."
Your Company intends to stay on track for success.
"Our business model – individual premium mobility in its different forms and in line with re-
gional requirements – continues to offer substantial potential for achieving profitable growth 
and gaining market share."
"We are taking advantage of these opportunities in our rolling strategic approach and our long-
term corporate planning."
"What sets us apart is that we make conscious decisions, that are 
consistently based on facts, empirical findings and well-founded analysis – not driven by the 
current “zeitgeist” or short-term hypes."
"And, of course, it takes experience and sometimes 
also common sense."
"Our BMW, MINI, Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad brands enjoy an excellent reputation 
worldwide."
"Our products don’t just get people from A to B; they touch hearts and spark 
emotions."
Our customers experience their mobility in a very individual way.
"To achieve this, 
we are making mobility more human, more intelligent and more sustainable."
"A glance in the rear-view mirror shows that we are certainly capable of doing this: BMW has 
overcome difficult situations many times in the past."
"This certainty has shaped our self-con-
fidence for 108 years."
"Your Company has constantly reinvented itself – taking bold leaps in 
innovation at exactly the right time."
"Timing is key in whether innovations gain traction and the Company stays relevant, but it is 
also clear that: 
The future is always ahead of us."
We know where we are headed at all times and we know what we need.
"Our consistent be-
haviour shapes the image of your Company in the eyes of the public and among our stake-
holders."
"People expect us to consider things carefully and to come up with practical solu-
tions."
"We “walk the talk” – people know that we take big leaps, but that we also deliver."
"All-
electric vehicles are projected to account for half of our global deliveries before 2030."
Your investment in the BMW Group must be worth it.
Your Company is robust and financially strong.
"Our Automotive EBIT margin for financial year 
2023 was within our upwardly adjusted target range of 9.0 to 10.5%."
"As you know, we are 
still targeting a range of 8 to 10% in the long term."
"At Group level, our EBT margin for 2023 
of 11% exceeded our strategic target of 10%."
Our profitability puts us in a position where we can once again pay you an attractive dividend.
We are making major investments in our future.
"The same applies to 2023 as well as to the 
current financial year."
"Our R&D spending focus on our products, further electrification and 
digitalisation of our line-up and automated driving."
"At the same time, we are investing in the 
NEUE KLASSE mega-project, our modular kits, construction of high-voltage battery produc-
tion facilities in various markets, and the new plant in Debrecen, to name just a few examples."
Your Company is going to profit noticeably from all this in the coming years.
We delivered a total of 2.55 million vehicles to customers in 2023.
"As anticipated, we not 
only posted solid year-on-year growth, but also achieved a new all-time high at Group level."
"Our brands performed very well individually, too, with new all-time highs for BMW, BMW M, 
Rolls-Royce and BMW Motorrad."
"Despite the model changeover due to the extensive realign-
ment of the brand, MINI reported higher sales than the previous year."
Our core BMW brand maintains its leading position in the global premium segment.
"In 
March 2024, BMW was ranked number one in the US by the consumer portal “Consumer 
Reports”."
"This independent platform compared test ratings, reliability, customer satisfaction 
and safety criteria among 34 automotive manufacturers."
"Four BMW models even earned 
the “Green Choice” environmental seal for being among the vehicles in the United States 
with the lowest emissions."
Dynamic growth for our all-electric models.
"In addition to significant growth in the luxury class and upper premium segment, the strongest 
impetus for growth last year came from our all-electric vehicles."
"We sold over 375,000 BEVs 
– which is about 75% more than the previous year."
"This means that, by the end of 2023, all-
electric vehicles made up around 15% of our total sales."
"This is also reflected in our share of the global BEV market: at 4.1%, it is already significantly 
higher than our share of the total global market, which remains stable at 3.3%."
"By the end of 2024, we will have more than 15 all-electric models in our line-up across all 
brands, from MINI to BMW to Rolls-Royce."
"All of this speaks for our fresh and highly attractive 
product range – across all brands, all segments and all drive technologies."
"In 2023, all our new vehicles went into production or were released onto the market, as 
planned, including the new BMW 5 Series and the new BMW X2 with the all-electric variants, 
the i5 and iX2."
"MINI also presented two models from the all-new MINI family at the IAA  
MOBILITY: the Cooper 3-door and the Countryman."
"BMW Motorrad celebrated its centenary in late September of last year, with Federal Chancel-
lor Olaf Scholz attending the anniversary celebrations at the Berlin-Spandau plant."
"There 
were two main highlights: the inauguration of the BMW Motorrad Welt – the counterpart to 
our BMW Welt in Munich, as a delivery and visitor centre – and the premiere of the R 1300 
GS."
Fans all over the world have been eagerly awaiting this leap in the next GS generation.
"All I have to say is: pure high-tech on two wheels – earning extremely positive feedback from 
the trade press."
Our technological expertise is delivering results.
"Our broad, yet centred, approach, with systematic further development of all drive technol-
ogies, reflects BMW’s typical self-belief, as well as the effectiveness of our strategy."
"General 
recognition of our strategy keeps on growing since we continue to present measurable suc-
cesses in decarbonisation."
Your Company outperformed the EU CO2 fleet target by 20%.
"As in previous years, we not only met the EU CO2 fleet target for the use phase in 2023, but 
significantly overfulfilled it: the BMW Group’s numbers came in at 26.5 grams significantly 
below the applicable limit for the reporting year of 128.6 grams of CO2 per kilometre."
"We 
therefore ended up below the CO2 limit set for BMW by more than 20%."
"As you can see, we are continuing the positive trend of recent years, through further electri-
fication of our vehicle portfolio and by using innovative Efficient Dynamics technologies 
throughout our entire fleet."
Technology openness in BMW 5 Series and 5 Series Touring.
"Following on from the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, which has been available since late 2023, 
the new BMW 5 Series Touring is another perfect example of how our comprehensive tech-
nological expertise works in practice."
"The Touring, which will be launched this spring, is especially popular in Europe."
"Here, also, 
customers will have four drive concepts to choose from: all-electric, plug-in hybrid or highly 
efficient diesel and petrol engines with 48-volt mild-hybrid technology."
"BMW is where Touring 
meets e-drive."
"No one else in this segment offers a vehicle like the all-electric BMW i5 Tour-
ing, with an electric range of over 500 kilometres."
"Both M variants come with 
an impressive partially electrified drivetrain."
Our plug-in hybrid models remain an important element of our drivetrain portfolio.
"Current 
Gen5 battery technology already enables an attractive range."
"Plug-in hybrids also provide a 
boost to e-mobility that should not be underestimated."
"Many customers discover the ad-
vantages of electric driving for the first time this way."
"Early in 2024, we passed the milestone of two million electrified vehicles sold."
"This includes 
both pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids."
We are already testing hydrogen drivetrains in everyday situations.
"We have been testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen on the road in selected countries under every-
day conditions since last year."
"Our pilot fleet’s world tour has raised awareness of the role 
hydrogen can play in the energy transition – not just for mobility, but industry-wide."
"We see 
hydrogen as a possible alternative drive technology in the mid to long term."
"Our vehicles performed well under various climate and traffic conditions – and the public re-
sponse has been overwhelmingly positive."
"This is understandable, since hydrogen fuel cell 
drivetrains combine the best of both worlds: the advantages of an emissions-free e-drive, 
with the fast refuelling people are used to."
"We also demonstrated this at the COP28 UN Cli-
mate Change Conference in Dubai."
"Your Company is supporting the growth of the hydrogen 
economy worldwide, as well as locally, including expansion of infrastructure networks for 
hydrogen filling stations."
We aim to continue our profitable growth.
"All our brands and drivetrain variants help assure the continued profitable growth of your 
Company."
"We expect to see significant double-digit growth in sales of our BEV models again 
in 2024."
"We continue to steer the e-mobility ramp-up smartly and precisely in line with differ-
entiated demand in all regions of the world."
"We presented our latest models to members of the international media in Portugal in Febru-
ary 2024."
"Shortly afterwards, we invited 1,500 retailers from 30 European countries to Am-
sterdam for a glimpse of the future, including the new BMW 1 Series and the latest edition of 
one of our top-selling individual models, the BMW X3."
"The new MINI models for 2024 include the next member of the new MINI family, the Aceman, 
which will celebrate its world premiere in April 2024."
"This electric-only crossover in the pre-
mium compact-car segment will also bring a massive leap in digitalisation."
"MINI has a de-
voted community and creates a unique sense of life and community spirit."
"The new MINI 
family is produced at our Chinese joint venture, Spotlight, in Oxford, UK, and, for the first time, 
in Germany, at the Leipzig plant."
"At Rolls-Royce, Spectre is the first battery-electric model to 
become available."
"Rolls-Royce has long been a standout and unrivalled in the ultra-luxury 
class with exclusive models."
"With the CE02, BMW Motorrad is already releasing its second all-electric model onto the mar-
ket, as well as the second M motorcycle model, the M 1000 XR, and the R 1300 GS Adven-
ture."
That means there will be no fewer than three new top models at BMW Motorrad.
"They 
all illustrate the breadth of the product line-up."
"Everyone – and that also applies to me as a 
motorcycle rider – can find the right bike for their needs at BMW Motorrad."
NEW RETAIL: direct sales as win-win for everyone involved.
"In January 2024, we sold and delivered our first vehicle, a MINI, through our new sales sys-
tem."
"We have already switched the MINI brand to a direct sales model in Poland, Italy and 
Sweden, with other European markets to follow."
"In China, we have been successfully using 
this approach for MINI since 2023."
"We aim to digitalise and simplify the car-buying process for customers, with transparent, con-
sistent pricing nationwide."
This will create a win-win situation for everyone involved.
"Our retail 
partners and their profitable business model will remain an essential pillar of these new 
arrangements."
Automated driving: the car as digital companion.
"It goes without saying that we offer our customers the newest innovations and the latest, 
state-of-the-art technology."
"Over-the-air upgrades ensure that every one of our vehicles is 
always digitally up to date."
"The art lies in mastering this process: we anticipate far in advance 
what our customers are going to need and want in five to ten years’ time."
"That is how we 
ensure they get the best overall package from us."
"And that is why we keep setting benchmarks: 
The BMW 5 Series Sedan is the first car in Germany to be approved for partially automated 
driving at speeds up to 130 km/h on motorways."
"The BMW Highway Assistant allows the 
driver to take their hands off the steering wheel while driving longer distances."
"We also 
added a completely new feature: Active Lane Change Assistant with eye confirmation."
"This 
allows the vehicle to make an automated lane change without a steering intervention: a 
glance in the exterior mirror is all that is required."
"Taking your hands off the steering wheel and even being able to temporarily turn your atten-
tion away from the road – that is Level 3 highly automated driving."
"From March 2024 on-
wards, our customers will be able to do precisely this in the models of the new BMW 7 Series."
"BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of this new function, which takes over driving in certain 
defined traffic situations and manages speed, distance and lane tracking autonomously."
"For us, the highest level of premium functionality goes hand in hand with maximum safety 
for our customers and all road users."
"We therefore opened the Future Mobility Development 
Centre in Sokolov in the Czech Republic in summer 2023, where we are testing automated 
driving and parking functions, up to and including fully automated driving (Level 4)."
"At this 
location, we are able to simulate virtually all situations that occur in road traffic and thus en-
sure the maturity of our technical solutions."
NEUE KLASSE – vision becomes reality.
"With its spectacular Vision Vehicles, your Company showcases time and again indicates the 
direction in which we are taking mobility, in line with the major global topics of the future – 
through bold leaps in innovation and responsible action."
"This is what our NEUE KLASSE 
mega-project represents in a unique way."
"Last year, there were two major milestones: at the CES in Las Vegas at the start of the year, 
we unveiled our BMW i Vision Dee, full of digital innovations."
"Then, in September, at the IAA 
MOBILITY, we presented our BMW VISION Neue Klasse."
"No other car at the IAA MOBILITY 
received as much media coverage and attention as the BMW VISION Neue Klasse."
We also presented this Vision Vehicle to our associates at an exclusive evening event.
"Up to 700 associates from across Germany were selected by lottery to 
attend the event live with a companion."
"Another 25,000 watched the live stream or the re-
cording of the event."
That is a sixth of our global workforce.
"I see that as genuine interest in 
our joint future project, the NEUE KLASSE."
"‘‘We anticipate far in advance what our 
customers want."
"The innovations of the NEUE KLASSE will benefit all future BMW 
models."
"We are preparing to launch the NEUE KLASSE onto the market at an unprecedented pace 
from 2025 onwards, with six models within just 24 months of the start of production."
"We 
showed the scope of the NEUE KLASSE in a very concrete way for the first time at the BMW 
Group Annual Conference on 21 March 2024."
"Its offering ranges from sporty sedan to X 
model."
"The BMW VISION Neue Klasse and our newest Vision Vehicle – the BMW VISION 
Neue Klasse X – represent these two bookends."
I can promise you that both Vision Vehicles will be on the market soon in a very similar form.
"In-between these two models, there is plenty of room for everything that will define the BMW 
brand in the future."
"The Board of Management members already had the chance to drive prototypes of the 
NEUE KLASSE."
"The first camouflaged prototypes are 
already being tested on the roads and we will be building the first pre-production vehicles 
before the end of the year."
"After the official start of production, in 2025, at our newest BMW plant in Debrecen, Hun-
gary, the NEUE KLASSE will also come off the production line at our oldest plant in Munich 
from 2026, with other locations worldwide to follow."
"Incidentally, one out of every two 
BMWs leaving the Munich production line is already fully electric today."
"From 2027 on-
wards, our more than 100-year-old main plant will build only electric vehicles."
"Mobility is movement – and movement requires energy and functioning supply 
chains."
"We are talking here about powerful, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells – in 
other words, high-voltage batteries."
"In the models of the NEUE KLASSE, we will be using our 
newly developed round lithium-ion battery cells, which have been optimised for the new ar-
chitecture, for the very first time."
"Our sixth-generation BMW eDrive technology represents an enormous leap in technology, 
compared to the previous generation: we are increasing energy density by more than 20%, 
improving charging speed by up to 30% and boosting range by around 30% – at the same 
time as lowering costs."
"We are also reducing CO2 emissions from cell production by up to 
60%."
"For both basic research and development of mass-manufacturing processes for high-voltage 
batteries, your Company is relying on in-house expertise."
"We want to understand every as-
pect of the high-voltage battery."
"To do so, we have created the necessary conditions for this 
with the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich and the Cell Manufacturing Competence 
Centre in Parsdorf, Bavaria, enabling us to span all value creation processes involved in cell 
production; this is a crucial step for us."
"The Gen6 batteries for our plants in Bavaria will be supplied from our planned new location 
in Irlbach-Straßkirchen from 2026 onwards."
"Before embarking on the building project, we 
sought frank and open dialogue with local residents."
"We were very pleased that they voted 
strongly in favour of our site and see this as confirmation of our efforts."
"Your Company is building production facilities for BMW high-voltage batteries not just in 
Lower Bavaria, but all over the world – always in close proximity to our vehicle plants in 
Hungary, the US, Mexico, China and Thailand."
"Our strategic “local for local” approach also 
guarantees short transport distances for high-voltage batteries and secures our supply 
against unforeseen events in different regions of the world."
"With our “i Supply Chain” strategy, we are ensuring resilient, excellent and digital supply 
chains in all areas."
"Our plants worldwide need supplying with 36 million parts every day – at 
the right time, in the best quality and in the right quantity."
"For the digitalisation of our supply 
chains, we are relying on Catena-X, a shared data ecosystem for automotive manufacturers, 
suppliers and subcontractors, as well as recycling companies in the future."
"This digital collab-
oration increases efficiency and transparency – for example, around the carbon footprint and 
options for tracing components and raw materials."
"‘‘The NEUE KLASSE is much more than just a 
single car."
"Last year, renowned US publication Time Magazine and online platform Statista compared 
750 international companies."
"Your Company did exceptionally well to make it into the top 10, 
and was, in fact, the highest-ranked automotive manufacturer in the global comparison."
"Three criteria were decisive for this assessment: revenue growth, sustainability and employee 
satisfaction."
These three are not opposing factors but belong together.
"With regard to employees: in autumn 2023, we once again asked our global team to share 
their opinion."
"For the first time, all 150,000 associates worldwide were able to take part."
84% took advantage of this opportunity.
The vote was unequivocal: 85% support our strategy – our BMW way.
"Another very clear 
majority of 88% said they would recommend our Company as an employer."
"93% are proud 
to work for the BMW Group."
2023 was another strong team effort.
"Personally, and on behalf of the entire Board of Management, I would like to thank all our 
associates."
Everyone made a valuable contribution.
"I would also like to thank all our custom-
ers worldwide, our retail organisation and our suppliers."
"Dear Shareholders, 
Our business environment will again be dominated by a great many challenges this financial 
year, including weak economic development in several markets, the price development in the 
automotive sector, high interest rates and the uncertainty created by geopolitical shifts."
That is why it is so decisive that we recognise and systematically exploit our opportunities.
"It 
is important to me that all of us at the BMW Group approach our tasks with self-belief, confi-
dence and the necessary grit."
"I travel the world a lot, visiting our markets and facilities."
"Everywhere I go, I see how valuable and important individual mobility is in many people’s 
everyday lives."
"Courage, pride in performance and resilience."
That is what makes your Company different.
"We dare to chart our own course, even in turbu-
lent times; we are able to withstand the headwinds, as long as we are convinced that we are 
on the right path."
Your Company is a high-performance organisation.
"That is why we once again have ambi-
tious plans for 2024: on the automotive side, 14 new models will go into production and 
BMW Motorrad will release a further 12 new models – not to mention numerous model up-
dates and engine variants."
"We have never postponed a launch and we will not waver from 
this."
All of this shows that we are continually laying the foundation for our future success.
"That is 
continuous progress."
In other words: ↗ DRIVING THE NEXT ERA.
"That is why the following applies to your Company: 
Strong today – strong tomorrow."
"Oliver Zipse 
Chairman of the Board of Managemen
‘‘Our customers experience their mobility in a 
very individual way."
"We therefore are continually 
laying the foundation for our future success."
That is continuous progress.

"Its business activities impact the environment in 
which it operates, and can have both a direct and an indirect 
bearing on the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders."
"Con-
versely, societal trends and developments can influence many 
aspects of the Group’s business activities."
"Against this backdrop, 
the BMW Group maintains a continuous dialogue with its stake-
holders worldwide."
"↗ GRI Index: 2-29 
Key topics in 2023 
The BMW Group’s interaction with stakeholders includes topics 
brought to its attention from outside the Group as well as those 
in which it proactively engages in dialogue."
"The for-
mats selected usually take place several times a year."
"The results 
of these stakeholder dialogues are documented and incorpo-
rated in the Group’s strategic considerations."
"The 
BMW Group is a member of numerous associations in various 
countries."
"As a rule, membership and commitment are voluntary."
"In certain cases, however, participation may also be based on 
statutory requirements."
"The BMW Group’s involvement in associations ranges from 
board memberships in association bodies to active participation 
in working groups as well as simple observer status."
"Our goal is 
to coordinate our approach with the respective associations on 
positions regarding relevant strategic issues."
"If the BMW Group 
identifies discrepancies between association and Company po-
sitions, the Company works with the association concerned with 
the aim of bringing the positions closer together."
"The BMW 
Group sees its role as sharing its corporate opinions as part of 
the associations’ policy-forming process."
"In this way, we are able 
to participate in discussions on key strategic issues such as cli-
mate protection, human rights, the circular economy, decarboni-
sation with a view to achieving the Paris climate targets, and 
transparent supply chain management."
"A comprehensive overview of the BMW Group’s key political po-
sitions and activities can be found at ↗ Advocacy, a new section of 
the website made available in May 2023 which goes beyond and 
replaces the previous Climate Commitment Report."
"The 
BMW Group kept investors, analysts and rating agencies up to 
date again in 2023 with its regular quarterly and annual report-
ing."
"The BMW Group has stepped up its communication with in-
vestors who consider sustainability criteria in their investment 
decisions in the past few years and now meets this group’s in-
formation needs with in-person and virtual ESG conferences, in 
addition to individual and group meetings."
"The Group’s commu-
nication focused on the further development of the business 
model, digitalisation and other technology trends in the automo-
tive industry, sustainability in the supply chain and the ramp-up 
of electromobility."
"In 2023, the Group also focused on measuring 
the carbon footprint of its pension plan assets in the UK and Ger-
many, and validating the data available for this purpose."
"The 
↗ TCFD Report was created for the UK BOPS* Plan, reiterating the 
target to achieve carbon neutrality for the scheme’s asset port-
folio by 2050."
"The volume of non-liquid pension plan assets invested in our var-
ious impact funds continues to grow according to schedule, with 
several new subscriptions exercised in the form of fund-based 
investments."
"The investments made to date in this area relate 
not only to climate protection, but also to other Sustainable De-
velopment Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN."
"Investments that 
have a beneficial effect on the climate are at the forefront of the 
impact funds."
"Outlook 
The BMW Group will continue to interact closely and construc-
tively with its stakeholders and develop existing dialogue oppor-
tunities in 2024, and will continue to maintain active dialogue 
with capital market players such as investors, financial analysts 
and rating agencies."
"As in previous years, our activities will in-
clude direct dialogue as well as participation in in-person and vir-
tual ESG conferences."
"To the 
extent possible, our aim is to take account of non-liquid invest-
ments in the Group’s reporting on sustainability, or at least for all 
such investments to be reviewed from a sustainability perspec-
tive."
"The Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board also maintains regular contact with stake-
holders."
"The members of the Supervisory Board attend the An-
nual General Meeting, and many of them also interact with stake-
holders as part of their other activities and mandates."
"Approach taken to engage stakeholders 
The BMW Group continuously communicates with a large num-
ber of different stakeholder groups at all locations and in all mar-
kets."
"Appropriate forms and methods of engagement are se-
lected, depending on the situation."
* BMW Operations Pension Scheme.
"In 2023, the rating agencies Moody’s 
and Standard & Poor’s (S&P) both confirmed BMW AG’s high in-
vestment-grade credit ratings within a challenging market envi-
ronment."
"Moody’s long-term rating remains at “A2 with stable 
outlook”, while the short-term rating is unchanged at “P-1”."
"S&P’s long-term rating remains at “A with stable outlook”, with a 
short-term rating of “A-1”."
"The credit ratings reflect BMW’s continued strong operating per-
formance."
"The credit rating is also backed up by the Company’s 
solid capital structure, balanced financial policy and solid liquidity 
position."
"Moreover, the increasing proportion of Group sales of 
all-electric vehicles is seen as a positive factor."
"These above-average credit ratings are testimony to BMW AG’s 
excellent creditworthiness."
"Accordingly, BMW AG enjoys good 
access to international capital markets and benefits from attrac-
tive refinancing conditions."

tio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in

BMW Group caters to a wide range of customer requirements."
"The essence of the BMW brand lies in the seamless interplay be-
tween components, which provide the distinctive driving dynam-
ics synonymous with the brand."
"An extensive and attractive 
product range with a variety of drivetrains - from purely electric

cient combustion engines - reflects BMW’s technology-oriented

* ↗ Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.
"Trends with significant implications for the automotive 
industry are analysed and evaluated and the underlying prem-
ises are scrutinised."
"Taking into account these influencing fac-
tors, characterised by their in parts rapid rate of change, we con-
tinually refine our corporate strategy and adjust our strategic ob-
jectives accordingly."
"The corporate strategy and strategic targets of the BMW Group 
form the starting point for the departments to define concrete ap-
proaches and implementation measures."
"This process is based 
on strategic fields of action and key success factors."
"The strategy process allows plans to be drawn up for different 
scenarios to account for increasingly volatile and challenging en-
vironmental conditions, thereby ensuring flexibility and respon-
siveness for the BMW Group."
"The BMW Group’s strategy is 
based on fundamental values such as the integrity of our 
actions."
"↗ Compliance and Human Rights 
The strategy is integrated into annually revised, longer-range 
corporate planning using a closed loop-based planning and 
management system."
"Its implementation is monitored by a tar-
get system that is comprised of the aspects of finance, custom-
ers, processes, learning and development."
"↗ Risks and 
Opportunities To this end, we continuously monitor the business 
environment in our key regions, using available data to analyse 
the trends and developments that could affect our business in 
the future."
"In 2023, we undertook an extensive update and re-
view of our environmental analysis, significantly broadening the 
scope of subject areas considered."
"Regular ↗ Dialogue with 
Stakeholders within the scope of the established BMW Group 
XChange formats completes the picture from the analysis of ex-
ternal and environmental factors."
"Alongside the current development directions, certain trends are 
gaining momentum, notably within digital technologies and the 
political landscape."
"The most significant trends set to have a 
long-term effect on the BMW Group’s business model are clas-
sified according to their impact on society, technology, business, 
environment and politics."
"Society 
Individual mobility remains a fundamental human need, though 
vehicle ownership continues to depend to a large extent on in-
come, household size and location."
"The coronavirus pandemic 
has not had any significant or lasting effects on mobility behav-
iour in general."
"On-demand mobility (ODM) services, especially 
in urban areas, remain a supplementary option."
"Technology  
For a technology-based company like the BMW Group, general 
developments in this area are of particular importance."
"This area 
is undergoing constant change, with the market environment 
evolving dynamically and new collaborative models emerging."
"New solutions, particularly in artificial intelligence, are emerging 
and are finding applications across all aspects of life."
"Modern ve-
hicles are already one of the most complex digital items owned 
by consumers."
"Vehicle requirements are also increasingly influ-
enced by the digital ecosystems that customers interact with 
every day."
"Automobiles should be a reliable source of support in 
everyday life, fit seamlessly into a person’s living environment 
and create a holistic overall experience."
"Software updates with 
further functional developments are expected and generally be-
coming standard."
"↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation 
Alongside digitalisation, development of automated/autono-
mous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mobility."
"Initial offerings of Level 4* features are expected to launch in the 
market before 2030, although widespread adoption is expected 
to occur only after 2030."
"↗ Products 
The acceleration of electromobility worldwide continues to be an 
important prerequisite on the path to climate neutrality, although 
the pace of adoption is expected to vary regionally."
"In the long 
term, there will be a parallel range of electric vehicles and com-
bustion engine vehicles available worldwide."
"However, the num-
ber of all-electric models in the automotive industry as a whole is 
expected to continue to increase."
"Addressing remaining uncer-
tainties, including regulations, the swift and widespread develop-
ment of charging infrastructure and the availability of raw mate-
rials will be essential for the future expansion of this sector."
"It is 
necessary to increase the pace at which capacities are expanded 
in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for climate-neutral 
and green energy across industries."
"The share of regenerative 
energies in the energy mix is on the rise, increasing the volatility 
of the entire energy supply and making it increasingly difficult to 
maintain the stability of networks."
"Due to these factors and the 
limited capacities of distribution networks, every effort needs to 
be continued to ensure that electromobility is a long-term suc-
cess."
"↗ Electromobility  
Environment 
As governments around the world work to transpose the goals of 
the Paris Climate Agreement’s carbon reduction targets into na-
tional laws, an ambitious orientation towards climate policy will 
serve as an important basis for successful action for businesses."
"It is equally vital to prepare for the consequences of current and 
anticipated changes brought about by climate change, which 
create a tangible urgency to take action."
"The role of hydrogen as 
an energy source is set to undergo a fundamental shift, propelled 
by the global imperative for decarbonisation."
"Business 
Business and the environment are closely linked and influence 
each other."
"Thus, alongside carbon emissions, resource effi-
ciency will also gain in importance."
"The demand for secondary 
materials and recycling is also rising, for instance, due to quota 
requirements."
"Simultaneously, this development is giving rise to 
cross-industry initiatives and opportunities for new business 
models."
"↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and Renewable Energy 
Competition among various political systems is a dominating 
force in international politics, influencing changes in international 
trade flows using instruments like sanctions, tariffs and subsi-
dies."
"The need to secure supply chains is intensifying due to the 
dual challenges of climate change and geopolitical risks."
"Politics 
Politics and regulations are narrowing the scope for action across 
the entire automotive value creation model."
"There is an increas-
ing variety of legislation in all regions of the world."
"In urban areas within the European Union, infrastructure bottle-
necks and selective reallocation of road space are likely to result 
in increased traffic congestion and reduced accessibility."
"Simul-
taneously, there is an increasing trend towards policies that dis-
courage car use in city centres."
"The planned deployment of smart 
city technologies would, however, primarily affect cities in China."
"CORNERSTONES OF THE 
STRATEGY 
The BMW Group’s strategy is oriented to its corporate purpose: 
“The BMW Group exists to move body, heart and mind.” 
It is the driving force, the guiding principle and the orientation for 
our employees, and our commitment to our active role in society."
"Its long-term focus guides us purposefully through the extensive 
transformation of the entire automotive industry and beyond."
"Transitioning to the specific details of the BMW Group strategy, 
the BMW Group Impact broadens the Company’s long-term stra-
tegic vision and underscores its ambition to contribute to broader 
societal development."
"The BMW Group 
strategy outlines targets in four areas: position, direction, strate-
gic approach and collaboration."
"* Standard industry definition according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE): Five levels 
of automated driving."
"With its inspiring and innovative products, the BMW Group is 
committed to first-class individual mobility and contributes to 
sustainable development."
"It aims to find the right balance be-
tween business, the environment and society."
"The key areas of 
focus within the strategy are electrification, digitalisation and 
sustainability or circularity."
"This enables us to seamlessly merge 
enjoyment and responsibility, without compromising, and to 
achieve our growth and profitability objectives."
The BMW Group is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement.
"For 
this reason, the BMW Group has laid out measurable, science-
based targets to be reached by 2030; these are firmly estab-
lished across the company (base year 2019)."
"Carbon emissions 
are to be reduced as follows: 
1."
"An average of 80% carbon reduction at our own plants 
and locations (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle produced 
(↗ Carbon emissions generated at BMW Group locations) 
2."
"Carbon reduction during the vehicle’s use phase (Scope 3 
downstream) by an average of at least 50% per kilometre 
driven."
"Increased efficiency in our electrified models and 
the new generation of combustion engine technology will 
make this possible."
"An additional driving force for this is the 
dynamic growth in demand for our electrified vehicles 
↗ Electromobility, ↗ Automotive segment 
3."
"An average of at least 20%* carbon reduction in the supply 
chain (Scope 3 upstream) per vehicle produced ↗ Carbon 
emissions in the supply chain 
We have joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for 
this purpose."
"This will enable us to guarantee transparency and 
comparability in the validation and measurement of our targets 
and, at the same time, ensure they are in line with the latest sci-
entific findings and regulatory requirements."
"These are de-
scribed in more detail in the chapter ↗ Carbon Emissions."
"↗ Performance management parameters such as ↗ Carbon Emissions over 
the entire product life cycle are important ↗ Performance indicators 
during the development phase of our vehicle projects."
"The Board 
of Management receives and discusses a status report on sus-
tainability every quarter and derives appropriate measures as re-
quired."
"The BMW Group is actively working on numerous projects and 
initiatives to improve the framework conditions for electromobil-
ity, including the expansion of charging infrastructure on a broad 
basis."
"The ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are 
designed to tackle climate change in the transport sector, requir-
ing a combination of modern drive technologies that are closely 
aligned with customer needs and different mobility requirements 
around the world."
"In addition to all-electric models, plug-in hy-
brids and modern combustion engine technology also make an 
important contribution to the reduction of global carbon emis-
sions."
"The BMW Group is also forging ahead with its work with 
hydrogen."

The target validated under SBTi is 22%.
"Best practices in 
the fields of environmental protection, social sustainability, cor-
porate citizenship and governance are also shared within an in-
ternational sustainability network."
"The BMW Group offers exciting products for current and future 
generations and secures its independence as a company by 
maintaining a high level of profitability."
"The BMW Group is shap-
ing the future of sustainable mobility with its passion and strong 
capacity for innovation."
"Thanks to its exciting products, the BMW 
Group is able to achieve maximum customer satisfaction and 
brand strength, and thus grow its market share."
"Economic performance is a very important aspect of our corpo-
rate management system and is anchored in our objective of har-
nessing growth potential and securing our profitability targets."
"This is supported by our ambitious financial standards, which are 
linked to the strategic key figures EBIT margin in the Automotive 
segment (between 8 and 10%), RoCE in the Automotive seg-
ment of at least 18% and an EBT margin in the Group of more 
than 10%."
"↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management 
The quality and reliability of all of our products and services are 
the critical drivers for customer satisfaction, enthusiasm and the 
economic success of the BMW Group."
"We are therefore commit-
ted to a comprehensive approach to quality, centred on deliver-
ing the best possible customer experience."
"The “Mission Quality” 
initiative was launched across the Company in 2023."
"As a key 
area of focus for the Company, the initiative promotes the 
strengthening of quality awareness and focuses on the individual 
contributions of all employees."
"Digitalisation is consistently extended beyond the vehicle 
↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation, encompassing both 
corporate and customer processes, as well as along the automo-
tive value chain, enhancing the resilience and business agility of 
the BMW Group."
"There are corresponding initiatives in all  
areas of the Company."
"Our “Digital Process & Impact” initiative 
is an example of commitment to significantly accelerating the 
digitalisation of our internal processes and operations across the 
Company, harnessing digital potential in every area through the 
use of digitalised process management."
"The dedicated process 
and digitalisation functions ensure the consistent implementa-
tion and corresponding development of expertise across all de-
partments."
"Concurrently, March 2023 marked the launch of DIG-
ITAL BOOST, one of the most comprehensive training pro-
gramme in the BMW Group’s history."
"This virtual training pro-
gramme, designed for employees in indirect roles across all lev-
els of the organisation, delivers insights and opportunities in dig-
italisation on both national and international fronts."
"The aim is 
for all employees to acquire the same basic knowledge of digital-
isation, enabling them to identify potential within their own areas 
of responsibility and harness it for the benefit of the BMW Group."
"The BMW Group is focused on its customers worldwide and on 
meeting their different requirements."
"It does so by understanding 
the needs of its current and future customers and exceeding their 
expectations."
"It combines ground-breaking technologies, emo-
tional products and individual customer care to create a unique 
overall experience."
"The fields of action electrification, digitalisa-
tion and circularity are of particular importance."
"We recognised the importance of electromobility early on and 
have been working resolutely to accelerate the adoption of all-
electric and connected mobility."
"By the close of 2023, the 
BMW Group had introduced at least one all-electric model across 
all its brands and segments."
"In 2023, the extended-wheelbase 
version of the iX1 for the Chinese market, the BMW i5* sedan and 
the Rolls-Royce Spectre* were launched on the market."
"In 2023, 
deliveries of all-electric automobiles increased by more than 
74.1%, reaching 375,716 automobiles, up from 215,752 auto-
mobiles in 2022."
"↗ Automotive 
segment The BMW Group expects its attractive product range to 
drive another significant increase in the number of all-electric ve-
hicles delivered in 2024."
"With intelligent vehicle architectures 
and flexible production facilities, the company is well-prepared 
for the continued expansion of electromobility."
"Society’s ac-
ceptance of electromobility will depend on trends in customer de-
mand, regional regulations and the development of a suitable 
framework, with a particular focus on infrastructure expansion."
"The BMW Group is currently planning for all-electric vehicles to 
account for more than 50% of all vehicles by 2030."
"The Rolls-
Royce brand is set to become all-electric by 2030, and the MINI 
brand will follow suit by the early 2030s."
"↗ Electromobility 
The launch of the BMW CE 04 electric scooter has successfully 
established BMW Motorrad’s position in the electromobility land-
scape."
"Building on this success, the eParkourer – the BMW CE 
02 – is set to advance the electrification strategy for urban mo-
bility in April 2024."
"↗ Motorcyles segment 
In addition to delivering product substance, we also offer custom-
ers a 360° approach with an appropriate charging ecosystem."
"Customers can charge their vehicles at home, at work and in pub-
lic places, and can also use our BMW Charging and MINI Charg-
ing stations and we are actively involved in expanding the charg-
ing infrastructure."
"In an increasingly digital envi-
ronment with changing customer needs, the Company relies on 
a future-oriented sales structure with a focus on the digitalisation 
of the customer interface and direct customer access."
"The aim is 
to offer the industry’s best premium customer experience."
"In this 
context, the My BMW App and MINI App play a significant role 
with over 12 million users (as at December 2023)."
"More than 
three million customers (as at December 2023) access the apps 
every day."
"Using their smartphones, they interact with their BMW 
or MINI vehicles, the BMW Group itself and the BMW and MINI 
dealerships, and also receive personalised offers."
"The relation-
ship with the customer thus becomes even closer."
"The BMW Group is decisively and consistently driving forward 
with its online sale of vehicles."
"Customers are free to choose 
whether they would like to order their vehicle from agents or 
online."
"They also have the option to seamlessly transition be-
tween both worlds."
"A central aspect of the revamped sales structure is the transition 
to direct sales."
"After the pilot market in South Africa, MINI was 
the first Group brand to implement the new sales model in China 
in March 2023, followed by Europe in January 2024 with Italy, 
Poland and Sweden."
"The remaining European countries will 
transition over the course of 2024 and 2025 and the BMW brand 
will follow suit in Europe in 2026."
"Going forward, our existing 
trading partners will continue in their roles as active commercial 
intermediaries 
between 
the 
BMW 
Group 
and 
our  
customers."
"The trading partners will be closely involved in the implementa-
tion."
"The new sales structure offers an attractive and sustainable 
business model for these partners, and they will continue to be 
the face for customers in the future, where they can focus on 
providing the best advice and support."
"At the same time, we aim 
to achieve consistent prices across each sales channel."
"By enabling smooth transitions between physical and digital 
channels and launching direct sales, the BMW Group is improv-
ing direct customer connections – an essential step for providing 
the best customer experience ↗ Automotive segment."
"In the Finan-
cial Services segment, we are also continually expanding our ser-
vices to include digital and modular services."
"The aim is for our 
products to be accessible to all customer groups across all chan-
nels within our strategic orientation in the Financial Services seg-
ment."
↗ Financial Services segment.
"This ensures that our customers 
receive personalised offers designed to meet their specific 
needs."
"Circularity is a key focus for the BMW Group in the drive towards 
more resource-efficient mobility."
"The concept revolves around 
recycling materials to the fullest extent, ensuring that resources 
are utilised sustainably and retain their value over time."
"This ap-
proach opens up a range of opportunities across the entire value 
chain."
"Reusing valuable resources reduces our reliance on pri-
mary raw materials and their fluctuating prices."
"Furthermore, the 
use of high-quality secondary materials significantly reduces the 
carbon footprint of our vehicles."
"↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency 
and Renewable Energy."
"We aim to progress gradually towards a cir-
cular economy, from designing for circularity through to increas-
ing the use of secondary materials for parts and components and 
ultimately advancing to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles."
"The BMW Group constantly strives for the best results, support-
ing its employees with the discovery and development of their 
potential so they are able to remain productive."
"We support and 
challenge strong teams with complementary strengths who work 
together to achieve the best solutions in a complex environment."
We see diversity as an important element of our competitiveness.
"↗ Employees and Society The diversity metric defines the share of 
women in management positions as a key performance indicator 
and a strategic target variable."
"The aim is to increase the share 
of women in management positions at the BMW Group to 22% 
by 2025."
"↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management 
BMW Group employees not only work closely together within the 
Company, but also with external partners."
"The stable relation-
ships that have grown in our partner networks over time are 
based on the same values as those at the BMW Group."
"They al-
low us to maximise our effectiveness and work together to lead 
the Company to success."
"Experiences from the crisis years have 
further strengthened these relationships, as exemplified by our 
supply chains."
"↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network 
Together with our cooperation partners, we realise potential by 
accessing more expertise and improving our profitability and 
technology footprint."
"In addition to the collaboration with Qual-
comm in the advancement of assisted and automated driving, 
the development partnership between the BMW Group and Solid 
Power, for instance, presents advantages for both companies."
"Examples include our Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre 
(CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich, where our expertise in design-
ing and manufacturing solid-state cells is continuously expanded 
through a dedicated prototype line, bringing significant value to 
our partnership with Solid Power."
"We continuously expand our 
collaborations to unlock additional potential for value creation in 
the Group."
"↗ Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation 
The BMW Group invests in the development of employee skills, 
with the view that continuous training guarantees jobs world-
wide."
"↗ Employees and Society The restructuring of our Munich head-
quarters is an example of this commitment."
"The complete re-
structuring of an entire plant, including combustion engine vehi-
cle production, to 100% electromobility, will be implemented by 
2027 while production is ongoing."
"The BMW Group is already 
designing and producing electrified drive components for its ex-
isting electric vehicles at German facilities in Munich, Dingolfing, 
Leipzig and Regensburg, as well as in China at the Shenyang lo-
cation."
"↗ Production 
and Supplier 
Network, 
↗ Employees and Society 
Beginning in 2025, we will take the next step in our transfor-
mation process with the NEUE KLASSE, which is expected to set 
standards in electrification, digitalisation and circularity."
"The con-
cept vehicle, unveiled at the IAA Mobility 2023 International Mo-
tor Show in Munich, offered a glimpse into the future of the NEUE 
KLASSE."
"The NEUE KLASSE is distinguished by its new cluster 
architecture (NCAR), which is entirely focused on BEVs (battery 
electric vehicles)."
"The sixth-generation BMW e-drive technology 
will significantly improve driving pleasure and efficiency."
"In the 
interior, the next generation of BMW iDrive delivers a completely 
fresh digital user experience, seamlessly blending real and virtual 
worlds."
"Another aim of the NEUE KLASSE is to 
achieve a new level of sustainability across the entire vehicle life 
cycle."
"To accomplish this, the BMW Group is increasingly inte-
grating secondary materials and implementing resource-efficient 
production methods."
"↗ Circular Economy, Resource Efficiency and 
Renewable Energies  
Production of vehicles for the NEUE KLASSE will get underway 
in 2025 at the newly constructed BMW Group plant in Debrecen 
and then be expanded to other locations."
"The resulting target system is 
therefore a key instrument for anchoring strategy throughout the 
Company."
"For corporate management purposes, the strategic 
targets are backed by effective performance indicators."
"Long-range corporate planning for the Company as a whole and 
its segments is geared towards the structure of the BMW Group 
target system."
"In this way, the targets set out in the planning are 
regularly compared with the BMW Group’s strategic goals."
"Once approved by the Board of Management and the Supervi-
sory Board, the target amounts decided upon within the strategic 
target system become the basis of planning for the current re-
porting year and for the target agreements with BMW Group 
managers."
"The following summarises the 
key performance indicators defined in DRS 20, which also form 
the basis for performance management in the BMW Group."
"Capital is 
considered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit 
generated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and 
debt capital."
"This strategy also secures the desired degree of cor-
porate autonomy in the long term."
"The BMW Group’s performance management system is based 
on a multilayered structure."
"Operational performance is man-
aged primarily at segment level."
"In order to influence long-term 
corporate performance, additional performance indicators are 
taken into account within the management system at Group 
level."
"In this context, the value added serves as one of several 
indicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value 
during the financial year."
"This aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and seg-
ment level by means of the key performance indicators."
"The link 
between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented 
in a simplified form below."
"BMW Group – Value drivers  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Managing sustainability 
The BMW Group’s long-term corporate strategy is determined 
by the Board of Management."
"Responsibility for implementing 
the Group’s sustainability goals also lies with the full Board."
"Sig-
nificant decisions are therefore evaluated from the point of view 
of sustainability."
"This ensures that sustainability issues are sys-
tematically integrated in decision-making processes and to 
compensation at top management levels."
"As part of the proce-
dures for managing sustainability on an integrated basis at cor-
porate level, a Group target system has been created, which ap-
plies to specific departments."
"The BMW Group has set itself the target of decarbonising its 
vehicle fleet by at least 40% over the entire life cycle by 2030, 
based on the reference year 2019."
"In this context, specific tar-
gets have been set for the scopes of the vehicle’s use phase, 
production and supply chain (↗ Position, ↗ Carbon Emissions)."
"This 
entails setting specific carbon targets for each vehicle project, 
managing them through digital processes and tracking their at-
tainment."
"An integrated approach to target management ensures that the 
BMW Group’s vehicle projects make a positive contribution to-
wards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set."
"Furthermore, the BMW Group will consistently increase its use 
of secondary raw materials."
"The Group intends to already have 
made significant progress by 2025 with the introduction of the 
first X model of the NEUE KLASSE."
"Non-financial performance 
indicators such as carbon emissions and, in future, secondary 
raw materials quotas are therefore key performance indicators 
for all new vehicle projects."
"It is also ensured that financial as-
pects are taken into consideration and the most effective 
measures are prioritised for implementation in all areas."
"The 
overall result is a cohesive management model across all as-
pects of the business."
"Depending on 
the business model, the segments are measured on the basis of 
return on total capital or return on equity."
"Return on capital employed (RoCE) is used for the Automotive 
and Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Fi-
nancial Services segment."
"These indicators combine a wide 
range of relevant economic information, such as profitability (re-
turn on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure 
segment performance and the development of enterprise value."
"Automotive segment 
The most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the 
Automotive segment is RoCE, which provides information on the 
profitability of capital employed and business operations."
"Value 
driver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in 
RoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development."
"The capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus 
of operational segment management."
"Capital employed is 
calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inven-
tories and trade receivables less trade payables."
"The amount of 
capital employed increased in light of the full consolidation of 
BMW Brilliance in the BMW Group Financial Statements as at 
11 February 2022."
"The increase arose primarily due to the take-
over of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, as 
well as the capitalisation of reacquired rights in conjunction with 
the purchase price allocation."
"The RoCE will be impacted tempo-
rarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisa-
tion expense expected to be recorded."
The strategic target for RoCE is 18%.
"Due to the special significance of RoCE for the BMW Group, the 
Automotive segment is also managed on the basis of a number 
of additional key performance indicators that have a significant 
impact on RoCE and hence on segment performance."
"These 
value drivers include deliveries and the operating return on sales 
(EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a percent-
age of segment revenues) as a key figure for profitability in the 
segment."
"Furthermore, the Automotive segment manages its compliance 
with fleet carbon emissions requirements in regulated markets."
"This also includes the share of all-electric automobiles in deliver-
ies reported since the 2023 financial year."
"The proportion of 
electrified automobiles, including PHEV models, was reported as 
a performance indicator until 2022."
"↗ Performance indicators As 
compliance with regulatory requirements is a significant factor in 
the BMW Group’s success, business decisions relating to vehicle 
projects also take targets for fleet carbon emissions into  
account."
"The principal key 
performance indicator is the return on capital employed (RoCE)."
"The strategic RoCE target set for the Motorcycles segment is 
18%."
"The main value drivers are the deliveries and the operating return 
on sales (EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as 
a percentage of segment revenues) as the key performance in-
dicator for segment profitability."
"Financial Services segment 
The performance of the Financial Services segment is measured 
on the basis of the return on equity (RoE), a key performance in-
dicator commonly used in the banking sector."
"Within the BMW 
Group, RoE is defined as segment profit/loss before tax, divided 
by the average amount of equity capital in the Financial Services 
segment."
The target is a return on equity of at least 14%.
"Group profit/loss before tax pro-
vides a comprehensive measure of the Group’s overall corporate 
performance after consolidation effects and enables a transpar-
ent comparison over time."
"Other key performance indicators at 
Group level are the size of the workforce at the year-end as well 
as the share of women in management positions."
"By 2025, the 
BMW Group aims to increase the share of women in manage-
ment positions to 22%."
"↗ Strategy Process 
The information provided by these key performance indicators at 
Group level is complemented by the two financial performance 
indicators of pre-tax return on sales and value added."
"Value 
added, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also pro-
vides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost 
of capital required to generate Group profit."
"A positive value 
added means that a return on investment above the cost of cap-
ital has been achieved."
"Capital employed comprises the amount of Group equity and 
pension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Auto-
motive and Motorcycles segments employed on average at the 
end of each of the last five quarters."
"The earnings amount corresponds to Group profit/loss before 
tax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the 
pension provisions and on the financial liabilities of the Automo-
tive and Motorcycles segments (profit/loss before interest ex-
pense and tax)."
"The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return 
expected by capital providers in return for the capital employed."
Since capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g.
"share 
capital) and a debt capital element (e.g."
"bonds), the overall cost 
of capital is determined on the basis of the weighted average 
rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard mar-
ket procedures."
"The pre-tax average weighted cost of capital for 
the BMW Group in 2023 was 12%, unchanged from the previ-
ous year."
"In order to determine the internal rate of return, risk-adjusted cost 
of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent 
years."
"Project-related decisions are therefore a crucial el-
ement of financial management in the BMW Group."
"Project deci-
sions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash 
flows of each individual project."
"Calculations are made for the 
complete term of a project, incorporating future years in which 
the project is expected to generate cash flows."
"Project decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and 
the internal rate of return calculated for the project."
"The net pre-
sent value indicates the extent to which the project will be able to 
generate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of cap-
ital."
"A project with a positive net present value enhances future 
value added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise 
value."
"The project’s internal rate of return measures the average 
return on the capital employed in the project."
"For all project deci-
sions, the project criteria and long-term impact on periodic re-
sults are measured and incorporated in the long-term Group 
plan."
"This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project 
decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year 
during the term of the project."
"Board of Management remuneration 
Performance criteria for the variable remuneration paid to mem-
bers of the Board of Management are based on the key strategic 
targets and performance indicators."
"More information can be 
found in the ↗ Remuneration Report."
"According to calculations of the Inter-
national Monetary Fund (IMF), global gross domestic product 
(GDP) grew by 3.1% in 2023."
"While the US and China recorded 
stronger growth than in the previous year, economic growth in 
Europe weakened."
"In the eurozone, growth in 2023 was 0.5% due to high inflation 
rates and the resulting fall in demand."
"In Germany, GDP con-
tracted by 0.3% as a result of rising prices, declining export de-
mand and the low level of investments in light of higher interest 
rates."
"In France (+0.9%), Italy (+0.7%) and Spain (+2.5%), eco-
nomic growth was more robust."
"The UK experienced a significant 
slowdown in growth to 0.1%."
"In the USA, the economy proved very resilient in the face of rising 
interest rates and grew by 2.5% in the reporting period."
"A sus-
tained low level of unemployment in combination with rising 
wages helped boost consumption."
"In China, the growth rate in 
2023 stood at 5.2%, slightly higher than the target set by the 
government."
"The momentum resulted in particular from catch-
up effects following the end of coronavirus lockdowns."
"The Japanese economy recovered well during the reporting pe-
riod with a growth rate of 1.8%, benefiting from stronger export 
demand on the back of the depreciated currency."
"Higher benchmark interest rates in many markets and a 
strong euro 
At the beginning of 2023, inflation remained relatively high in a 
number of countries."
"Only in the second half of the year did the 
inflation rate gradually begin to decline."
"Therefore, many central 
banks continued to pursue their restrictive monetary policies and 
raise benchmark interest rates."
"In 2023, the British 
pound was slightly weaker compared to the previous year, fluc-
tuating between 0.89 and 0.85 pounds to the euro, with an av-
erage annual exchange rate of 0.87 pounds to the euro."
"In China, inflation was low during 2023, enabling the country’s 
central bank to pursue a newly evolving monetary policy, which 
contributed to a depreciation of the Chinese renminbi."
"For the 
year as a whole, the average exchange rate for the Chinese cur-
rency was 7.66 renminbi to the euro."
"The Japanese currency fluctuated between 138 and 164 yen to 
the euro during 2023."
"Based on an average exchange rate of 
152 yen, the Japanese currency fell in value against the euro 
compared to the previous year."
"The currencies of major emerging markets mostly depreciated 
against the euro."
"While the Indian rupee depreciated by approxi-
mately 8% on average, the South African rand declined by 16%."
"On the other hand, the Brazilian real remained largely stable 
against the euro, depreciating by less than 1% on average."
"Con-
versely, the Russian rouble depreciated markedly by 25% due to 
the normalisation of energy prices and increasingly stringent 
sanctions."
"Throughout the year, the prices of aluminium and steel declined, 
ending the year at approximately the same level as at the begin-
ning of 2021."
"Precious and non-ferrous metals exhibited a simi-
lar trend, with prices lower on average in 2023 compared to the 
previous year."
"This development was partly due to the significant 
price declines in metals such as rhodium (approximately -60%) 
and palladium (approximately -40%)."
Prices for battery-related raw materials also fell again.
"For the 
majority of 2023, cobalt was once again below the long-term av-
erage, while lithium prices fell by up to 80% over the course of 
the year."
"Energy prices also fell over the course of the year, as Germany in 
particular adapted to the changed availability of natural gas."
"By 
the end of 2023, natural gas prices in Europe had returned to the 
levels seen in autumn 2021, significantly lower than the levels 
before the start of the conflict in Ukraine."
"Worldwide, the number of new 
registrations rose by 8.3% to 77.1 million units."
"Overall, European markets 
recorded growth of 18.6%."
"Among the major motorcycle mar-
kets, Italy (+21.7%), Spain (+20.9%) and France (+13.4%) 
contributed significantly to this trend."
"Germany also recorded a 
sharp year-on-year increase of 14.3%."
"The US market remained 
stable, growing by 0.4%."
"In China, the downward trend in the 
motorcycle market continued (-22.9%), influenced by the linger-
ing effects of the pandemic."
"In Brazil, however, motorcycle regis-
trations were significantly higher than one year earlier, with an 
increase of 50.4%."
"In many mar-
kets, higher inflation rates, accompanied by increased interest 
rates, also weighed on consumer sentiment."
"Despite these fac-
tors, the BMW Group can look back on an overall positive course 
of 
business 
in 
the 
financial 
year 
2023."
"Deliveries of premium segment automobiles, motorcycles and 
scooters were all at record-high levels."
"In particular, sales of all-
electric premium vehicles provided significant impetus for 
growth."
"BMW AG’s solid financial condition is reflected in the results of 
operations, financial position and net assets reported for the fi-
nancial year 2023."
"Performance was in line with management 
expectations and the targets set for 2023."
"This assessment also 
takes into account events after the end of the reporting period."
"Compared to 
expectations at the beginning of the year, the BMW Group’s per-
formance was bolstered by the easing of the supply situation as 
well as by favourable pricing conditions in both new and pre-
owned vehicle markets, despite higher cost pressures."
"Carbon emissions per vehicle produced decreased more than ex-
pected at BMW Group sites."
"This was due to reduced gas and 
heating oil usage on the one hand and a simultaneous increase 
in production volume on the other."
"The following table summarises the development of the 
BMW Group’s key performance indicators as a whole as well as 
those of the Automotive, Motorcycles and Financial Services 
segments in the financial year 2023 compared to the forecasts 
made in the BMW Group Report 2022."
"Detailed information on the BMW Group’s key performance indi-
cators is provided below in conjunction with the analysis of the 
Group’s results of operations, financial position and net assets."
"The development of the most significant performance indicators 
is described in the respective chapters on the Automotive, Mo-
torcycles, and Financial Services segments."
"An explanation of 
the development of other non-financial performance indicators is 
provided in the chapters on Products as well as Employees and 
Society."

"(BMW Bril-
liance) has been  fully consolidated as a subsidiary since 11 Feb-
ruary 2022, whereas up to that date, it had been accounted for 
using the equity method."
"Consequently, BMW Brilliance is in-
cluded for the whole of 2023, but only for a proportionate period 
of the previous year."
"Group revenues totalled € 155,498 million in the reporting year 
(2022: € 142,610 million), representing a solid increase over 
the previous year (+9.0%)."
"The main reason for revenue growth 
was the higher number of vehicles delivered."
"Furthermore, fa-
vourable product mix effects and the aforementioned full consol-
idation of BMW Brilliance contributed to the year-on-year in-
crease in revenues."
"Additionally, higher interest rates and in-
come from dealership financing further increased revenues in 
2023, mainly reflecting the impact of higher inventory levels held 
by dealerships in light of improved vehicle availability, model 
changes and a higher average financing volume per vehicle."
"Reduced intersegment eliminations associated with leasing 
business had a positive impact on revenues."
"These favourable factors were offset by unfavourable exchange 
rate effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar which 
held down Group revenues."
"The year-on-year increase in cost of sales reflected sales volume 
growth as well as higher expenses for materials and warranty 
obligations."
"Similarly, cost of sales recorded by BMW Brilliance 
also contributed to an increase compared to 2022."
"Cost of sales 
in the previous financial year were also additionally negatively 
impacted by the first-time full consolidation of BMW Brilliance."
"Rising interest rates increased interest expenses for the Finan-
cial Services segment."
"Group research and development expenses increased signifi-
cantly by 13.8% year on year."
"Research and development ex-
penditure related primarily to the digitalisation and electrification 
of the vehicle fleet across all model series, as well as the devel-
opment of automated driving functions."
"Further expenditure was 
incurred for the development of new models, such as the all-elec-
tric BMW i5*, the X3 and X5 and the Rolls-Royce Spectre and 
NEUE KLASSE models."
"Due to revenue growth, the research and development expendi-
ture ratio remained at the same level as one year earlier."
"Selling and administrative expenses went up slightly by 3.9% 
year on year."
"The rise was due to higher administrative ex-
penses, primarily influenced by higher costs for IT projects, nota-
bly in connection with the planned switch to direct sales in Eu-
rope."
"The ratio of selling and administrative expenses to reve-
nues fell to 7.1% (2022: 7.4%)."
"Depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets recorded in cost of sales as well as in sell-
ing and administrative expenses totalled € 8,974 million (2022: 
€ 8,566 million)."
"The net amount of other operating income and expenses deteri-
orated year on year."
"In 2022, other operating income was in-
creased by income arising on the reversal of provisions."
"Due to the various factors affecting gross profit, as described 
above, profit before financial result climbed to € 18,482 million 
(2022: € 13,999 million; +32.0%)."
"The impact of the previous 
year’s first-time full consolidation of BMW Brilliance and lower 
intersegment eliminations related to leasing business had a par-
ticularly positive effect on the year-on-year change in gross 
profit."
"The financial result deteriorated significantly to a net negative 
amount of € 1,386 million (2022: net positive amount of 
€ 9,510 million)."
"In the previous year, other financial result ben-
efitted primarily from the gain of approximately € 7.7 billion aris-
ing on the remeasurement of the shares already held by the 
BMW Group prior to the business combination with BMW Bril-
liance."
"Additionally, the other financial result was adversely impacted by 
the fair value measurement of interest rate hedging transactions, 
reflecting falling interest rates in the USA, the UK and the euro-
zone during the twelve-month period under report."
"In the previ-
ous year, the increase in interest rates resulted in favourable 
measurement effects on interest rate hedging transactions."
2 Capitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.
"Similarly, the net interest result deteriorated year on year."
"In the 
previous year, interest and similar expenses included income 
arising on the change in interest rates in connection with the 
measurement of provisions."
"By contrast, falling interest rates in 
2023 had a negative impact."
"Accordingly, Group profit before tax amounting to € 17,096 mil-
lion – as forecast – was significantly lower than one year earlier 
(2022: € 23,509 million)."
"At € 4,931 million (2022: € 4,927 million; +0.1%), income tax 
expense in the reporting year was at a similar level to the previ-
ous year."
The effective tax rate was 28.8% (2022: 21.0%).
"In the previous 
financial year, the primary factor reducing the effective tax rate 
was the tax-neutral gain resulting from the remeasurement of 
the shares held prior to the business combination with BMW Bril-
liance."
"In the reporting year, the size of the workforce was slightly higher 
at 154,950 employees, which was in line with expectations 
(2022: 149,475 employees; +3.7%)."
"The buyback authori-
sation remains valid until 10 May 2027."
"The programme was 
launched on 1 July 2022 and ended on 30 June 2023."
"BMW AG 
repurchased a total of 22,199,529 shares of common stock for 
€ 1,850 million and 1,923,871 shares of preferred stock for 
€ 150 million."
"On 18 July 2023, the Board of Management re-
solved to redeem all of the shares repurchased in conjunction 
with the initial buyback programme."
"The process of redeeming 
the shares was completed during the third quarter 2023."
"On 3 May 2023, on the basis of the authorisation granted by the 
Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2022, the Management 
Board resolved to initiate a second share buyback programme, 
which duly began on 3 July 2023."
"The programme, with a vol-
ume of up to € 2 billion (total purchase price excluding incidental 
acquisition costs) pertains to common and preferred stock, the 
latter of which is limited to a maximum volume of € 350 million."
"The first tranche of the second share buyback programme was 
successfully completed on 1 December 2023."
"As part of this first 
tranche, a total of 4,218,363 shares of common stock and 
942,892 shares of preferred stock were acquired between 3 July 
2023 and 1 December 2023."
"A total purchase price (excluding 
incidental acquisition costs) of around € 500 million was paid for 
the shares repurchased as part of this tranche."
"The second tranche of the second share buyback programme 
will be carried out with a volume of up to € 410 million for com-
mon stock and up to € 90 million for preferred stock in the period 
from 2 January 2024 to 28 June 2024, at the latest."
"The second share buyback programme will be concluded by 31 
December 2025, at the latest."
"Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements 
correspond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet."
"Cash flows from operating activities are determined indirectly, 
starting with Group/segment profit before tax."
"By contrast, cash 
flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual 
payments and receipts."
"The lower net cash inflow from operating activities was primarily 
due to changes in leased products and receivables from sales 
financing, particularly credit financing for dealerships."
"The year-
on-year increase in credit financing for dealerships was driven by 
improved vehicle availability, model changes and a higher aver-
age financing volume per vehicle."
"A further factor for the decrease in cash inflow from operating 
activities was the higher level of inventories held with a view to 
servicing markets and fulfilling customer demand."
"A lower in-
crease in receivables and higher payables had a positive impact 
on the cash inflow from operating activities."
"The cash outflow from investing activities was higher than one 
year earlier."
"In 2022, the first-time full consolidation of BMW Bril-
liance resulted in a positive impact of € 3,587 million to cash out-
flow from investing activities, resulting from cash acquired on the 
business combination and the purchase price paid."
"Moreover, in-
creased investments in property, plant and equipment, particu-
larly for introducing new vehicle models, digitalising the fleet as 
well as pressing ahead with automated driving and the NEUE 
KLASSE, resulted in a higher net cash outflow than one year ear-
lier."
"In contrast, the net cash inflow arising on the sale of marketable 
securities had a positive impact on cash flows from investing 
activities."
"The decrease in the net cash outflow from financing activities 
was mainly the result of higher borrowings and lower repay-
ments."
"Higher dividend payments to shareholders of BMW AG (2023: 
€ 5,430 million; 2022: € 3,827 million) increased the net cash 
outflow from financing activities."
"The main factor for the year-on-year decrease was the net cash 
outflow from investing activities, which, in 2022, had included a 
positive impact of € 5,011 million in connection with the full con-
solidation of BMW Brilliance."
"Excluding that impact, the seg-
ment’s free cash flow would have amounted to € 6,060 million 
in 2022."
"Automotive segment cash inflow from operating activities im-
proved year on year, with the change in trade receivables and 
trade payables contributing to the increase."
"In contrast, the build-
up of inventories to service the markets had a negative impact."
"Liabilities for bonus payments to dealerships went up, partly due 
to the higher sales volume, and had a positive impact on the cash 
flow."
"In addition, the net cash inflow from operating activities rose 
due to lower income tax payments."
"Net financial assets of the Automotive segment decreased year 
on year due to dividend payments and the share buyback pro-
gramme."
"In the Automotive segment, net financial assets comprised the 
following: 
 
* Excluding derivative financial instruments."
"The year-on-year increase in credit fi-
nancing for dealerships was driven by improved vehicle availa-
bility, model changes, and a higher average financing volume per 
vehicle."
"The change in the net cash outflow from financing activities was 
attributable to lower cash outflows relating to intragroup refi-
nancing on the one hand and the decreased repayment of exter-
nal financial liabilities on the other."
"The funds 
raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW Group’s 
Financial Services business."
"The overall objective of Group fi-
nancing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW Group at all times, 
focusing on three areas: 
1."
"The ability to act through permanent access to strategically 
important capital markets 
2."
"Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing instru-
ments and investors 
3."
"A focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs 
Financing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure ac-
cess to liquidity for the Group’s operating subsidiaries at stand-
ard market conditions and consistent credit terms."
"Funds are ac-
quired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a bal-
anced mix of financing instruments."
"The use of longer-term in-
struments to refinance the Group’s Financial Services business 
and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves 
to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio."
"This con-
servative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the 
Group’s rating."
"Further information is provided in the section  
Liquidity Risks within the chapter ↗ Risks and Opportunities."
"Focused capital market management, good ratings and the high 
level of acceptance enjoyed by the BMW Group on those markets 
enabled it to refinance itself on the world’s debt capital markets 
at favourable conditions during the 12-month period under re-
port."
"In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commer-
cial paper."
"Specific banking instruments, such as the customer deposits 
used by the Group’s own banks in Germany and the USA, were 
also deployed for financing purposes."
"In addition, loans were 
taken from international banks."
"During the reporting period, the BMW Group issued bonds total-
ling approximately € 9.2 billion."
"The Group refinanced itself by 
means of 144A transactions with a total volume of 3 billion US 
dollars on the US capital market and by means of so-called 
Panda bonds with a volume of 3 billion Chinese renminbi on the 
Chinese capital market."
"Furthermore, the BMW Group issued, 
among others, two euro benchmark bonds totalling € 3.0 billion, 
as well as a pound sterling benchmark bond of 0.4 billion British 
pounds and a Canadian bond of 0.5 billion Canadian dollars on 
the international capital markets."
"ABS transactions with a total 
financing volume equivalent to € 16.0 billion were executed in 
2023, including both new and rolled-over ABS transactions."
"During the reporting period, ABS financing transactions were 
carried out in the following markets: Australia, China, Germany, 
Japan, Canada, Switzerland, South Korea, the USA and the UK."
"The BMW Group continued to deploy robust liquidity-related 
measures throughout 2023 to ensure its ability to act flexibly and 
independently at all times."
"As at 31 December 2023, liquidity on hand amounted to € 19.5 
billion, slightly below the previous year’s level (2022: € 20.3 bil-
lion)."
"The BMW Group also has access to a syndicated credit line, 
which was renewed in June 2023."
"The syndicated credit line 
amounting to € 8 billion has a term without exercising extension 
options until June 2028 and is provided by a consortium of 43 
international banks."
The credit line was not being utilised at 31 December 2023.

ther information with respect to financial liabilities is provided in

"The Group’s balance sheet total is slightly higher than one year 
earlier."
"Currency effects from the Chinese renminbi and the US 
dollar had a dampening effect on the balance sheet total.1  
Intangible assets decreased moderately compared to 31 De-
cember 2022 on a currency-adjusted basis."
"The main reason for 
the decrease was the amortisation recognised on reacquired 
rights and dealership relationships from the acquisition of 
BMW Brilliance."
"Adjusted for currency effects, property, plant and equipment was 
up by 12.2% year on year."
"This increase was driven in particular 
by additions to land, buildings and production facilities of the 
newly fully consolidated entity, BMW Manufacturing Hungary Kft."
"Higher investments in the sixth generation of electric drives, as 
well as for new vehicle projects such as the new BMW 5 Series, 
also had an impact."
"The capital expenditure ratio stood at 5.7% 
(2022: 5.5%) whereas the capital expenditure ratio excluding 
right-of-use assets increased to 4.9% (2022: 4.3%)."
Leased products were slightly up on a currency-adjusted basis.
"The increase was driven by the higher level of new leasing busi-
ness and a higher average financing volume."
"In contrast, the 
managed contract portfolio decreased to 1,712,330 contracts 
(2022: 1,807,904 contracts; –5.3%)."
"Receivables from sales financing increased slightly compared to 
31."
Dezember 2022 on a currency-adjusted basis.
"An increase 
in dealership financing, especially in the USA and Germany, had 
an impact at 31 December 2023."
"The year-on-year increase in 
dealership financing was due to better availability of vehicles, the 
introduction of new models such as the BMW 7 Series and the 
BMW i5², and a higher average financing volume per vehicle."
"The 
increase was offset by a decrease in customer financing, partic-
ularly in China."
"The decrease in China was due to strong  com-
petition from local banks."
"The increase in inventories was mainly due to the build-up of fin-
ished goods to service the markets and as a result of model 
changes."
"Group equity climbed to € 92,923 million, driven primarily by the 
Group net profit amounting to € 12,165 million (2022: € 18,582 
million)."
"Equity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG rose to 
€ 89,596 million mainly due to the net profit for the year attribut-
able to shareholders of BMW AG amounting to € 11,290 million."
"The dividend payout amounting to € 5,430 million reduced 
Group equity and, to an equal extent, equity attributable to 
BMW AG shareholders."
"The continued share buy-back pro-
gramme also reduced equity attributable to shareholders of the 
BMW Group."
"Pension obligations stood at € 427 million, surpassing the pre-
vious year’s figure of € 339 million."
"The increase in the provision 
for pensions resulted mainly from the application of lower dis-
count rates."
"Other provisions increased significantly on a currency-adjusted 
basis, largely due to higher provisions for statutory and non-stat-
utory warranty obligations, as well as product guarantees."
"Currency-adjusted financial liabilities went up, primarily due to in-
creased volume of ABS financing and higher liabilities from cus-
tomer deposits."
"These increases took place against the backdrop 
of rising financing requirements in light of the growth of Financial 
Services business."

(2022: 6,021 units; +0.2%)."
"Electric mobility maintains momentum 
The BMW Group’s sales growth in the reporting year was signif-
icantly influenced by the systematic electrification of its product

"This was borne out by continued strong growth in deliver-
ies of all-electric vehicles."
"Market demand for all-electric vehicles 
from the BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brands resulted in deliver-

"2 Deliveries including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd, also for the period prior to that entity’s 
full consolidation in the BMW Group Financial Statements (1 January to 10 February 2022: 
96,133 units)."
"Electrification also had a highly perceptible im-
pact in the premium compact segment, with the MINI Cooper SE* 
once again finishing the year as the brand’s best-selling model."
"The MINI Cooper SE Convertible* was also launched during the 
reporting year, providing electrified driving pleasure in combina-
tion with an open-air experience."
"The limited edition of 999 ve-
hicles was quickly sold out."
"Overall, electrified MINI models (BEV 
and PHEV models) accounted for 20.8% of the brand’s deliver-
ies (2022: 20.8%; +0.0%)."
"All-electric vehicles accounted for 15.3% of deliveries (2022: 
14.9%; +2.7%)."
"The new MINI family will be launched in the 
course of 2024."
"In addition to the completely new MINI Cooper 
E*, an all-electric version of the MINI Countryman* is also availa-
ble for the first time."
"The new MINI Aceman, the brand’s first 
crossover model, will make its debut as a purely electrically pow-
ered model in spring 2024."
"Record high for Rolls-Royce 
The year 2023 was an extremely successful one for Rolls-Royce."
"The luxury brand delivered a total of 6,032 units to customers in 
the reporting year (2022: 6,021 units; +0.2%)."
"With this performance, Rolls-Royce achieved a new record high 
in terms of deliveries of ultra-luxury class automobiles."
"Once 
again, the most sought-after model was the Luxury Offroader 
Rolls-Royce Cullinan."
"The Bespoke programme, which allows for 
custom-made Rolls-Royce models tailored to individual cus-
tomer preferences, also enjoyed great success worldwide."
"To-
wards the end of 2023, the first all-electric Rolls-Royce Spectre* 
made its market debut."
"The luxurious Supercoupé marks a mile-
stone in the history of the prestigious marque and already has a 
backlog of orders stretching through to 2025."
"In 2023, it has been included for the full year."
"At € 132,277 million (2022: € 123,602 million; +7.0%, cur-
rency-adjusted: +11.3%), the Automotive segment recorded a 
solid year-on-year increase in revenues on the back of higher ve-
hicle sales."
"In the previous year, vehicle sales fell due to produc-
tion cutbacks caused by the limited availability of semiconductors 
and wiring harnesses as well as pandemic-related lockdowns in 
China."
"Furthermore, the increased volume of high-revenue mod-
els sold, such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW X5, as well as 
growth in spare parts and accessories business, also contributed 
to the year-on-year increase in revenues."
"The full consolidation 
of BMW Brilliance also increased revenues."
"Unfavourable cur-
rency translation effects, primarily from the Chinese renminbi and 
the US dollar, held down the increase in revenues."
"The segment’s cost of sales amounted to € 109,920 million and 
was therefore moderately higher than the previous year (2022: 
€ 104,324 million; +5.4%)."
"Similar to revenue, higher vehicle 
sales and full consolidation of BMW Brilliance also had an impact 
in this regard."
"The segment’s cost of sales was also negatively 
impacted by increased expenses for warranties."
"A higher propor-
tion of electrified, especially all-electric, vehicles also contributed 
to increased costs."
"In the previous year, the impact of the full consolidation of 
BMW Brilliance, including approximately € 1.8 billion in depreci-
ation from purchase price allocation and the elimination of ap-
proximately € 1.3 billion in intra-group profits, had a negative ef-
fect on the cost of sales."
"Depreciation from the purchase price 
allocation amounted to approximately € 1.4 billion in 2023."
"The increased research and development expenditure  is primar-
ily related to the cross-series digitalisation and electrification of 
the vehicle fleet, as well as the development of automated driving 
functions."
"Furthermore, the expenditure resulted from the 
development of new models, such as the BMW 5 Series and 
NEUE KLASSE models, for example."
"Selling and administrative expenses rose to € 9,195 million in 
the reporting period (2022: € 8,801 million; +4.5%)."
"A signifi-
cant reason for the increase is higher costs for IT projects."
"The net amount of other operating income and expenses de-
creased year-on-year."
"Among other factors, other operating in-
come in the previous year included higher reversals of provisions."
"At € 12,981 million, profit before financial result in the 2023 fi-
nancial year was significantly higher than in the same period of 
the previous year (2022: € 10,635 million; +22.1%)."
"The full 
consolidation of BMW Brilliance had a dampening impact in 
2022 in the year-on-year comparison."
"The EBIT margin for the segment was at 9.8% for the reporting 
year (2022: 8.6%; +1.2 percentage points)."
"As forecasted in the 
quarterly report for 30 September 2023, the EBIT margin was 
within the range of 9.0 to 10.5%."
"The financial result of the Automotive segment was a net nega-
tive amount of € 339 million and therefore significantly down on 
the previous year’s corresponding figure (2022: net positive 
 
amount of € 8,283 million)."
"The main reason for the year-on-
year deterioration was the gain of € 7.7 billion recognised in 
2022 in other financial result arising on the remeasurement of 
the segment’s previous at-equity interest in BMW Brilliance."
"In the year under report, the interest result was primarily im-
pacted by higher expenses arising from the unwinding of interest 
on discounted provisions, while interest income from bank de-
posits had an offsetting effect."
"In the previous year, interest in-
come arising from the change in interest rates in connection with 
the unwinding of interest on discounted provisions was reported 
within interest and similar expenses."
"The Automotive segment’s return on capital employed (RoCE) 
for 2023 finished at 20.2%, and was therefore within the pre-
dicted target range of 18 to 22% (2022: 18.1%; +2.1 percent-
age points)."
"The improvement was primarily due to the higher 
profit before financial result."
1 Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues.
2 Profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues.
"This 
represents a slight increase of 3.0%, in line expectations for the 
financial year."
"Sales growth in all key regions 
All major regions worldwide contributed to the successful sales 
result in 2023."
"In Europe, deliveries increased slightly to 
116,011 units (2022: 110,788 units; +4.7%)."
"Germany re-
mained at the previous year’s level with 24,176 units (2022: 
24,129 units; +0.2%)."
"France achieved a slight increase with 
21,668 units (2022: 21,223 units; +2.1%)."
"Slight growth was 
also recorded in Italy with 16,179 units (2022: 15,668 units; 
+3.3%)."
"Deliveries in Spain totalled 12,716 units (2022:
12,506 units; +1.7%)."
"In the Americas, deliveries totalled 46,184 units, maintaining the 
previous year’s level (2022: 45,775 units; +0.9%)."
"Solid growth 
was recorded in Brazil with 14,106 units delivered to customers 
(2022: 13,051 units; +8.1%)."
"The USA saw a total of 17,017 
units sold, slightly down on the high number achieved in the pre-
vious year (2022: 17,690 units; -3.8%)."
"Sales in China in-
creased slightly to 15,832 units (2022: 15,404 units; +2.8%)."
"Market launches in the reporting year 
In 2023, BMW Motorrad celebrated its centenary and took the 
opportunity not only to renew but also expand its product portfo-
lio in the premium segment."
"The BMW R 1300 GS was intro-
duced as the highlight and start of the renewal of the legendary 
GS Boxer family and has been available to customers since No-
vember 2023."
"In the first half of the year, three model updates were introduced 
in the Sport and Super Sport segment with the R 1250 RS, the S 
1000 RR and their high-performance M variant – the M 1000 
RR."
The R 1250 R was updated within the Roadster lineup.
"The 
M 1000 R, the first M Roadster, took to the roads as a completely 
new model."
"The centenary celebrations were complemented in 
the Heritage segment by two exclusive edition models: the BMW 
R 18 100 Years and the BMW R nineT 100 Years."
"Another high-
light of the year was the opening of BMW Motorrad Welt in Berlin 
as the “Home of the Brand”."
"Fans and other interested parties 
can enjoy a world of experience centred around the BMW Motor-
rad brand."
"Deliveries of BMW motorcycles 
in 1,000 units 
BMW Group – largest motorcycle markets 2023 
in % of sales 
New products unveiled by BMW Motorrad 
For BMW Motorrad, the 2023 reporting year was dominated by 
the centenary celebrations."
"Four new models and four model up-
dates were presented for market launches in 2024."
"BMW Motor-
rad presented the new BMW CE 02 at the BMW Motorrad Days 
in July 2023."
"One year after the launch of the BMW CE 04, 
BMW Motorrad announced a further electric vehicle for urban 
centres and is systematically pursuing its electric mobility strat-
egy."
"The BMW CE 02 eParkourer opens up a new vehicle seg-
ment in urban mobility."
"As model updates, the F 800 GS, F 900 GS and GS Adventure 
revive the BMW Motorrad 2-cylinder family in the Adventure 
segment."
"In parallel to the presentation of the model update of the S 1000 
XR in October, the M variant – the M 1000 XR – was announced 
as a new model and will provide new impetus in the sports seg-
ment."
"The R nineT family received a refreshed look with the world 
debuts of the new R 12 nineT and R 12 boxer models towards 
the end of the year."
* For a definition of deliveries see ↗ Glossary.
"Retail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting pe-
riod do not correlate directly to the revenues that BMW Group recognizes in respect of such re-
porting period."
"At € 258 million, profit before tax in the financial year 2023 was 
down slightly (2022: € 269 million; – 4.1%), whereby sales vol-
ume growth and positive pricing effects were offset by unfavour-
able product mix effects and higher material costs."
"In a year-on-
year comparison, net interest expense of € 1 million in 2023 had 
a negative impact on the financial result (2022: net interest in-
come of € 12 million)."
"In the previous year, interest income aris-
ing from the change in interest rates in connection with the un-
winding of interest on discounted provisions was reported within 
interest and similar expenses."
"In contrast, decreasing interest 
rates had a negative impact in 2023."
"The return on capital employed (RoCE) in the Motorcycles seg-
ment for the reporting year came in at 22.1%, and was therefore 
within the expected target range of 21 to 26% (2022: 24.9%; -
2.8 percentage points)."
"The primary factor for the year-on-year 
change was the rise in net working capital, driven by a number of 
factors, including the model update in 2023 and a moderate in-
crease in inventory levels."
"FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT 
Financial Services segment earnings down on previous year 
Profit before tax reported by the Financial Services segment for 
the financial year 2023 amounted to € 2,962 million (2022: 
€ 3,205 million; -7.6%) and was therefore moderately down on 
the previous year."
"Key reasons for the decrease were higher re-
financing costs due to rising interest rates and a decrease in the 
contract portfolio."
"Remarketing revenues from lease returns re-
mained at a high level, but were nevertheless below the previous 
year’s figure."
"This also had a negative impact on earnings com-
pared to the previous year."
"On the other hand, a lower expense 
for credit risk provisioning had a positive effect on earnings."
"In 
the previous year, the level of expense recognised in connection 
with credit risk provisioning was heavily influenced by geopolitical 
uncertainties and a weaker macroeconomic outlook."
"The credit loss ratio for the entire credit portfolio remained at a 
low level in 2023, finishing at 0.18% for the year (2022: 0.13%)."
"In balance sheet terms, business volume increased slightly to 
stand at € 137,910 million (2022: € 135,689 million; +1.6%)."
"Stable earnings performance by Financial Services segment 
Return on equity for the Financial Services segment remained at 
a similar level to the previous year, finishing at 17.2% for the fi-
nancial year 2023 (2022: 17.9%; -0.7 percentage points)."
"Re-
turn on equity for 2023 was therefore within the revised target 
range of between 16 and 19%."
"New business with retail customers in line with last year’s 
level 
Credit financing and leasing business with retail customers re-
mained at the same level in 2013, with a total of 1,542,514 new 
contracts concluded (2022: 1,545,490 contracts; -0.2%)."
"Out of 
the new contracts concluded in 2023, 325,320 contracts (2022: 
321,535 contracts; +1.2%) related to credit financing and leas-
ing of pre-owned BMW Group vehicles."
"New lease business grew by 8.5% increase in 2023, whereas 
credit financing business contracted by 4.1%."
"Leasing ac-
counted for 33.6% of total new business, credit financing for 
66.4%."
"The total volume new credit financing and leasing contracts with 
retail customers rose by 3.4% to € 57,333 million (2022: 
€ 55,449 million), mainly due to a higher average financing vol-
ume per vehicle as a result of an improved product mix in the 
Automotive segment."
"The share of new BMW Group vehicles either leased or financed 
by the Financial Services segment stood at 38.2%* in 2023 
(2022: 41.0%; -2.8 percentage points)."
"New BMW Group vehicles leased or financed by the  
Financial Services segment* 
in % 
 
*The calculation only includes automobile markets in which the Financial Services segment is rep-
resented by a consolidated entity."
"Fleet business at previous year’s level 
Under the brand name Alphabet, the Financial Services segment 
primarily offers credit financing and leasing contracts, as well as 
related services, mainly to commercial customers as part of its 
fleet management business."
"Out of the total portfolio of credit fi-
nancing and leasing contracts with retail customers, this line of 
business accounted for 720,094 contracts at the end of the re-
porting period (31 December 2022: 714,630 contracts2; 
+0.8%)."
"Dealership financing up on previous year 
At 31 December 2023, the total business volume of dealership 
financing stood at € 18,941 million, up sharply compared to the 
end of the previous financial year (2022: € 15,209 million; 
+24.5%)."
"The increase was mainly due to improved vehicle 
availability, model changes and a higher average financing vol-
ume per vehicle."
"OTHER ENTITIES SEGMENT / 
ELIMINATIONS 
The Other Entities segment recorded a loss before tax 
of  € 100 million (2022: profit before tax  of € 995 million)."
"The 
main reason for the deterioration was the level of fair value 
measurement losses recognised on interest rate hedging trans-
actions in the line item “Other financial result” as a result of falling 
interest rates in the USA, the UK and the eurozone during the 
reporting year."
"In the previous year, sharply rising interest rates 
led to fair value measurement gains on interest rate hedging 
transactions reported by the Other Entities segment."
"At the level of profit before tax, eliminations increased to a posi-
tive amount of € 1,334 million (2022: € 122 million)."
"In compar-
ison to the previous year, lower eliminations in 2023 for leasing 
and credit financing business had a positive impact on the result 
reported."
"1 EU Bank comprises BMW Bank GmbH with its branches in Italy, Spain and Portugal."
"2 Previous year’s value adjusted due to a change in brands for contracts with third-party branded 
vehicles."
"The comments on the BMW Group and Automotive segment 
provided in earlier sections apply to BMW AG, unless presented 
differently in the following section."
"The Financial Statements of 
BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplemen-
tary requirements contained in the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG)."
"The key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the divi-
dend payout ratio."
"This is defined as the unappropriated profit of 
BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net 
profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with 
IFRS."
"The key non-financial performance indicators are essen-
tially identical and concurrent with those of the BMW Group."
"These are described in detail in the ↗ Financial Performance section 
of the Combined Management Report."
"Differences also arise in the presentation of assets 
and liabilities and of items in the income statement."
"Business environment and review of operations 
The general and sector-specific environment of BMW AG is es-
sentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in 
the ↗ Financial Performance section of the Combined Management 
Report."
"BMW AG develops, manufactures and sells automobiles and 
motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufac-
tured in-house, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, 
and performs services related to these products."
"Sales activities 
are carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, inde-
pendent dealerships and importers."
"Automobile deliveries in-
creased by 235,621 to 2,620,920 units in the financial year 
2023."
"This figure includes 692,267 units relating to series sets 
supplied to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, an in-
crease of 50,473 units compared with the previous year."
"As of 31 December 2023, BMW AG had 85,168 employees, 
plus 5,733 apprentices, interns and thesis students (31 Decem-
ber 2022 81,683 employees, plus 5,500 apprentices, interns 
and thesis students)."
"The year 2023 was characterised by a volatile business environ-
ment marked by increasing (geo-)political tensions."
"In addition, 
in many markets higher inflation rates accompanied by increased 
interest rates had a negative impact on the consumer climate."
"Despite these factors, BMW AG overall looks back on a positive 
business performance in the reporting year."
"BMW AG’s solid financial condition is reflected in the results of 
operations, financial position and net assets reported for the fi-
nancial year 2023."
"Business developed in line with management 
expectations."
"This assessment also takes into account events 
after the end of the reporting period."
"Price and product mix effects, along with increased 
sales volume, had a positive impact on revenue growth."
"Ex-
change rate factors also had a positive effect on revenues."
"Geo-
graphically, the increase in revenues was mainly attributable to 
Europe and Asia."
"Revenues totalled € 107,874 million (2022:  
€ 98,807 million), of which Group internal revenues accounted 
for € 83,231 million (2022: € 77,843 million) or 77.2% (2022: 
78.8%)."
"Production costs went up by € 9,212 million to € 90,865 million, 
mostly due to higher costs for materials and logistics."
"Gross profit decreased by € 145 million to € 17,009 million."
"Overall, selling expenses increased slightly, while general admin-
istrative costs increased substantially."
"In line with the ramp-up of vehicles and the ex-
penses for platforms related to the transformation towards 
electromobility, research and development costs increased by 
2.1% compared to the previous year."
"Other operating income was reduced to € 1,872 million (2022: 
€ 2,529 million).The change was mainly due to lower reversals 
of other provisions and lower income from financial transac-
tions."
"Other operating expenses decreased to € 2,067 million (2022: 
€ 2,889 million) and, as in the previous year, mainly included 
expenses from financial transactions and additions to other 
provisions."
"Income from profit and loss transfer agreements with Group 
companies, reported in the line item Result on investments, de-
creased significantly."
"This was essentially due to the decrease 
in the profit of BMW INTEC Beteiliungs GmbH, Munich, which, 
among other things, received lower distributions."
"The financial result improved by € 2,842 million compared to 
the previous year."
"The previous year mainly included higher ex-
penses from the the fair value measurement of plan assets off-
set against pension obligations."
"Taxes on income resulted primarily from the current tax calcu-
lation for the financial year."
"Subject to the shareholders’ approval of the appropriation of re-
sults at the Annual General Meeting, the unappropriated profit 
available for distribution amounts to € 3,802 million (2022: 
€ 5,481 million)."
"This translates to a payout ratio of 33.7% cal-
culated based on the BMW AG shareholders’ portion of the 
BMW Group’s consolidated net profit in accordance with IFRS."
"The payout ratio thus remains within the forecasted corridor of 
30% to 40%, as in 2022 (30.6%)."
"The payout ratio takes into account the number of shares entitled 
to dividends at 31 December 2023 and may change prior to the 
Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing share buyback  
programme."
"Depreciation 
and 
amortisation 
amounted to € 2,607 million (2022: € 2,452 million)."
"Investment assets remained in line with last year’s level and to-
talled € 12,077 million (2022: € 12,093 million)."
"Inventories in-
creased to € 8,505 million (2022: € 7,523 million), primarily due 
to higher levels of finished goods and goods for resale."
"Receivables from subsidiaries declined to € 16,398 million 
(2022: € 24,510 million)."
"Specifically, there was a decrease in 
financial receivables from BMW INTEC Beteiliungs GmbH, Mu-
nich."
"The increase in other receivables and other assets to € 3,120 
million (2022: € 2,281 million) was due in particular to an in-
crease in other assets."
"Liquidity within the BMW Group is ensured by means of a liquidity 
concept applied uniformly across the Group."
"This involves con-
centrating a significant part of the Group’s liquidity at the level of 
BMW AG."
"An important instrument in this context is the cash pool 
based at BMW AG."
"Cash and cash equivalents decreased slightly by € 62 million to 
€ 6,145 million due to outflows from investing and financing  
activities."
This was offset by the surplus from operating activities.
"Equity fell by € 2,286 million to € 17,932 million, mainly due to 
lower unappropriated profit and lower retained earnings as a re-
sult of the share buyback programmes."
"The equity ratio changed 
from 28.0% to 26.4%."
"In order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling € 430 
million were transferred to BMW Trust e."
"V., Munich, in conjunc-
tion with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested 
in plan assets."
"Plan assets are offset against the related guaran-
teed obligations."
"After offsetting pension plan assets against pension obligations, 
provisions for pensions decreased from € 2,871 million to  
€ 2,231 million."
"Other provisions decreased from € 11,686 million to € 11,537 
million mainly due to a decline in provisions for taxes and provi-
sions for liability risks."
"Conversely, the provision for statutory and 
non-statutory warranty and product guarantee obligations in-
creased."
"The decrease in liabilities to subsidiaries to € 22,648 million 
(2022: € 25,703 million) was mainly due to the decline in finan-
cial liabilities."
"Deferred income went up by € 450 million to € 4,501 million and 
included primarily amounts for services still to be performed re-
lating to service and maintenance contracts."
"Risks and opportunities 
BMW AG's performance is essentially dependent on the same 
set of risks and opportunities that affect the BMW Group and 
which are described in detail in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities chapter 
of the Combined Management Report."
"As a general rule, BMW 
AG participates in the risks entered into by Group companies in 
proportion to the respective shareholding percentage."
"At the 
same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on 
the earnings of BMW AG."
"BMW AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management sys-
tem and internal control system of the BMW Group."
"Further in-
formation is provided in the ↗ Internal Control System chapter of the 
Combined Management Report."
"Due to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group 
companies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non-fi-
nancial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW 
Group's outlook."
"This is described in detail in the ↗ Outlook chapter 
of the Combined Management Report."
"PricewaterhouseCoopers 
GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-
schaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqual-
ified audit opinion on the Company Financial Statements of BMW 
AG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are 
presented here."
"For the purposes of their inclusion in Company 
Register, the Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the 
financial year 2023 will be submitted electronically to the body 
that maintains the Company Register, and may be obtained via 
the Company Register website."
"The financial statements are also

"It aims to channel capital flows towards envi-
ronmentally sustainable economic activities."
"The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco-
nomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil-
ment of predetermined technical screening criteria."
"Essentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sus-
tainable if it substantially contributes to one of the following six 
environmental objectives: 
I."
"Climate change mitigation 
II."
"Climate change adaptation 
III."
"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine re-

be significantly harmed during performance of the activity and 
the company involved must observe minimum safeguards, 
among them compliance with human rights."
"New activities for Envi-
ronmental Objectives I and II are set out by Delegated Regulation 
2023/2485."
"The BMW Group will be required to report on Tax-
onomy alignment for all environmental objectives from reporting 
year 2024 onwards."
"Our holistic understanding of sustainability 
The BMW Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Tax-
onomy to promote the private financing of environmentally sus-
tainable economic activities in order to make Europe the world’s 
first climate-neutral continent by 2050."
"As a company aspiring 
to achieve ↗ Net zero across its entire value chain2 by no later than 
2050, the BMW Group had already set ambitious, science-
based targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims to 
achieve by 2030 (base year 2019)."
"These goals were validated 
by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"Each year, the 
BMW Group informs about the actual level of progress."
"↗ The BMW 
Group Strategy 
In the coming years, as a result of the significant increase in elec-
tric mobility, the majority of carbon emissions will no longer be 
generated primarily in the use phase, but in the upstream value 
chain."
"Accordingly, the BMW Group is taking a holistic 
approach to achieving its sustainability-related targets and is 
committed to considering ↗ Carbon Emissions over the entire life cy-
cle."
"However, for the economic activities that are relevant to 
the BMW Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reduc-
ing carbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable 
to low-emissions (until 2025) and emissions-free drivetrains."
"In-
direct carbon emissions, for instance those produced when gen-
erating charging current or during the energy-intensive produc-
tion of high-voltage batteries, are not taken into account in the 
context of these economic activities."
"Moreover, the EU Taxon-
omy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures on in-
house production to the extent that they serve to manufacture 
Taxonomy-aligned products or to the extent that they are explic-
itly included in the description of an activity."
"For example, in-
creasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also re-
duces carbon emissions in in-house production when an internal 
combustion engine vehicle is painted."
"The BMW Group’s sus-
tainability efforts in this regard is not or only partially taken into 
account as part of currently defined economic activities in the EU 
Taxonomy."
"↗ Carbon Emissions 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1The definition of the three performance indicators and their differentiation from IFRS can be found 
in the ↗ Glossary."
"2 In this context the entire value chain is to be understood as Scope 1 and 2 as well as the Scope 3 
categories applicable to the BMW Group (categories 1, 4 and 11) in accordance with the Green-
house Gas Protocol."
"We will also be re-
porting on Taxonomy eligibility in relation to Environmental Ob-
jective IV “Transition to a circular economy” for the first time."
"Taxonomy eligibility is an initial indicator of the 
maximum environmental sustainability potential of economic ac-
tivities as defined by the EU Taxonomy."
"Taxonomy alignment, 
on the other hand, serves as an indicator of an organisation’s 
transformation towards environmentally sustainable economic 
activities."
"An economic activity is considered as Taxonomy-eligible if it is 
described in the Delegated Acts relating to one of the six envi-
ronmental objectives, regardless of whether that economic activ-
ity meets the technical screening criteria stipulated in those Del-
egated Acts."
"Accordingly, specific reporting tables for these activities are not included."
"This economic activity may become increasingly 
important in the next few years as the electrification of the vehicle 
portfolio increases, but is not included in the reporting of the cur-
rent year."
"In order to determine the Taxonomy alignment of economic ac-
tivities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5 in the reporting year, they must be 
reviewed against the technical screening criteria relevant to 
them: 
1."
"They make a substantial contribution to the fulfilment of 
the environmental objective based on the specific carbon 
emissions for the respective vehicles (“Substantial contri-
bution”)."
"They do not cause any significant harm to other environ-
mental objectives based on the specific requirements for 
each relevant economic activity (“Do no significant harm” 
or “DNSH”)."
"It must also be ensured that the organisation carrying out the 
economic activities has established minimum safeguards."
"Economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 as un-
dertaken by the BMW Group are also described under Environ-
mental Objective II “Climate change adaptation”."
"The vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 includes 
BMW Group vehicles and vehicles from other manufacturers."
"As 
no data are available regarding the relevant attributes of these 
third-party products, it is currently not possible to make a com-
prehensive assessment in relation to the DNSH criteria."
"For this 
reason, these vehicles are currently not reported as Taxonomy-
aligned."
"Climate change adaptation 
A robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for 
both economic activity CCM 3.3 and economic activity CCM 6.5 
to determine that they do not cause significant harm to Environ-
mental Objective II."
"To satisfy this requirement, the physical cli-
mate risks at all key BMW Group production sites are considered 
and an assessment of any damage that may occur as a result of 
climate change is being carried out based on long-term climate 
projection scenarios2 up to 2035 and 2050."
"Moreover, we con-
sider potential natural hazards at all of our direct supplier loca-
tions in order to adequately take supply risks into account when 
selecting and evaluating suppliers."
"Adaptive solutions to mitigate 
risks are drawn up and implemented as appropriate based on 
the results of this risk analysis and in consultation with site rep-
resentatives."
"For further information, see ↗ Climate-related Risks and 
Opportunities."
"The DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective II are ful-
filled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5."
"In this context, the BMW Group carries out environmental impact 
assessments in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU during 
the construction of new and expansion of existing sites within the 
EU that also take account of water and biodiversity."
"At locations 
outside the EU, the BMW Group carries out an environmental im-
pact assessment based on EU requirements."
"Moreover, a certi-
fied environmental management system pursuant to ISO 14001 
has been implemented at all BMW Group production sites and all 
local statutory requirements are met."
"↗ Resource Management at all 
locations 
The DNSH requirements for Environmental Objectives III and VI 
are fulfilled for economic activity CCM 3.3."
"Transition to a circular economy 
The requirements for both economic activities of the BMW Group 
to do no significant harm to Environmental Objective IV differ for 
each stage of the value chain."
"With regard to 
the use phase and recycling of BMW Group vehicles (economic 
activity CCM 6.5), we have set up appropriate processes to com-
ply with recycling requirements and established measures for 
managing waste during maintenance and at the end of the life 
cycle."
"All these criteria also form part of our comprehensive ap-
proach to the ↗ Transition to a circular economy."
"The DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective IV are ful-
filled for economic activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5."
"1 The end-of-lease business for BEV previously included in economic activity CCM 6.5 is now re-
ported under economic activity CE 5.4 following the redefinition of this activity."
"2 SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5."
"With regard to economic activity CCM 3.3, the BMW Group has 
established corresponding processes which aim to monitor and 
ensure legal compliance with any prohibitions and limits relating 
to the use of chemical substances at vehicle level."
"All substances 
used by the BMW Group are in compliance with national and Eu-
ropean laws."
"If the use of these hazardous substances cannot be 
avoided, the BMW Group uses them under controlled conditions 
in accordance with hazardous material regulations."
"On the other hand, it is not possible to meet all criteria to do no 
significant harm to Environmental Objective V in the case of eco-
nomic activity CCM 6.5."
"Current PHEV models with air pollutant 
emissions under 50  g CO2/km WLTP offered by the BMW Group 
and other manufacturers may make a substantial contribution as 
defined by the EU Taxonomy."
"The vast majority of 
PHEV in the vehicle portfolio for economic activity CCM 6.5 must 
therefore be considered not Taxonomy-aligned, even if they 
meet these values in everyday driving situations."
"Owing to the lim-
ited availability of data, the eligibility of the models concerned is 
calculated in a simplified manner based on the tyres approved 
for these models, weighted by their purchase volumes and take 
rates."
"The DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective V are ful-
filled for economic activity CCM 3.3; however, not all are fulfilled 
for economic activity CCM 6.5, owing to the RDE and tyre label 
requirements described."
"Minimum safeguards 
Additionally, companies that carry out economic activities as de-
fined by the EU Taxonomy are required to establish minimum 
safeguards."
"These require the implementation of processes to 
ensure compliance with due diligence obligations both within an 
organisation and in stages of the upstream and downstream 
value chain that have been outsourced."
"Specifically, this refers to 
compliance with human rights and topics like bribery, corruption, 
taxation and fair competition."
"↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network, 
↗ Compliance and Human Rights 
The minimum safeguard requirements are met."
"EU Taxonomy performance indicators 
Please refer to the remarks in the glossary for the definition and 
calculation of the Taxonomy-specific performance indicators rev-
enues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure and their 
differentiation from IFRS."
"↗ Glossary 
The proportion of total revenues, capital expenditure and oper-
ating expenditure relating to eligible and non-eligible economic 
activities are shown in each case as an aggregate percentage for 
the BMW Group."
"This approach avoids double counting 
of revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure when 
determining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic 
activities."
"In the case of capital expenditure and operating expenditure, all 
Taxonomy-eligible expenditure is allocated to the two economic 
activities CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5."
"There is no separable Taxon-
omy-eligible capital expenditure and operating expenditure for 
economic activity CE 5.4."
"In most cases, values from financial data were allocated directly 
to the economic activities for all three performance indicators, 
based for example on the drivetrain or the vehicle model."
"In the 
remaining cases, an allocation mechanism was used for each 
economic activity and each performance indicator."
"It is used for capital 
expenditure on property, plant and equipment (including right-of-
use assets from lessee relationships), intangible assets and 
expenditure on research and development for economic activity 
CCM 3.3."
"For operating expenditure, the allocator is only applied 
to non-capitalised development costs."
* PHEV volumes are only taken into account in the allocator until reporting year 2025 inclusive.
"Improvement in all three performance indicators for 
reporting year 2023 
The following overview tables summarise the performance indi-
cators revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure 
from Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned economic activ-
ities of the BMW Group."
"Regardless of the Taxonomy require-
ments, the BMW Group regularly and comprehensively ad-
dresses risks arising from climate change and their potential im-
pact on its sites and supply chains."
"Taxonomy-aligned revenues of the BMW Group amounted 
to € 23,690 million (2022: € 15,705 million), correspond-
ing to 15% of total Group revenues and an increase on the 
previous year of four percentage points."
"The Taxonomy-
aligned share of capital expenditure was 26% (€ 7,926 mil-
lion), which corresponds to an increase of almost five per-
centage points on 2022."
"Taxonomy-aligned capital ex-
penditure as a proportion of the BMW Group’s total capital 
expenditure is impacted significantly by additions related to 
leased products."
"Consequently, an examination of the pro-
portion of Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure at BMW 
Group level does not reflect the huge investment in sustain-
able economic activities and products."
"Operating expendi-
ture incurred for Taxonomy-aligned economic activities 
amounted to € 2,051 million, corresponding to over 31% of 
Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure (2022: 29%)."
"As a percentage of third-party revenues of 
the two segments, the Taxonomy-aligned share rose to 
22.1% (2022: 15.7%)."
"As a result, revenues from the Au-
tomotive and Motorcycles segment that are associated with 
the manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transport 
(CCM 3.3) increased by approximately 41%."
"In contrast to 
the previous year, revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the 
Automotive segment are reported under the new economic 
activity CE 5.4, somewhat dampening the rise in Taxonomy-
aligned revenues."
"↗ Segment information 
The Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital expenditure in 
the Automotive and Motorcycles segment rose to 22.7% 
from 19.1% in the previous year."
"Segment-
specific capital expenditure is thus around 17 percentage 
points higher than in the previous year."
"This was driven by 
increased investment in sustainable products and plant in-
frastructure as part of electrification."
"This underscores the 
BMW Group’s extensive capital expenditure on sustainable 
products and technologies."
"This is due to the fact that there is a time lag 
before the effects of the vehicle fleet electrification ramp-up 
are reflected in the financing and leasing lines of business."
"Third-party brands are 
not included in the vehicle portfolio in the reporting on Tax-
onomy alignment for economic activity CCM 6.5."
"A lack of 
available data regarding the tyre categories or WLTP emis-
sions values of third-party products makes it impossible to 
review compliance with the DNSH criteria in full."
"Moreover, 
revenues from the sale of lease returns are reported under 
the new economic activity CE 5.4, differently from the previ-
ous year."
"The Financial Services segment recorded a de-
cline in revenues for 2023 in absolute terms following the 
reallocation of revenue components to the new economic 
activity CE 5.4."
"The Taxonomy-aligned proportion of capital 
expenditure in the Financial Services segment rose by more 
than 50% on the previous year to 3.3% (€ 1,018 million)."
"Based on total capital expenditure in the Financial Services 
segment, the Taxonomy-aligned proportion rose by signifi-
cantly more than 40% to 5.4%."
"This economic 
activity includes revenues from pre-owned vehicles in the 
Automotive segment and revenues from the sale of used 
cars after their intended use by clients in the Financial Ser-
vices segment, but does not include revenues from the sale 
of used motorcycles."
"Around 12% of total revenues are 
Taxonomy-eligible in reporting year 2023."
"2 Taxonomy-aligned share calculated with denominator as the Taxonomy-eligible value of the re-
spective economic activity."
"See ↗ Note [20] to the Group Financial Statements for details on the 
BMW Group’s capital expenditure."
3 Only includes the operating expenditure defined in the EU Taxonomy.
4 Prior-year figures adjusted due to change in calculation basis.
"These Company cars are generally 
transferred to the BMW Group’s external sales programme 
within 12 months after a short period of in-house use."

2 Including Spotlight Automotive Ltd.
"This plan has been approved by 
the Board of Management of BMW AG and covers a seven-year 
period (2023–2029)."
"The CapEx plan covers capital expenditure 
and operating expenditure for the reporting year and planned 
capital expenditure and operating expenditure (only non-capital-
ised development costs) for 2023–2029 for economic activities 
CCM 3.3 and CCM 6.5."
"The selected future period corresponds 
to the detailed long-term corporate planning of the BMW Group 
and contains various investment measures with different imple-
mentation times (e.g."
"electrification of the vehicle fleet, model re-
visions, structural investments in production sites)."
"The CapEx

"Innovations help to optimise processes, improve 
products and introduce new technologies."
"Remaining consistently one step ahead while keeping a firm eye 
on the future is a core aspect of our philosophy as a company 
and an expression of our firm commitment to innovation."
"The 
BMW Group works tirelessly to provide our customers with for-
ward-thinking solutions today to simplify their daily lives."
"The 
new BMW 5 series, for example, achieves a new level of digital 
connectivity with its completely novel assistance systems."
"The 
BMW VISION Neue Klasse offers a first glimpse at our next prod-
uct generation."
"BMW VISION Neue Klasse 
With the BMW VISION Neue Klasse, the BMW Group is demon-
strating what the next generation of core BMW brand vehicles 
will look like."
"The Vision Vehicle, which was unveiled to the public 
for the first time at the International Motor Show IAA Mobility 
2023 in Munich, features a clear design language that is reduced 
to the essentials with spacious surfaces and a small number of 
striking lines."
"This approach focuses on signature features like 
the BMW kidney grille and the Hofmeister kink in the side win-
dows."
"The design radiates more of the essence of BMW than 
ever."
"The driver interacts 
with the vehicle via the BMW Panoramic Vision, the central dis-
play unit and multifunctional buttons on the steering wheel."
"The 
user experience is complemented by the tried-and-tested voice 
control system via the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant."
"The 
next generation of the BMW iDrive thus offers a modern interpre-
tation of the brand’s typical driver-oriented focus."
"Similar to the 
BMW iDrive controller that was formerly on the centre console or 
the BMW head-up display, the brand is setting new standards 
with the BMW Panoramic Vision, which will be available for the 
first time in the NEUE KLASSE."
"It projects information at a height 
ideally aligned with the driver's line of sight and, for the first time, 
across the entire width of the windscreen."
"This innovation will 
complement the enhanced BMW head-up display in the NEUE 
KLASSE series models."
"The BMW VISION Neue Klasse is also characterised by the in-
creased use of secondary raw materials, resource-friendly pro-
duction methods and an electric drive system featuring sixth-
generation BMW eDrive technology."
"The BMW VISION Neue Klasse represents the entire range of 
technological innovations with which the BMW Group is under-
lining its future entrepreneurial viability."
"It stands for the dawn of 
a new era of individual mobility: electric, digital and circular."
"Digitalisation stands for innovation and customer focus 
Digitalisation is a key element in keeping the vehicle constantly 
up to date for customers long after they have taken delivery of 
their new automobile."
"Since the launch of Operating System 7 in 
2018, remote software upgrades1 have been available for BMW 
vehicles."
"Apart from these software upgrades, the BMW Group 
also releases new functions and features on an ongoing basis."
"At the end of 2023, over six million BMW vehicles worldwide 
were already fully updatable."
"In other words, these vehicles can 
be updated in every respect, including infotainment, the drive 
system, driver assistance, convenience and safety."
"The BMW 
Group can currently update over 30 derivatives of all its drive var-
iants remotely over the air."
"BMW ConnectedDrive upgrades also allow additional functions 
to be either bought or simply booked for a specific period after 
the vehicle has been initially purchased."
"The vehicle as a digital experience 
The latest generation of BMW Group vehicles offers customers a 
maximum of interaction, infotainment and connectivity."
"State-of-
the-art on- and off-board technologies such as 5G connectivity 
and cloud services make the latest BMW vehicles an integral part 
of their users’ digital ecosystems."
"The comprehensive connectiv-
ity enables a whole host of digital services and functions, from 
smart and learning navigation to in-car gaming and video 
streaming."
"The vehicle is thus becoming the ”next living space” 
for its users."
"With the further development of the BMW iDrive in 2023 and the 
”QuickSelect” fast access concept, an improved menu structure 
based on devices from the consumer electronics sector is being 
added to the system."
"With the right information in the right place, 
the new BMW iDrive provides users with a concentrated, confi-
dent driving experience."
"The iconic, round OLED dis-
play takes centre stage in this concept."
"Software expertise at the BMW Group 
More than twenty years ago, with the founding of BMW Car IT 
the BMW Group began developing its own software Since then, 
the company has continued to expand its teams of developers to 
form a global network."
"Beginning with the Ulm site in southern 
Germany, its software expertise has been bolstered by the joint 
ventures Critical TechWorks in Portugal and BA TechWorks in 
China."
"Digital connectivity and automation 
Automated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help 
cut emissions, reduce the risk of accidents and ease traffic con-
gestion."
"That’s why the BMW Group is consistently driving this 
issue forward – with a sharp focus on customer convenience and 
safety."
"To ensure the safety of automated systems, the BMW Group is 
promoting the development of industry-wide ISO standards for 
partially, highly and fully automated driving functions."
"The work 
on classifying the standardisation of SAE3 Level 3 and Level 4 
functions has resulted in an ISO technical report that is due to be 
published as an ISO technical specification in 2024."
"Further-
more, in 2023 an ISO PAS standard was published that supports 
the introduction of Level 2 systems with innovative driver inte-
gration."
"The documents define uniform technical standards for 
safe assisted and automated driving."
"1 The availability and contents of remote software upgrades depends on the country, model, equip-
ment and software version installed."
2 The use of OS 8.5 and OS 9 depends on the vehicle class and the production period.

* Munich test site – pilot test of automated driving in urban traffic."
"During the year under report, the BMW Group opened a new test 
site, the Future Mobility Development Centre in Sokolov, Czech 
Republic, where we are currently testing automated driving and 
parking functions and even fully automated driving (Level 4) on 
an area of 600 hectares."
"With the help of virtual simulations and 
real-life testing, all driving situations are covered, whether in the 
city, in the country, on the highway or when parking."
"We are thus 
creating the basis for meeting our customers’ high safety stand-
ards when it comes to automated driving."
"We also operate re-
search facilities in Munich, where we were involved in the 
↗ TEMPUS* research project in collaboration with the city authori-
ties."
"Between 2021 and 2023, we gathered practical experience 
on a wide range of use cases relating to automated driving func-
tions and innovative mobility services in urban areas."
"The BMW 
Group also has research facilities located in China and the USA, 
enabling it to integrate its two largest markets with regard to 
road- and traffic law-related issues right from the outset."
"The new BMW 5 Series sets new standards in terms of digital 
connectivity and automation."
"Among other things, the vehicle 
can be optionally equipped with a highway assistant, which per-
manently takes over distance control and steering tasks and, for 
the first time, actively changes lanes when confirmed by the 
driver’s gaze."
"Following recent approval by the Federal Motor Transport Au-
thority, the new BMW 7 Series will be equipped with Level 3 func-
tions for the first time."
"The option will be available as of March 
2024, making the BMW Group one of the leading automobile 
manufacturers in the field of highly automated driving."
"Drivetrain technologies of the future 
When developing drive system technologies, the BMW Group 
considers the needs of its customers worldwide."
"For this reason 
we are constantly developing existing drivetrain technologies in 
the interests of efficiency, decarbonisation and resource conser-
vation."
"At the same time, we continue to research new drivetrain 
technologies with the ultimate aim of developing them for series 
production."
"New generation of battery cells 
High-performance, innovative and sustainably produced battery 
cells are the key to success for individual electric mobility."
"With its 
NEUE KLASSE models, as of 2025 the BMW Group will be using 
newly developed, round battery cells for the first time, which are 
optimally coordinated to suit the new architecture."
"The sixth gen-
eration of our lithium-ion cells represents a giant technological 
leap forward compared with the previous generation, effectively 
increasing energy density by more than 20%, charging speed by 
up to 30% and range by around 30%."
"The carbon emissions 
generated by cell production will be reduced by up to 60%."
"Electrified vehicles as part of the power grid 
The BMW Group is conducting its own research and develop-
ment work with the aim of integrating electrified vehicles in the 
power grid."
"The focus is on technologies such as smart charging, 
a key component of the ↗ BMW ChargeForward service, which en-
ables customers to synchronise their charging behaviour with the 
current grid load and the use of renewable energy."
"The technol-
ogy has been available to all drivers of electrified vehicles in the 
USA since November 2023."
"Another cross-sectoral project 
known as ↗ Bidirectional Charging Management (BCM) was successfully 
completed at the end of 2022."
"Over a period of three years, the 
BMW Group, together with grid operators and universities, tested 
how electric vehicles can become mobile energy storage units 
and thus part of the power grid system."
"The results of the project 
underline the great potential of bidirectional charging and were 
incorporated in an initial customer offering, Connected Home 
Charging, in 2023."
"The project is a strategic cooperation with the 
grid operator E.ON, which aims to establish a Europe-wide eco-
system for smart charging at home."
"The innovation enables cus-
tomers to connect their electrified BMW or MINI vehicle with their 
smart home and the power grid."
"The service has been available 
in an initial expansion stage in several European countries since 
late 2023."
"In the coming years, it is to be expanded and ex-
tended to include additional scope with the ultimate aim of ena-
bling bidirectional charging as well."
"[[ BMW Highway Assistant and Active Lane Change 
In the new BMW 5 Series Sedan, customers can use the BMW Highway 
Assistant and Active Lane Change feature for the first time."
"The BMW 
Highway Assistant enables drivers to take their hands off the steering 
wheel and place them in a comfortable position when driving for pro-
longed distances."
"The function is also supplemented by a new feature: 
the Active Lane Change assistant with driver’s gaze confirmation, 
which enables the vehicle to change lanes automatically without the 
driver having to touch the steering wheel."
"All the driver needs to do is 
glance at the wing mirrors to confirm the lane change."
"The prerequi-
sites for this technology include high-precision sensors, a powerful 
computing platform and connection to the BMW Cloud."
"Take your hands off the steering wheel and temporarily turn your at-
tention away from the traffic situation – this is highly automated driving 
at Level 3 and can be experienced in new BMW 7 Series models as of 
March 2024."
"BMW Personal Pilot L3 is the name of the new function 
that relieves customers of the task of driving in defined traffic situa-

"Specifically, 
it is about using street space more efficiently, creating open 
spaces for liveable urban areas, establishing new mobility solu-
tions and promoting parking space management, among other 
things."
"The BMW Group 
also held a ↗ stakeholder dialogue together with the City of Rotter-
dam in the reporting year."
"Over 100 participants from city admin-
istrations, the scientific community, industry and start-ups from 
Europe, the USA and China discussed the urban mobility of the 
future."
"The findings are now being incorporated into other pro-
jects."
"According to this principle, we focus on collaborations in which 
the BMW Group complements its strengths with those of estab-
lished partners and innovation drivers such as start-ups, ena-
bling us to continue developing our innovative strengths."
"The 
global network of BMW Group Technology Offices is also making 
an essential contribution to maintaining the Group’s leading role 
in terms of innovation."
"These offices are strategically positioned worldwide and focus 
on key hotspots of technology and innovation."
"The potential of 
new technologies is therefore being explored in pilot projects and 
transferred to the Group’s centralised teams."
"Whether manufac-
turing, developing smart city solutions or the mobility of the fu-
ture, these Technology Offices are driving forward innovations 
that benefit the Group in all its lines of business."

PRODUCT QUALITY AND 
SAFETY 
All BMW Group products and services are required to meet the 
highest standards in terms of quality and safety, People’s safety 
has top priority, right from the product development stage."
"With 
this point in mind, optimum chassis tuning, highly effective brak-
ing systems and stable passenger compartments are key fac-
tors."
"We are also working continuously to further improve the safety of 
our vehicles."
"In 2023, the new BMW 5 Series achieved top marks 
in the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP)."

"↗ GRI Index: 416-1 ↗ SASB Index 
Quality management 
In addition to its high quality and compliance with statutory reg-
ulations and standards, the BMW Group’s comprehensive quality 
management system also focuses on ensuring the safety of its 
products."
"From the development stage to manufacturing, they 
are therefore subject to rigorous testing procedures."
"Further-
more, any information received from customers regarding poten-
tial deviations from quality standards are systematically followed 
up."
"If a safety risk or a compliance-related defect is found, the BMW 
Group implements all the measures required to remedy the issue 
following detailed discussions with the relevant authorities."
"In 
2023, safety- and compliance-related technical campaigns af-
fected around 1.8 million vehicles (2022: 3.4 million vehicles)."
"All 
these actions were voluntary and carried out in coordination with 
the authorities concerned."
"The BMW Group works according to 
the principle of prevention."
"To avoid technical campaigns of this 
type going forward, the BMW Group has also developed a com-
prehensive programme that has been in place since 2023."
"Pollutants management 
To the extent possible, the BMW Group excludes the use of prob-
lematic substances right from the vehicle design stage and sets 
out corresponding stipulations for its suppliers."
"Guidance is pro-
vided in the form of the ↗ Global Automotive Declarable Substance List 
(GADSL)."
"At the same time, we are working to reduce pollutant 
emissions in the interior of our vehicles to an absolute minimum."
"All BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are equipped as 
standard with interior air filters that prevent exterior pollutants 
and particles such as dust or pollen from entering the vehicle."
"Since 2020, the BMW Group has been using air filters equipped

brand vehicles in 25 countries."
"Participants learn how to handle 
their vehicles in a safe manner and are sensitised to recognise 
dangerous situations in road traffic."
"In 2023, more than 110,000 
customers worldwide took part in these training courses."
"Customer data protection 
Right from the early stages of developing its functions and ser-
vices, the BMW Group sets out strict requirements for data pro-
tection due to the growing IT risks."
"Any personal data required in 
the course of contact with our customers are only collected, pro-
cessed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the active 
consent of the data subject."
"In order to ensure the protection of customer data, despite the 
challenge posed by the growing number of digitalised services, 
we are constantly developing our data management systems 
and respond promptly to any information received regarding 
data protection risks."
"If customers have any queries regarding 
the processing of their personal data, they can contact the Cus-
tomer Interaction Centre or the Data Protection Officer in their re-
spective market."
"With the aim of maintaining our high level of 
data protection, we regularly check all applications that process 
customer data to ensure full implementation of all current and 
appropriate IT security measures."
"Teams of experts also search 
specifically for any vulnerabilities in existing applications."
"We also 
translate any new findings into binding, Group-wide standards."
"The BMW Group collaborates closely with the relevant data pro-
tection supervisory authorities – particularly regarding funda-
mental data protection issues such as those arising from the in-
creasing connectivity of vehicles."
"↗ GRI Index: 3-3, 418-1 
Secure connectivity 
The BMW Group’s responsibility for its products includes the se-
cure transmission of vehicle data to third parties."
"For example, 
Group vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but 
communicate directly and exclusively with the BMW Connect-
edDrive back-end facilities via a secure connection within a vir-
tual private network."
"The strategy enables the BMW Group to 
minimise the risk of unauthorised third parties accessing either 
the vehicle itself or any of its sensitive data."
"The access point to 
the Internet is controlled via a gateway."
"We currently see this ex-
tended vehicle approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the 
best solution for offering an outstanding level of data security and 
data protection and meeting the statutory cybersecurity require-
ments (e.g."
"↗ CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with transparency 
and sovereignty over the transfer of data to authorised third par-
ties."
"With the introduction of the service in Germany and Europe 
in 2017 and the USA in 2020, the BMW Group is fully imple-
menting the current requirements of the EU General Data Pro-
tection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California Consumer Pri-
vacy Act (CCPA)."
"The BMW Group deploys state-of-the-art tech-
nologies to prevent vehicle theft."
"The new BMW 5 Series and 7 
Series also feature the latest ultrawide-band technology, which 
further raises the level of vehicle safety."
"We are taking ambitious 
steps to contribute to progressive decarbonisation, and have 
therefore developed a carbon reduction strategy based on a ho-
listic approach."
"For the BMW Group, holistic means decarbonising the emissions 
generated by its vehicles over their entire life cycle."
"Although the 
gradual electrification of the Group’s fleet is contributing towards 
decarbonisation during the use phase, emissions are also in-
creasing at the same time, particularly in the supply chain."
"The 
main reason for this is the carbon-intensive production of com-
ponents such as high-voltage batteries."
"Reducing carbon emis-
sions within the supply chain is therefore one of our main selec-
tion criteria when awarding contracts to suppliers."
"With this strat-
egy, the BMW Group is making a vital contribution to decarbon-
ising the entire life cycle of its products, including energy-inten-
sive raw materials such as steel, light metals and plastics."
"The 
approach also helps reduce carbon emissions across various 
sectors."
"↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain 
The BMW Group’s decarbonisation targets are part of its inte-
grated corporate target system and validated by the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"They are being implemented 
under the responsibility of the Board of Management in the BMW 
Group’s various departments and thus throughout the organisa-
tion ↗ Performance Indicators and Performance Management."
"Specific de-
carbonisation targets are derived from the overarching objectives 
for each vehicle project, with the aim of achieving substantial im-
provements from one vehicle generation to the next."
"The respon-
sibility for achieving these goals lies with specialist units in the 
management areas of Development, Purchasing, Supplier Net-
work, Production and Logistics."
"Internal control and reporting 
systems take into account the various stages in the value chain, 
comprising the supply chain, development, production and the 
use phase."
"Among other factors, our decarbonisation measures 
are based on emissions specifications at material and compo-
nent level."
"Target management and the monitoring of target 
achievement are performed at vehicle level and subsequently 
aggregated for reporting at Group level."
"We explain how the BMW Group manages the topic of sustaina-
bility across the organisation in the chapter ↗ The BMW Group 
Strategy."
"We also report on the management of climate-related 
opportunities and risks in the chapters ↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and 
Opportunities."
"Reducing carbon emissions across the entire value chain 
The BMW Group aims to achieve ↗ Net zero carbon emissions 
across the entire value chain1 by no later than 2050."
"This objec-
tive is based on decarbonisation targets up to 2030 that were 
validated in 2021 by the SBTi and are in line with the climate 
targets set out in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming."
"Based on this commitment, we are part of the SBTi and the in-
ternational ↗ Race to Zero Campaign led by the United Nations."
"We have set ourselves the following decarbonisation targets2 to 
be achieved by 2030 (base year 2019 for each scope): 
― 
Decarbonisation by an average of 80% per vehicle 
produced at our own plants and sites (Scope 1 and 2)3."
"To accomplish this target, we are driving 
the electrification of the entire product portfolio forward and 
using new, efficiency-enhancing technologies."
"↗ Efficient 
Dynamics technologies 
― 
Decarbonisation by an average of more than 20%7 per 
vehicle produced in the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream8)."
"Thus we also have a scientifically approved and confirmed 
target for reducing carbon emissions in the supply chain."
"The use of green electricity4 as a criterion when awarding 
contracts to suppliers, a continuously increasing secondary 
raw materials quota as well as innovations in the production 
of primary raw materials contribute in particular to achieving 
the target."
"↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain 
1 In this context the entire value chain is to be understood as Scope 1 and 2 as well as the Scope 3 
categories applicable to the BMW Group (categories 1, 4 and 11) in accordance with the Green-
house Gas Protocol."
"The measurement of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as the additional 
Scope 3 emissions, does not include climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide."
"3 In addition to production emissions, Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions also include those gener-
ated at non-manufacturing sites."
"4 In-house generation, direct purchase or Energy Attributes Certificates (e.g."

"In order to achieve this 
target, we are committed to promoting decarbonisation 
measures such as the use of green electricity2 in our own opera-
tions and those of our suppliers, without compensation 
measures being taken into account."
"The combination of a signif-
icant increase in the sale of electrified vehicles, efficiency im-
provements in all drivetrain technologies and effective measures 
to reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain are expected to 
help achieve the targets that have been set."
"We reviewed our carbon targets in 2023, as previously an-
nounced."
"The aim of this process was to set absolute targets for 
reducing carbon emissions by 2030."
"The targets are expected to 
be revalidated in the course of 2024."
"At the same time, we also 
improved the quality of carbon-emissions-related data in our 
supply chain (Scope 3 upstream) in 2023."
"In addition, greater 
transparency was achieved with the first-time publication of a 
↗ Vehicle Footprint for the new BMW i53, providing stakeholders 
with useful information, including the greenhouse gas potential 
of the vehicle over its entire life cycle."
"On the other hand, 
electrification had a proportionate positive effect in the use 
phase."

items “Purchased Goods and Services” and “Logistics – material supply of the plants and distri-
bution of vehicles”."
The prior-year figure has been retrospectively adjusted.
"Figure before change 
in methodology: 117.4 million t CO2."
"Average fleet carbon emis-
sions within the EU1, taking into account regulatory require-
ments2 and in accordance with WLTP3, were 102.1 g CO2/km4."
"We have thus further reduced the carbon emissions generated 
by our new vehicles within the EU5 fleet by 2.9 g year on year 
(2022: 105.0 g CO2/km 4)."
"Regulatory GHG-based fleet consumption targets were met in 
the US market during the year under report."
"6 In the USA, fleet 
GHG emissions 7 averaged 116.5 g CO2/km for model year (MY) 
2023 in the Passenger Cars category (MY 2022: 137.3 g 
CO2/km) and 137.6 g CO2/km (MY 2022: 154.9 g CO)2/km) in 
the Light Trucks category."
"Volume-weighted fleet-wide carbon 
emissions came to 126.5 g CO2/km on average in the USA (MY 
2022: 145.9 g CO2/km).8 The significant year on year reduction 
in fleet-wide carbon emissions in the US market was driven by 
an upturn in all-electric vehicle sales in MY 2023."
"In China, aver-
age fleet carbon emissions were 146.4 g CO 2/km 9 in accord-
ance with the WLTC test cycle (2022: 150.6 g CO2/km WLTC)."
"Thus, we also met the regulatory CAFC fleet-wide consumption 
requirements applicable during the year under report.10 
The BMW Group’s global fleet-wide carbon emissions11 aver-
aged 185.4 g CO2/km12 (2022: 193.7 g CO2/km) in the year un-
der report."
"These figures correspond to a decrease of 15.1% 
compared to the base year 2019 (2019: 218.5 g CO2/km)."
"As in 
previous years, when calculating the emissions figure, the 
BMW Group takes into account average fleet-wide carbon emis-
sions (including upstream emissions for fuel and electric charg-
ing) in the EU, the USA and China and standardises them in ac-
cordance with the WLTP."
"With a share of more than 80% of 
BMW Group deliveries, these three core markets and regions 
form a reliable basis for calculating global carbon fleet emissions."
"The BMW Group pays close attention to carbon emissions legis-
lation in its various markets."
"Current developments in the year 
under report included the adoption of fleet-wide carbon emis-
sions limits in the EU for the years 2030 and 2035 and the pub-
lication of draft legislation for GHG fleet-wide consumption tar-
gets in the USA for the period from 2027 to 2032."
"The statutory 
framework for China’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate 
was amended in the year under review."
"The amendment covers 
the years 2024 to 2025 and increased the quota set for the 
number of zero emissions vehicles."
"The BMW Group supports 
the development of harmonised regulations – both nationally 
and internationally."
"Comparable specifications in large markets 
create reliable and predictable framework conditions and make 
a vital contribution to combating climate change effectively."
"We 
provide information on the BMW Group’s most important climate 
policy positions and activities in our ↗ Climate Commitment Report."
"Making conventional drivetrains more efficient and lowering 
their emissions 
Vehicles powered by modern, efficient internal combustion en-
gines continue to play a major role for our customers."
"This fact is 
particularly true in regions where unrestricted access to charging 
infrastructure is not yet available nationwide."
"For this reason, the 
BMW Group will continue to work on improving the already high 
efficiency of its conventional drivetrains going forward through 
the use of innovative technologies as part of the Efficient Dynam-
ics technology package."
"A key component in this respect is the 
broader use of 48-volt technology."
"48-volt recuperation systems 
use the energy recovered when braking to supply the vehicle’s 
electrical system and generate additional propulsion, thereby re-
ducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions."
"In Europe, in ad-
dition to our all-electric models and plug-in hybrids, we offer nu-
merous new model series that feature a 48-volt recuperation 
system."
"Since 2022, our modular engines have been fitted with 
the second, even more efficient generation of 48-volt technology."
"The further development of energy management in BMW Group 
vehicles, alongside other measures such as switching to highly 
efficient tyres, is designed to ensure additional efficiency and op-
timised consumption figures."

"3 Average carbon emissions fleet-wide within the EU (including Norway and Iceland) are required 
to be reported in accordance with the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure 
(WLTP) type test cycle as of 2021."
"Since 2021, this metric has been used by the EU Commission 
as the basis for calculating carbon fleet emissions."
"4 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2/km, as official 
registration figures from the authorities are not available for all EU states."

"6 In the US market, manufacturers receive positive credits for undercutting regulatory GHG (Green-
house Gas) fleet limits."
Failure to remain below the regulatory limits results in negative credits.
"At 
the end of a model year, a positive GHG credit balance must be achieved in order to meet regula-
tory requirements."
"As GHG credits are valid for five years on the US market, a short-term failure to 
meet fleet-wide limit targets in one year can be compensated by undercutting them in a previous 
year."
"Moreover, it is possible to purchase credits from other manufacturers."
"In 2023, the BMW 
Group drew on existing credits from previous years."
"However, it did not purchase any external 
credits from other manufacturers."
"The requirements were therefore met without exception by us-
ing self-generated and existing credits."

meet fleet limit targets in one year can be compensated by undercutting them in a previous year."
"Moreover, it is possible to purchase credits from other manufacturers."
"In 2023, the BMW Group 
drew on existing credits from previous years."
"However, it did not purchase any external credits 
from other manufacturers."
"The requirements were therefore met without exception by using self-
generated and existing credits."

ELECTROMOBILITY 
The BMW Group sees the electrification of its model range as a 
key component of its product strategy to reduce fleet emissions 
and thus achieve its ambitious strategic ↗ decarbonisation targets."
"We already provide our customers with an extensive range of all-
electric, battery-powered vehicles (BEV)."
"In 2023, another high-
volume model, the all-electric BMW i52 business sedan, went on 
sale."
"MINI presented the new all-electric MINI Cooper SE2 to the 
public during the year under report."
"The Rolls-Royce brand 
launched its first all-electric model, the Rolls-Royce Spectre2, in 
2023."
"The BMW Group therefore has at least one all-electric 
model in its range for all three premium brands and in all seg-
ments."
"At the end of the reporting period, a total of 20 all-electric 
models in ten different series were available to order from the 
BMW Group."
"Demand for all-electric vehicles rising 
With our growing range of all-electric models, we are serving a 
rapidly increasing level of demand."
"Deliveries of all-electric cars 
increased significantly again year on year to 375,716 units 
(2022: 215,752 units/+74.1%)."
"The share of all-electric vehi-
cles to total deliveries was 14.7%, also significantly higher than 
in the previous year (2022: 9.0%/+63.3%)."
"Since the 2023 fi-
nancial year, this key figure has replaced the proportion of elec-
trified vehicles, including PHEV vehicles, which was reported as 
a key performance indicator up to 2022."
"As of 2025, the Group will take its core BMW brand into a new, 
consistently all-electric era with the NEUE KLASSE."
"By the early 
2030s, the MINI and Rolls-Royce brands will have an exclusively 
all-electric product portfolio."
"The strategy will help to achieve a 
share of more than 50% of the BMW Group’s global sales with 
all-electric vehicles – depending on certain framework conditions 
such as the development of a comprehensive charging infra-
structure by 2030."
"The BMW Group aims to have delivered more 
than 10 million all-electric vehicles to customers by 2030."
"1 The other non-EU countries to which this statement applies are Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Liechtenstein, Macau, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey."

Designing electric vehicle ranges to match user behaviour 
The BMW Group assesses the increase in the electric ranges of 
its vehicles from various points of view."
"Our main approach is to 
optimally adapt vehicle ranges to the respective purpose of use 
and user behaviour."
"With this strategy we also take into account 
the environmental impact, as greater range also means deploy-
ing larger and therefore heavier high-voltage batteries."
"This re-
lationship has an effect on resource consumption and the carbon 
footprint of the supply chain as well as the vehicle’s weight and 
therefore its electricity consumption."
"The new all-electric MINI Cooper SE1, which is mainly designed 
for urban use, has a customer-focused range of around 400 kil-
ometres (WLTP2)."
"The new BMW i51 can achieve a range of up 
to 582 km in the statutory WLTP test cycle, depending on factors 
such as equipment and type of motor."
"With offers such as the 
BMW eDrive Zone, attractive electricity tariffs for driving, charg-
ing equipment, the integration of charging in the vehicle app and 
increased ranges, we are helping drivers of plug-in hybrids to 
drive electrically as frequently and over as long a distance as 
possible."
"For instance, the BMW X5 Plug-in-Hybrid1 from the 
compact segment can cover up to 110 kilometres (WLTP2) solely 
on battery power."
"Thinking holistically about electric mobility 
The BMW Group’s electrified vehicles are characterised by their 
high efficiency and low consumption."
"However, the BMW Group 
has greater aspirations:  its vehicles need to be as eco-friendly 
as possible, not only during their locally carbon-free use phase, 
but also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply 
chain and production."
"↗ Carbon Emissions Unlike conventional com-
bustion engine-powered vehicles, the environmental impact of 
battery-powered automobiles lies predominantly in the up-
stream value chain."
"Where the use of natural raw materials to 
manufacture battery cells and the carbon-intensive production of 
batteries make a significant impact."
"It is therefore particularly important to the BMW Group to include 
environmental and social aspects in the production of compo-
nents such as electric motors, high-voltage storage systems and 
battery cells."
"↗ Carbon emissions in the supply chain, ↗ Social and ecological 
responsibility."
"Other approaches to mitigating the environmental 
impacts include increasing the use of recycling and reusing high-
voltage storage units from our BEV and PHEV models in an ap-
propriate manner."
"The BMW Group offers customers who pur-
chase its battery-powered vehicles the option to take back their 
high-voltage batteries free of charge."
"The offer also applies to 
markets where take-back is not mandatory by law."
"Reliable, comprehensive charging opportunities 
An expanded, customer-friendly charging infrastructure will pave 
the way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility."
"With 
the adoption of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation 
(AFIR) in 2023, the EU resolved to set up a basic network of both 
electric charging stations and hydrogen filling stations by the end 
of 2030."
"From the BMW Group’s point of view, this is a first key 
step towards providing a customer-friendly charging infrastruc-
ture."
"The BMW Group remains committed to achieving standard-
ised framework conditions and encourages offers that enable 
customer-friendly charging on a broad basis."

"The aim is to ascertain whether the product is ready for series 
production and to obtain initial customer feedback."
"On the one 
hand, we are focusing on countries where the hydrogen industry 
is developing positively, for example with the establishment of a 
filling station network."
"On the other hand, we are also active in 
areas where the production of preferably green hydrogen and its 
distribution and use in various applications are gaining in im-
portance."
"These areas currently include parts of Europe, Japan, 
South Korea, China, the USA and the Middle East."
"Firstly, the findings from the pilot project are being incorporated

"An important start-
ing point in this endeavour is to close cycles for certain materials 
and components."
"With this objective in mind, the BMW Group re-
turns selected production residues to the supplier, enabling 
those materials to be recovered and reused in a new production 
process."
"At the BMW Group, the circular economy principle (“De-
sign for Circularity”) is already being implemented as an opera-
tional concept in the design of the NEUE KLASSE by the corpo-

Biodiversity 
The BMW Group also takes biodiversity into account at its vari-
ous locations worldwide."
"It assesses biodiversity in the context of 
its plants, using a biodiversity indicator as an example within the 
framework of ecological verification procedures."
"Based on this 
assessment, measures to improve these habitats are then pro-
posed accordingly."
"We are also committed to protecting 
biodiversity in countries where our renewable raw materials are 
grown."
"In Indonesia, for instance, we therefore support local na-
ture conservation initiatives that are dedicated to preserving nat-
ural biodiversity via the “Living Rubber” project."

sources, the purchase of green electricity from Power Purchase 
Agreements and the use of Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g."
"The remaining emissions1 are largely attributable to the use of 
natural gas."
"In this respect, the BMW Group faces the challenge 
of replacing natural gas with non-fossil energy sources such as 
biogas, green hydrogen or green electricity."
"However, the transi-
tion to alternative energy sources depends largely on their avail-
ability, the technical retrofitting of the systems and the political 
framework conditions."
"In this context, clear 
roles – in each case with corresponding responsibilities, targets 
and reporting obligations – are assigned to central strategy de-
partments, regional management units and plants at local level."
"After the persistent restrictions put in place due to the corona-
virus pandemic and the impact of the war in Ukraine, production 
volumes increased again significantly in 2023."
"Due to the asso-
ciated improvement in plant capacity utilisation, specific energy 
consumption in automobile production fell to 1.97 MWh per ve-
hicle produced (2022: 2.13 MWh; -7.5%) for the year under re-
port."
"At 6,380,652 MWh, the total amount of energy consumed 
by the BMW Group during the period under report was higher 
than the previous year due to production volume factors (2022:

across the entire value chain 
The BMW Group is committed to achieve a technically feasible, 
substantial reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in order 
to continue meeting this target for each financial year."
"Further-
more, the BMW Group also supports projects dedicated to de-
carbonisation outside its own value chain."
"We voluntarily back 
these initiatives without them counting towards the the 
BMW Group’s CO2 reduction targets."
"In collaboration with partners such as atmosfair and First Cli-
mate, we support climate protection projects operating in the vol-

Carbon emissions generated by transport logistics 
With its Green Transport Logistics project, the BMW Group has 
been pursuing the aim of continuing emissions-reduced trans-
portation within its global production and sales network since 
2015."
In addition to second-generation biofuels (e.g.
"HVO 100, 
produced from residual and waste materials), battery-powered, 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles have been increasingly de-
ployed for transporting goods at the Group’s main plant in Mu-
nich since 2023."
"For the first time, the use of bio-LNG on public 
roads was tested in Germany to supply production."
"Moreover, 
the BMW Group has been involved in the “H2Haul” research pro-
ject since 2019 and the “HyCET” research project since 2022 in 
order to gain early experience in the use of hydrogen trucks."
"About half of the vehicles produced by the BMW Group leave its 
plants by rail."

"The latter resulted in 
higher costs for the BMW Group, primarily for raw materials, 
semiconductors, energy and transportation."
"The overall supply 
situation also remained challenging in 2023."
"The supply situa-
tion for semiconductors in particular will remain challenging for 
certain technologies in the current financial year."
"↗ Outlook, ↗ Risks 
and Opportunities 
Natural disasters pose an additional risk."
"Extensive flooding in 
Slovenia led to delivery difficulties during the year under report."
"The prospect of climate change and the increasing number of 
extreme weather events are likely to make planning more difficult 
going forward."
"However, the BMW Group is able to mitigate the 
effects of these unexpected events through its flexible supply 
network and thus largely ensure its ability to deliver vehicles."
"To lessen the impact of the war in Ukraine on its European 
plants, since 2022 extensive measures have been in place, and 
therefore continues to source components from western Ukraine."
"At the same time, our partners have established additional pro-
duction sites outside Ukraine."
"As a result of these various 
measures the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has 
largely returned to normal."
"The situation is, however, being mon-
itored continually."
"Expanding resilient supply chains  
During the year under report, the BMW Group was generally able 
to rely on the stability of its supply chains, despite the problems 
caused by geopolitical crises and the availability of critical raw 
materials."
"Price increases on global markets also tended to in-
tensify the tense purchasing situation."
"The BMW Group RiskHub 
plays a key role in making our global supply chains more resilient."
"For example, it helps to identify risks at an earlier stage through 
the use of artificial intelligence (AI)."
"We see the development of 
the Catena-X digital ecosystem as the key to standardised data 
transfers throughout our supplier network."
"The BMW Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com-
ponents close to its production sites, wherever possible."
"We are 
therefore represented by local purchasing teams in all key mar-
kets in order to quickly identify local risks and opportunities and 
respond flexibly to the respective market conditions."
"In the face 
of geostrategic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group’s sup-
ply chains is also becoming increasingly important and the 
BMW Group takes this fact increasingly into account when se-
lecting its partners."

An interconnected risk management system is fundamental for 
managing the supplier network."
"It takes preventative action when 
nominating suppliers, while also reacting quickly in order to iden-
tify 
and 
analyse 
impending 
supply 
bottlenecks."
"The 
BMW Group’s RiskHub analyses information from external, pub-
lic-ly available data sources with regard to potential risks such as 
natural disasters or financial risks."
"We also employ state-of-the-
art methods derived from the fields of AI and big data analytics."
"For selected topics such as the reliable supply of semiconductor 
components, we also take the locations of sub-suppliers into ac-
count when assessing overall risk."
"In order to avoid cyber risks and deal effectively with an increas-
ing number of supplier-related incidents, the BMW Group contin-
ues to rely on supplier certification in accordance with the TISAX 
automotive standard."
"When it comes to purchasing materials 
both directly and indirectly, TISAX is an integral part of the pro-
curement process and an inherent component of contracts with 
suppliers that meet the specific relevance criteria."
"The initiative 
for joint IT security analyses and the regular exchange of infor-
mation via a B2B portal also enable us to make the supplier net-
work more resilient."

"Raw materials security and strategy 
The volatile situation on energy and raw materials markets had 
a major impact on purchasing over the course of 2023."
"The long-
term supply of critical raw materials required for electric mobility 
remains a strategic challenge."
"Measures taken by the 
BMW Group to increase supply security and promote the pro-
curement of raw materials from responsible sources include, 
among other things, sourcing lithium and cobalt directly."
"Further-
more, the BMW Group analyses the development of raw materi-
als prices and hedges against price fluctuations – provided the 
capital market offers the opportunity to do so."
"↗ Raw materials price 
risks and opportunities 
For the BMW Group, the responsible procurement of raw mate-
rials is the result of a holistic approach that takes economic, eco-
logical and social aspects equally into account."
"There are also raw-materials-
specific statements such as the ↗ High Level Commitment for 
sustainable natural rubber."
"Annual risk analyses form the basis for implementing raw-mate-
rials-related preventive and remedial measures to reduce envi-
ronmental and human rights risks."
"Key levers in this respect are 
to forgo, substitute or reduce the use of primary raw materials 
that entail a high level of risk."
"The BMW Group’s secondary raw 
materials strategy is of vital significance in this context: ↗ Circular 
economy, resource efficiency and renewable energy."
"We also focus in par-
ticular on collaborating closely with our partners in the supplier 
network as well as in multistakeholder initiatives and projects."
"We use scientific findings to gain an even better understanding 
of the extraction processes of raw materials and take them into 
account accordingly when analysing the level of risk."
"↗ Lithium 
Study 
Among other things, the BMW Group focuses on the conflict min-
erals tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG) and uses standard-
ised tools of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) to trace raw 
materials back to the smelter."
"We use existing certifications for 
other raw materials."
"The BMW Group is also involved in develop-
ing certified standards for critical stages of the value chain, for 
example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assur-
ance (IRMA), and is engaged in their implementation by suppli-
ers."
"Further details and raw materials profiles are available 
↗ online."
"↗ SASB Index 
Moreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a 
positive impact for selected raw materials through our involve-
ment in local development projects."
"This currently applies to the 
raw materials lithium, mica, cobalt and natural rubber."
"Purchasing battery cells  
As of 2025, the BMW Group plans to deploy a new generation of 
battery cells."
"Against this backdrop, we have concluded contracts 
with our partners that guarantee us annual production capacities 
in Europe, China and the USA."
"We are strategically establishing 
supply chains for battery cells close to our production sites, 
thereby underpinning the “local for local” approach."
"During the 
year under report, we entered into a new partnership in North 
America to make the battery cell supply chain more resilient."
"To strengthen this resilience even further, we plan to anchor the 
upstream value chain for critical components in the respective re-
gions while accounting for geopolitical risks and economic effi-
ciency."
"Through this, the BMW Group also aims to improve its 
resilience in the face of external events while reducing its de-
pendence on geopolitical factors and its exposure to related 
risks."
"Secondary raw materials will be increasingly deployed to cover 
the BMW Group’s cobalt, lithium and nickel requirements, to-
gether with purchased green electricity for the latest generation 
of battery cells."
"Contracts and framework agreements have al-
ready been concluded with suppliers to this end."
"This will help 
further reduce our carbon footprint from the new battery cell in 
the supply chain compared to the previous generation."

In-house production as a strategic competitive advantage 
The BMW Group regularly examines its range of products in 
terms of their profitability and strategic significance."
"The main fo-
cus is being directed at electric mobility, digitalisation and sus-
tainability."
"In these key areas of transformation, the BMW Group 
is expanding its in-house expertise on a targeted and long-term 
basis on matters relating to strategically important components."
"At the same time, in-house production aims to improve both se-
curity of supply and the ability to innovate."
"The benefits of this 
approach have already been seen, for example, with the control 
unit of the high-voltage storage system and scopes of the electric 
drive equipment."
"At the same time, we are looking to strengthen 
our process competencies in technologies relevant for quality 
management and enablement within the supplier network."
"Quality assurance 
Quality is a promise we make to our customers as well as a de-
cisive competitive advantage and an essential factor for the en-
during success of the BMW Group."
"The quality management sys-
tem is the basis for continuously improving the quality of our 
products, processes and services."
"It consists of an intercon-
nected, comprehensive system that encompasses the entire 
product development process, industrialisation and series pro-
duction with respect to both in-house production and the supplier 
network."
"The various steps are supported based on need by our 
teams of quality experts when necessary."
"The ultimate aim is to 
ensure – both preventatively and systematically – that all quality 
requirements are met at all times."
"Innovations 
Collaboration with technology partners and the establishment of 
new networks enables us to implement innovations in our vehi-
cles within a very short time."
"In this context, we work closely with 
the ↗ BMW Startup Garage and ↗ BMW i Ventures."
"The specialist teams cooperate in technology clusters to sharpen 
the focus on innovation screening, which is implemented through 
strategic supplier dialogue formats (Future Vision DeepDive) and 
other means."
"Findings from the supplier network are systemati-
cally processed within the technology clusters."
"Catena-X is the pioneering initiative within the automotive indus-
try for digitalising the supply and value chains between automo-
bile manufacturers, suppliers, sub-suppliers and, in the future, 
recycling companies."
"The digital platform enables partners 
within value chains to tackle key challenges facing the industry, 
such as enhancing resilience, meeting sustainability goals and 
regulatory matters through digital collaboration."
"After two years 
of development work, including a significant contribution from the 
BMW Group as consortium leader, a beta test phase was suc-
cessfully conducted in 2023."
"Among other things, pilot projects 
were carried out in conjunction with BMW component produc-
tion, providing valuable insights that will serve to promote inno-
vative data processing methods in a production environment."
Catena-X has been in the rollout phase since October 2023.
"The BMW Group is focusing mainly on component traceability 
along multistage supply chains, cooperative root cause analysis 
to combat any potential quality problems and the collection of 
carbon-emissions-related data in the supply chains."
"In 2024, ef-
forts will be scaled up with suppliers with the aim of further im-
plementing and developing additional “use cases” as well as 
scaling these for strategic relevant components through the in-
dustry network."
"Another key advancement is the provision of dig-
ital product passports, which contain product-specific data for 
components such as batteries or even for entire vehicles."
"Based 
on information from the n-tier supply chain via Catena-X, data 
are available in particular regarding origin, material composition 
and recycling."
"Social and environmental responsibility 
The BMW Group views responsible supply chain management 
as an integral part of good corporate governance The develop-
ment of established processes was continued throughout the 
year under report."
"The BMW Group’s requirements and the ex-
pectations it places on its suppliers are set out in the ↗ BMW Group

"Due diligence in the supplier network  
Our corporate responsibility for environmental and social stand-
ards in the supply chain is institutionalised as part of a multi-
stage due diligence process."
"We mainly use standardised control 
procedures to carry out the due diligence obligations incorpo-
rated in our business processes."
"The BMW Group also cooper-
ates with initiatives and associations such as the Responsible

"We also remain committed to establishing an 
industry-wide complaints mechanism, among other things."
"― 
Risk analysis  
The BMW Group monitors and assesses the sustainability risks 
in its supplier network in business relationships at both potential 
and active supplier locations."
"In order to identify and assess ab-
stract environmental and human rights risks, various internal and 
external data sources such as country- and product-group-spe-
cific indicators as well as media analyses at Group and location 
level are drawn upon."
"The BMW Group uses standardised sus-
tainability surveys and commissions external on-site audits (as-
sessments) to conduct in-depth risk analyses for its Tier 1 sup-
pliers."
"Supply chain mapping forms the basis for analysing risks 
at n-Tier suppliers."
"The BMW Group continuously endeavours to 
increase transparency along the entire supply chain."
"Our 
suppliers are also required to request these from their subcon-
tractors based on their respective risks."
"The measures, which are 
queried, validated and evaluated as part of the sourcing process 
using the industry-wide questionnaire from ↗ Drive Sustainability, 
serve to minimise potential risks or eliminate existing deficien-
cies."
"↗ Further GRI information, ↗ Sustainability assessment of relevant 
supplier locations This online assessment is performed for suppliers 
of production-related goods and services with a contract volume 
over a certain threshold."
"Different modules are used depending 
on the size of the company being assessed."
"Implementation 
must be successfully completed prior to the start of production."
"For suppliers of non-production-related goods and services, this 
procedure is also carried out depending on country- and product-
group-specific risks."
"The extent of the preventive measures is 
based on the potential risks, the nature and scope of the busi-
ness activity and the size of the supplier."
"In addition, we offer 
training courses on sustainability in the supply chain, some of 
which are mandatory for internal purchasers."
"These trainings 
also address process partners and suppliers on a voluntary ba-
sis."
"The BMW Group has put additional control mechanisms in place 
for suppliers in high-risk regions or high-risk product groups."
"Key 
instruments in this respect are audits of environmental and social 
standards at supplier locations using cross-industry assessment 
programmes provided by the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA) and the Responsible Supply Chain Initiative (RSCI) of the 
VDA."
"The BMW Group reviewed a total of 95 potential and active 
supplier locations using this method during the reporting year 
(2022: 49)."
"The BMW Group has set itself the goal that all Tier 1 
supplier sites that have been assessed meet the locally applica-
ble statutory requirements for sustainability as well as interna-
tional human rights standards (BMW Group minimum require-
ments)."
"In two cases, the closure as-
sessment carried out was not immediately able to confirm that 
the agreed measures had been implemented."
"However, together 
with the suppliers the BMW Group has now implemented these 
measures, which will be reviewed by means of a new assess-
ment in 2024."

Effectiveness and complaint mechanisms 
Information on possible violations of the BMW Group’s sustaina-
bility requirements in the supplier network can be submitted via 
the BMW Group Human Rights Contact Supply Chain, among 
other options."
"We also use the standardised RBA Voices com-
plaint mechanism as a complementary measure."
"Moreover, 
whistle-blower systems are in place to detect and report possible 
statutory violations."
"Our aim is to ensure that all substantiated 
reports of environmental or human rights violations are rectified 
by agreeing on remediation measures."
"Further information on 
whistle-blower systems at the BMW Group can be found in the 
chapter ↗ Compliance and Human Rights and on the ↗ website."
"If necessary, the BMW Group temporarily suspends a given busi-
ness relationship during efforts to mitigate the detected risk."
"However, the business relationship will only be terminated if no 
other effective means are available and we are unable to further 
leverage our ability to exert influence."
"We endeavour to avoid this 
latter situation by carefully selecting our suppliers and empower-
ing and working with them to improve their sustainability perfor-
mance."

Carbon emissions in the supply chain 
The BMW Group aims to actively promote decarbonisation in its 
own supply chain and ↗ reduce carbon emissions along the entire value 
chain."
"For this reason, one of our sourcing criteria requires that 
suppliers commit to undertaking decarbonisation measures."
"1 We 
specifically enable our suppliers with online training via the 
BMW Group Partner Academy and additionally provide face-to-
face formats for partner workshops at the BMW Group plant in 
Landshut (Germany) as well as other locations."
"↗ GRI Index: 3-3 
In 2023, the number of contractual agreements with suppliers 
that specified decarbonisation measures rose to 707 (2022: 
468), Including those specifying the use of secondary raw mate-
rials, biomaterials and carbon-reduced steel."
"In our view, how-
ever, the use of green electricity has the greatest impact on de-
carbonising the supply chain2."
"Accordingly, the BMW Group 
specifies its use by direct suppliers (Tier 1) and for energy-inten-
sive processes in the upstream supply chain (n-Tier) as a crite-
rion for awarding new contracts to supply carbon-intensive com-
ponents and materials."
"During the year under report, we con-
cluded agreements of this kind for 676 contracts (2022: 343 
contracts)."
"In addition, since mid-2021 the BMW Group has con-
cluded numerous framework agreements with suppliers regard-
ing the use of green electricity.2 In 2023, the BMW Group had 72 
valid green electricity framework agreements in place with its 
largest suppliers (2022: 46)."
"During the year under report, we 
developed an approach to review suppliers’ concepts for the use 
of green electricity even prior to series production."
"Furthermore, we continue to engage an external service provider 
to carry out annual reviews relating to decarbonisation measures 
in series production."
"In the course of 2023, the BMW Group re-
viewed compliance with contractually agreed decarbonisation 
measures in the supply chain at 72 suppliers (2022: 23)."
"As a 
result, the BMW Group reduced the volume of carbon emissions 
generated in the supply chain by around 1.7 million t CO2e during 
the reporting period."
"In 2023, carbon emissions generated in the 
supply chain and via logistics on behalf of the BMW Group world-
wide averaged 13.9 t CO2e per vehicle produced (t CO2e)3."
"As ex-
pected, the gradual electrification of the fleet leads to a rise in 
emissions generated in the supply chain."
"We assume that the 
current upward trend will reverse by 2026 at the latest thanks to 
the implementation of carbon-reducing measures."
"We continue to rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Sup-
ply Chain Programme to assess the performance of the supply 
chain in terms of its decarbonisation."
"This helps suppliers to de-
fine their decarbonisation targets, integrate these into their busi-
ness processes and report on the actual reductions achieved."
"Their efforts are linked to a rating from which we derive measures 
for supplier development and empowerment."
"In 2023, 282 sup-
pliers took part in the rating (84% of the production-relevant pur-
chasing volume)."
"1 The BMW Group includes measures that reduce carbon emissions, such as the use of green elec-
tricity, the use of secondary raw materials, new manufacturing processes for raw materials, and 
product and material innovations such as biomaterials."
"Accordingly, compensation measures are 
not included."

opment of digital skills across the Company with the “Digital 
Boost” training campaign."
"Further training measures in the re-
porting year also focused on the future-oriented fields of electrics 
and electronics, data analytics, artificial intelligence, innovative 
production technologies and new working methods."
"The progress of our Company-wide qualification measures is 
also reflected in the number of participants* which, at around 1.4 
million, was significantly higher than the previous year (2022: 1 
million)."
"The number of training hours per employee also in-
creased in 2023 to an average of 23.7 hours (2022: 21.6)."

"↗ GRI Index: 404-1, 404-2 
* The number of participants takes into account the fact that there are employees who attended 
several training events within the reporting year."
"The 
basis for this is the vocational training approach that has grown 
over the years, the opportunities to pursue a dual study pro-
gramme and other student development programmes."
"Specifically, we offer young people approximately 30 apprentice-
ships and 20 dual study programmes at 20 training locations 
and 20 branches worldwide, in order to prepare them for their 
future career at the BMW Group."
"The focus is on the future topics 
of electrification, digitalisation, automation and sustainability."

"↗ Dialogue with 
Stakeholders 
The BMW Group measures the general mood in the workforce 
and the performance of the organisation every two years as part 
of a Company-wide employee survey*."
"This is measured using 
the “High Performance Organisation Index” (HPO-I)."
"In the sur-
vey in autumn 2023, the participation rate was higher than ever 
before at 84%."
"At the same time, the HPO-I improved again 
when compared to the last survey in 2021."
"88% of the workforce 
would recommend the BMW Group as an employer."
"86% of em-
ployees were convinced by the strategy of integrating sustain-
ability and setting ambitious targets in this respect."
"They also 
signalled a high level of willingness and motivation to play an ac-
tive role in this process, This contributes significantly to the fact 
that approximately 85% of respondents are optimistic about the 
future of the BMW Group."
"The topic of Compliance also scores 
well among the workforce, with 88% approval."
"Despite progress 
compared to the last survey, employees identified room for im-
provement in the optimisation of processes."
"The results of the 
survey will form the basis for concrete measures that are sched-
uled for implementation by mid-2024."
"Employees also have a central opportunity to participate through 
idea management, which allows employees to contribute ideas 
outside of their area of responsibility."
"If the proposals have a pos-
itive impact on the BMW Group in terms of efficiency or sustain-
ability, they will be honoured accordingly."
"In 2023, numerous 
employees submitted a total of 5,470 ideas (2022: 5,028)."
"At 
the same time, a total of 1,267 ideas (2022: 1,188) were imple-
mented, resulting in first-year benefits totalling € 52.0 million 
(2022: € 20.5 million)."

"It is important to the BMW Group that all employees have access 
to the Company’s own health services."
"In Germany, these ser-
vices focus on providing acute care to employees and temporary

One of the ways in which the Company measures the success of 
health management is by its sickness rate, which at 3.8% at 
BMW AG was below the previous year (2022: 4.2%)."
"The 
sickness rate in Germany remained at a high level until the mid-
dle of 2023 and normalised over the course of the year."

geted measures in accordance with our “Attendance Manage-
ment Works Agreement” (BAM) and the relevant health manage-
ment initiatives."

"Increasing the share of women 
The BMW Group is working continuously to increase the share of 
women in the workforce as a whole, and in management func-
tions, in particular."
"This remains a challenging task in that it is still 
the case that more men go through the process of vocational 
training, particularly in technical fields, and are, therefore, in the 
majority on the labour market."
"The BMW Group has set targets for the percentage share of 
women at all levels of the Company."
"By 2025, we aim to increase 
the share of women in the BMW Group workforce as a whole to 
between 20 and 22% and to between 17 to 19% for BMW AG."

with the UN Alliance of Civilizations and supports selected organ-
isations around the world that are engaged in concrete projects

Responsible Leadership for sustainable development 
The BMW Group wants to support and bring together people 
who are committed to societal needs."

World Summit represents an international networking oppor-
tunity."

managers to the global forum for sustainable development since 
2016, including in 2023."
"Selected IIH organisations also had the 
opportunity to take part in the international event."

citizenship strategy at the local level, for example, through men-
toring and internship opportunities directly at our locations."
"― 
Culture and Sports for a united world

ships, we also contribute, for example, through the scholarship 
programme of the ↗ Evans Scholars Foundation in conjunction with 
the BMW Championships golf tournament."

port social issues around the world in various ways through its 
SOCIAL DRIVE initiative."
"The first pillar is the annual BMW Group 
AWARD for social commitment, which has recognised the out-
standing commitment of individual employees for 12 years."
"Of 
the ten finalists in 2023, four emerged as winners – one of whom 
also won the special Doppelfeld Foundation prize."
"The prize 
money of € 10,000 each will be used to fund the relevant charity 
projects."
"The second pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE IT platform, 
which informs employees about specific support needs."
"The 
platform launched in Germany in 2022 and is currently being 
rolled out internationally."
"With our employees’ help, we can also 
provide more comprehensive support for existing projects, for ex-
ample through volunteer work and monetary donations."
"The 
third pillar is the SOCIAL DRIVE DAYS, which are intended to 
strengthen our employees’ interest in social commitment."

tance in the form of knowledge transfer, networking opportuni-
ties, projects to promote public infrastructure, and the engage-
ment of its own workforce."
"We also generate additional societal 
impact through memberships in associations and institutions, 
the provision of vehicles, including for vocational schools, and 
participation in projects aimed at promoting more sustainable 
mobility in cities."
"↗ Shaping the future of mobility In doing so, we aim 
to contribute as corporate citizens and play our part in address-
ing major future questions and challenges."
"In line with the 
Group’s performance management, the outlook covers a period 
of one year."
"Short-term risks and opportunities are managed on 
the basis of a two-year assessment period."
"In addition, we report 
on medium- and long-term risks and opportunities arising in con-
nection with climate change."
"The continuous forecasting process applied within the 
BMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take advantage 
of opportunities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to 
any unexpected risks."
"The principal ↗ Risks and Opportunities are de-
scribed in detail in the section of the same name and concern all 
performance indicators."
"Actual outcomes may, however, deviate 
from the outlook due to unexpected events."
"Economic outlook 
The International Monetary Fund anticipates global growth of 
3.1% in 2024."
"Geopolitical conflicts and the effects of tighter 
monetary policy in many countries will be the greatest burdens 
on the global economy in 2024."
"Higher interest rates are affect-
ing consumer spending and investment, with a corresponding ef-
fect on the economy."
"Further information on political and global 
economic risks is also available in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities sec-
tion."
"Forecasts for the eurozone as a whole indicate slight growth 
(+0.6%)."
"France (+0.7%), Italy (+0.5%) and Spain (+1.6%) are 
expected to meet or outstrip the average for the eurozone."
"Ger-
many is expected to record at least a slight increase in economic 
output in 2024 (+0.3%), although the continued modest growth 
in the global economy is dampening the country’s export econ-
omy."
"A slight uptick in economic output (+0.4%) is forecast for the UK, 
where higher interest rates and continued higher inflation are 
slowing growth."
The growth rate in the USA is expected to slow to 1.8% in 2024.
"Higher interest rates are burdening companies and private 
households in that country as well, while continually low unem-
ployment levels are supporting the economy."
"Growth is expected to reach 4.6% in China, where continued up-
heaval in the real estate sector and the resulting drop in con-
sumer confidence are dampening expectations."
"The Japanese economy is expected to see slower growth in 
2024 than in the previous year (+0.8%)."
"Currency markets and international interest rate 
environment 
Currencies of particular importance for the international opera-
tions of the BMW Group are the Chinese renminbi, the British 
pound, the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the South Korean 
won."
"It is expected that inflation in the US and in Europe will continue 
to fall, and the BMW Group therefore does not expect any further 
interest rate hikes from central banks."
"Accordingly, the US dollar 
is expected to move sideways against the euro in 2024, with the 
pound/euro exchange rate also expected to remain stable."
"It is possible that Japan’s highly expansionary monetary policy 
may come to an end in 2024."
"If it does, the yen would appreciate 
somewhat against the euro compared to its current very low 
level."
"Low inflation in China could lead to a more expansionary mone-
tary policy on the part of the central bank of China, potentially 
resulting in a depreciation of the renminbi against the euro."
"The currencies of emerging countries such as India and Brazil 
may benefit from the monetary policies of the EU and USA sta-
bilising in 2024."
"No further devaluations against the euro and US 
dollar are therefore expected at present."
"International automobile markets 
The generally stable macroeconomic conditions should allow for 
slight growth on international automobile markets in 2024 
(+ 3.9%)."
"Growth is expected to be spread across many mar-
kets, particularly the US and China."
"A higher global supply of new 
vehicles is, however, expected to give rise to increasing price 
competition, which will also have an effect on prices for pre-
owned vehicles."
"International motorcycle markets 
The BMW Group expects the world’s motorcycle markets in the 
500 cc plus class to remain in line with the previous year overall 
in 2024."
"In Europe, market growth is also expected to be in line 
with last year's level, with a slight decrease forecast in the USA."
"Economic expectations will influence the motorcycle market in 
China, while the motorcycle market in Brazil is expected to re-
main in a stable condition in 2024, as in the previous year."
"A challenging competitive en-
vironment and macroeconomic and geopolitical developments 
could all have a significant impact on business performance."
"The 
close cooperation between our sales network and our production 
network and our flexible vehicle architecture allow us to respond 
to even unforeseeable developments effectively."
"↗ Risks and 
Opportunities 
Assumptions used in the outlook 
The outlook contains forward-looking statements based on the 
BMW Group’s expectations and assessments and may be influ-
enced by unforeseeable events."
"As a result, actual outcomes can 
deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations de-
scribed below due to changes in the political and economic envi-
ronment as well as other factors."
"The following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is 
based on the composition of the BMW Group during that time."
"The outlook takes account of all information available at the time 
of reporting that could have an impact on the BMW Group’s  
performance."
"The expectations contained in the outlook are based on the 
BMW Group’s forecast for 2024 and reflect its status at the time 
of preparation of the Group Financial Statements."
"The basis for 
the preparation of and the principal assumptions used in the 
forecasts – which consider the consensual opinions of leading 
organisations, such as economic research institutes and banks – 
are set out below."
"The BMW Group’s outlook takes account of 
these assumptions."
"It is expected that a fall in inflation and stabilised interest rates in 
many countries will allow for a slight increase in demand in 2024."
"The number of vehicle deliveries is set to increase slightly against 
this backdrop and in light of the full availability of new models 
such as the BMW 7 Series and the BMW 5 Series, model 
launches such as the BMW X2 and BMW X3, and the renewal of 
the MINI product range."
"Pricing across the product portfolio is ex-
pected to remain at prior year’s level."
"The BMW Group anticipates an improved situation on the com-
modity markets in 2024 in light of the downward price trend for 
precious metals and battery materials in the second half of 2023."
"The continued rise in all-electric and electrified vehicle numbers 
does, however, mean that expenditure will remain at a high level."
"Higher costs for employees are expected in 2024, along with 
higher costs from the supply chain, owing to high inflation in pre-
vious years."
"In addition, the continued implementation of the electrification 
and digitalisation strategy will lead to greater research and de-
velopment costs in 2024."
"Expenditure related to the NEUE 
KLASSE, such as the further development of the sixth generation 
of battery technology and manufacturing preparations in the pro-
duction network, will also impact the Group’s earnings and result 
in greater capital expenditure."
"The situation in the Middle East became increasingly volatile at 
the end of 2023."
"The conflict between Israel and Palestine is not 
having a significant effect on the BMW Group’s business at pre-
sent as the Group does not operate directly in that region."
"How-
ever, it must be assumed that the threat posed in the Red Sea by 
the Houthi militia will cause some logistical challenges in 2024."
"Our outlook does not account for any further escalation of the sit-
uation."
The BMW Group is monitoring developments.
"The war in Ukraine and its potential implications for the 
BMW Group’s course of business are also being closely moni-
tored."
"All applicable restrictions resulting from sanctions have 
been factored into the outlook."
"In view of the growing unpredictability of political developments, 
actual macroeconomic and geopolitical developments in some 
regions may deviate from expected trends and outcomes."
"Poten-
tial sources of political uncertainty include policies affecting trade 
and customs tariffs, security developments and a possible wors-
ening of international trade conflicts."
"Outlook for the BMW Group – key performance indicators 
Deliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand vehicles in the 
Automotive segment are expected to rise slightly year-on-year 
due to a slight increase in demand, full availability of new models 
and model launches."
"In this context, the share of all-electric ve-
hicles relative to total deliveries is expected to increase signifi-
cantly compared to 2023."
"An EBIT margin of between 8 and 10% is forecast for the Auto-
motive segment in 2024."
"The RoCE for the Automotive segment 
is also being affected by the increasing investment in electrifica-
tion and digitalisation, and expected to be between 15 and 20%."
"The BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly reducing 
the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet by 
further improving the overall fuel consumption of its products and 
deploying an increasing number of vehicles with electric 
drivetrain systems."
"It is therefore expected that we will continue 
to remain significantly under the legal limits."
"A moderate reduction is expected in carbon emissions from 
BMW Group plants per vehicle produced (Scope 1 and 2) due to 
increased production volumes and BMW making greater use of 
green energy."
"The EBIT margin is expected to be between 8% and 
10% and the segment RoCE between 21% and 26%."
"The RoE in the Financial Services segment is predicted to finish 
between 14% and 17%."
"As expected, the supply of and demand 
for pre-owned vehicles is continuing to stabilise."
"It is therefore to 
be expected that revenues from remarketing lease returns will fall 
further as compared to 2023."
Group profit before tax will decrease slightly.
"As the BMW Group 
continues to take a leading role among its competitors in the dig-
italisation and electrification of the vehicle fleet and intends to 
strengthen this position, expenses associated with future pro-
jects will remain high in the Automotive segment in 2024."
"The 
production network will also be expanded in 2024 in connection 
with the NEUE KLASSE."
"The decrease in the financial services 
business will also contribute to the fall in Group profit before tax."
"The aforementioned targets are to be met with a slight growth in 
the size of the workforce."
"Likewise, the share of women in man-
agement positions in the BMW Group is expected to increase 
slightly."
"The BMW Group’s actual business performance may also devi-
ate from current expectations due to the risks and opportunities 
discussed below in the ↗ Risks and Opportunities section."
2 Including an allowance for eco-innovations (amounts of minor significance).
3 Efficiency ratio calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions (i.e.
"research 
centres, sales centres, offices) divided by the number of vehicles produced (BMW Group manufacturing sites and partner plants, but excluding contract manufacturers)."
"The Risk Management System (RMS) comprises the entire set of 
organisational rules and measures in place to identify, assess, 
manage and communicate risks, including system monitoring."
"↗ Risk and Opportunity Management 
The ICS (in the narrower sense), the RMS and the CMS are au-
dited independently on a risk-oriented basis by Internal Audit as 
part of the “Three Lines” model, with all systems interconnected 
by overarching structural elements."
"Internal Audit’s findings are 
reported to the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board on a regular basis."
"The design and implementation of the internal control system 
and the risk management system take into account the size, 
structure and complexity of the BMW Group in particular."
"These 
systems are intended to detect, manage and mitigate significant 
risks."
"However, despite the comprehensive analysis of risks in 
general, any control and risk management system has inherent 
limitations."
"For this reason, the occurrence of risks cannot be 
ruled out in all circumstances."
"Taking this into account, the Board of Management is not aware 
of any circumstances that give rise to doubts regarding the ap-
propriateness and effectiveness of the systems."
"In particular, no 
material cases of non-compliance or systemic weakness were 
identified that preclude such appropriateness and effectiveness."
"* The information provided in this section is extraneous to management reports which are not cov-
ered by PwC’s audit."
"This 
is based on an effective risk and opportunity management strat-
egy, which puts us in a position to be able to react quickly and 
flexibly to changes in political, economic, environmental, social, 
technical or legal conditions."
"The general risk situation is regu-
larly evaluated as part of this."
"The aim of our risk management system (RMS) is to identify, 
measure and actively manage risks, both individual and cumula-
tive, that could pose a threat to the success of the business."
"Risks and opportunities (including risks to reputation and cli-
mate-related risks) are considered for the current and subse-
quent financial year."
"↗ Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities In 
addition, medium-term and long-term risks and opportunities 
are also presented in connection with climate change."
"↗ Climate-
Related Risks and Opportunities 
Organisation of risk management 
Risk management is organised as a decentralised, Group-wide 
network and steered by a centralised risk management function."
"The various BMW Group divisions are represented by Network 
Representatives."
"We draw on the expertise of climate experts in 
order to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities."
"The re-
sponsibilities and tasks of the centralised risk management func-
tion, Network Representatives and climate experts are docu-
mented and accepted."
"All material risks are firstly presented for 
review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is 
chaired by Group Controlling."
"Any material risks are then re-
ported to both the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board’s Audit Committee."
"Other functions such as Group Compliance and the Internal Con-
trol System (ICS) form key interfaces to the risk management 
system."
"In its capacity as an independent control body, Corporate 
Audit reviews the RMS established by the Board of Management 
on an annual basis."
"The key elements of the risk management pro-
cesses and an appropriate risk culture are embedded in the 
BMW  Group’s core values, the Group’s extensive rules and reg-
ulations on risk management and in its overall risk strategy."
"Fur-
thermore, the BMW Group’s risk management strategy is contin-
ually being refined in order to reflect new findings and require-
ments."
"Training programmes and informational events are reg-
ularly conducted throughout the BMW Group, particularly within 
the risk management network."
"The risk management process is applicable across the entire 
Group and comprises the early identification, analysis and eval-
uation of risks, the use of appropriate risk management tools and 
the monitoring and assessment of the measures taken."
"If no spe-
cific reference is made, risks and opportunities relate to the Au-
tomotive segment."
"Risk Evaluation 
The BMW Group uses standardised, suitable methods for meas-
uring all short-term risks, reputational risks and medium to long-
term climate-related risks."
"Short-term risks 
Risks relating to the current and subsequent financial year are 
shown in the section ↗ Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities."
"These risks are evaluated using value-at-risk models and as-
sessed on the basis of uniform loss distribution metrics, thereby 
enabling better comparability of risks for both internal and exter-
nal reporting purposes."
"Risks are evaluated net of any effective 
risk mitigation measures (net basis)."
"The earnings impact may be significantly higher if the risk actu-
ally materialises (worst-case scenario, confidence level: 99%)."
"The impact of risks and opportunities is presented separately 
without offsetting against each other."
"Group-wide effects and trends can be identified by aggregating 
all material short-term risks at Group level."
"For this purpose, the 
potential earnings impact of the risks is aggregated, taking cor-
relation effects into account."
"In order to assess the risk-bearing 
capacity of the BMW Group, the aggregated amount of risks is 
compared with the risk cover amount (the equity of the 
BMW Group recognised for accounting purposes)."
"A limit system 
for various risks helps monitor the risk-bearing capacity."
"Reputational risks 
Quite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have 
an impact on the BMW Group’s reputation."
"For these purposes, 
the BMW Group assesses all material risks with regard to their 
impact on its reputation using a scoring model."
"Moreover, other 
overarching topics are monitored by means of regular media 
analysis."
"Any material reputational repercussions are described 
in the section ↗ Material Short-Term Risks and Opportunities."
"Climate-related risks 
Risks associated with climate change are presented in the sec-
tion ↗ Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities."
"Climate-related risks are 
evaluated as physical and transitory risks in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Finan-
cial Disclosures (TCFD)."
"Transitory risks arise from the transition 
to a low-carbon economy and are evaluated with the help of cli-
mate-related risk drivers and qualitative expert assessments."
"Physical risks arise due to climate change and are evaluated us-
ing external data on potential natural hazards."
"Potential short-
term impacts of climate change are already included in the short-
term risks."
"All short-term risks are evaluated for their climate im-
pact."
"If a risk is categorised as climate-relevant, the climate-re-
lated portion of the risk is determined."
"The potential development 
of climate-related risks is evaluated for two reporting periods 
(medium-term until 2035 and long-term until 2050) and for 
three global warming scenarios."
"Non-financial risks as reported in the non-financial 
statement (NFS) 
Alongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk 
management, sustainability constitutes a core strategic principle 
of the BMW Group."
"Risks resulting from sustainability issues are 
generally identified via the Group-wide risk management 
network."
"In accordance with § 289c of the German Commercial Code 
(HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non-financial as-
pects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part 
of the reporting process."
"Material risks in this context are defined 
as those stemming from business activities, business relation-
ships and products and services provided by the BMW Group 
that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact."
"No ma-
terial non-financial risks were identified during the reporting year."
"Opportunity management 
Identifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW Group’s 
strategic planning process."
"The Group’s range of products and 
services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses."
"The continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict 
cost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of 
profitability and returns on capital employed."
"The importance of short-term opportunities for the BMW Group 
is classified on a qualitative basis in the categories “material” and 
“immaterial”."
"Probable measures aimed at increasing profitabil-
ity are already incorporated in the outlook."
"Climate-related opportunities are identified progressively as part 
of the strategy development process and described in the section 
↗ Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities."
"Consistently high inflation with high interest rates and lower real 
incomes along with a corresponding widespread drop in demand 
may have a negative impact on sales volumes and result in un-
favourable price and product mix effects."
"A prolonged war be-
tween Russia and Ukraine as well as further escalation of the 
conflict in the Middle East could also significantly strain the global 
economy."
"The present fragility of the Chinese economy poses an 
extra risk to sales."
"On balance, neither the Board of Management nor the Supervi-
sory Board see any threat to the BMW Group’s status as a going 
concern at the balance sheet date or at the date on which the 
Group Financial Statements were drawn up."
"As in the previous 
year, the current set of risks to the BMW Group are considered to 
be manageable."
"All risks and opportunities that are expected to 
materialise have already been addressed in the Outlook Report 
as well as in the long-term corporate planning and are accord-
ingly not included in the risk and opportunity assessment below."
"Liquidity requirements are currently covered by existing liquidity 
as well as the various financing instruments available."
"The following sections illustrate potential future developments or 
events that could result in a negative (risk) or a positive (oppor-
tunity) deviation from the outlook for 2024 and 2025 and indi-
cate their significance to the BMW Group."
"In addition, unforeseen events could affect business operations 
and hence the BMW Group’s results of operations, financial po-
sition and net assets as well as its reputation."
"Macroeconomic risks and opportunities 
Economic conditions have an impact on business performance 
and hence on the level of earnings generated by the BMW Group."
"Unforeseen disruptions in global economic relations can have 
highly unpredictable effects."
"The level of risk continues to be 
classified as high."
"With regard to the war in Ukraine, there is a risk of a further es-
calation of the conflict and therefore of further sanctions imposed 
by Western countries on Russia as well as possible counter-
sanctions and/or retaliatory measures by Russia."
"Withdrawal of 
US support for Ukraine could have major ramifications for the 
course of the war."
"Further escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could nega-
tively impact the price of oil, which in turn could lead to rising in-
flation rates."
"In the trade war between the US and China, the focus is currently 
shifting from simple tariff increases to further import and export 
restrictions on specific technologies."
"This could also lead to less 
favourable import and export conditions for the BMW Group."
"An escalation of the conflict 
could have negative consequences for trade between Europe 
and China, resulting in both sales risks and risks in the supply 
chain."
Another risk is of recession in Europe and the United States.
"In 
both regions, interest rates were raised considerably in order to 
curb inflation."
"Inflation rates have significantly decreased by this 
point and the majority of economies have continued to grow de-
spite the interest rate hikes – labour markets have shown partic-
ular resilience."
"However, monetary policy measures such as in-
terest rate hikes often take effect with some delay and could 
therefore slow down the economy in 2024, posing a risk to sales."
"The present fragility of the Chinese economy also represents a 
risk to sales."
"If the situation in the real estate sector were to de-
teriorate further, the potential impacts on the economy would be 
significantly felt."
"To mitigate the effects, sales markets are being monitored on an 
ongoing basis, and individual measures are being defined by 
standardised processes and committees."
"At the moment, macroeconomic opportunities that could influ-
ence the earnings situation of the BMW Group positively in the 
long term are rather unlikely to materialise."
"If significantly more 
positive economic development were to occur in a market due to 
stronger fiscal or monetary policy measures, this could certainly 
have a positive impact."
"Country- and sector-specific trade barriers can also be subject to 
change at short notice."
"Any tightening up of regulations could ne-
cessitate significantly increased investments and costs, influence 
customer behaviour, and lead to interruptions in supply."
"The risk 
is categorised as high."
"The BMW Group is seeing increasingly stringent vehicle emis-
sions regulations for conventional drive systems."
"In December 
2023, a political deal was reached in the EU on the Euro 7 reg-
ulation."
"Risks may arise from the details of the regulation still to 
be finalised by the European Commission."
"In addition to pollutant 
emissions, brake particle emissions, tyre abrasion and high-volt-
age battery durability (BEV, PHEV) are also being regulated for 
the first time."
"Following the implementation of Euro 7, additional 
targeted tightening measures are anticipated around 2030."
"The legally required fleet-wide carbon emissions target in the EU 
has been reduced to 0 g/km for 2035, thus requiring complete 
electrification of the passenger car new vehicle fleet by 2035."
"Moreover, the European Commission is working on a proposal to 
determine if and how vehicles powered exclusively by e-fuels can 
be recognised as zero-emission vehicles."
"In 2026, a review will 
take place during which the necessary framework conditions to 
achieve the zero emissions target in 2035 will be analysed."
"Risks 
can arise from the availability of renewable energies, inadequate 
private and public charging infrastructure as well as limited ac-
cess to resources for the construction of electric drives."
"A discus-
sion of consumption values and carbon emissions may have an 
impact on the Company’s reputation."
"Changes in trade policies could also have a positive impact on 
the BMW Group’s earnings in the short to medium term."
"Any re-
duction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise duties 
could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and 
services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices."
"Op-
portunities potentially arising from changes in legislation and 
regulations are classified as immaterial."
"Market developments 
The constant change in consumer preferences or an altered 
brand perception pose both risks and opportunities."
"For instance, 
the BMW Group could be confronted with short-term disruptions 
in both supply and demand during the transition from conven-
tionally powered vehicles to alternative drive systems."
"The likeli-
hood of market risks occurring may be categorised as high."
"Opportunities arising as a result are classified 
as immaterial."
"Risks and opportunities relating to production and technologies 
Plant downtime is the main risk affecting production."
"Disruptions 
to production can have various causes, including equipment and 
tool shortages, supplier bottlenecks, scarcity or shortages of pro-
duction resources such as gas or electricity, as well as problems 
with logistics."
"Furthermore, IT disruptions caused by cyber- 
attacks, for example, are playing an increasingly significant role 
in disruptions to the supply chain and production."
"Damage to the 
factory infrastructure, caused by fire or natural events such as 
hail, storms or heavy rainfall, can lead to production downtime."
The risk level for the occurrence of such risks is assessed as high.
"All BMW Group plants have implemented measures for risk 
avoidance and reduction."
"These include, for example, predictive 
maintenance."
"The risk of production downtime due to parts sup-
ply is reduced via measures related to logistics, purchasing and 
the use of the production network."
"A variety of measures are also being taken to prevent and coun-
teract longer downtimes of manufacturing equipment due to tar-
geted cyberattacks."
"Potential natural hazards are already taken into account when 
selecting a site and through the implementation of measures 
during construction."
"The risk posed by natural hazards or fire is 
reduced by the use of on-site fire services and employee training."
"Risks resulting from property-related damage and damage due 
to downtime, as well as transport damage to vehicles already 
manufactured, are transferred to highly solvent insurance com-
panies."
"Due to the volatility of the international insurance mar-
kets, the BMW Group itself bears significant risks today."
"This so-
lution may become increasingly relevant if premiums and de-
ductibles continue to rise."
"This, 
along with a delayed start of production for new models, could 
lead to sales losses."
"Numerous control points have been imple-
mented as part of the homologation process in order to identify 
and mitigate risks."
Product recalls can lead to additional costs.
"The BMW Group es-
tablishes appropriate provisions for statutory and non-statutory 
warranty obligations."
"It cannot be ruled out, however, that addi-
tional costs could be incurred that are either not covered or not 
fully covered by these provisions."
"Despite the deployment of 
thorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always 
arise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove 
insufficient – in some cases years after a product has been 
launched."
"A high number of recalls could also have a negative 
impact on the BMW Group’s reputation."
"Further information on 
risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non-statu-
tory warranty obligations is provided in ↗ Note [34] to the Group 
Financial Statements."
"The BMW Group sees opportunities relating to production pro-
cesses primarily in the competitive edge gained from mastering 
new and complex technologies."
"Given the long lead times in-
volved in developing new products, additional opportunities are 
not expected to have a significant earnings impact on the 
BMW Group."
"Risks and opportunities relating to purchasing 
The greatest risk relating to purchasing comes from supply 
shortages due to supplier bottlenecks."
"Production problems at 
the supplier level could lead to consequences caused by in-
creased expenditure for the BMW Group due to production inter-
ruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales."
"Supply 
bottlenecks may also have a negative impact on the reputation 
of the BMW Group if customer demand cannot be met as 
expected."
"The risk 
is categorised as high."
"During the selection of suppliers a standardised assessment of 
risk criteria is part of the sourcing process."
"An increasing complexity within the supplier network, particularly 
with sub-suppliers over which the BMW Group has only an indi-
rect influence, as well as a lack of solvency on the part of suppli-
ers, may influence the delivery of supplies to plants."
"A prevention 
programme was put in place in order to identify relevant devel-
opments early on and define individual measures."
"Additional risks arise from the inflation-related price increases of 
recent years and the resulting demands from suppliers, which 
can have a negative impact on earnings."
"In addition to price risks, 
the number of suppliers at risk of insolvency which the 
BMW Group must support to maintain supplier operations is 
increasing."
"The rising threat of cyberattacks along the entire value chain af-
fects both the security of supply and the protection of expertise 
relevant to the BMW Group."
"In order to optimise the level of in-

 Risks and Opportunities  
Overall, the risks arising from the sales network can be catego-
rised as low."
"The BMW Group continuously strives to align its sales strategies 
with future trends, prioritising the needs of both prospective and 
current customers as the focal point of its operations."
"Opportuni-
ties arising as a result are classified as immaterial."
"Information security, data protection and IT 
Digitalisation and automation across all areas of the business 
and its products offer a wide range of opportunities for the 
BMW Group."
"Especially in the field of artificial intelligence, poten-
tial uses as well as risks are evaluated on a continuous basis."
"At 
the same time, information technology (IT) requirements regard-
ing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are 
becoming increasingly strict."
"The threat level has continued to 
rise over recent years."
"Increasing geopolitical conflicts also con-
tribute to the rise in cyberattacks."
"Moreover, legal and regulatory 
requirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide, which could 
also necessitate higher investments in hardware and software."
"In view of the higher incidence of observed attacks, the risk 
amount – despite extensive security measures – is still classified 
as high."
"In order to protect vehicle functions from manipulation, we have 
introduced processes such as standardised safety assessments 
and regular penetration tests."
"However, risks in this regard can 
never be fully ruled out due to the high complexity and increasing 
connectivity."
"Information and data can also be compromised by a lack of risk 
awareness and inappropriate behaviour."
"The main direct conse-
quences would be negative effects on Group revenues, disrup-
tion in production, or reputational damage."
"For this reason, the 
BMW Group has launched an interactive programme to provide 
regular training for every employee on the correct way to handle 
dangerous emails."
"Protecting information, for example from unauthorised access or 
misuse, has the highest priority."
"In conjunction with risk manage-
ment requirements, risks relating to information security, data 
protection and IT are systematically documented, allocated ap-
propriate measures by the departments concerned and continu-
ously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation."
"Regular analyses and controls as well as tight security manage-
ment policies ensure an appropriate level of security."
"However, despite continuous testing and preventive security 
measures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this 
area."
"All authorised persons are required to treat information 
such as confidential business, customer and employee data with 
great care, use information systems securely and handle risks in 
a transparent manner."
"Uniform requirements that apply through-
out the Group are documented in a comprehensive set of rules 
and guidelines."
"A consistently applied policy of updating such 
rules and regulations to the current situation, coupled with regu-
lar communication, awareness-raising and training measures, 
form the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness in 
general."
"Financial risks and risks relating to the use of financial 
instruments 
Currency risks and opportunities 
As an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW Group con-
ducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to cur-
rency risks and opportunities."
"A substantial portion of Group rev-
enues, production, other purchases and funding occur outside 
the eurozone."
"The BMW Group manages currency risks at both the strategic 
(medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium 
term)."
"Over the medium and long term, it is possible to ramp up 
production or purchase volumes in foreign currency regions (nat-
ural hedging)."
"Currency risks are managed in the short to me-
dium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on 
financial markets, the primary objective of which is to improve 
planning reliability for the BMW Group as a whole."
"Regularly up-
dated cash-flow-at-risk models are used to limit currency risks 
and identify opportunities."
"The risk amount associated with cur-
rency risks is classified as high."
"The strengthening of the euro in 
2023 has led to an increased level of risk compared to the pre-
vious year."
"Depending on exchange rate fluctuations, opportunities may 
also arise, which means they can be considered material."
"Risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices 
As a manufacturing company, the BMW Group is subject to price 
risks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle 
production."
"The analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned pur-
chases of raw materials and components containing those prod-
ucts."
"A cash-flow-at-risk model is deployed to measure risks re-
lating to raw materials prices."
"Price fluctuations for raw materials 
such as precious metals, non-ferrous metals, raw materials for 
batteries and steel, and also energy, are hedged using financial 
derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements."
"The prices of many raw materials continue to be subject to un-
certainty on commodity markets."
"Accordingly, the risk amount 
associated with raw materials prices is classified as medium, but 
there are also material opportunities."
"This risk is lower than in the 
previous year due to the decline in prices of raw materials."
"Liquidity risks 
The major part of the Financial Services segment’s credit financ-
ing and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets."
"The 
risk of restricted access to funds is deemed low."
"The liquidity concept, based on the experience gained during the 
global financial crisis, is rigorously adhered to and continuously 
developed."
"In the Financial Services segment, the use of the 
“matched funding principle” ensures that liquidity risks are gen-
erally avoided."
"Solvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW Group by 
adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range 
of refinancing sources."
"The liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed 
through the Group-wide planning of financial requirements and 
funding."
"Further information on risks in conjunction with financial 
instruments is provided in ↗ Note [40] to the Group Financial State-
ments."
"The BMW Group works together with banks to ensure that the 
available liquidity is optimally invested in order to hedge against 
financial market risks (particularly currency, commodity and in-
terest rate risks) using derivative financial instruments and to 
protect payments made in advance."
"Counterparty risk denotes 
the risk that the BMW  Group will not receive, or not receive in full, 
the payments due to it in connection with the investment and 
hedging transactions referred to above."
"A value-at-risk model is 
employed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the 
creditworthiness of the banks and the business volumes in-
volved."
"Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes 
daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at 
the level of the individual counterparties."
"The BMW Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in 
numerous entities."
"The recoverability of these investments is 
monitored on an ongoing basis as part of a standardised pro-
cess."
"However, risks from impairment losses could still arise."
"The risk associated with other financial risks is classified as me-
dium."
"Potential opportunities resulting from the revaluation of in-
vestments are evaluated as immaterial."
"Risks and opportunities relating to pension obligations 
Future pension obligations are financed largely via external pen-
sion funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the 
BMW Group."
"Externally managed funds are invested on capital 
markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling 
future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets."
"These arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension 
payments out of ongoing operations."
"Fluctuations in pension 
provisions and the related pension assets give rise to risks that 
may have varying effects due to the differences in accounting 
standards between IFRS and HGB."
"The risk associated with pension provisions based on IFRS val-
uations is categorised as medium."
"Material opportunities can 
arise if the value of pension assets on the capital markets devel-
ops favourably or if pension provisions decreased at a more pro-
nounced rate than the related assets."
"Pension obligations are chiefly measured by projecting future 
payouts, gauged with a current discount rate derived from mar-
ket yields from top-rated corporate bonds."
"This discount rate is 
subject to market fluctuations and therefore influences the level 
of pension obligations in terms of present value."
"Changes in 
other parameters, such as inflation rates and life expectancy, 
also impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension 
payments."
"Regulatory requirements may also affect the amount 
of pension obligations."
"The fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of various 
asset classes on capital markets."
"Investments are broadly diver-
sified (interest-bearing securities, equities, real estate and other 
asset classes)."
"Reevaluations on the liabilities and assets sides are recognised 
net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and 
hence directly in equity of the BMW Group (within revenue re-
serves)."
"Further information on risks in conjunction with pension 
provisions is provided in ↗ Note [33] to the Group Financial State-
ments."
"Legal risks 
Like all entities with international operations, the BMW Group is 
confronted with legal disputes, alleged claims relating in particu-
lar to warranty and product liability or intellectual property rights 
infringements and proceedings initiated by government agen-
cies."
"Any of these could, amongst other consequences, have an 
adverse impact on the Group’s reputation."
"Such proceedings are 
typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning 
product or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions, 
or are antitrust related."
"Particularly in the US market, class action 
lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial 
consequences and cause damage to the Group’s reputation."
"More rigorous application, interpretation of, or changes to, exist-
ing regulations could result in a greater number of recalls."
The level of risk from legal risks is classified as medium.
"The potential financial impact of the matters covered under con-
tingent liabilities, including those related to legal and warranty 
risks, cannot be conclusively assessed at this stage."
"International movements of goods require compliance with ex-
tensive export control regulations."
"In addition to goods-related 
restrictions, international trading may also involve personal, 
country-specific and end-use-related restrictions."
"In particular, 
non-compliance with applicable EU and US export control regu-
lations could result in significant legal consequences for the 
BMW Group."
"In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, 
any intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries 
could be a potential source of additional risk exposure."
"BMW Group companies are subject to governmental tax and 
customs audits in each country where they operate, potentially 
resulting in back taxes, retrospective customs duties, interest, 
penalties and similar payments."
"Payments of this nature may, for 
instance, result from the non-recognition of inter-company trans-
fer prices in the countries concerned."
"Further substantial legal 
risks may emerge from contested interpretations of tax or cus-
toms legislation."
"The findings of the tax audit in the countries are 
effective for the audit period and, if applicable, in subsequent 
years."
"Risk management relating to tax and customs legislation 
is enshrined in the BMW Group’s RMS."
"The BMW Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for 
lawsuits and risks."
"In addition, a part of these risks is insured to 
an economically reasonable extent."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be 
ruled out that damages may occur in excess of the insured 
amounts."
"In accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the 
BMW Group concludes that disclosure of the information could 
seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal proceed-
ings."
"Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in 
↗ Note [39] to the Group Financial Statements."
"Further information on this can be 
found in the chapter ↗ Compliance and Human Rights."
"Risk management system in the Financial Services segment 
Risk management in the Financial Services segment is based on 
various pillars; namely, the prevailing risk culture, the risk strat-
egy and the defined risk appetite for the various types of risk."
"In 
addition to this, there are a wide range of guidelines in place 
worldwide that are implemented by the individual companies in 
the Group."
"The central goal of risk management in the Financial Services 
segment is the continuous assurance of risk-bearing capacity."
Limits are assigned depending on the type of risk.
"Various value-
at-risk models are used for this purpose, which are validated at 
regular intervals."
"The confidence level used in this model is con-
servative."
"Care is always taken to ensure that the coverage 
amounts based on the equity of the Financial Services segment 
are sufficient."
Regular stress tests are carried out to support this model.
"These 
are another indicator of potential risk management measures 
and create a high degree of transparency with regard to extreme, 
realistic events, particularly in volatile times."
"Risk management in the Financial Services segment is based on 
the requirements of the supervisory authorities, which are imple-
mented consistently worldwide."
"Climate-related risks are also 
taken into account and analysed at regular intervals, thereby 
considering a medium-term period in the future."
"Further-
more, the credit portfolio is evaluated on an ongoing basis with 
the aim of determining if any impairment allowances need to be 
made for financial receivables."
"This evaluation is based on sta-
tistical methods and takes into account the following aspects, 
among others: the creditworthiness of the customer, the cus-
tomer’s payment history and the economic context in the cus-
tomer’s region."
"The amount allocated to credit risks remains cat-
egorised as medium."
"There may be positive effects in the ongoing assessment of the 
portfolio’s creditworthiness that lead to a reduction of the overall 
risk and therefore constitute an opportunity."
"The BMW Group 
continues to classify potential opportunities in this area as imma-
terial."
"In order to take account of the volatile economic environ-
ment, parameters within the credit awarding process were re-
viewed and adjusted to factor in or not accept declining credit 
ratings."
"Residual value risks and opportunities 
Residual value risks are classified as high in terms of their risk 
level, while residual value opportunities are deemed significant."
"They arise primarily when leased vehicles are sold after they are 
returned at the end of the leasing period."
"A negative deviation 
from the residual value forecast results in a residual value risk, 
while a positive deviation represents a residual value oppor-
tunity."
"Each lease contract is assigned a forecasted sales value for the 
vehicle at the end of the lease term."
"Current market trends are 
taken into consideration within the routine portfolio evaluation."
"In 
addition, the portfolio composition (e.g."
"by drivetrain type) is an-
alysed on an ongoing basis."
"Relevant changes and their impacts 
are incorporated into the portfolio evaluation."
"The residual value 
calculation models, as well as the portfolio evaluation models, 
are continually being refined."
"Interest rate risks 
To a limited degree, interest rate risks are deliberately accepted 
in order to make use of the associated return potential."
"Risks 
thereby result when there is a partial mismatch between fixed in-
terest rate periods, which means they are rated as low."
"The as-
sociated opportunities are classed as material."
"Operational risks 
Operational risks result from any form of ineffective or defective 
internal processes, systems, external events or human error."
"The 
aim is to systematically record and quantify all risks except for 
those listed in the paragraphs above."
"Because the risks arise in 
a wide range of areas of the Company, such as IT security or sup-
plier management, the close dovetailing of these areas is essen-
tial and ensures that there is adequate transparency regarding 
the current risk situation of the entire division."
"All individual oper-
ational risks are recorded in a system and appropriate mititgation 
measures are implemented."
"The risk amount is categorised as 
medium."
"Consequently, the company analyses a range of cli-
mate scenarios, identifies and evaluates climate-related risks 
and opportunities and takes the relevant measures."
"↗ GRI Index: 
201-2 
The BMW Group follows the recommendations of the TCFD by 
continuously refining processes for reporting and the internal 
steering of climate-related risks and opportunities."
"During the 2023 reporting year, all material risks and opportuni-
ties for the BMW Group were analysed in terms of their sensitivity 
regarding three different climate scenarios in accordance with 
the TCFD."
"For the medium-term period until 2035, we distin-
guish between transitory and physical climate risks."
"For the long-
term period until 2050, the evaluation focuses on the physical 
climate risks."
"Climate scenarios 
The BMW Group uses three scenarios to identify and evaluate 
climate-related risks, which are based on the scenarios of the 
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) of the Intergovernmen-
tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
"These climate scenarios range from a low-emissions scenario 
with global warming of <+1.5 °C (Paris Agreement, SSP1-2.6), 
a medium scenario with warming of an average of +2.5 °C (mid-
dle of the road, SSP2-4.5) to >+4 °C (fossil-fuelled development, 
SSP5-8.5)."
"The BMW Group has committed to aligning its business activities 
with the low-emissions scenario of the Paris Agreement and has 
consistently based its long-term corporate planning on this."
"↗ Carbon Emissions 
Transitory climate risks 
Transitory climate risks arise from the transition to a low-emis-
sions economy across all sectors that is necessary in order to 
mitigate climate change."
"These risks become particularly appar-
ent when conditions change more quickly and/or differently than 
expected."
"The transitory climate risks were identified and evalu-
ated along five different risk dimensions."
"For the BMW Group, this may have a negative impact on deliveries 
and the residual value of existing products."
"In the areas of Production and Purchasing, remanence costs and impairment risks may result from changing processes and equipment."
The digital connectivity between companies and products to support decarbonisation is increasing in order to streamline processes and better manage emissions.
"Risks for the BMW Group 
result from the time delay until such technologies can be used if, for example, some areas of the supply chain cannot provide the relevant 
standards and interfaces quickly enough."
"Significant technological innovations may make product and production technologies, which are in use or in the pipeline today (from energy storage to recycling), as well as investments in 
these innovations, obsolete or challenge their efficiency."
"In terms of infrastructure (such as new fuel options, charging technologies for electric vehicles), 
they may jeopardise the availability and acceptance of planned or expected conditions for the customer."
"Market and competition 
 
― 
 
― 
 
― 
 
Due to a global focus on sustainable products, energy prices and commodities costs are rising."
"This has a direct impact on manufacturing costs for the BMW Group and 
may go on to affect deliveries."
"Furthermore, credit and residual value risks in the Financial Services segment may also be impacted."
Existing and new competitors are accelerating the production of electrified vehicles.
"If products and business models are perceived as being more attractive by customers, 
this may have the corresponding impact on deliveries by the BMW Group."
"Any serious failure to comply with sustainability or quality standards and providing incorrect information accordingly, could cause disruptions in the supply chain or a shortfall of individual 
suppliers to deliver."
"Capital and financial market 
 
―

― 
 
A good ranking in the ESG ratings has a positive effect on the perception of a company on the capital market and has a favourable effect on investment decisions."
"Investment and 
financing decisions by investors or lenders depend on a good ESG rating."
"Short-term and unforeseeable regulatory changes may reduce the appeal of a company on the capital market and 
increase refinancing costs if it is not possible to react to the changes in the regulatory framework in time."
This may impact the credit rating and refinancing costs of the BMW Group.
The short-notice termination of government subsidies to promote low-carbon mobility may reduce the demand for electrified vehicles.
"Uneven adjustments of prices for carbon emissions could have a negative impact on the macro- and microeconomic situation of a national economy, causing distortions in the credit risk, for 
example."
Production processes must quickly be changed to green energy sources and resource-friendly facilities.
The BMW Group already consistently implements known requirements.
"However, 
additional costs may result if additional requirements are announced at short notice."
"For suppliers, stricter requirements regarding circular economy, recycling and avoiding the use of resources may lead to higher costs in the short term."
"Fast rising and/or selectively discriminating regional vehicle-related purchase and usage taxes may lead to higher costs or a decrease 
in deliveries."
"Society 
 
― 
 
Around the world, people’s environmental awareness is increasing."
"Social discussions arising from a perceived worsening of the climate’s health may lead to changes in mobility patterns 
and/or customer preferences that may vary by region."
"This may require us to adapt the product portfolio, which may impact deliveries and residual values for vehicles."
"Potential impacts 
are grouped into five different levels."
"In the Paris Agreement global warming scenario, the potential 
transitory risks are deemed the highest over the medium term as 
a result of the fast-paced, sometimes unforeseeable develop-
ments."
"It cannot be ruled out that more decisive measures will 
have to be taken globally in the next few years in order to achieve 
the < +1.5°C target."
"For the BMW Group, this is reflected primar-
ily in the risk dimensions of “Politics, legal affairs and regulatory 
framework”, as well as “Market and competition”."
"Regulatory re-
quirements introduced at short notice may enter into force, which 
could have an impact on products, production and supply chains."
"In the “Market and competition” risk dimension, risks may also 
increase due to higher demand and the resulting higher prices for 
select (scarce) raw materials on the one hand and due to rising 
energy prices on the other."
"Transitory climate risks 
 
Physical climate risks 
In addition to the transitory risks, the BMW Group also evaluates 
physical risks."
"In doing so, the increasing frequency and intensity 
of acute extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms 
and floods, are taken into account, along with longer-term 
changes such as in terms of temperature and rainfall."
"In order to measure such risks, we draw on external data that 
evaluate the development of acute and persistent natural phe-
nomena across the global warming scenarios and across time."
"For the BMW Group, this may result in damage to assets such as 
buildings, vehicles or parts on the one hand, and on the other 
hand, such events may lead to downtime at BMW Group sites or 
at suppliers’ sites."
"Physical climate risks also increase for the BMW Group particu-
larly in the long-term >+4 °C scenario."
"This leads to a higher risk 
both for the BMW Group’s production sites and also for suppliers’ 
sites."
"The op-
portunities identified are also distributed across the five dimen-
sions."
"DIMENSION

By expanding the portfolio of electrified products and developing and producing our own electric drivetrains, batteries and battery cell prototypes, we will be able to safeguard know-how and 
system expertise early on."
This may result in competitive advantages.
"By embracing the circular economy, the BMW Group is contributing towards achieving its decarbonisation target within the supply chain and reducing its dependence on primary materials, 
also in terms of their availability, costs and ESG risks."
Mitigation measures (Scope 1 and 2) can help to reduce energy consumption and operating costs.
"Due to the convincing sustainability performance of its offered products and the acceleration towards a circular economy, the BMW Group may experience advantages arising from higher 
customer demand."
"Differentiation through the consistent reduction of carbon emissions in the vehicle portfolio by means of the electrification and highly efficient combustion engines can further increase the 
BMW Group’s market share."
"Leveraging BMW tools and other offers to manage carbon emission reduction efforts among Tier 1 suppliers has the potential to be a distinguishing feature for both investors and customers, 
raising brand reputation in the process."

Further diversification of the investor base by proactively managing the risks posed by climate change."
An excellent ESG rating for the BMW Group could further enhance the Group's appeal to investors.
An above-average performance compared to industry benchmarks in terms of ESG indicators could lead to heightened appeal to investors.
"Improvements in the tax environment and incentives for customers, along with investment grants and easements for climate protection measures in production may 
accelerate progress in terms of reducing carbon emissions."
"Eligibility to participate in global government initiatives and grants which facilitate the continued acceleration of climate change adaptation efforts (Scope 1 and 2), encompassing tax 
reforms, green and digital stimulus packages as well as research and development incentives."
"Implementing early-stage adjustments to the supply chain to address climate change enhances its long-term resilience, thereby ensuring business continuity."
Subsidy programmes for alternative drivetrain technologies are helping to increase sales.
"Society

Together with its suppliers, the BMW Group helps to reduce carbon emissions along the value chain and to work towards implementing decarbonisation measures."
"By taking action at an 
early stage, the BMW Group will be prepared and also will benefit from a business perspective."
"Thanks to its focus on sustainability, the BMW Group can make a valuable social contribution to the prevention of global warming."
"The BMW Group actively considers the risks and 
corresponding opportunities and takes them into account in de-
cision-making and planning processes."
"Drawing on internal and 
external momentum, the risk management system is being con-
tinuously refined."
"Compliance builds trust in our products and brands 
and shapes our public image."
"Compliance means much more to 
the BMW Group than simply complying with applicable laws and 
BMW Group directives around the globe."
"It forms part of our iden-
tity, our understanding of leadership and our living culture of in-
tegrity."
"Compliance creates a binding framework for all our busi-
ness activities worldwide."
"Compliance as a corporate function 
Compliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Man-
agement of BMW AG, executed by creating an appropriate regu-
latory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular and 
ad hoc reporting, accompanied by clear communications."
"This 
approach is based on the core belief that compliance with applic-
able laws and related internal regulations is the responsibility of 
all employees."
"As role models, managers are tasked with an-
choring compliance culture in their area of responsibility and en-
suring compliance requirements and processes are imple-
mented accordingly."
"↗ GRI Index: 2-23 
In addition to being responsible for the Company-wide Compli-
ance Management System, the Chief Compliance Officer also 
manages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of 
Management and Supervisory Board of BMW AG at regular  
intervals."
"Compliance Management System (CMS) 
The BMW Group’s Company-wide Compliance Management 
System (CMS) reinforces the culture of compliance and integrity 
and helps reduce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks aris-
ing from other (non-)financial disadvantages, such as reputa-
tional risks."
"The CMS focuses on adequacy and effectiveness 
and is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which de-
fines specific preventive, monitoring, control and response 
measures."
"Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also 
essential."
"The CMS is tailored to the BMW Group’s risk situation and ad-
dresses all relevant compliance topics."
"Group-wide, these in-
clude anti corruption and fraud prevention, anti-money-launder-
ing, antitrust and human rights compliance, export control com-
pliance, data privacy protection and product compliance."
"In the 
reporting year, the already established compliance programmes 
External Workforce Compliance and Compliance for regulated Fi-
nancial Services Units were incorporated into the CMS."
"Respon-
sibility for Data Privacy Protection, Product Compliance, External 
Workforce Compliance and Compliance for Regulated Financial 
Services Units outside Group Compliance lies with independent 
departments."
"↗ GRI Index: 2-27, 205-1, 205-3, 206-1 
Further development of CMS 
The CMS is reviewed on a regular basis and refined as needed."
"This primarily involves evaluating strategic focus topics, legal 
and regulatory requirements and trends, best practices as well 
as industry standards, all of which are taken into account from a 
risk perspective."
"The objective is to consistently improve the 
CMS."
"The BMW Group is an active member of various associa-
tions and interest groups, including the German Institute for 
Compliance e."
"During the reporting period, a key area of focus was the updating 
and further development of the compliance regulatory land-
scape."
"This included an update of the ↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct 
as the central policy for the BMW Group’s expectations of its em-
ployees in terms of compliance with applicable legal provisions 
and internal regulations."
"An analysis of the BMW Group’s activi-
ties to further improve antitrust compliance was also carried out."
"Further priority areas emerged in the context of export control, 
due to the war in Ukraine, and in anti-money-laundering efforts, 
due to the increase in legislative initiatives as well as in anticipa-
tion of changes to the business model aiming to intensify direct 
sales."
"One component of the CMS is the compliance programme Data 
Privacy Protection, which is the responsibility of the department 
Group Data Privacy Protection."
"This is based on the directive Pri-
vacy Corporate Rules and the so-called Binding Corporate Rules, 
which contractually protect the transfer of employee data within 
the BMW Group."
"Implementation of the programme is validated 
through regular reporting by affiliated companies and independ-
ent audits carried out by Group Data Privacy Protection."
"During the reporting year, there was a ex-
pansion of the Detect processes in particular, aimed at enhanc-
ing preventive activities."
"This expansion was accompanied by 
the implementation of new training and communication formats."
"In the reporting period, External Workforce 
Compliance was restructured to ensure that the requirements for 
compliant contracts for work and labour are even more firmly 
rooted in the procurement of services and cooperation with ser-
vice providers."
"The compliance programme Compliance for Regulated Financial 
Services Units takes into account the particularities of the 
financial services business and the risks and regulations in-
volved."
"The specific focus of the programme – in addition to the 
proper implementation of other compliance topics – is on legis-
lative and regulatory monitoring, consumer protection and the 
implementation of financial services supervisory requirements."
"Three-Stage Approach of the Compliance Management System 
 
The Financial Services segment has established its own dedi-
cated risk management unit, which works closely with the central 
Group Compliance function as part of the CMS."
"On the basis of 
an annual analysis, it identifies the possible need for adjustments 
and defines appropriate measures."
"Group-wide implementation 
by the BMW Group’s financial services companies is continu-
ously reviewed and reported on to the management of the Fi-
nancial Services segment on a quarterly basis."
"In the Financial Services segment, compliance is incorporated 
into the target management process."
"Integration of specific tar-
gets into strategic steering helps monitor implementation."
"A 
management system also supports the process of identifying 
risks arising from non-compliance with internal and external reg-
ulations at an early stage."
"Around 200 
managers Group-wide perform these tasks for their area of re-
sponsibility as operational Compliance Responsibles."
"Every Compliance Officer 
is tasked with implementing the CMS and compliance pro-
grammes for defined topics in their area of activity, as well as 
identifying and realising division-specific compliance measures."
"Compliance training 
Compliance training opportunities are continuously refined for 
specific target groups."
"The online training courses with case 
studies and test questions, repeated every two years, strength-
ens the compliance culture and reinforces compliant behaviour."
"More than 95,500 staff and managers worldwide have so far 
completed the Compliance Essentials training and 51,500 have 
received the Antitrust Compliance training."
"This offering is sup-
plemented by target-group-specific classroom training on anti-
trust compliance as well as online training courses on data pri-
vacy and product compliance."
"↗ GRI Index: 205-2 
Digitalisation supports compliance 
IT-based compliance systems are used for transparent and effi-
cient documentation, assessment and approval of compliance-
relevant matters Group-wide."
"This includes topics such as 
money laundering and sanctions lists, exchange activities with 
competitors, business partner due diligence and verifying the le-
gal admissibility of benefits in kind."
"The data collected in this way 
forms the basis for the compliance risk assessment."
"Compliance and notification systems 
Employees with questions or concerns relating to compliance 
can discuss these matters with their managers or relevant de-
partments and, specifically, with the Compliance functions."
"The 
Compliance contact serves as a further point of contact for both 
employees and external parties."
"Reports regarding potential compliance violations can also be 
submitted anonymously and confidentially in several languages 
via the BMW Group SpeakUP Line notification system or via the 
ombudsperson."
"↗ Checking effectiveness 
The BMW Group protects information providers in two ways: 
first, individuals may provide information without disclosing their 
identity; second, no one providing information faces retaliatory 
action."
"All queries and concerns relating to compliance are doc-
umented and processed using a Group-wide electronic case 
management system."
"If necessary, Corporate Audit, Corporate 
Security, the legal departments or the Works Council may be 
brought in."
"↗ GRI Index: 2-16 
CMS monitoring and controls 
The CMS provides differentiated monitoring levels for reviewing 
observance and implementation of compliance rules and pro-
cesses at regular intervals."
"In addition to the direct checks per-
formed by Compliance Responsibles as business managers, 
risks are further reduced by additional measures integrated into 
business processes, which generally form part of the ↗ Internal 
Control System."
"Compliance investigations are carried out when the need arises 
or ad hoc as part of the Detect function of central Group Compli-
ance."
"These include internal investigations in connection with of-
ficial investigations, which serve to clarify the facts internally."
"Risk-based compliance audits aimed at identifying specific com-
pliance risks are focused on antitrust law."
"In 2023, export control 
and anti-money-laundering efforts were incorporated as new 
topics."
"Corporate Audit also monitors adherence to compliance 
requirements by business managers, as well as selected ele-
ments of the CMS."
All control checks are geared towards reducing compliance risks.
"Any infringements are immediately remedied, with an emphasis 
on reducing the risk of repeat offences as far as possible."
"Where 
infringements can be traced to an individual, that person will be 
appropriately sanctioned, in accordance with the processes de-
fined for this purpose."
"As part of the annual review of the BMW Group CMS, its appro-
priateness and effectiveness are assessed on the basis of de-
fined criteria."
"In addition to the assessment of the Compliance 
Responsibles, the measurement also takes into account the as-
sessment of compliance and other governance functions."
"Our 
overall statement on the adequacy and effectiveness of the In-
ternal Control and Risk Management System, including the 
CMS, can be found in the section ↗ Appropriateness and Effectiveness 
of the Internal Control System and Risk Management System."
"Our ↗ Group-wide approach, which is subject to continuous 
improvement, is based on established due diligence processes 
that encompass our own business operations, our ↗ supply chains 
as well as other business partners."
"The individual steps include 
a risk analysis, prevention, control and mitigation measures, 
↗ Complaint mechanisms, review of effectiveness and reporting."
"The focus is on topics where the BMW Group has identified high 
risks in terms of human rights and environmental aspects and 
where it has a certain level of influence."
"We place particular em-
phasis on our global, extensive and highly complex supply chain."
"We offer comprehensive details about the multistage due dili-
gence process for upholding human rights within the supplier 
network in the section ↗ Purchasing and Supplier Network."
"Internationally recognised guidelines for the protection of human 
rights set the benchmark for the BMW Group’s entire value chain."
"We regard them as specific demands placed on ourselves, our 
supply chain and other business partners."

partners regarding the BMW Group’s efforts to safeguard 
human rights and ensure fair working conditions."

Diligence Act (LkSG)."
"― 
↗ BMW Group Supplier Code of Conduct: The BMW Group’s 
requirements and expectations for its global supplier 
network in accordance with internationally recognised 
sustainability standards and guidelines."
"The BMW Group has established clear responsibilities across the 
organization for implementing and monitoring due diligence ob-
ligations."
"Within the BMW Group, responsibility rests with the re-
spective departments and the management of the Group enti-
ties, while outside the BMW Group it lies with the relevant busi-
ness partners and suppliers."
"Central functions such as Group 
Compliance and Sustainability in the Supply Chain oversee and 
monitor compliance with due diligence obligations in the relevant 
area."
"The BMW Group Human Rights Officer, who was ap-
pointed by the Board of Management of BMW AG at the end of 
2021 as one of the requirements of the LkSG, also assumes a 
support and monitoring function."
"In the reporting period, we focused on further developing the ex-
isting due diligence processes following the first-time application 
of the LkSG."
"In addition to the policy statement published at the 
end of 2022, this includes the further development of the risk 
analysis for our own business operations."
"In 2023, we have also 
updated the Human Rights Code and integrated the topic of hu-
man rights into the ↗ BMW Group Code of Conduct."
"The requirements for the design and structure of ICS procedures 
incorporated in accounting and financial reporting processes as 
well as those used to generate selected non-financial infor-
mation included in the BMW Group Report are defined on a 
Group-wide basis."
"The ICS for financial reporting has the task of ensuring that sig-
nificant accounting and financial reporting processes deployed 
within the BMW Group are both accurate and reliable."
"The ICS 
for non-financial reporting focuses primarily on the further devel-
opment of the processes used to gather data as the basis for re-
porting the non-financial performance indicators disclosed in the 
BMW Group Report."
"The ICS is based on the “three lines” model, including a clear def-
inition of how the various functions are required to interact with 
one another in order to manage risks."
"As a component of the 
second line, the ICS serves as the link between the operating 
units (first line) and Corporate Audit (third line)."
"In principle, the aim of every appropriate and effective ICS is to 
prevent potential risks in external financial and non-financial re-
porting or reduce the likelihood of potential risks materialising."
"Internationally acknowledged standards for internal control sys-
tems were taken into account when designing the various ele-
ments of the ICS deployed by the BMW Group (e.g."
"The principal features of the BMW Group’s ICS are a role-based 
approach embedded throughout the organisation, a clearly de-
fined control environment that is underpinned by a combination 
of risk assessment procedures, control activities, information and 
communication, and monitoring activities."
"Both the system itself and the methods applied are subject to 
continuous improvement, with its functionality being assessed 
on a regular basis."
"Notwithstanding the measures taken, every 
control system is subject to inherent limitations, given that it is 
not possible to prevent all incorrect disclosures or detect them in 
a timely manner."
"Relevant BMW Group working instructions and guidelines for 
recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts as well 
as definitions of non-financial performance indicators are avail-
able to all employees via the BMW Group’s intranet system."
"New 
reporting standards are assessed for their potential impact on 
the BMW Group’s reporting."
"The principle of segregation of duties is taken into account for all 
IT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial report-
ing."
"ICS requirements are also embedded in the ongoing devel-
opment of all IT systems used in these areas."
"Furthermore, the 
BMW Group deploys data analysis tools to identify and subse-
quently eliminate any weaknesses detected in its processes 
and/or control systems."
"They report annually 
on their assessment of the ICS for accounting and financial re-
porting processes and the processes for non-financial perfor-
mance indicators."
"The assessment takes into account the results 
of internal and external audits as well as the results of continuous 
monitoring."
"The results of the assessment are gathered and doc-
umented in a centralised IT system."
"Both the Board of Manage-
ment and the Audit Committee are informed about the status of 
the ICS on an annual basis."
"The Board of Management and, 
where appropriate, the Supervisory Board, are promptly in-
formed in the event of any significant changes to the ICS."

"02 Group reporting entity and consolidation principles 
The BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all 
material subsidiaries over which BMW AG – either directly or in-
directly – exercises control."
"This also includes 62 structured en-
tities, consisting of asset-backed financing arrangements and 
special purpose funds."
"In some cases, contractual agreements 
are in place with the asset-backed securities companies to offset 
their losses in connection with residual value risks arising from 
the receivables sold to them."
"and BMW India 
Financial Services Private Ltd., whose year-ends are 31 March 
in accordance with local legal requirements."
"Interim financial 
statements are prepared as at 31 December for the two compa-
nies with divergent reporting dates."
"When assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled 
entity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint ven-
ture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and 
other circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of 
the entity."
Discretionary decisions may also be required.
"If indi-
cations exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the 
BMW Group undertakes a new assessment."
"An entity is classified as an associated company if BMW AG – 
either directly or indirectly – has the ability to exercise significant 
influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies."
"As a 
general rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence 
if it holds 20% or more of the entity’s voting power."
"Joint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrange-
ments."
"Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity 
jointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a 
contractual agreement."
"In the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control 
of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for 
the liabilities, relating to the arrangement."
"Assets, liabilities, rev-
enues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised propor-
tionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the 
BMW Group entity’s rights and obligations (proportionate con-
solidation)."
"The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial 
Statements is of minor significance."
"The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50% of the 
joint operation’s equity."
"In the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control 
only have rights to the net assets of the arrangement."
"Associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for us-
ing the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition 
based on acquisition cost."
"On 11 February 2022, via its subsidiary BMW Holding B.V., the 
BMW Group increased its shareholding in the BMW Brilliance Au-
tomotive Ltd."
"(BMW Brilliance) joint venture from 50% to 75% 
with the acquisition of a further 25% of BMW Brilliance’s shares."
"BMW Brilliance has been fully consolidated in the Group Finan-
cial Statements since that date."
"With regard to the figures re-
ported for the previous financial year, it should therefore be noted 
that BMW Brilliance is only included for the relevant part of 2022 
(i.e."
from 11 February onwards).
"If BMW Brilliance had been fully 
included in the Group Financial Statements with effect from 1 
January 2022, Group revenues and profit after tax for the finan-
cial year 2022 would have amounted to € 145,521 million and 
€ 18,842 million respectively."
"The remeasurement of the previ-
ously held shares resulted in a gain of € 7,649 million on first-
time consolidation, which was recognised in income from invest-
ments within the line item “Other financial result” in the previous 
year."
"Detailed information is provided in ↗ BMW Group Report 2022, 
note [3] to the Group Financial Statements."
"Following approval by the relevant antitrust authorities, the 
transaction was completed on 18 October 2023, with the BMW 
Group holding a 16.67% stake."
"Although this is below 20%, the 
newly founded entity is included in the BMW Group Financial 
Statements as an associated company using the equity method, 
reflecting the fact that the BMW Group is represented on the 
management board and therefore has significant influence."
"On 6 November 2023, the BMW Group signed an agreement 
with the Mercedes-Benz Group AG to establish a company in 
China with the aim of developing a charging infrastructure there."
Approval has been granted by the antitrust authorities.
"The BMW 
Group will hold a 50% stake in the newly founded entity."
"It will 
be included in the BMW Group Financial Statements as a joint 
venture using the equity method."
"On 30 September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agreement 
with the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance 
Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., a Huachen Group subsidi-
ary."
"The transaction will not, however, be completed."
"The other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a 
material impact on the results of operations, financial position 
and net assets of the Group."
"03 Other significant events 
Russia-Ukraine war 
Major uncertainties remained at 31 December 2023 with re-
spect to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war."
"The current sanctions 
and the countermeasures taken significantly restrict economic 
activities with Russia and also have an impact on the Russian 
companies of the BMW Group."
"The restrictions currently in place for payments continue to re-
strict the transfer of liquid funds from Russia."
"Developments in 
this area are reviewed by the BMW Group on a regular basis."
"In 
total, the Russian companies hold around 4% (2022: 5%) of the 
BMW Group’s cash and cash equivalents."
"A closing rate of RUB 100.62 (2022: 77.12) to the euro was ap-
plied at 31 December 2023 to translate foreign currency items 
denominated in Russian roubles."
"The BMW Group has been able 
to execute transactions at this rate."
"Under this method, assets and liabilities are 
translated at the closing exchange rate, while income and ex-
penses are translated at the average exchange rate."
"Differences 
arising on foreign currency translation are presented in “Accu-
mulated other equity”."
"In the single entity accounts of BMW AG 
and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables 
are measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate pre-
vailing at the date of first-time recognition."
"Advance payments to 
suppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in 
the addition of non-monetary assets or liabilities are recorded at 
the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment."
"At the end 
of the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and pay-
ables are measured using the closing exchange rate."
"The result-
ing unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and 
losses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income state-
ment, in line with the underlying substance of the transaction."
"Non-monetary balance sheet line items denominated in foreign 
currencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange 
rates."
"Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Re-
porting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been ap-
plied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina."
"The price indices pub-
lished by the Federación Argentina de Consejos Profesionales de 
Ciencias Económicas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non-mone-
tary asset, liability and income statement line items."
"The result-
ing effects are not material for the BMW Group."
"The Standard replaces IFRS 4 and contains new rules relating to 
the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure re-
quirements for insurance contracts."
"In a Group-wide project, the 
BMW Group examined the impact of adopting IFRS 17 for exist-
ing agreements."
"The BMW Group offers various products that 
meet the definition of an insurance contract in accordance with 
IFRS 17."
"However, for the majority of these products, either an 
exemption applies (e.g."
"for warranty agreements) or the insur-
ance arrangements qualify as fixed-fee service contracts, which 
can continue to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 due 
to the option available in IFRS 17."
"In some markets, however, 
products are offered (e.g."
"comprehensive vehicle insurance) that 
are required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17."
"These contracts can be accounted for using the premium alloca-
tion approach, which is essentially the same as the accounting 
method already being applied for such contracts."
"In the financial 
year 2023, insurance premiums for insurance contracts amount-
ing to € 89 million were recognised in other income within the 
line item “Revenues”."
"At 31 December 2023, insurance liabilities 
for the remaining terms of these contracts amounted to € 289 
million."
"In May 2023, the IASB published International Tax Reform – Pil-
lar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12) which sets out a 
mandatory exemption to the accounting for deferred taxes in 
conjunction with the global minimum taxation (Pillar Two)."
"The 
amendments provide for a temporary exemption from recognis-
ing deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar 
Two rules."
"The exemption has accordingly been applied by the 
BMW Group."
"The amendments also include disclosures in the 
notes to explain the impact of the introduction of minimum taxa-
tion on affected entities."
"The introduction of the Pillar Two regu-
lations is not expected to have any significant impact on the 
BMW Group Financial Statements."
"b Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not 
yet applied 
Other financial reporting standards and revised standards issued 
by the IASB that have not yet been applied are not expected to 
have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial State-
ments."
"c Accounting policy changes in the financial year 2023 
In order to increase consistency between internal performance 
management and external reporting, the following accounting 
policies were changed in the financial year 2023."
"Government grants related to assets were previously reported as 
deferred income and recognised through profit or loss over the 
accounting periods in which the costs occur that they are in-
tended to compensate."
"With effect from the financial year 2023, 
government grants relating to assets are deducted from the car-
rying amount of the relevant assets and therefore now recog-
nised in profit or loss over the respective useful lives of the assets
in the form of reduced depreciation/amortisation."
"In this context, 
the accounting treatment applied for investment tax credits was 
also changed."
"Instead of being recognised immediately as a re-
duction of income tax expense, with effect from the financial year 
2023 investment tax credits are also deducted from the carrying 
amount of the related assets."
"The income statement impact is 
therefore also spread over the respective useful lives of the as-
sets in the form of lower depreciation/amortisation expense."
"The 
change in accounting policy has not been applied retrospectively 
on the grounds of immateriality."
"Prior-year figures have therefore 
not been adjusted."
"Deferred income for government grants relating to assets at 31 
December 2022 amounted to € 465 million or 0.19% of Group 
total assets at that date."
"At 31 December 2023, the correspond-
ing amount was € 370 million."
"Also with a view to increasing consistency with internal perfor-
mance management, with effect from the financial year 2023 
advance payments to suppliers are reported within other assets."
"At 31 December 2022, advance payments to suppliers amount-
ing to € 259 million were reported within inventories."
"Prior year 
figures have not been adjusted on the grounds of immateriality."
"The impact of the changes in accounting policy is not material for 
the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the 
BMW Group."
"As a consequence of joining the Business Ambition for 1.5°C 
campaign led by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the 
BMW Group pursues validated SBTi Near Term Targets for the 
year 2030, which are incorporated in the Group’s long-term cor-
porate plan."
"More detailed information on how climate-related aspects are 
taken into account for recognition and measurement purposes is 
provided below, particularly in the comments on property, plant 
and equipment, leased products and the performance of impair-
ment tests."
"This includes an indication of the extent to which cli-
mate-related aspects have been taken into account in the esti-
mations and assumptions for the recognition and measurement 
of balance sheet items."
"Revenues from customer contracts include in particular reve-
nues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre-owned ve-
hicles and related products) as well as revenues from services."
"Revenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealer-
ship or retail customer."
"In the case of sales of products, this is 
usually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of owner-
ship are transferred."
"Revenues are stated net of settlement dis-
count, bonuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value 
subsidies."
"The consideration arising from these sales usually 
falls due for payment immediately or within 30 days."
"In excep-
tional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed."
"In the case 
of services, control is transferred over time."
"Consideration for the 
rendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment 
at the beginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a con-
tract liability."
"The deferred amount is released over the service 
period and recognised as revenue in the income statement."
"As a 
rule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense 
trend, as this best reflects the performance of the service."
"If the 
sale of products includes a determinable amount for services 
(multiple-component contracts), the related revenues are de-
ferred and recognised as income in the same way."
"Variable con-
sideration components, such as bonuses, are measured at the 
expected value, and in the case of multi-component contracts, 
allocated to all performance obligations unless directly attribut-
able to the sale of a vehicle."
"Revenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase ar-
rangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full."
"Instead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the 
difference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised 
in instalments over the term of the contract depending on the na-
ture of the agreement."
"In the case of vehicles sold to a dealership 
that are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent period as 
part of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group 
level at the time of the sale of the vehicle."
"Instead, assets and 
liabilities relating based on the right of return of these vehicles 
are recognised."
"Revenues from leases of own-manufactured vehicles are recog-
nised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for 
manufacturer or dealer leases."
"In the case of operating leases, 
revenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term."
"Finance leases, on the other hand, are 
accounted for as a sale."
"At the lease commencement date, rev-
enues are recognised at the amount of the fair value of the leased 
asset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehi-
cles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of 
the lease term."
"In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as 
cost of sales at the lease commencement date."
Revenues also include interest income from financial services.
"In-
terest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail cus-
tomer and dealership financing is recognised using the effective 
interest method and reported as interest income on credit financ-
ing within revenues."
"The resulting income 
is recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs 
occur that they are intended to compensate."
"Information on the 
accounting policy changes applied for the first time from the fi-
nancial year 2023 relating to government grants received for as-
sets as well as to investment tax credits is provided in ↗ note 5."
"Net profit for the year is 
accordingly allocated to the different categories of stock."
"The 
portion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated 
to each category of stock based on the number of outstanding 
shares."
"Profits available for distribution are determined directly 
on the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common 
and preferred stock."
"Diluted earnings per share are calculated 
and separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33."
"Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at acquisi-
tion or manufacturing cost."
"Subsequently, intangible assets with 
finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
useful lives of between three and 20 years."
"Impairment losses 
are recognised where necessary."
"Intangible assets with indefi-
nite useful lives are tested annually for impairment."
"Internally 
generated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs 
for vehicle, module and architecture projects."
"Development costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified 
by IAS 38 are met."
"They are measured on the basis of direct 
costs and directly attributable overhead costs."
"Project-related 
capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line 
basis following the start of production over the estimated product 
life (usually five to 12 years)."
"Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring a business exceeds 
the Group’s share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities identified during the acquisition."
"Intangible assets also include emission allowances and similar 
rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or 
other climate-damaging emissions (for example in conjunction 
with the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle-related emis-
sions regulations in the USA or China)."
"These allowances and 
rights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated 
free of charge, recorded at a value of zero."
"Amounts are derec-
ognised when they are returned or, in exceptional cases, when 
they are sold or expire."
"In parallel to the recognition of these al-
lowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in ac-
cordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations 
expected to arise in conjunction with the related emissions regu-
lations."
"Provisions are measured on the basis of the expected 
value of the allowances or rights that are to be returned."
"If there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets, or 
if an annual impairment test is required (i.e."
"intangible assets 
with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the devel-
opment phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed."
"Each individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows 
generated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the 
cash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets."
"In these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash-gener-
ating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group."
"For the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying amount of 
an asset (or a cash-generating unit) is compared with the recov-
erable amount."
"The first step of the impairment test is to deter-
mine the value in use."
"If the value in use is lower than the carrying 
amount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to 
sell and compare the amount so determined with the asset’s car-
rying amount."
"If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, 
an impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount 
to the higher of the asset’s value in use or fair value less costs to 
sell."
"If the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no 
longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of 
the recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acqui-
sition or manufacturing cost."
"Impairment losses on goodwill are 
not reversed."
"As part of the process of assessing recoverability, 
it is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions – 
in particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and the 
length of the forecast period – which could differ from actual 
amounts."
"Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and 
estimations used if business conditions develop differently to  
expectations."
"The BMW Group determines the value in use of intangible assets 
on the basis of a present value computation."
"The cash flows used 
for this calculation are derived from the long-term corporate plan 
approved by management, corresponding to a forecast period of 
six years."
"Forecasting assumptions are adjusted 
to current information and regularly compared with external 
sources."
"The assumptions used take account in particular of ex-
pectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future mar-
ket share development, macroeconomic developments (such as 
currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the 
legal environment and past experience."
"Assumptions also take into account the impact of climate-related 
aspects and the influence of other sustainability factors on busi-
ness performance and the product portfolio, for example as a re-
sult of changes in demand patterns, regulatory requirements or 
changes in production conditions."
"Amounts are discounted on the basis of a market-related cost of 
capital rate."
"Impairment tests are performed for accounting and 
financial reporting purposes and using a risk-adjusted pre-tax 
cost of capital (WACC) for the Automotive (excluding BMW Bril-
liance), BMW Brilliance and Motorcycles cash-generating units."
"In the case of the Financial Services cash-generating unit, a pre-
tax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector."
"By analogous application of the procedures used for the other 
cash-generating units, the value in use is also determined for the 
BMW Brilliance cash-generating unit in view of the time period 
since the acquisition date."
"No environmental, social and governance 
(ESG)-related adjustments were made to the WACC."
"Even in the 
case of a 10% deterioration in the individual measurement as-
sumptions, an impairment loss would not arise."
"If the WACC were 
to develop as in the previous year, the value in use calculated for 
the Financial Services cash-generating unit would fall slightly be-
low its carrying amount in 2024."
"The BMW Group does not, how-
ever, expect the WACC to develop as in the previous year."
"All items of property, plant and equipment are measured at ac-
quisition or manufacturing cost less accumulated depreciation 
and accumulated impairment losses."
"The cost of internally constructed plant and equipment com-
prises all costs which are directly attributable to the manufactur-
ing process as well as an appropriate proportion of production-
related overheads."
"This includes production-related depreciation 
and amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of admin-
istrative and social costs."
"Financing costs are not included in ac-
quisition or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attribut-
able to the asset."
"The carrying amount of items of depreciable 
property, plant and equipment is written down according to 
scheduled usage-based depreciation – as a general rule on a 
straight-line basis – over the useful lives of the assets."
"Depreci-
ation is recorded as an expense in the income statement."
"This review also takes 
account of the impact of climate-related aspects on useful lives, 
for example due to changes in demand patterns or regulatory re-
quirements."
"This assessment is based on the assumptions used 
for long-term corporate planning purposes and product-related 
decisions, as described above."
"Climate-related aspects have an 
indirect impact on the utilisation of property, plant and equip-
ment."
"Adjustments to the useful lives of items of plant and ma-
chinery are avoided by a combination of flexible manufacturing 
arrangements (independent of drivetrain type and capable of 
handling all vehicle generations) and asset-preservation 
measures."
"The useful lives of plant and machinery that are used 
exclusively for internal combustion vehicle production are also 
covered by the most up-to-date planning assumptions."
"For ma-
chinery used in multiple-shift operations, depreciation rates are 
increased to account for the additional utilisation."
"If there is any 
indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an im-
pairment test is performed as described above for intangible as-
sets."
"Depending on the specific 
facts and circumstances of each individual case, power purchase 
agreements and long-term supply contracts for battery cells may 
also constitute a lease."
"The BMW Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a liability 
for the outstanding lease payments with effect from the date on 
which the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW 
Group."
"Lease in-
centives granted by the lessor are deducted."
"Right-of-use assets 
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the 
useful life of the leased asset and the expected lease term."
"If 
ownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the 
end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is re-
flected in the lease payments, the right-of-use asset is depreci-
ated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the 
leased asset."
"Right-of-use assets are reported in the balance 
sheet within the relevant line items for property, plant and equip-
ment."
"The depreciation expense on right-of-use assets is re-
ported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in sell-
ing and administrative expenses."
"The lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the present 
value of the future lease payments."
"Subsequent to initial recog-
nition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to 
reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income 
statement impact, by the lease payments made."
"Lease liabilities 
are reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is 
reported as part of net interest result."
"In the cash flow statement, 
both the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease pay-
ments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities."
"The lease payments to be taken into account to measure the 
right-of-use asset and the lease liability comprise fixed pay-
ments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an 
interest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under 
residual value guarantees."
"If it is reasonably certain that a pur-
chase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant 
payments are also included."
"Payments for periods for which the 
lessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only in-
cluded in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the 
termination option will not be exercised."
"For the purposes of as-
sessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and 
circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or 
not to exercise the option."
"IFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a gen-
eral rule using the interest rate implicit in the lease."
"However, 
since the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group 
cannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the 
basis of the incremental borrowing rate."
"The incremental borrowing rate comprises the risk-free interest 
rate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a pre-
mium for the credit risk."
"Specific risks attached to an asset are 
generally not taken into account, given that collateral received in 
the context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant 
within the BMW Group."
"Determining which items are to be counted as lease payments – 
including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments 
– and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and 
assumptions that may differ from actual outcomes."
"As lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemp-
tions available for short-term leases and leases of low-value  
assets."
"Group products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased 
products under operating leases are measured at manufactur-
ing cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each 
case including initial direct costs."
"All leased products are depre-
ciated over the period of the lease using the straight-line method 
down to their expected residual value."
"Where the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset’s 
carrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are rec-
ognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over 
the remaining term of the lease."
"If the recoverable amount is 
lower than the asset’s carrying amount, an impairment loss is 
recognised for the shortfall."
"A test is carried out at each balance 
sheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised 
in prior years no longer exists or has decreased."
"In such cases, 
the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable 
amount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset’s amor-
tised cost."
"Assumptions and estimations are required regarding future re-
sidual values, since these represent a significant part of future 
cash inflows."
"Relevant factors to be considered include the trend 
in market prices and demand on the pre-owned automobile mar-
ket."
"The expected change in the drive-system mix going forward, 
which is subject to regular analysis, is also taken into account."
"The BMW Group has developed and implemented methods and 
processes that enable sustainability aspects of residual value 
risks, particularly climate-related aspects, to be appropriately as-
sessed and managed."
"However, the transition to new drive systems will stretch 
over a period of time."
"Under these circumstances, regulatory as-
pects, customer behaviour and the structure of the product range 
all have to be taken into account."
"To varying degrees, the afore-
mentioned aspects will play a role in bringing about changes to 
the existing product portfolio over the coming years."
"The nature 
of these planned changes can already be anticipated today to 
some extent, highlighting potential but calculable risks for future 
operations."
"In addition to these various considera-
tions, the vehicle portfolio subject to residual value risks is re-
measured on a quarterly basis, allowing new aspects to be incor-
porated in the valuation at an early stage."
"In this case, valuations 
relevant for new business which are subject to the same turn of 
events would also be adjusted."
"The forecasting models used by 
the BMW Group are subject to regular review and can be supple-
mented where appropriate to include aspects relating to changes 
in the market."
"Using this approach, upward or downward adjustments can be 
made to the forecast value on the basis of a range of scenario 
analyses."
"The assumptions are based on internally available his-
torical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of 
external institutions."
"Furthermore, assumptions are regularly val-
idated by comparison with external data."
"Certain types of con-
tracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding whether 
they give rise to operating leases or receivables from sales  
financing."
"Investments accounted for using the equity method are 
measured – provided no impairment has been recognised – at 
cost of investment adjusted for the Group’s share of earnings 
and changes in equity capital."
"If there is any indication that an 
investment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the 
basis of the discounted cash flow method."
"An indicator exists, for 
example, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, 
the loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid 
insolvency."
"With the exception of lease receivables financial assets are 
measured on initial recognition at their fair value."
"Financial as-
sets include, in particular, other investments, receivables from 
sales financing, finance-related receivables, trade receivables 
and cash and cash equivalents."
"As a general rule, initial recogni-
tion takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to 
a contract."
"In the case of so-called “regular way” purchases or 
sales of non-derivative financial assets, initial recognition takes 
place at the settlement date."
"Financial assets are derecognised 
when contractual cash flows attached to them have expired or 
are transferred and all significant risks and rewards have been 
passed on to the acquirer."
"Depending on the business model and the structure of contrac-
tual cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at 
amortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at 
fair value through profit or loss."
"The category “measured at fair 
value through comprehensive income” at the BMW Group com-
prises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used 
for liquidity management purposes."
"In the BMW Group, selected 
marketable securities, shares in investment funds, money mar-
ket funds and convertible bonds are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely 
represent payments of principal and interest."
"The BMW Group does not make use of the option to measure 
equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive in-
come or debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss."
"The market values of financial instruments measured at fair 
value are determined on the basis of market information avail-
able at the balance sheet date, such as quoted prices or using 
appropriate measurement methods, in particular the discounted 
cash flow method."
"Items reported under other investments within the scope of 
IFRS 9 are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Invest-
ments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated com-
panies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included 
in other investments."
"Receivables from sales financing are measured as a general 
rule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method."
"The transferred receivables are not derecognised and therefore 
remain on the BMW Group’s balance sheet."
"For this reason, re-
ceivables from sales financing fulfil the criteria of the ”hold” busi-
ness model."
"Receivables from sales financing also include finance lease re-
ceivables which are measured at the amount of the net invest-
ment in the lease."
"This balance sheet line item also includes op-
erating lease receivables at the end of the reporting period."
"The 
related vehicles are reported within the line item “Leased  
products”."
"With the exception of receivables from operating leases and 
trade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach 
described in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets."
"Under the general approach, loss allowances are measured on 
initial recognition on the basis of the expected 12-month credit 
loss (stage 1)."
"If the credit loss risk at the end of the reporting 
period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the im-
pairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime ex-
pected credit losses (stage 2 – general approach)."
"The measure-
ment of the change in default risk is based on a comparison of 
the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of 
the reporting period."
"The default risk at the end of each reporting 
period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key 
performance indicators and any overdue payments."
"For the purposes of 
allocating an item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit 
risk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since in-
itial recognition."
"As a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is 
in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objec-
tive indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency 
proceedings."
"Credit-impaired assets are identified as such on the 
basis of this definition of default."
"In the case of credit-impaired 
assets which had not been credit-impaired at the time they were 
acquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at 
an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3)."
"This 
is the case regardless of whether the general or simplified ap-
proach is applied."
"In the case of stage 3 assets, interest income 
is calculated on the asset’s carrying amount less any impairment 
loss."
"In addition, post-model adjustments are recorded if the risk is not 
fully covered by the standard models."
"The BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no 
reasonable expectation of recovery."
"This may be the case, for in-
stance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or 
other sources of income to service the debt."
"Loss allowances relating to the balance sheet line item “Receiv-
ables from sales financing” are determined primarily on the basis 
of past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue re-
ceivables, rating classes and scoring information."
"Forward-looking information (for instance forecasts of key per-
formance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past 
experience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to ac-
tual credit losses."
"Loss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily 
on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts."
"Further-
more, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used 
alongside the latest forecasts of key performance indicators 
when determining the level of valuation allowances."
"These sce-
narios are based on local analyses and take into account, for ex-
ample, anticipated political and economic developments."
"Input factors available on the market, such as ratings and prob-
abilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowances for 
cash and cash equivalents, financial assets, receivables from 
subsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an invest-
ment is held."
"In the case of marketable securities and investment 
funds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate 
financial assets with a low default risk to different stages."
"Accord-
ingly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allo-
cated to stage 1."
"Financial assets include in particular marketable securities and 
shares in investment funds as well as derivative financial instru-
ments."
"Derivative financial instruments are used within the BMW 
Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest 
rate, fair value and market price risks."
"Derivative financial instru-
ments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair 
value."
"Depending on their market value at measurement date, 
these financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet line 
items “Financial assets” or “Financial liabilities”."
Fair values are determined on the basis of valuation models.
"Ob-
servable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are 
taken into account in the measurement of derivative financial in-
struments."
"Furthermore, the Group’s own credit risk and that of 
counterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default 
swap values for market contracts with matching terms."
"The BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks 
arising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial as-
sets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount."
"Portfo-
lio-based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments 
and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative fi-
nancial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the rel-
ative fair value approach (net method)."
"Fair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks 
relating to financial liabilities."
"The currency basis is not desig-
nated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross cur-
rency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges."
"Accordingly, changes in the market value of such components 
are recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other eq-
uity."
"Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other fi-
nancial result within the income statement over the term of the 
hedging relationship."
"The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) 
are reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales fi-
nancing or financial liabilities."
"Interest rate risks are hedged on 
the basis of the present value of net cash flows relating to fixed 
income assets (on the asset side) less cash flows relating to vari-
able-rate financing (on the liabilities side)."
"The net cash flow de-
termined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding in-
terest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate 
risk."
"Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a 
monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking 
account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio."
"Fair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other 
financial result."
"The time values of option transactions and the interest compo-
nent – including the currency basis – of forward currency con-
tracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in 
the case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow hedges."
"Changes in the fair value of such components are recorded as 
costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other  
equity."
"Amounts recorded in accumulated other equity from cur-
rency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related 
hedged item is recognised in profit or loss."
"In the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as 
cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full 
as part of the hedging relationship."
"Amounts recorded in accu-
mulated other equity are included in the carrying amount of in-
ventories on initial recognition."
"Ineffectiveness arising on cash 
flow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the 
impact of prematurely terminated hedging relationships is recog-
nised in other operating income and expenses."
"Deferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differ-
ences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and lia-
bilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures, 
as well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it 
is probable that they can be utilised."
"As an exception to this, de-
ferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the implementation 
of the Pillar Two rules are not recognised."
"Further information is 
provided in ↗ note 5."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is real-
ised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date."
"The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each bal-
ance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future 
financial years."
"If with a probability of more than 50% future tax 
benefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation 
allowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets."
"The calcula-
tion of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with 
regard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of re-
covery of deferred tax assets."
"These assumptions take account 
of forecast operating results, announced legislative changes in 
connection with climate change and the impact on earnings of 
the reversal of taxable temporary differences."
"Since future busi-
ness developments cannot be predicted with certainty and to 
some extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the meas-
urement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty."
"This is particularly the case if it is intended 
that profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to main-
tain the substance and expand the volume of business of the en-
tities concerned."
"Current income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on 
the basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries."
"To 
the extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treat-
ment and amount of tax items presented in the financial state-
ments, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities 
may take a different position."
"As a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered inde-
pendently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes."
"If it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will 
be accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the 
most likely amount of the tax treatment when determining tax-
able profit and the tax base."
"Inventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are 
generally stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net 
realisable value."
"Work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of 
manufacturing cost and net realisable value."
"Manufacturing cost 
comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manu-
facturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of produc-
tion-related overheads."
"This includes production-related depre-
ciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of ad-
ministrative and social costs."
"Financing costs are not included in 
the acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories."
"Inventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial ser-
vices business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net re-
alisable value."
"Cash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and 
cash at bank with an original term of up to three months."
"With the 
exception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at amortised cost."
"For these 
purposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the 
case of financial liabilities allocated to the category “measured at 
fair value through profit or loss”."
"Subsequent to initial recognition, 
liabilities are – with the exception of derivative financial instru-
ments – measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method."
"Provisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit 
credit method."
"Under this method, not only obligations relating to 
known vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but 
also the effect of future expected increases in pensions and sal-
aries."
"The calculation is based on independent actuarial valua-
tions which take into account the relevant biometric factors."
"In the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset 
against plan assets measured at their fair value."
"If the plan as-
sets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for re-
coverability."
"In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reim-
bursement or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an 
asset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of 
the present value of the future economic benefits attached to the 
plan assets."
"For funded plans, in cases where the obligation ex-
ceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension provi-
sions."
"The calculation of the amount of the provision requires assump-
tions to be made with regard to discount rates, pension trends, 
employee fluctuation and the life expectancy of employees, 
among other things."
"Discount rates are determined by reference 
to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality 
fixed-interest corporate bonds."
"Net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net in-
terest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented 
separately within the financial result."
"All other costs relating to 
allocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by func-
tion in the income statement."
"Past service cost arises where a BMW Group company intro-
duces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable un-
der an existing plan."
"This cost is recognised immediately in the 
income statement."
"Similarly, gains and losses arising on the set-
tlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in 
the income statement."
"Remeasurement of the net liability can result from changes in the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of 
the plan assets or the asset ceiling."
"Remeasurement can result, 
amongst others, from changes in financial and demographic pa-
rameters, as well as changes following the portfolio develop-
ment."
"Remeasurements are recognised immediately through 
other comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within rev-
enue reserves)."
"Other provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a 
present legal or factual obligation towards a third party arising 
from past events, the settlement of which is probable and when 
the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated."
"Provi-
sions with a remaining period of more than one year are meas-
ured at their net present value."
"The measurement of provisions for statutory and non-
statutory warranty obligations (statutory, contractual and 
voluntary) involves estimations."
"In addition to manufacturer 
warranties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various fur-
ther standard (assurance type) warranties depending on the 
product and sales market."
"No provisions are recognised for ad-
ditionally offered service packages that are treated as separate 
performance obligations."
"Provisions for statutory and non-statutory warranties are recog-
nised at the point in time when control over the goods is trans-
ferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided 
to introduce new warranty measures."
"With respect to the level of 
the provision, estimations are made in particular based on past 
experience of damage claims and processes."
"Future potential re-
pair costs and price increases per product and market are also 
taken into account."
"Provisions for warranties for all companies of 
the BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new 
information, with the impact of any changes recognised in the in-
come statement."
Further information is provided in ↗ note 34.
"Sim-
ilar estimates are also made in conjunction with the measure-
ment of expected reimbursement claims."
"The recognition and measurement of provisions for litigation 
and liability risks necessitate making assumptions in order to 
determine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the 
duration of the legal dispute."
"The assumptions made, especially 
the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are sub-
ject to a high degree of uncertainty."
"The appropriateness of as-
sumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments under-
taken both by management and external experts, such as law-
yers."
"If new developments arise in the future that result in a dif-
ferent assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly."
"If the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled 
and the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the po-
tential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability."
"This includes all persons in key positions of 
the Company, as well as close members of their families or inter-
mediary entities."
"In the case of the BMW Group, this also applies to members of 
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board."
"Details 
relating to these individuals and entities are provided in ↗ note [41] 
and in the list of investments disclosed in ↗ note [47]."
"Share-based remuneration programmes that provide for set-
tlement in shares or a cash payment with a direct obligation to 
invest in shares of BMW AG common stock are measured at their 
fair value at grant date."
"The related expense is recognised as 
personnel expense in the income statement over the vesting pe-
riod and offset against capital reserves."
"Share-based remuneration programmes expected to be settled 
in cash are revalued to their fair value at each balance sheet date 
between the grant date and the settlement date and on the set-
tlement date itself."
"The expense is recognised as personnel ex-
pense in the income statement over the vesting period and pre-
sented in the balance sheet as a provision."
"The share-based remuneration programme for Board of Man-
agement members and senior heads of department entitles 
BMW AG to elect whether to settle its commitments in cash or 
with shares of BMW AG common stock."
"Based on the decision to 
settle in cash, the share-based remuneration programmes for 
Board of Management members and senior heads of depart-
ment are accounted for as cash-settled, share-based remunera-
tion programmes."
"Further information on share-based remuner-
ation programmes is provided in ↗ note [42]."
"An analysis of revenues by segment is shown in the explanatory 
comments on segment information provided in ↗ note [46]."
"Revenues from the sale of products and related goods are gen-
erated primarily in the Automotive segment and, to a lesser ex-
tent, in the Motorcycles segment."
"Revenues from the sales of 
products previously leased to customers, income from lease in-
stalments and interest income on credit financing and finance 
leases are allocated to the Financial Services segment."
"Other income relates mainly to the Automotive segment and the 
Financial Services segment."
"The major part of revenues expected to arise from the Group’s 
order book at the end of the reporting period relates to the sale 
of vehicles."
"Revenues resulting from those sales will be recog-
nised in the next financial year."
"The services included in vehicle sale contracts that will be recog-
nised as revenues in subsequent years represent only an insig-
nificant portion of expected revenues."
"Accordingly, use has been 
made of the practical expedient contained in IFRS 15, permitting 
an entity not to disclose information on a quantitative basis due 
to the short-term nature of items and the lack of informational 
value of such disclosures."
"Interest income on credit financing and finance leases includes 
interest calculated on the basis of the effective interest method 
totalling € 4,081 million (2022: € 3,656 million)."
"This interest 
income is not reported separately in the income statement as it 
is not significant compared to total Group revenues."
"Impairment losses recognised in the income statement 2023 in 
connection with receivables from sales financing amounted to 
€ 168 million (2022: € 649 million)."
"In view of the fact that the 
impairment losses are of minor importance compared to total 
Group cost of sales, they have not been disclosed separately in 
the income statement."
"The expense 
for additions to provisions includes litigation and other legal risks."
"Income from the reversal of and expenses for the recognition of 
impairment allowances and write-downs relate mainly to impair-
ment allowances on receivables."
"Expenses for impairment allowances recognised on receivables 
from contracts with customers amounted to € 15 million 
(2022: € 61million)."
"In the financial year 2022, expenses for impairment allowances 
included the write-down of receivables from a non-consolidated 
Russian subsidiary, which negatively impacted the Other Entities 
segment."
"Detailed information is provided in the ↗ BMW Group 
Report 2022, note [4] to the Group Financial Statements."
"In the previous year, steepening yield curves had a positive im-
pact on the discount unwinding result."
"Further information 
on this matter is provided in the ↗ BMW Group Report 2022, note [3] to 
the Group Financial Statements."
"The negative sundry other financial result was attributable in par-
ticular to the unfavourable fair value development of interest rate 
hedges as a consequence of the decline in yield curves and port-
folio effects."
"The previous year’s figure included the positive im-
pact of interest rate hikes in the financial year 2022."
"The tax income resulting from the change in the valuation allow-
ance on deferred tax assets relating to tax losses available for 
carryforward and temporary differences amounted to € 19 mil-
lion (2022: expense of € 103 million)."
"The BMW Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two 
model rules aimed at ensuring a global minimum taxation rate of 
15%."
"Under these rules, the BMW Group will be required pay a 
top-up tax to the extent that the Pillar Two specific tax rate in 
each jurisdiction where it operates falls below the minimum rate 
of 15%."
"The Pillar Two model rules have been implemented in 
Germany with effect for financial years beginning after 31 De-
cember 2023."
"The BMW Group is therefore not subject to a Pillar 
Two tax expense for the financial year 2023."
"The impact of the 
Pillar Two model rules from the financial year 2024 onwards is 
currently being assessed."
"For this purpose, the jurisdictions that 
could be affected by a top-up tax based on a preliminary Pillar 
Two calculation have been analysed for the BMW Group, taking 
into account the statutory temporary simplification rules (for so-
called “transitional safe harbours”)."
"Based on the results of the 
analysis to date, the tax expense arising in the relevant jurisdic-
tions is estimated to be immaterial for the BMW Group."
"The BMW 
Group is already applying the exemption relating to the recogni-
tion of deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with Pillar 
Two."
Further information is provided in ↗ note 5.
"Deferred taxes are determined on the basis of tax rates which 
are currently applicable or expected to apply in the relevant na-
tional jurisdictions when the amounts are recovered."
"These ranged in the 
financial year 2023 between 9.0% and 40.0% (2022: between 
9.0% and 40.0%)."
"The tax increases due to non-deductible expenses were mainly 
attributable to withholding tax expenses."
"Other variances included a net positive amount of € 304 million 
(2022: net negative amount of € 54 million) attributable to de-
ferred tax effects relating to prior periods."
"This in-
cludes tax losses available for carryforward amounting to 
€ 382 million (2022: € 416 million), on which a valuation allow-
ance of € 129 million (2022: € 141 million) was recognised on 
the related deferred tax asset."
"Of these loss carryforwards, 
€ 349 million (2022: € 382 million) can be used indefinitely, 
while € 33 million (2022: € 34 million) expires after one to three 
years."
"A net surplus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities 
amounting to € 95 million (2022: € 1,966 million) is reported for 
entities that have suffered tax losses in the financial year 2023 
or the preceding year."
"The basis for the recognition of deferred 
taxes is the BMW Group business model or management’s as-
sessment that there is material evidence that the entities will 
generate future taxable profit, against which deductible tempo-
rary differences can be offset."
"Capital losses available for carryforward in the UK which do not 
relate to ongoing operations decreased due to changes in con-
solidated group companies and exchange rate factors and stood 
at € 1,845 million (2022: € 1,856 million) at the end of the year 
under report."
"As in previous years, deferred tax assets recog-
nised on these tax losses amounting to € 461 million (2022: 
€ 464 million) were fully written down since they can only be uti-
lised against future capital gains."
"Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for 
each relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities."
"Temporary 
differences of this kind, for which no deferred taxes were recog-
nised, amounted to € 36,081 million (2022: € 32,882 million)."
"No computation was made of the potential impact of income 
taxes on the grounds of proportionality."
"Deferred tax liabilities on expected dividends amounted to 
€ 187 million (2022: € 199 million) and related primarily to divi-
dends from foreign subsidiaries."
"The tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by 
German and foreign tax authorities."
"Taking account of numerous 
factors – including interpretations, commentaries and legal deci-
sions relating to the various tax jurisdictions as well as past ex-
perience – adequate provision has been made, to the extent 
identifiable and probable, for potential future tax obligations."
"In the case of preferred stock, the calculation of earnings per 
share and the average number of shares in circulation only takes 
account of shares of preferred stock that are entitled to receive a 
dividend in each of the relevant financial years."
"As in the previous 
year, diluted earnings per share correspond to basic earnings per 
share."
"The total pension expense for defined contribution plans of the 
BMW Group amounted to € 179 million (2022: € 175 million)."
"Employer contributions paid to state pension insurance schemes 
totalled € 806 million (2022: € 750 million)."
"These leases are ex-
pected to give rise to future cash outflows amounting to 
€ 480 million (2022: € 873 million)."
"The BMW Group is also party to long-term supply contracts for 
battery cells that give rise to fixed and variable payment obliga-
tions."
"Based on the current interpretation, these arrangements 
include a lease component in accordance with IFRS 16."
"The fixed 
payment obligations arising in conjunction with such IFRS 16 
compatible contracts amount to € 749 million and will fall due 
with effect from the financial year 2026 after series deliveries 
commence."
"Cash outflows for leases in the financial year 2023 amounted to 
€ 675 million (2022: € 681 million)."
"In addition, cash outflows 
for right-of-use assets paid in advance amounted to € 674 mil-
lion (2022: € 732 million)."
"Information on right-of-use assets, lease liabilities as well as fur-
ther explanatory comments are provided in ↗ note [6], ↗ note [20],  
↗ note [22] and ↗ note [36]."
"The 
agreements have, in part, extension and purchase options."

The fee expense pursuant to § 314 (1) no."
"The audit of 
financial statements comprises mainly the audit of the Group Fi-
nancial Statements and the separate financial statements of 
BMW AG and subsidiaries, and all work related thereto, including 
the review of the Interim Group Financial Statements."
"Other at-
testation services include mainly project-related audits, comfort 
letters and statutorily prescribed, contractually agreed or volun-
tarily commissioned attestation work."
"No tax advisory or other 
services were provided in the financial year 2023 or in the previ-
ous year."
"18 Government grants and government assistance 
Income from asset-related and performance-related grants, 
amounting to € 98 million (2022: € 118 million) and € 215 mil-
lion (2022: € 172 million) respectively, was recognised in the in-
come statement in 2023."
"These amounts relate mainly to public sector grants aimed at the 
promotion of regional structures as well as to subsidies received 
for plant expansions and development."
"In the previous year, the amounts re-
ported for equity accounted investments comprised a negative 
amount of € 395 million within currency translation differences 
and positive amounts of € 220 million and € 93 million within 
derivative financial instruments and costs of hedging respec-
tively."
"The hedging effects of derivative financial instruments that are 
subsequently recycled to the acquisition cost of inventories are 
not included in other comprehensive income after tax."
2 Including advance payments for right-of-use assets amounting to € 79 million.
"3 Including assets under construction amounting to € 4,565 million."
2 Including advance payments for right-of-use assets amounting to € 160 million.
"3 Including assets under construction amounting to € 2,502 million."
"Also included 
are subsidies for tool costs, licences, purchased development 
projects, emissions allowances, software and purchased cus-
tomer bases."
"Other intangible assets include brand-name rights amounting to 
€ 96 million (2022: € 95 million) which are allocated to the Au-
tomotive segment and are not subject to scheduled amortisation 
since their useful life is deemed to be indefinite."
"The brand-name 
rights are, to an extent, subject to a limited right of ownership."
"Intangible 
assets 
also 
include 
goodwill 
of 
€ 33 million 
(2022: € 33 million) allocated to the Automotive excluding BMW 
Brilliance

unit 
(CGU) 
and 
goodwill 
of 
€ 1,107 million (2022: € 1,182 million) allocated to the BMW

CGU."
"Goodwill 
amounting 
to 
€ 347 million 
(2022: € 347 million) related to the Financial Services CGU."
"As in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise 
impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intan- 
gible assets in 2023."
"As in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a 
cost component of intangible assets in 2023."
"In 2023, government grants totalling € 2 million (2022: € 0 mil-
lion) were deducted from the acquisition cost of intangible assets 
for the first time."
"These grants include public sector funds aimed 
at promoting development."
"22 Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use 
assets arising from leasing) 
No impairment losses were recognised in 2023, as in the previ-
ous year."
"As in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a 
cost component of property, plant and equipment in 2023."
"Right-of-use assets arising from leases of land and buildings re-
late primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser ex-
tent, to selling and production premises."
"In order to secure these 
premises and, in the interests of flexibility, the property rental 
agreements concerned often contain extension and termination 
options."
"In 2023, government grants totalling € 121 million (2022: 
€ 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of property, 
plant and equipment for the first time."
"These amounts relate 
mainly to public sector grants aimed at the promotion of regional 
structures as well as to subsidies received for plant expansions."
"The review of useful lives did not lead to 
any material adjustments in the financial year 2023."
"Income 
from the reversal of impairment losses amounted to € 274 mil-
lion (2022: € 282 million)."
"In 
2023, 
public 
sector 
grants 
totalling 
€ 252 million 
(2022: € 0 million) were deducted from the acquisition cost of 
leased products for the first time."
"These amounts relate mainly 
to investment tax credits in the form of tax credits for electric ve-
hicles."
"It is expected that the investment tax credits can be uti-
lised."
"The actual utilisation of investment tax credits will, how-
ever, depend on the extent to which they can be offset against 
income tax liabilities and is therefore subject to a degree of  
uncertainty."

"Collateral assets comprise mainly customary collateral (banking 
deposits) arising on the sale of asset-backed financing instru-
ments."
"Write-
downs to net realisable value in the financial year 2023 
amounted to € 189 million (2022: € 112 million), while rever-
sals of write-downs amounted to € 13 million (2022: € 11 mil-
lion)."
"The expense recorded in conjunction with inventories during the 
financial year 2023 amounted to € 81,497 million (2022: 
€ 76,014 million)."
"At 31 December 2023, the carrying amounts of inventories ex-
pected to be realised after more than 12 months amount to € 86 
million (2022: € 98 million)."
"Expenses for impairment losses and income from the reversal of 
impairment losses are not significant for the BMW Group and are 
therefore not reported separately in the income statement."
"The issued share capital and 
the number of shares were reduced by € 24,123,400 in 2023 
following the redemption of 22,199,529 shares of common 
stock and 1,923,871 shares of preferred stock."
"These treasury 
shares had been acquired in conjunction with the first share buy-
back programme 2022/2023."
"The amount of the share capital 
reduction was reclassified to capital reserves."
All Company stock is issued to bearer.
"Preferred stock, to which 
no voting rights are attached, bears an additional dividend of 
€ 0.02 per share."
"BMW AG is authorised to issue shares of non-voting preferred 
stock amounting to nominal € 5.0 million prior to 15 May 2024."
"At the end of the reporting period, 0.3 million shares of these 
amounting to € 0.3 million remained available for issue."
"Capital reserves 
Capital reserves include mainly premiums arising from the issue 
of shares, and totalled € 2,456 million (2022: € 2,432 million)."
"Revenue reserves 
Revenue reserves include the non-distributed earnings of com-
panies consolidated in the Group Financial Statements."
"In addi-
tion, remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation for 
pension plans are also presented in revenue reserves."
"Based on the num-
ber of shares at 31 December 2023 entitled to receive a divi-
dend, the proposed dividend represents a total payout of € 3.8 
billion."
"The proposal for the appropriation of unappropriated profit takes 
into account 4,218,363 treasury shares of common stock and 
942,892 treasury shares of preferred stock held directly or indi-
rectly by the Company at 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with 
§ 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act, these shares are not 
entitled to receive a dividend."
"The number of shares entitled to receive a dividend may change 
prior to the Annual General Meeting."
"In this case, based on an 
unchanged distribution per share of common and preferred stock 
entitled to receive a dividend, a correspondingly amended reso-
lution concerning the appropriation of profit will be submitted to 
the Annual General Meeting."
"The proposed distribution was not recognised as a liability in the 
Group Financial Statements."
"The buyback authorisation 
remains valid until 10 May 2027."
"In conjunction with this authorisation, on 30 June 2022 the 
Board of Management of BMW AG resolved the first of a number 
of share buyback programmes via the stock exchange."
"Under 
this initial programme, BMW AG was authorised to acquire treas-
ury shares of common and preferred stock amounting to a max-
imum of € 1.85 billion and € 0.15 billion respectively."
"The share 
buyback programme was launched in July 2022 and completed 
on 30 June 2023."
"On 3 May 2023, the Board of Management of BMW AG ap-
proved a second share buyback programme via the stock ex-
change."
"Under this programme, BMW AG is authorised to ac-
quire treasury shares of common and preferred stock amounting 
to a maximum of € 1.65 billion and € 0.35 billion respectively."
"The programme commenced immediately following completion 
of the first buyback programme and will run until 31 December 
2025 at the latest."
"This corresponds to around 3.6% 
of share capital prior to the redemption of the shares and the re-
duction of issued share capital."
"Up to 31 December 2023, a total of 4,218,363 shares of com-
mon stock had been bought back via the stock exchange at an 
average price per share of € 98.38 and a total acquisition cost of 
€ 415 million, corresponding to 0.64% of share capital."
"The 
shares concerned are held by BMW AG as treasury shares at the 
end of the reporting period."
"Up to 31 December 2023, a total of 942,892 shares of preferred 
stock had been bought back via the stock exchange at an aver-
age price per share of € 90.15 and a total acquisition cost of 
€ 85 million, corresponding to 0.14% of share capital."
"The 
shares concerned are held by BMW AG as treasury shares at the 
end of the reporting period."
"On 19 September 2023, the Board of Management resolved a 
share buyback programme for shares of common stock for em-
ployees (“Share Buyback Programme Employee Shares 2023”) 
which was carried out during the period from 8 November to 27 
November 2023."
"The acquisition of shares of common stock un-
der this programme serves the sole purpose of fulfilling the obli-
gations arising from the Employee Share Programme."
"Based on 
the applications received from eligible employees, 1,290,000 
shares of common stock were bought back and subsequently 
sold to employees at a preferential price of € 71.47 per share."
"These shares are entitled to receive dividends for the first time 
with effect from the financial year 2023."
"Capital management disclosures 
The BMW Group’s objectives with regard to capital management 
are to safeguard over the long-term the Group’s ability to con-
tinue as a going concern and to provide an adequate return to 
shareholders."
"The capital structure is managed in order to meet needs arising 
from changes in economic conditions and the risks of the under-
lying assets."
"The BMW Group is not subject to any unified external minimum 
equity capital requirements."
"Within the Financial Services seg-
ment, however, there are a number of individual entities which 
are subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory 
banking authorities."
"In order to manage its capital structure, the BMW Group uses 
various instruments, including the amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders and share buybacks."
"Moreover, the BMW Group 
actively manages debt capital, carrying out funding activities with 
a target debt structure in mind."
"A key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the ob-
jective to achieve matching maturities for the Group’s financing 
requirements."
"In order to reduce non-systematic risk, the BMW 
Group uses a variety of financial instruments available on the 
world’s capital markets to achieve diversification."
"32 Non-controlling interests 
The 25% non-controlling interests of other shareholders in the 
subsidiary BMW Brilliance represent a significant item in the 
BMW Group’s balance sheet."
"Total comprehensive income allocated to the other shareholders 
of BMW Brilliance amounts to € 615 million (2022: € 580 mil-
lion)."
"A dividend of € 1,447 million (2022: € 1,445 million) was 
distributed to these shareholders during the financial year 2023."
"At 31 December 2023, non-controlling interests in BMW Bril-
liance amounted to € 2,970 million (2022: € 3,709 million)."
"Defined benefit plans may be covered by provisions or pension 
assets."
"In Germany, pension obligations of the BMW Group are 
almost entirely covered by assets transferred to BMW Trust e.V., 
Munich (BMW Trust), in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Ar-
rangement (CTA) (funded plan)."
"In addition, funded plans also 
exist in the UK as well as in the USA, Switzerland, Belgium and 
Japan."
"In the meantime, all of the main defined benefit plans 
have been closed for new entrants and replaced by defined con-
tribution plans."
"The assumptions stated below, which depend on the economic 
situation in the relevant country, are used to measure the defined 
benefit obligation of each pension plan."
"Germany 
Employer-funded as well as employee-funded benefit plans exist 
in Germany."
"In addition to retirement benefits, pension benefits 
also include disability and surviving dependents’ benefits."
"The 
level of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with 
§ 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz)."
"Two employer-funded pension plans are in place that are based 
on defined contributions for which the level of benefits depends 
on developments on the capital markets."
"Benefits granted by the 
two plans are funded by a combination of the payment of fixed 
monthly contributions by the Company, a deferred remuneration 
option for employees and a matching contribution by the Com-
pany."
"Further contributions are made on the basis of the BMW 
Group’s performance."
"A further plan is in place that is funded en-
tirely out of deferred remuneration."
"Due to the minimum interest 
rate guaranteed by the BMW Group, these plans are all classified 
as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19."
"In addition to 
the above plans, an employer-funded, defined benefit pension 
plan with lifelong pension benefits remains in place which is now 
closed to new entrants."
"The pension benefit is calculated by mul-
tiplying a fixed amount by the number of completed years of ser-
vice."
"Only employees who have not agreed to a one-time option 
to switch to the defined contribution system will receive future in-
creases in entitlements under this plan."
"The assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW 
Trust (a German association) in accordance with a CTA."
"The rep-
resentative bodies of the association are the Board of Directors 
and the Members’ General Meeting."
"BMW Trust currently has 
seven members and three members of the Board of Directors 
elected by the Members’ General Meeting."
"The Board of Directors 
is responsible for investments, drawing up and deciding on in-
vestment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those 
guidelines."
"The members of the association can be employees, 
employee representatives, senior executives and members of the 
Board of Management of BMW AG."
"An ordinary Members' Gen-
eral Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with 
a range of matters, including receiving and approving the associ-
ation’s annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Direc-
tors and adopting changes to the association’s statutes."
"UK 
Defined benefit plans exist in the UK which are closed for all plan 
participants."
Vested benefits remain in place.
"New benefits are 
covered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan."
"The defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW 
Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees 
Limited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act inde-
pendently of the BMW Group."
"BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farn-
borough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trus-
tees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees."
"A minimum of one 
third of the trustees must be elected by plan participants."
"The 
trustees represent the interests of plan participants and decide 
on investment strategies."
"Funding contributions to the funds are 
determined in agreement with the BMW Group."
"Plan assets in Germany, the UK and other countries comprised 
the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
In the financial year 2024, disbursements out of plan assets are 
expected to exceed the employer’s contributions to plan assets 
by € 298 million."
"Plan assets of the BMW Group include own 
transferable financial instruments amounting to € 17 million 
(2022: € 7 million)."
"The BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from defined 
benefit plans and defined contribution plans with a minimum re-
turn guarantee."
"The discount rates used to calculate pension ob-
ligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore influ-
ence the level of the obligations."
"Furthermore, changes in other 
actuarial parameters, such as expected rates of inflation, also 
have an impact on pension obligations."
"In order to reduce cur-
rency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either in-
vested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by 
means of currency derivatives."
"As part of the internal reporting 
procedures and for internal management purposes, financial 
risks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value-at-
risk approach by reference to the pension deficit."
"The investment 
strategy is also subject to regular review together with external 
consultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are struc-
tured to match the timing of pension payments and the expected 
development of pension obligations."
"In this way, fluctuations in 
pension provisions recognised in the balance sheet are reduced."
It is only possible to aggregate sensitivities to a limited extent.
"Since the change in obligation follows a non-linear pattern, 
estimates made on the basis of the specified sensitivities are only 
possible with this restriction."
"The calculation of sensitivities using 
ranges other than those specified could result in a dispropor-
tional change in the defined benefit obligation."
"In the UK, the sensitivity analysis for the pension level trend also 
takes account of restrictions due to caps and floors."
"Depending on when claims occur, it is possible that the BMW 
Group may be called upon to fulfil the warranty or guarantee ob-
ligations over the whole period of the warranty or guarantee."
"Warranty provisions include amounts recognised in connection 
with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler."
"Expected reimburse-
ment claims at 31 December 2023 amounted to € 819 million 
(2022: € 872 million) and are disclosed within other assets (see 
↗ note [28])."
"Provisions for obligations for personnel and social expenses 
comprise mainly obligations relating to performance-related re-
muneration components, workforce measures as well as pre- 
retirement part-time working arrangements and long-service 
awards."
"The provisions for other obligations cover numerous specific 
risks and uncertain obligations, in particular for litigation and lia-
bility risks as well as risks relating to the order backlog."
"35 Income tax liabilities 
Current 
income 
tax 
liabilities 
totalling 
€ 1,401 million 
(2022: € 1,224 million) include € 50 million (2022: € 58 mil-

"Liabilities may be settled earlier than this depending on the tim-
ing of the underlying proceedings."
"Similarly, 
potential 
future 
cash 
outflows 
amounting 
to 
€ 1,639 million (2022: € 1,608 million) (undiscounted) have not 
been taken into account in the measurement of lease liabilities 
as it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be renewed (or 
not terminated)."
"These cash outflows relate to periods of up to 
90  years (2022: up to 61  years)."

with customers as well as deferred grants."
"Grants comprise mainly public sector funds to promote regional 
structures and which have been invested in the production plants 
in Brazil, China, Germany, Mexico, Austria and South Africa 
amongst others."
"The grants are partly subject to holding periods 
for the assets concerned of up to five years and/or minimum em-
ployment figures or minimum production figures."
"Grants and 
subsidies awarded before 31 December 2022 are released to 
income over the useful life of the assets to which they relate."
"38 Trade payables 
Trade payables mainly have a remaining term of up to one year."
"The BMW Group determines its best estimate of contingent lia-
bilities on the basis of the information available at the date of 
preparation of the Group Financial Statements."
"This assessment 
may change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of 
new information and circumstances."
"A part of the risks is covered 
by insurance."
"The EU Commission’s antitrust proceedings were settled on 8 
July 2021 (see ↗ note [10] to the BMW Group Financial State-
ments for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group 
Report 2021)."
"In addition, respective antitrust proceedings were opened 
against BMW AG by the Chinese State Administration for Market 
Regulation in March 2019 and the Korea Fair Trade Commission 
in May 2020."
"Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection 
with the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently fore-
seen, neither in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved."
"In April 2023, the South Korean antitrust authority imposed a 
fine of approximately 13 billion South Korean won (approxi-
mately € 9 million)."
"BMW AG will no longer take action against 
the authority’s decision."
"In relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits 
have been brought in the USA and Canada in the second half of 
2017, as well as several individual customers’ lawsuits in South 
Korea in June 2018."
"In the USA, the customer class actions were 
withdrawn in August 2021 and the dealer class action was dis-
missed in the final instance in June 2022."
"In Canada, the class 
action lawsuits have been discontinued without any payments 
made by BMW."
"The individual customers’ lawsuits in South Ko-
rea remain at an early stage."
"Further civil lawsuits based on the 
allegations are possible going forward."
"Further disclosures pur-
suant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present."
"Beginning in 2014, regulatory authorities have ordered the BMW 
Group to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags 
supplied by the Takata group of companies."
"Provision for the 
costs involved has been recognised within warranty provisions."
"In addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it 
cannot be ruled out that further vehicles of the BMW Group will 
be affected by future recall actions."
"Further disclosures pursuant 
to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present."
"In May 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
(NHTSA), an agency of the US federal government, requested a 
recall of airbags in the USA that are equipped with airbag inflat-
ors produced by ARC Automotive."
"Further implications for the 
BMW Group in other regions outside of North America as well as 
implications from class action lawsuits, which have been brought 
in this context against the BMW Group in the USA, cannot be  
 
 
 
 
estimated at present."
"Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 
cannot be provided at present."
"In March 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted in-
spections at the premises of automobile manufacturers and as-
sociations located in several member states."
"In parallel, the EC 
sent out formal requests for information to several automobile 
manufacturers, including BMW AG."
"The inspections and re-
quests for information concern possible collusion in relation to 
the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life vehicles and 
light commercial vehicles."
"The inspections were conducted in co-
ordination with the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which 
has initiated formal proceedings in respect of the UK market."
"The 
competition authorities allege that car manufacturers (i) coordi-
nated the remuneration to be paid to dismantlers for the provi-
sion of their services and (ii) agreed that issues related to end-
of-life vehicles should be dealt with in a non-competitive way."
"Appropriate risk provisions were recognised in the second quar-
ter 2022 in connection with these investigations."
"At the current 
stage of the investigations, further risks for the BMW Group in 
connection with the proceedings of the two authorities cannot be 
quantified at present."
"In December 2023, the South Korean anti-
trust authority conducted an inspection at the premises of sev-
eral car manufacturers, including BMW Korea."
"The investigation 
by the South Korean antitrust authority has the same back-
ground as the investigations of the European Commission and 
the UK Competition and Markets Authority."
"Due to the early stage 
of this investigation, it is also not possible to provide further in-
formation in this regard."

37.86 cannot be provided at present."
"Potential risks for the BMW 
Group cannot be quantified at the present time."
"Further disclo-
sures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present."
"In several recent judgements, the European Court of Justice has 
ruled on emission control systems in diesel vehicles and has sig-
nificantly tightened requirements pertaining to the justification of 
these systems."
"As a result of these new judgements by the Eu-
ropean Court of Justice, the interpretation of regulatory require-
ments for emission control systems is evolving."
"This is reflected, 
amongst other things, by the fact that established administrative 
practices of type approval authorities are being questioned from 
numerous sides."
"This development leads to a reassessment of 
civil proceedings pending in Germany due to the emissions per-
formance of BMW and MINI diesel vehicles."
"According to previ-
ously established case law of German national courts, damage 
claims could only be asserted on the basis of intentional damage 
inflicted in a manner offending common decency."
"An increase in the effort and complexity of the defence in 
individual cases, an increasing number of new court proceedings, 
increased legal risks and increased financial expenditure are to 
be expected."
"Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot 
be provided at present."
"In addition, the KBA determined in February 2024 that two func-
tionalities of the emission control system of the BMW vehicle 
model X3 with 2.0 litre diesel engine (EU5), built between Sep-
tember 2010 and March 2014 do not comply with legal require-
ments."
"The KBA views these functionalities as prohibited defeat 
devices."
"The BMW Group has filed a timely objection against this 
decision."
"Corrective measures are currently being coordinated 
with the responsible type approval authorities."
"Furthermore, the 
BMW Group is investigating whether and to what extent function-
alities of the emission control systems of this and other past die-
sel vehicle models comply with legal requirements and is in dia-
logue with the responsible authorities in this regard."
"Also, against 
the background of the development in case law referred to 
above, it is possible that further authorities and/or courts find 
fault with functionalities of the emission control systems or deem 
them as non-compliant with legal requirements."
"Given that the 
investigations will take some time, it is not currently possible to 
make any disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 with regard to pos-
sible measures to be taken, possible effects on administrative 
and civil court proceedings and any financial risks that may be 
related thereto."
"Furthermore, several BMW Group entities have been facing a 
number of diesel emissions-related court claims in England and 
Wales since November 2021 as well as in Scotland since March 
2023."
"In November 2023, the High Court approved a group liti-
gation regarding the proceeding in England and Wales."
"In De-
cember 2023, the court ordered that at least three out of the 16 
pending court proceedings against OEMs will proceed to trial 
from October 2024 onwards."
"The proceedings against two other 
OEMs have already been selected, and the selection of other 
OEM proceedings is expected to follow in March 2024."
"In Scot-
land, the court also approved the combination of relevant claims 
in group proceedings."
"It is estimated that any sued BMW Group 
entities will have to file their statement of defence in April 2024."
"Given that proceedings are still at an early stage, the probability, 
amount or timing of any liability cannot be determined at present."
"Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at 
present."
"The fair values are generally determined using the discounted 
cash flow method, taking into account the relevant risk of default."
"For the purposes of fair value measurement using the discounted 
cash flow method, expected future cash flows are discounted on 
the basis of up-to-date interest rate curves observable on the 
market."
"The fair values of receivables from sales financing are measured 
using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account cus-
tomer-specific credit risk."
"In view of the fact that these allow-
ances are calculated in part on the basis of internal information, 
receivables from sales financing are allocated to Level 3 in the 
level hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13."
"In the case of financial liabilities, own credit risk is taken into ac-
count based on credit default swaps available on the market, so 
that the fair values of these items are allocated to Level 2."
"For all other financial instruments not listed here that are meas-
ured at amortised cost, the carrying amount corresponds to the 
fair value."
"For this reason, they are not presented separately."
"As a general rule, any transfers between fair-value hierarchy lev-
els are made at the end of the relevant reporting period."
"In the previous year, derivative instruments used to hedge raw 
material price risks amounting to € 71 million were reclassified 
from Level 3 to Level 2 as sufficient observable market data was 
available for the first time for the instruments concerned."
"The valuation of unlisted equity 
instruments is determined primarily using the market-based ap-
proach."
"In particular, the financing rounds that take place within 
the private equity sector – usually on a regular basis at intervals 
of approximately 12 to 24 months – represent a significant input 
factor for these purposes."
"In addition, the investment advisor 
provides the external fund manager with relevant, investment-
specific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly)."
"The 
latter subsequently assesses the underlying individual com- 
panies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private 
Equity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV)."
"As part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund 
manager reviews the investment-specific milestones, including 
an analysis of financial, technical and liquidity-specific perfor-
mance indicators, among others."
"Based on this analysis, it is 
considered whether the price of the most recent financing round 
is accept-able as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for 
early-stage or growth-phase investments."
"Key performance in-
dicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are depend-
ent on the business model underlying the investment."
"Typical 
technical key performance indicators relate to licenses and pa-
tents held, the stage of technology development such as evi-
dence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and 
user growth and appointments to key management positions."
"Key financial performance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA 
and the corresponding growth rate and/or development of 
specific contribution margins."
"Key liquidity-specific performance 
indicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for 
future financing rounds."
"Since the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be 
the decisive input factor for the valuation, increases and de-
creases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity 
instrument that is recognised in the income statement."
"In addition, equity instruments that are held outside the private 
equity fund are measured using the income approach."
"This in-
volves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business 
cases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine 
the fair value of the financial instrument."
"Changes in fair values 
determined in connection with adjustments to significant input 
factors are not material for the BMW Group."
"The convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are 
primarily used as instruments in advance of future financing 
rounds relating to private equity investments."
"Valuations are 
therefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines."
"Mandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that 
the number of shares to be received depends on the future share 
price."
"Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are 
subject to only insignificant fluctuations in value."
"Irrespective of 
this fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals."
"The fair value of the options that the BMW Group holds in shares 
of such investee companies is measured primarily on the basis 
of a binomial model, taking into account the respective conditions 
under which the options were granted."
"The comments provided 
on the income-based approach used to measure equity instru-
ments held outside the private equity fund apply analogously for 
the purposes of determining the relevant entity value that is 
taken into account when measuring the fair value of the options."
"The exercise price for share options arising in conjunction with 
the private equity fund is generally low, verging towards zero."
"Consequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair 
value of the options."
"In this respect, the valuation of options and 
assessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to the 
approach taken to unquoted equity instruments, as described 
above."
"However, receivables and payables relating to derivative 
financial instruments are not netted due to non-fulfilment of the 
stipulated criteria."
"No financial assets and 
liabilities have been netted in the BMW Group due to the fact that 
the necessary requirements for netting have not been met."
"Further details 
are provided in ↗ note [19]."
"Total interest income arising on finan-
cial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income amounted to € 82 million (2022: € 37 million) and total 
interest expense to € 18 million (2022: € 10 million)."
"Net gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured 
at fair value through profit and loss mainly include results from 
the fair value measurement of stand-alone derivatives, market-
able securities and shares in investment funds, as well as other 
financial assets."
"Net gains and losses arising on financial assets measured at 
amortised cost include mainly exchange rate gains/losses and 
impairment losses/reversals."
"Net gains and losses arising on financial liabilities measured at 
amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains/losses."
"Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are some-
times subject to carrying amount adjustments that are recog-
nised through profit or loss as part of the application of hedge 
accounting."
"These carrying amount changes are largely neutral-
ised by the offsetting changes in fair value arising on hedging 
transactions and for this reason are not reported in the figures for 
net gains and losses."
"Total interest income arising on financial assets measured at 
amortised cost relates mainly to the interest income earned on 
credit financing and reported within revenues."
"Total interest ex-
penses arising on financial instruments measured at amortised 
cost amounted to € 2.5 billion (2022: € 1.7 billion)."
"Credit risk 
The BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if con-
tractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, 
are unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obliga-
tions."
"Information on the management of credit risk for receiv-
ables from sales financing is provided in the Combined Manage-
ment Report."
"(↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and Opportunities) 
Notwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carry-
ing amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative 
financial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit 
risk."
"In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unu-
tilised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of busi-
ness."
"Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the re-
porting period therefore amounted to € 32,149 million (2022: 
€ 31,163 million)."
"In the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly as-
sessed with regard to their credit risk."
"Depending on contractual 
status, necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are  
initiated in good time."
"The credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial 
instruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters 
into such contracts with parties of first-class credit standing."
"Within the financial services business, items financed for retail 
customers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and prop-
erty) serve as first-ranking collateral with a recoverable value."
"Security is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset 
pledges, asset assignment and first-ranking mortgages, supple-
mented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees."
"Items 
previously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired re-
late mainly to vehicles."
"As a rule, these assets can be converted 
into cash at short notice through the dealership organisation."
"Creditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW 
Group’s credit risk management."
"Every borrower’s creditworthi-
ness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered 
into by the BMW Group."
"In the case of retail customer financing, 
creditworthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems in-
tegrated in the purchasing process."
"In the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed 
by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating sys-
tem that takes account not only of the material credit standing of 
the borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliabil-
ity in business relations."
"The credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly on the 
basis of information relating to overdue amounts."
"The classification into 
creditworthiness levels is based on default probabilities."
"The amounts dis-
closed for derivative financial liabilities comprise only cash flows 
relating to derivatives that have a negative fair value at the bal-
ance sheet date."
"It should be noted that, due to the various yield 
curves used, a net positive cash flow may arise from inflows/out-
flows relating to derivative instruments with negative fair values."
"At 31 December 2023, credit commitments available at short 
notice to dealerships which had not been called upon at the end 
of the reporting period amounted to € 13,218 million (2022: 
€ 16,044 million)."
"Solvency is assured at all times by managing and monitoring the 
liquidity situation on the basis of a rolling cash flow forecast."
"The resulting funding requirements are covered by a variety of 
instruments placed on the world’s financial markets, with the aim 
to minimise risk by matching maturities with financing require-
ments and in alignment with a dynamic target debt structure."
"As a further reduction of risk, a syndicated credit line totalling  
€ 8 billion (2022: € 8 billion) from a consortium of international 
banks is available to the BMW Group."
"Intra-group cash flow fluc-
tuations are balanced out by the use of daily cash pooling ar-
rangements."
"Further information is provided in the Combined 
Management Report."
"Protection against such risks is provided in the first instance 
though natural hedging which arises when the values of non-de-
rivative financial instruments have matching maturities and 
amounts (netting)."
"Derivative financial instruments are used to 
reduce the risk remaining after netting."
"Currency, interest rate and raw materials market price risks of the 
BMW Group are managed at a corporate level."
"Further information is provided in the ↗ Outlook and ↗ Risks and 
Opportunities sections of the Combined Management Report."
"Currency risk 
As an enterprise with worldwide operations, the BMW Group 
conducts business in a variety of currencies, from which currency 
risks arise."
"In order to hedge currency risks, the BMW Group 
holds, as at 31 December 2023, derivative financial instruments 
mostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency 
swaps."
"As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, 
the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided 
at regular intervals."
"The economic relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on 
the fact that they are denominated in the same currency and 
have the same maturities."
"Items are hedged on the basis of a 
constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk 
exposure."
"Causes of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for 
counterparty credit risk."
"However, in view of the processes that 
have been established for credit risk management, ineffective-
ness is not expected to arise."
"The BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash-flow-at-
risk model."
"The analysis of currency risk is based on forecast 
foreign currency transactions which could result in exposures to 
surpluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows."
"The currency exposure is compared to all hedges that are in 
place."
"The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk 
position."
"The cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the 
impact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash 
flows on the basis of probability distributions."
"Volatilities and cor-
relations serve as the main input factors to determine the rele-
vant probability distributions."
"The potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the re-
porting date for each currency for the following financial year on 
the basis of current market prices and exposures with a confi-
dence level of 95%."
"The risk mitigating effect of correlations be-
tween the various currencies is taken into account when the risks 
are aggregated."
"The following table shows the potential negative impact for the 
BMW Group for the following year resulting from unfavourable 
changes in exchange rates, measured on the basis of the cash-
flow-at-risk approach."

Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risks arise when funds are borrowed and invested 
with differing fixed-rate periods or differing terms."
"At the BMW 
Group, all items subject to, or bearing, interest are exposed to 
interest rate risk and can therefore affect both the assets and li-
abilities side of the balance sheet."
"The fair value of the Group’s interest rate portfolios was as fol-
lows at the end of the reporting period: 
in € million 
 
31.12.2023  
31.12.2022 
Fair values of interest rate portfolios 
 
73,510  
73,954 
    
Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate de-
rivatives."
"As part of the implementation of the risk management 
strategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regu-
lar intervals."
"The interest rate contracts used for hedging pur-
poses comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is ap-
plied, are accounted for as fair value hedges."
"The economic re-
lationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument 
is based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item 
and the related hedging instrument (e.g."
"start date, term and cur-
rency) are the same."
"Items are hedged on the basis of a constant 
ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk expo-
sure."
"In view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedg-
ing relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low."
"For selected fixed-interest assets, part of the interest rate risk is 
hedged on a portfolio basis."
"In this case, swaps are used as the 
hedging instrument."
"Hedge relationships are terminated and re-
designated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting pe-
riod, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content 
of each portfolio."
"In light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark in-
terest rates, some of the BMW Group’s hedging relationships 
have been redesignated to take account of alternative bench-
mark interest rates."
"The tasks of the conversion project includes the continual 
monitoring of regulatory developments, the initiation of neces-
sary changes to systems, processes, risk and measurement 
models as well as the clarification of the associated accounting 
and financial reporting implications."
"In the financial year 2023, 
all contracts based on USD LIBOR were converted to alternative 
benchmark interest rates (€ 412 million)."
"In the case of CAD CDOR and PLN WIBOR, uncertainty remains 
as to the exact timing and nature of the changes."
"Non-derivative 
financial instruments that have not been converted to an alterna-
tive interest rate at 31 December 2023 all relate to the CAD 
CDOR, with a nominal liability amount of € 171 million 
(2022: € 242 million)."
"Derivative financial instruments that have 
not been converted to an alternative interest rate at 31 Decem-
ber 2023 all relate to the PLN WIBOR, with a nominal amount of 
€ 584 million (2022: € 100 million)."
"The BMW Group applies a value-at-risk approach throughout the 
Group for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest 
rate risk."
"This approach is based on a historical simulation in which the 
potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are 
compared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis 
of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of 
99.98%."
"The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the 
various portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggre-
gated."
"In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward 
commodity contracts."
"As part of the implementation of the risk 
management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should 
be hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding 
hedging ratio defined."
"Items are hedged on the basis of a con-
stant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk 
exposure."
"Causes of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for 
counterparty credit risk."
"However, in view of the processes that 
have been established for credit risk management, ineffective-
ness is not expected to arise."
"The economic relationship between the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they 
have the same basis and term."
"The BMW Group designates only 
the commodity price index-linked raw materials surcharge, which 
is specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components, as 
a hedged item."
"The proportion of the hedged risk component as 
a percentage of the total fair value depends on the specific types 
of vehicle component involved."
"Other price components con-
tained in the contract are not designated as being part of the 
hedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for 
these components."
"The starting point for analysing raw materials price risk is to iden-
tify planned purchases of raw materials or components contain-
ing raw materials, the so-called “exposure”."
"At each reporting 
date, the exposure for the following financial year amounted to: 
in € million 
 
31.12.2023  
31.12.2022 
Raw material price exposures 
 
9,033  
10,153 
    
This exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place."
"The 
net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position."
"The 
cash-flow-at-risk approach involves showing the impact of po-
tential raw materials market price fluctuations on operating cash 
flows on the basis of probability distributions."
"Volatilities and 
correlations serve as input factors to assess the relevant proba-
bility distributions."
"The potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the re-
porting date for each raw materials category for the following fi-
nancial year on the basis of current market prices and exposure 
with a confidence level of 95%."
"The risk mitigating effect of cor-
relations between the various categories of raw materials is 
taken into account when the risks are aggregated."
"The following table shows the potential negative impact for the 
BMW Group resulting from fluctuations in prices across all cate-
gories of raw materials, measured on the basis of the cash-flow-
at-risk approach."
"The amounts shown are stated before de-
ferred taxes and take account of additional effects arising from 
the application of the modified closing rate method."
"The hedge rates therefore correspond in each case to the current 
market interest rate level."
"Most of the hedges used in this context relate to variable yield 
curves relating to the euro, US dollar and British pound currency 
areas."

"Employee Share Programme 
Within the scope of the Employee Share Programme in the finan-
cial year 2023, eligible BMW Group employees were granted 
shares of BMW AG common stock on preferential terms (for in-
formation on the number and price of the shares of common 
stock issued see ↗ note [31])."
"Employees who are currently employed by 
BMW AG or a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG based in Ger-
many were able to partake in the programme, insofar as the sub-
sidiary’s management had decided to participate."
"Employees 
were required to have been in their positions for at least one year 
without interruption at the time the programme was announced 
and had to remain in their positions until the shares of common 
stock were transferred."
"The shares of common stock acquired in the scope of the Em-
ployee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four 
years calculated from 1 January of the year in which the shares 
of common stock were acquired."
"These shares of common stock 
are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from 
the financial year 2023."
"A total of 1,290,000 shares of common stock were transferred 
to employees in the reporting year (2022: 1,439,975 shares of 
preferred stock)."
"The 1,290,000 shares of common stock were 
acquired in the scope of the Employee Share Programme."
"The 
1,439,975 shares of preferred stock in the previous year 
stemmed from Authorised Capital 2019."
"BMW AG’s Board of 
Management decides each year whether to continue the  
programme."
"Board of Management members and eligible senior department 
heads receive an earmarked cash amount (personal cash invest-
ment amount) that is, net of tax and deductions, to be invested 
in shares of BMW AG common stock."
"This amount depends on 
the achievement of certain financial and non-financial targets in 
the past financial year (vesting year)."
"Payment of the personal cash investment amount is made after 
the Annual General Meeting at which the Financial Statements 
are presented for the relevant financial year."
"The shares of com-
mon stock are purchased immediately after the personal cash in-
vestment amount has been paid out and are subject to a holding 
period of four years from the date of purchase."
"The RoCE com-
ponent and the strategic focus target component each make up 
half of the target amount for the personal cash investment 
amount."
"For the RoCE component, a RoCE factor is determined 
based on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment for the 
grant year."
"For the strategic focus target component, a minimum 
of two strategic focus targets are defined prior to the start of the 
financial year."
"Minimum, target and maximum values are defined 
and factors are assigned for the RoCE in the Automotive seg-
ment and for each strategic focus target."
"The relevant factors are 
determined after the end of the financial year based on the extent 
to which targets were achieved."
"This amount was also subject 
to a four-year holding period and on expiry thereof the Board of 
Management members received one additional share of the 
Company’s common stock or the equivalent value in cash 
(matching component) for every three shares of common stock 
held, at BMW AG’s discretion."
"In the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early 
payment of share-based remuneration components (matching 
components) based on the target amounts, and the holding pe-
riod is also dropped for shares of common stock that were ac-
quired with share-based remuneration components."
"Up to and including financial year 2021, eligible senior depart-
ment heads committed to invest 26% of their earnings-related 
bonus in shares of BMW AG common stock and to hold the ac-
quired shares for four years."
"For the investment obligation, BMW 
AG granted an amount corresponding to the entire investment 
amount as a net subsidy."
"Participants receive one additional share of common stock or the 
equivalent value in cash for every three shares of common stock 
held once the four-year holding requirement has been fulfilled, at 
the Company’s discretion."

sheet date hold 112,969 shares of BMW common stock with a 
holding obligation arising from share-based remuneration for fi-
nancial years 2019 to 2022 (2022: 118,604)."
"The share-based remuneration component is revalued at its fair 
value at each balance sheet date between the grant date and the 
settlement date and on the settlement date itself."
"The expense 
for such programmes is recognised in the income statement (as 
personnel expense) on a straight-line basis over the vesting pe-
riod of the options and in the balance sheet as a provision."
"The remuneration system does not provide for any further 
matching components for the members of the Board of Manage-
ment from financial year 2021 or for the senior department 
heads from financial year 2022."

nent is measured at fair value on the balance sheet date (closing 
price of BMW AG common stock in Xetra trading on 31 Decem-
ber 2023)."
"The total carrying amount of the provision for the share-based 
remuneration component for eligible active and former Board of 
Management members and senior department heads was

"The activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the oper-
ating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and 
Other Entities."
"BMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through 
branches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealer-
ships."
"Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary 
companies and by independent import companies in some mar-
kets."
"Rolls-Royce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via 
subsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised 
dealerships."
"Activities relating to the development, manufacture, assembly 
and sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories 
are reported in the Motorcycles segment."
"Automobile and motorcycle leasing, retail and dealership financ-
ing, multi-brand fleet business, customer deposit business and 
insurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Finan-
cial Services segment."
"Holding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other 
Entities segment."
"This segment also includes the operating com-
pany Bavaria Lloyd Reisebüro GmbH, which is not allocated to 
one of the other segments."
"Internal management and reporting 
Segment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity 
with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and presenting 
the Group Financial Statements."
"Exceptions to this general prin-
ciple include the treatment of inter-segment warranties, the earn-
ings impact of which is allocated to the respective segments on 
the basis used internally to manage the business."
"In addition, in-
tragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and 
Financial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment al-
lowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of 
consolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also ex-
cluded."
"Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the 
internal management and reporting system on an IFRS 16 basis 
and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any 
changes in the presentation of segment information."
"Inter-seg-
ment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expenses 
and profits are eliminated upon consolidation."
"Inter-segment rev-
enues are based on market prices."
"Centralised cost components 
are included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash 
flows."
"The role of “chief operating decision maker” with respect to re-
source allocation and performance assessment of the reportable 
segment is embodied in the full Board of Management."
"For this 
purpose, different measures of segment performance as well as 
segment assets are taken into account in the operating 
segments."
"The Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the 
basis of return on capital employed (RoCE)."
"The relevant meas-
ure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial re-
sult."
"Capital employed is the corresponding measure of segment 
assets used to determine how to allocate resources."
"Capital em-

11 Control on basis of economic dependence.
"In addi-
tion, we have audited the group management report of Bayer-
ische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with 
the Company's management report, for the financial year from 
1 January to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with the Ger-
man legal requirements, we have not audited the content of 
those parts of the group management report listed in the ""Other 
Information"" section of our auditor's report."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the 
audit, 
— 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU, and the additional requirements of German 
commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs."
"In all 
material respects, this group management report is 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, 
complies 
with 
German 
legal 
requirements 
and 
appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future 
development."
"Our audit opinion on the group management 
report does not cover the content of those parts of the 
group management report listed in the ""Other Information"" 
section of our auditor's report."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare 
that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014, referred to 
subsequently as ""EU Audit Regulation"") in compliance with Ger-
man Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Au-
dits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute 
of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under 
those requirements and principles are further described in the 
""Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Fi-
nancial Statements and of the Group Management Report"" sec-
tion of our auditor's report."
"We are independent of the group en-
tities in accordance with the requirements of European law and 
German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled 
our other German professional responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 
10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we 
have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Arti-
cle 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consoli-
dated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January 
to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the 
context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not 
provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"At the balance sheet date, the 
figure reported under the ""leased products"" line item for operat-
ing leases was EUR 43,118 million (approximately 17.2% of 
total assets)."
"Leased products are measured at cost, which is 
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term to the 
expected residual value (recoverable amount)."
"A key estimated 
value for subsequent measurement of leased products is the 
expected residual value at the end of the lease term."
"For the re-
sidual value forecasts the BMW Group uses internally available 
data on historical empirical values, current market data and 
market estimates as well as forecasts by external market re-
search institutes."
"The residual value estimates also contain reg-
ulatory changes in the individual markets and expectations re-
garding customer behavior, among others including climate pol-
icy considerations."
"The estimation of future residual values is 
subject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to 
be made by the executive directors and the amount of data in-
cluded in the determination."
"Against this background and due to the resulting significant un-
certainties with regard to estimates in the context of measuring 
the residual values of the leased products, this matter was of 
particular significance in the context of our audit."
"Furthermore, 
we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the in-
ternal control system, particularly regarding the determination of 
expected residual values."
"This included the evaluation of the 
propriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented 
interfaces therein by our IT-specialists."
"In addition, we evaluated 
the appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model as-
sumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement 
of the residual values based on the validations carried out by the 
BMW Group."
"For this purpose, we inquired with the BMW 
Group's experts responsible for the management and monitor-
ing of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on 
residual value developments and residual value forecasts as 
well as the validation results."
"We examined the mathematical 
correctness of the forecast values using the key calculation 
steps."
"3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied ""Accounting poli-
cies, assumptions, judgments and estimations"" are contained in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 
and on leased products are contained under note 23."
"2/ Valuation of receivables from sales financing 
1/ The BMW Group offers end customers, dealerships and im-
porters various financing models for vehicles."
"In this context, 
current and non-current receivables from sales financing total-
ing EUR 87,355 million are reported in the consolidated state-
ment of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approx-
imately 34.8% of total assets)."
"Impairment losses amounting to 
EUR 2,189 million were recognized on these receivables as at 
the balance sheet date."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effec-
tiveness of the internal control system regarding the determina-
tion of the impairment loss to be recognized."
"The evaluation included an assessment by our IT-specialists of 
the appropriateness of the systems concerned and associated 
interfaces to ensure the completeness of data as well as the au-
dit of automated controls for data processing."
"As part of our au-
dit we assessed in particular the appropriateness of the risk 
classification procedures as well as the risk provisioning param-
eters used."
"For this purpose, we analyzed in particular the vali-
dations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Com-
pany."
"To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sam-
pling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for 
assignment to the respective risk categories were suitably avail-
able and the impairment losses had been calculated using the 
parameters defined for these risk categories."
"In our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the meas-
urement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate 
overall."
"3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied ""Accounting poli-
cies, assumptions, judgments and estimations"" are contained in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 
and on ""receivables from sales financing"" are contained under 
note 25."
"The obligations amounted to EUR 9,650 
million (approximately 3.8% of total assets) as at 31 December 
2023."
"The BMW Group is responsible for the legally required 
warranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market."
"In order to estimate the liabilities arising from statutory and non-
statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees for 
vehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages 
arising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at 
vehicle model level."
"The expected amount of obligations is ex-
trapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision 
in the corresponding amount, if the criteria of IAS 37 have been 
met."
"For specific or anticipated individual circumstances, for ex-
ample recalls for vehicles sold, additional provisions are recog-
nized provided they have not already been taken into account."
"The determination of provisions is associated with unavoidable 
estimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, 
depending on factors such as notification of detected defects as 
well as claims made by vehicle owners."
"Against this background, 
this matter was of particular significance during our audit."
"We also evaluated 
the appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for de-
termining the assumptions and parameters."
"With the involve-
ment of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used re-
garding their compliance."
"We compared the expenses for claims 
and technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw 
conclusions on the forecast accuracy."
"Based on a targeted sam-
ple of vehicle models, the mathematical correctness of the valu-
ation model used across the Group was examined."
"In our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statu-
tory and non-statutory warranty obligations as well as product 
guarantees is overall appropriate."
"Taking into consideration the 
information available, we believe that, overall, the measurement 
parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors 
are appropriate."
"3/ The Company's disclosures on the applied ""Accounting poli-
cies, assumptions, judgments and estimations"" are contained in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 6 
and on ""Other provisions"" are contained under note 34."
"Other Information 
The executive directors are responsible for the other infor-
mation."
"1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in 
compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial perfor-
mance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the execu-
tive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to 
continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility 
for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In 
addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on 
the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an inten-
tion to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no 
realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consoli-
dated financial statements and of the group management re-
port."
"Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individ-
ually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements and this group man-
agement report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve 
collusion, 
forgery, 
intentional 
omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"— 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
by the executive directors and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the executive directors and related 
disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty 
exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's 
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and in the group management report 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's 
report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"— 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain 
solely responsible for our audit opinions."
"— 
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report 
with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity 
with German law, and the view of the Group's position it 
provides."
"— 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the executive directors in the group 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant 
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for 
the prospective information and evaluate the proper 
derivation of the prospective information from these 
assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion 
on the prospective information and on the assumptions 
used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that 
future events will differ materially from the prospective 
information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regard-
ing, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the 
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant de-
ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with gov-
ernance, we determine those matters that were of most signifi-
cance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the 
current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We de-
scribe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regu-
lation precludes public disclosure about the matter."

"GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT 
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is 
Michael Popp."
"Our 
engagement in this context relates solely to the disclosures de-
noted with the symbol [[     ]] and the disclosures in the sections 
""Dialog with stakeholders"", “Further GRI information” and 
“SASB-Index”."
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external 
sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the 
Integrated Group Report."
"This responsibility includes the selection and application of ap-
propriate non-financial and sus-tainability reporting methods 
and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-fi-
nancial and sustainability disclosures of the Group that are rea-
sonable in the circumstances."
"Furthermore, the executive direc-
tors are responsible for such internal control as the executive di-
rectors consider necessary to enable the preparation of an Inte-
grated Group Report that is free from material misstatement 
whether due to fraud or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued 
thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifica-
tions have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, the 
executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereun-
der in section “EU-Taxonomy” of the Combined Non-financial 
Statement."
"They are responsible for the defensibility of this inter-
pretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal 
terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the 
interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"1 PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the ,,BMW Group Report 2023” and issued an independent practitioner’s report in German language, 
  which is authoritative."
The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner’s report.
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with In-
ternational Standard on Assur-ance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Re-
views of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB."
"In a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed 
are less extensive than in a reason-able assurance engagement, 
and accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is ob-
tained."
"The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to 
the professional judgement of the assur-ance practitioner."
"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to 
interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance 
engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"We do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources 
of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Disclo-
sures on Non-financial Reporting denoted with the symbol [[     ]] 
of the Company’s Combined Non-financial Statement."
"Restriction of Use  
We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement 
was conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report 
is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the 
assurance engagement."
"Consequently, it may not be suitable for 
any other purpose than the aforementioned."
"Accordingly, the re-
port is not intended to be used by third parties for making (finan-
cial) decisions based on it."
Our responsibility is to the Company.
We do not accept any re-sponsibility to third parties.

ance opinion is not modified in this respect."

The 2023 financial year was very successful for the BMW Group."
"A total of 2,554,183 vehicles were delivered – a new record for 
the BMW Group."
"The BMW brand defended its leading position 
in the global premium segment by selling just under 2.3 million 
delivered vehicles."
"The Rolls-Royce brand also achieved record 
sales."
"BMW Motorrad achieved the strongest sales in the Com-
pany’s history in the year of its 100th anniversary."

"Outlook for the 2024 Financial Year
The BMW Group generated a strong profit in the 2023 financial 
year."
"Group net profit amounted to € 12.2 billion, with € 11.3 bil-
lion attributable to BMW AG shareholders, while the Group return 
on sales after tax amounted to 7.8%."
"Under the leadership of the 
Board of Management, the Company continued to drive the 
BMW Group’s transformation to electromobility forward in the re-
porting year."
"The BMW Group increased its sales of all-electric 
ve-hicles at a significantly greater pace than the market as a 
whole and has an all-electric offering in every major segment."
"The proportion of total sales attributable to all-electric vehicles 
went up to around 15%."
"The current remuneration system for the members of the Board 
of Management came into effect on 1 January 2021."
"The Annual 
General Meeting approved it on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 
91.60% of the valid votes cast."
"The Supervisory Board did not 
resolve any changes to the remuneration system or the target 
remuneration in the remuneration levels set out for the members 
of the Board of Management in the 2023 financial year."
"In December 2022, the Supervisory Board set ambitious targets 
linked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board 
of Management for the 2023 financial year."
"Of the total variable 
target remuneration available, around 39% was linked to envi-
ronmental, social or governance (ESG) targets."
"The Supervisory 
Board has set ambitious targets to reduce fleet carbon emissions 
in the EU and to increase all-electric vehicle sales."
"These serve 
as strategic focus targets that correspond to 50% of the long-
term variable remuneration (share-based remuneration)."
"The 
Supervisory Board has thus once again incorporated the strate-
gic importance of accelerating the electrification of the vehicle 
fleet into the remuneration for the members of the Board of Man-
agement."
"The Supervisory Board placed particular emphasis on 
environmental sustainability targets, which make up 50% of the 
long-term variable remuneration."
"Thanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Manage-
ment exceeded both the financial and a large part of the non-
financial targets for short-term variable remuneration (bonuses) 
for the 2023 financial year."
"↗ Bonus for the 2023 financial year The fi-
nancial target tied to RoCE in the Automotive segment which 
makes up part of the long-term variable remuneration (share-
based remuneration) component was also exceeded."
"In terms of 
the non-financial strategic focus targets for the long-term vari-
able remuneration, the ambitious targets related to the reduction 
of fleet carbon emissions in the EU were exceeded, while the 
BMW Group’s sales targets for all-electric vehicles were not quite 
met in full."
"↗ Share-based remuneration for the financial year 2023 
If necessary, and in the interest of the long-term success of 
BMW AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from 
the remuneration system – as provided for in § 87a (2) Sentence 
2 AktG."
"After due examination, it did not 
make use of these options for the 2023 financial year."
"The composition of the Board of Management changed during 
the 2023 financial year."
"Mr Pieter Nota left the Board of Man-
agement on 31 October 2023 by mutual agreement as part of a 
succession arrangement."
"Dr Nicolas Peter left the Board of Man-
agement on 11 May 2023."
"This was also by mutual agreement 
as part of a succession arrangement."
"↗ Premature termination of 
activities and post-contractual non-competition clause Mr Walter Mertl was 
appointed as the member of the Board of Management respon-
sible for Finance on 12 May 2023."
"Mr Jochen Goller was ap-
pointed as the member of the Board of Management responsible 
for Customer, Brands, Sales on 1 November 2023."
"From the 
start date of his second period of office on 1 July 2023, Mr Frank 
Weber was eligible to receive the target remuneration in the sec-
ond remuneration level, which is available to members of the 
Board of Management from their second period of office."
"The remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory 
Board is set out in Article 16 of the Articles of Incorporation and 
provides only for fixed remuneration."
"It was confirmed by the An-
nual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 
99.40% of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2023 
financial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of 
Incorporation."
"In the 2023 financial year, Dr Martin Kimmich was 
appointed by the court to replace Mr Manfred Schoch as a mem-
ber of the Supervisory Board on 18 January 2023."
"Mr Schoch left 
the Supervisory Board on 31 December 2022."
"On 23 January 
2023, Dr Kimmich was appointed as the first deputy chair by the 
Supervisory Board and as a member of the Personnel and Audit 
Committee."
"As the first deputy chair, he is also a member of the 
Presiding Board and the legally required Mediation Committee."
"Apart from this, the composition of the Personnel Committee, 
which is responsible for the preparation of remuneration deci-
sions in accordance with the Supervisory Board’s rules of proce-
dure, did not change in the 2023 financial year."
"The Supervisory 
Board awarded a contract to new external remuneration consult-
ants in the 2023 financial year."
"The Remuneration Report for the 
2022 financial year was confirmed by the Annual General Meet-
ing on 11 May 2023 with a majority of 94.14% of the valid votes 
cast."
"In view of the high level of approval, there was no reason to 
rethink the implementation of the current remuneration system 
or the manner of reporting."
"Changes were made to make certain 
issues clearer."
"OUTLOOK FOR THE
2024 FINANCIAL YEAR
The remuneration system and the target remuneration for the 
remuneration levels of the members of the Board of Manage-
ment, as described in this report for the 2023 financial year, will 
continue to apply unchanged in the 2024 financial year."
"In De-
cember 2023, the Supervisory Board set the targets for variable 
remuneration for the 2024 financial year on the basis of a pro-
posal by the Personnel Committee."
"A resolution was passed to 
raise the required level of performance for the earnings compo-
nent of the bonus for the Board of Management, which remains 
limited to 180% of the target remuneration."
"There are no plans to change the remuneration system for mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 financial year."

"REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS
OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT
1."
"The Supervisory Board has applied the 
following principles in designing the remuneration system for the 
Board of Management: 
— 
The remuneration structure is geared towards the 
sustainable and long-term development of the Company."
"Therefore, variable remuneration components are pre-
dominantly granted on the basis of a multi-year 
assessment."
"— 
The total remuneration of the members of the Board of 
Management is commensurate with their tasks and 
performance as well as the Company’s situation."
"— 
The remuneration system ensures that both positive and 
negative developments are appropriately reflected in the 
remuneration (“pay for performance”)."
"— 
The remuneration system takes into account both the 
performance of the entire Board of Management and the 
achievement of individual targets."
"— 
The remuneration system observes the principle of 
consistency between the remuneration systems in the 
Company: the remuneration systems for the Board of 
Management, executives and employees of BMW AG are all 
designed in a similar way."
"— 
The total remuneration is in line with market practice both in 
terms of amount and structure, and takes into account the 
size, complexity and economic situation of the Company."
"The BMW Group aims to be the most successful and sustainable 
premium provider of individual mobility."
"The business strategy 
focuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable individ-
ual mobility in the premium segment, taking into account high 
profitability, in order to secure the Company’s independence in 
the future."
"The remuneration system contributes to the imple-
mentation of the business strategy and the sustainable and long-
term development of the Company."
"It also takes into account the 
concerns of the Company’s important stakeholders (in particular, 
shareholders, customers and employees)."
"The incentive effects 
of the various remuneration components have a complementary 
effect."
"— 
The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to 
take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short-
term goals, and thus contributes to the long-term 
development of the Company."
"It ensures a minimum income 
appropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of 
the Board of Management."
"— 
The variable bonus is divided into two parts, which influence 
behaviour 
in 
different 
ways."
"The 
earnings-related 
component of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving 
the Company’s financial targets in the vesting year, and 
promotes the earnings-related parts of the business 
strategy."
"In contrast, the performance component of the 
bonus is based on non-financial performance criteria, which 
are also derived from the business strategy."
"In this respect, 
the performance component of the bonus also offers 
particular incentives to encourage individuals to pursue the 
goals of the business strategy consistently for the long-term 
development of the Company."
"These goals do not have to 
be directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given 
vesting year."
"The obligation to use the total net amount to 
purchase shares of common stock in the Company and to 
hold these shares for at least four years is a share ownership 
guideline that strengthens the entrepreneurial long-term 
orientation of the Board of Management."
"Implementing the 
corporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate 
decisions also creates lasting value for the shareholders, 
and thus regularly provides the basis for positive long-term 
capital market performance."
"Due to the substantial 
investment and the fixed holding period associated with 
these shares, members of the Board of Management 
participate in the long-term positive (and negative) 
development of the Company, as reflected in the share price 
and dividend trends."

"The Su-
pervisory Board also takes remuneration studies into account 
when assessing the market conformity of the target and maxi-
mum remuneration, as well as when assessing actual remuner-
ation in horizontal terms."

(1) Bonus for the 2023 financial year 
Overview 
The bonus consists of an earnings component and a perfor-
mance component."
"If 100% of the target is achieved for both the 
performance and the earnings component, the share of the  
bonus attached to each component is 50% of the individual tar-
get amount of the bonus."
"The bonus amount is capped at 180% 
of the individual target amount."
"The bonus for the financial year 
will be paid as part of the next payroll run after the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting 2024."
"Earnings component of the bonus 
The earnings component of the bonus rewards the performance 
of the business in the 2023 vesting year, as measured by the 
financial indicators “Profit attributable to shareholders of 
BMW AG” and “Group post-tax return on sales”."
"For this pur-
pose, the Supervisory Board adopted an allocation matrix, from 
which an earnings factor is derived based on the values 
achieved."
"A minimum value, a target value and a maximum value were de-
fined for both key figures before the start of the 2023 vesting 
year."
"If one of the minimum values is not reached, the earnings 
factor is zero (corresponding to a target achievement of 0%)."
"If 
both target values are reached, the earnings factor is 1.000 (cor-
responding to a target achievement of 100%)."
"If both maximum 
values are exceeded, the earnings factor is 1.800 (correspond-
ing to a target achievement of 180%, the highest possible per-
centage)."
"For intermediate values, the earnings factor is derived 
from the allocation matrix."
"In the 2023 financial year, BMW AG’s 
share of profit attributable to shareholders was € 11.3 billion, 
and the Group post-tax return on sales was 7.8%."
"Based on the 
allocation matrix approved by the Supervisory Board, this pro-
vides an earnings factor of 1.680, which corresponds to a target 
achievement level of 168%."
"Performance component of the bonus 
The performance component of the bonus rewards the achieve-
ment of certain non-financial targets."
"Before the beginning of the 
financial year, the Supervisory Board sets these targets in the 
form of various non-financial performance criteria and associ-
ated metrics."
"The performance criteria are derived primarily from 
the corporate strategy, long-term corporate planning and the 
business development planning done for the following year."
"The 
targets are divided into individual targets for the individual mem-
bers of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and 
collective targets for the entire Board of Management (interde-
partmental targets)."
"The Supervisory Board has discretion in 
weighting the performance criteria."
"Approximately 10% of the 
target amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allo-
cated to the departmental targets."
"Departmental targets can be 
department-specific targets or contributions to shared targets 
measured individually for each department."
"The remainder of the 
target amount for the performance bonus (amounting to approx-
imately 90%) should be associated with interdepartmental, non-
financial targets."
"In this regard, around 50% of the target amount 
should be connected to the achievement of non-financial targets 
relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG targets)."

"The performance 
factor for the bonus was determined from the partial perfor-
mance factors, with a weighting of 10% for the departmental tar-
gets and 90% for the interdepartmental targets, in each case in 
relation to the target amount of the performance component of 
the bonus."
"With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50% of 
the weighting is for non-financial environmental, social and gov-
ernance (ESG) targets, and 40% is for other non-financial tar-
gets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the perfor-
mance component of the bonus."
"The leadership performance of the individual members of the 
Board of Management was assessed along with the overall per-
formance of the Board of Management as a whole."
"With regard 
to the departmental targets, the Supervisory Board assessed the 
individual performance of each member of the Board of Manage-
ment."
"With regard to the interdepartmental targets, the Supervi-
sory Board considered the Board of Management as a team and 
assessed the performance of all the members of the Board of 
Management as a whole."
"The Supervisory Board’s decision-
making process is based on a detailed, documented analysis of 
performance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well 
as in-depth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Super-
visory Board level."
"As a basis for the targets set in the previous 
year and the assessment process following the financial year, the 
Supervisory Board was guided, in particular, by the quantitative 
and qualitative metrics that were defined in the corporate plan-
ning before the beginning of the financial year."
"The results of comparative studies and calculations vis-à-vis 
competitors were also used to assess individual metrics."
"In addi-
tion to a review of performance in 2023, the Supervisory Board 
carried out a trend review covering several financial years."
"In do-
ing so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the 
overall course set in previous financial years on the 2023 finan-
cial year and also estimated the significance of the performance 
in 2023 for the future development of the Company."
"The defined quantitative and qualitative metrics include indica-
tors such as vehicle sales, segment shares, the share of sales for 
electrified and all-electric vehicles and the share of BMW brand 
vehicles with remote software upgrade capability."
"Other metrics 
included assessments of the quality of the customer experience 
compared to the competition, the R&D ratio, spending on em-
ployee training and development and diversity targets."

"Personal cash investment amount 
The personal cash investment amount for the 2023 financial 
year will be paid as part of the next payroll run after the Annual 
General Meeting in 2024."
"The size of this amount depends on 
the target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Automotive seg-
ment and the degree to which certain strategic focus targets 
were achieved in the vesting year."
"The personal cash investment

amount 
The Supervisory Board sets at least two strategic focus targets 
before the start of the vesting year."

imum, target and maximum value for each strategic focus target, 
and assigns a factor to each of these values."

value is not reached, the factor for that target is 0."
"If the target 
value is reached, the factor for that target is 1.00."
"If the maximum 
value is reached or exceeded, the factor for that target is 1.80."
"The strategic focus targets component of the personal cash 
investment amount is determined in a two-step process."
"In the 
first step, the factor for the vesting year achieved for the relevant 
strategic focus target is multiplied by the share of the individual 
target amount attributable to this target."
"In the second step, the 
values determined for the individual strategic focus targets using 
this calculation are added together."
"If two strategic focus targets 
are set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25% of the indi-
vidual target amount, unless the Supervisory Board decides on a 
different weighting."
"If more than two strategic focus targets are 
set, the Supervisory Board determines the weighting of each  
target."
"The

terest rates specified in the German actuarial reserve regulation

"Remuneration of the Members of the Supervisory Board
IV."
"REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF
THE SUPERVISORY BOARD
1."
"The regulation was adopted by the An-
nual General Meeting on 14 May 2020 and confirmed on
12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40% of the valid votes cast."
"Principles and elements of remuneration 
The Supervisory Board remuneration is structured as a purely
fixed remuneration in line with suggestion G.18 of the GCGC."
"Fixed remuneration strengthens the independence of the Super-
visory Board in advising and monitoring the Board of Manage-
ment."
"The structure and amount of the fixed remuneration
should ensure that highly qualified individuals can be proposed
to the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervi-
sory Board."
"This promotes the quality of advice and oversight,
which contributes to the Company’s sustainable and long-term
development."
"In accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of 
the Supervisory Board of BMW AG who does not exercise any 
additional function relevant to remuneration receives fixed remu-
neration of € 200,000 p.a."
"The GCGC recommends that exercising the functions of the chair 
and deputy chair of the Supervisory Board should also be con-
sidered when determining the level of remuneration, along with 
any committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17)."
"This is to take account of the extra time commitment associated 
with these positions."
"The Articles of Incorporation of BMW AG 
also take account of the requirements for the Audit Committee 
and its Chairman."
"They stipulate that the Chairman of the Super-
visory Board shall receive three times the amount, and each 
Deputy Chairman twice the amount, of remuneration paid to a 
Supervisory Board member who has no additional remunera-
tion-relevant functions."
"If a member of the Supervisory Board exercises 
more than one of the functions referred to above, their remuner-
ation is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the 
highest amount."
"In the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory 
Board during the year, or if additional remuneration-relevant 
functions are performed, remuneration is calculated on a propor-
tionate basis."
"In addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an 
attendance fee of € 2,000 per meeting for each meeting of the 
Supervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she participates."
"This 
also applies to participation by telephone or video link."
"If they at-
tend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are 
not remunerated separately."
"A continuous session on two con-
secutive days is treated as one session."
"The remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the 
end of the respective financial year."
"Furthermore, the company 
reimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their rea-
sonable expenses."
"In order to be able to perform his duties, the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat 
and chauffeur services."
"The activity on which the remuneration 
for the 2023 financial year is based was fully performed by the 
balance sheet date."
"Therefore, the remuneration for the Super-
visory Board activities is classified as granted for the 2023 finan-
cial year, even if the payment of the Supervisory Board remuner-
ation (including the attendance fee) was made after the end of 
the 2023 financial year."

VI."
"OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
BMW Group companies did not grant any loans to members of 
the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board in the 2023 
financial year, nor did they enter into any contingent liabilities in 
their favour."
"In the year under review, members of the Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board concluded contracts 
with BMW Group companies for the purchase of vehicles, other 
services (maintenance and repair work) and cash deposits at 
arm’s length conditions."
"The Company maintains a financial loss liability insurance policy 
for the members of the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board."
"The insurance provides cover for legal 
liability claims and protects the private assets of members of 
BMW AG’s Board of Management and Supervisory Board if a 
claim is made against them for financial loss in the course of 
exercising their function as a corporate entity."
"A deductible is 
provided for members of the Board of Management that 
complies with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG)."
"Auditor‘s Report  
 
 
 
VII."
"The 
executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsi-
ble for such internal control as they determine is necessary to 
enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the re-
lated disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error."
"Auditor’s Responsibilities  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration 
report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit."
"We 
conducted our audit in accordance with German generally ac-
cepted standards for the audit of financial statements promul-
gated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Au-
ditors in Germany) (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we com-
ply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the remuneration 
report, including the related disclosures, is free from material 
misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence 
about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the 
remuneration report."
"The procedures selected depend on the au-
ditor's judgment."
"This includes the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the remuneration report including the 
related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error."
"In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal 
control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report in-
cluding the related disclosures."
"The objective of this is to plan 
and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company's internal control."
"An audit also in-
cludes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by 
the executive directors and the supervisory board, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of remuneration report in-
cluding the related disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion."
"Audit Opinion  
In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remunera-
tion report for the financial year from January 1, 2023 to Decem-
ber 31 2023, including the related disclosures, complies in all 
material respects with the accounting provisions of § 162 AktG."
"Reference to an Other Matter – Formal Audit of the 
Remuneration Report according to § 162 AktG 
The audit of the content of the remuneration report described in 
this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration 
report required by § 162 Abs."
"[paragraph] 3 AktG, including the 
issuance of a report on this audit."
"As we express an unqualified 
audit opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit 
opinion includes that the information required by § 162 Abs."
"1 
and 2 AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the re-
muneration report."
"Restriction on use 
We issue this auditor’s report on the basis of the engagement 
agreed with Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft."
"The 
audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and 
the auditor‘s report is solely intended to inform the company as 
to the results of the audit."
"Our responsibility for the audit and for 
our auditor’s report is only towards the company in accordance 
with this engagement."
"The auditor’s report is not intended for 
any third parties to base any (financial) decisions thereon."
"We do 
not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards 
third parties; no third parties are included in the scope of protec-
tion of the underlying engagement."
"§ 334 BGB [Bürgerliches 
Gesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections 
arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, 
is not waived."
"The methodology used to calculate CO2 emissions changed in the reporting year 2023 for the items “Purchased Goods and services” and “Logistics – material supply of the plants and 
distribution of vehicles”."
The prior-year figures have been adjusted retrospectively.
"2 Carbon emissions (excluding climate-impacting gases other than carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants and BMW Motorcycle, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g."
"research centres, sales 
centres, office buildings)."
"3 This amount includes 15,881 t CO2 from the direct use of biomass."
"4 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
Leased space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included.
"5 Includes the emissions of company cars and function-related vehicles of the BMW Group plants, as well as the 12 major markets."
Emissions are preferably calculated on the basis of tank refills.
"This is the case for the plants and/or markets in Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy 
(only Alphabet Italia S.p.A."
"and BMW Bank GmbH, Milan), Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea (only BMW Financial Services Korea Co., Ltd., Seoul), Thailand and the UK."
"In the remaining cases, they are determined based on kilometres driven."
"For the USA, the data are partly extrapolated for 2023 
because the information was not yet available for the entire period at the time the data was collected."
"and BMW Italia Retail S.r.l., values for the reporting period are calculated based on average kilometres per day."
"For system-related reasons, the refuelling of company vehicles includes 
both business and private trips, except refuelling paid for by employees themselves."
6 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3).
A distinction in the systems is currently not possible.
7 The increase in this metric is the result of the scope being increased as compared to the previous year.
Reporting was only submitted for Germany and the international test sites up to and including 2022.
"During the 2023 reporting year, all BMW Group plants and the 12 major markets were integrated into the 
figure."
"A calculation based on the Scope from 2022 results in a comparative value for 2023 of 80,869 t CO2 (+5.7% compared to previous year)."
No retrospective adjustment was made.
"As a result, the figures for 2023 are not directly comparable with previous years."
"8 As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more meaningful comparisons in terms of civil aviation."
2 The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the reporting year 2023.
Each vehicle is assigned an average value based on the CO2e assessment of individual transport movements.
The values in the time series were adjusted to reflect the new methodology.
"The emission factors were also 
adjusted retrospectively (values prior to change in methodology and adjustment of transport logistics emission factors, excluding aftersales logistics: 2019: 1,454,534 t CO2e, 2020: 1,225,688 t CO2e, 2021: 1,748,700 t CO2e, 2022: 2,100,161 t CO2e) ↗ Glossary."
"3 Includes business trips by plane, rail and rental car."
"As a result of the extensive travel restrictions in place during the pandemic, 2019 is used as a base year for more conclusive comparisons in terms of business travel."
4 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also included on a pro-rata basis under employee commuting and use phase (both Scope 3).
A distinction in the systems is currently not possible.
5 2019 is not directly comparable to the other years because an improved data basis was available from 2020 onwards.
"In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on data collected at major national and international BMW Group locations."
"The sites in Farnborough, UK, and Woodcliff Lake, USA, 
were included in the calculation for the first time in the reporting year 2023."
6 The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the 2023 reporting year.
"Previously, the CO2e values were calculated on the basis of a small set of TÜV-validated life cycle assessments performed for European vehicles."
"Enhancements to the IT system have made it possible to perform a 
differentiated calculation for all vehicles taking into account different energy mixes and carbon emission factors for different production regions (see ↗ Glossary)."
"The values in the time series were adapted using this new methodology (values based on prior methodology: 2019: 18,505,921 t CO2e, 2020: 
16,234,959 t CO2e, 2021: 18,534,765 t CO2e, 2022: 19,758,702 t CO2e)."
The values for 2019 through 2021 as well as 2023 shown in the table according to the new methodology were subjected to a reasonable assurance audit.
The carbon-reducing measures are taken into account from 2022 onwards.
The implementation of measures for 2022 was subjected to a limited assurance audit.
"7 Energy consumption values (lower calorific value) in the “Purchased goods and services” category and the “Disposal” category are estimated using the methodology specified in footnote (9): 113,179 GWh in the “Purchased goods and services” category and 908 GWh in the “Disposal” category."
"8 The absolute emissions in the use phase are based on the ↗ Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well-to-wheel)."
"The total value in t CO2 is the result of multiplying the average value with all BMW Group vehicles sold in the reporting period 
and an assumed average mileage of 200,000 km (as per VDA 900-100)."
"9 CO2e calculated based on life cycle assessments as per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles from the product lines using the “LCA for Experts” tool provided by Sphera (including climate-impacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6, NF3)."
"For definition, see ↗ Glossary."
"research centres, sales centres, office buildings)."
"2 Upper calorific value 
3 CHP losses refer to the losses resulting from converting a fuel source into electricity and heat in a combined heat and power plant (CHP plant)."
These are listed separately as of the 2022 reporting year.
"Energy consumption for the automotive production, motorcycle production and non-manufacturing sites was 
not adjusted retrospectively for previous years."
"As a result, the figures for 2022 are not directly comparable with previous years."
The methodology used to calculate carbon emissions changed in the reporting year 2023.
"Each vehicle is 
assigned an average value based on the CO2e assessment of individual transport movements."
The values in the time series were adapted using the new methodology.
"The emission factors were also adjusted retrospectively (values prior to change in methodology and adjustment of transport logistics (inbound 
and outbound) emission factors, excluding aftersales logistics: 2022: 2,100,161 t CO2e)."
"For more information about calculating the CO2e emissions, please refer to the ↗ Glossary."
"2 Figures relate to spare parts deliveries to vehicle production facilities (BMW Group and partner plants, excluding contract manufacturing)."
Further information can be found in the ↗ Glossary.
"In some cases, figures have been extrapolated for individual months."
"3 These figures refer to the distribution of manufactured vehicles (BMW Group, contract manufacturing and partial volumes for partner plants) to markets worldwide."
"2 The number of vehicles produced (BMW Group plants, partner plants and contract manufactur-
ing) increased year-on-year to around 2.66 million vehicles (2022: around 2.38 million)."
"Based 
on an average vehicle weight of BMW Group vehicles of around 2.0 tonnes, the total weight of in-
put materials is around 4.9 million tonnes."
"To calculate the individual material flows, the total 
weight is multiplied by the average distribution of the materials in BMW Group vehicles."
2 Potable water consumption refers to water purchased from external water suppliers.
"If a BMW 
Group location does not purchase water from an external supplier, the primary source of supply is 
counted as potable water."
"This applies to the BMW Group plants in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and 
Araquari, Brazil, where groundwater is the main source."
3 Value of the base year 2016 to the target reduction of -25% by 2030: 2.00.

CO2e is a unit of measurement used to standardise the climate 
impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as me-
thane or nitrous oxide."
"This is necessary because the individual 
gases do not all contribute equally to the greenhouse effect."
"In 
addition, the expert committee at the United Nations (Intergov-
ernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has defined “global 
warming potential” (GWP)."
"This is an index used to express 
warming impact compared with CO2 so that all GHGs are aggre-

"For example, over a period of 100 years, methane has 28 
times the impact of CO2, while for nitrous oxide the impact is 265 
times higher."

"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership 
between the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Busi-
ness Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), distin-
guishes between Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, 
based on their various sources."
"Whereas direct emissions (Scope 
1) are generated within a company through the combustion of 
fossil fuels, Scope 2 refers to the indirect emissions caused by 
the consumption of electricity and heat from externally generated 
sources of energy."
"Additional indirect (Scope 3) emissions are 
generated in the upstream and downstream stages of the value 
chain, for instance in the supply chain (upstream) and in the sub-
sequent use of products and services (downstream)."
"Carbon emissions from BMW Group locations per vehicle

"The conversion is based 
on emission factors for electricity, district heating and fuels from 
the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) in the 
most current valid version and occasionally local emission fac-
tors."
"This key indicator is the basis for measuring the strategic 
target by 2030 with regard to Scope 1 and 2 emissions."
"The re-
porting indicator is t CO2 per vehicle produced."
"CO2e emissions from the supply chain including transport 
logistics per vehicle produced (Scope 3 upstream) 
A methodology tailored specifically for BMW was created to as-
sess the supply chain and logistics emissions in terms of their 
CO2e equivalents."
"Due to the absence of supplier-specific CO2e 
values throughout the entire supply chain, a model incorporating 
industry averages and, when accessible, supplier-specific data is 
used."
"This method draws upon components of ISO 14040/44 
and follows common practice in preparing life cycle analyses 
(LCA)."
"However, it should be noted that this approach may not 
be directly comparable with methods or values employed by 
other companies."
"Due to a lack of data availability, various esti-
mates, assumptions and average values are used to determine 
the key indicator."
"The aim is to improve the quality of the model 
for calculating key metrics in future years."
"This will be achieved 
by boosting transparency in supply chains and expanding the de-
tail of the model, all while maintaining consistency in calculations 
over time."
"Contrary to the def-
inition of the scopes of the GHG Protocol, the following are not 
included: motorcycles, racing vehicles and aftersales products, 
including their transport logistics, as well as purchased IT cloud 
services and engineering or development services."
"Baseline calculation of supply chain emissions 
The initial calculation of the supply chain CO2e emissions for a 
representative selection of vehicles is based on their bill of mate-
rials."
"This selection reflects the range of vehicle classes (from 
premium compact to luxury) and types of drive (petrol, diesel, 
PHEV and BEV) produced during the period under review."
"For the representative vehicles, the CO2e emissions of all in-
stalled components are calculated on the basis of their material 
composition and related processing steps."
"Up to around 60,000 
individual entries are evaluated in each case."
"The CO2e value of 
the relevant vehicle is calculated by adding these contributions 
together."
"For the vast majority of vehicle models produced that are not in-
cluded in the representative vehicles, there is no individual CO2e 
calculation available on a bill of materials basis."
"A modular scal-
ing calculation method has been developed to include these in 
the overall result: 
The bill of materials of the representative vehicles is divided into 
sections (modules) according to functional criteria, and these are 
assessed in terms of their total CO2e emissions."
"Previously un-
assessed vehicle derivatives can now be custom-built using 
these basic components, with different building blocks selected 
based on the specific technical features of the target vehicles, in-
cluding engine type, all-wheel drive or body style."
"Components 
that do not fit are scaled from existing ones."
"The scaling tech-
niques are based on empirical data derived from similar analyses 
as well as on expert evaluations."
"This encompasses the scaling 
of detailed bodywork calculations ranging from sedans to touring 
models with identical engine specifications."
"For example, in the baseline calculation for 2023, there is a 520i 
listed as a bill of materials vehicle, but no 520i Touring."
"To en-
sure that the latter is accurately represented, the calculated CO2e 
emissions for components like the drivetrain, wheels, seats and 
so on remain unchanged, while the body values are multiplied by 
a scaling factor when calculating the Touring model."
"The methodology outlined above depends on the established 
“LCA for Experts” database (previously known as “GaBi”) from 
Sphera to ascertain CO2e factors for energy, raw materials and 
manufacturing processes."
"In this process, the current datasets 
are consistently used, starting with the 2023 reporting year."
"Ret-
rospectively from 2019 until the release of the current datasets 
at the end of February 2023, data from 2019 are used to calcu-
late CO2e emissions."
"The CO2e emissions of supply chains vary across different re-
gions of the world."
"For this reason, we allocate the production 
sites of the vehicles to one of three regions: Europe, Asia or the 
USA."
"We then calculate the emissions for the entire vehicle sup-
ply chain using the Sphera datasets that are valid for that region."
"The particularly emission-intensive components, battery cells 
and catalytic converter coating are specifically calculated based 
on their actual production region, regardless of the vehicle’s 
manufacturing location."
"In addition to the actual assembly sites of the 
battery cells, the material compositions and related production 
processes, it also accounts for the unique characteristics of the 
cell chemistry (anode and cathode) as well as the emissions as-
sociated with supplier-specific energy consumption."
"This approach gives each vehicle built during the period under 
review its specific CO2e value for supply chain emissions."
"The to-
tal fleet value of CO2e supply chain emissions is calculated by 
adding up the CO2e contributions of all vehicles produced in the 
reporting year."
"electricity from 
renewable sources, use of recycled materials)."
"Agreements with 
suppliers of aluminium and precious metals as well as high-volt-
age storage cells resulted in particularly high reduction contribu-
tions."
"The CO2e value for these components and materials before the 
implementation of measures is initially determined using the 
“LCA for Experts” database on the basis of the type and quantity 
of material."
The emission-reducing measures are then deducted.
"The calculation of the effect is also carried out using industry av-
erage values from “LCA for Experts” for green electricity and sec-
ondary raw materials."
"The total emission-reducing measures for all components and 
raw materials in the vehicles produced in the reporting year that 
are evaluated in this manner is subtracted from the baseline 
value."
"This results in the share of supply chain CO2e emissions in 
the reporting value of the overall indicator."
"The methodology for 
calculating the supply chain CO2e emissions outlined above 
marks a key improvement over the previous approach."
"This im-
provement allows for the inclusion of agreed-upon emission-re-
ducing measures at the level of individual components and raw 
materials, among other factors."
"Until 2022, each vehicle in the 
fleet was allocated the supply chain CO2e value of the most sim-
ilar vehicle from a small selection of vehicles that already had 
TÜV-validated life cycle assessments available."
"The reporting 
metric is then obtained by adding the transport logistics CO2e 
emissions, the calculation of which is described in the following 
section."
"An external service provider commissioned by BMW conducts 
the verification of measures at affected suppliers and their sub-
contractors at the impacted manufacturing sites."
"A defined 
method is used to ensure that the contractually agreed emis-
sions-reducing measures are implemented clearly and without 
duplication in the reporting year."
"There are some limitations re-
garding the clear and non-repetitive allocation of material flows 
with secondary raw materials."
"Therefore, the secondary material quota is confirmed using sys-
tem extracts from the relevant suppliers’ Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) systems, along with details and evidence of sec-
ondary material procurement through mass balances."
"Further-
more, written confirmation is obtained from suppliers and n-tier 
suppliers (via declarations of conformity) to clearly attribute sec-
ondary materials to BMW products, preventing any possibility of 
double-counting with other customers."
"Transport logistics’ share of the reporting value 
This indicator takes into account transport logistics emissions in 
the reporting year."
"Firstly, inbound and outbound transport flows 
are documented using IT-enabled billing and movement data to 
calculate the CO2e emissions in tonnes and the transport volume 
in tonne-kilometres."
"In inbound logistics (production supply), all transport flows of in-
dividual component parts for automobile manufacturing (BMW, 
MINI and Rolls Royce) are considered."
"This includes 
transportation from the Tier 1 supplier’s shipping location to the 
receipt of goods at individual production plants worldwide, in-
cluding partner plants and excluding contract manufacturing 
sites."
"In outbound logistics (vehicle distribution), all transport 
flows of new vehicles transported from the production sites 
through compounds and national distributors to individual deal-
erships worldwide are considered."
"Exceptions include partial vol-
umes from partner plants."
"CO2e emissions are calculated for the gross weight (component 
weight including packaging and shipping material) as well as the 
specific vehicle weight and the distance travelled in kilometres."
"This calculation is based on the respective CO2e emission factor, 
which varies depending on the technology and mode of transport 
(road, sea, rail or air)."
"The CO2e emission factors used are de-
rived from contemporary standards such as the GLEC Frame-
work V3.0 and ISO 14083, supplemented by supplier-specific 
values whenever possible."
"In a second step, an average, derivative-specific inbound CO2e 
value is assigned to each vehicle produced from the CO2e as-
sessed transport flows, based on plant location and type of drive, 
and an outbound CO2e value is assigned based on the factory-
market relationship."
"If inbound and/or outbound CO2e values for 
individual derivatives are missing in the recorded transport 
streams (step 1), these are supplemented on the basis of exist-
ing derivatives with similar transport routes."
"Consequently, each 
manufactured vehicle is allocated an inbound and outbound 
CO2e factor based on the production site and intended market."
"The share of CO2e emissions attributed to transport logistics 
within the “supply chain and logistics emissions” metric is deter-
mined by aggregating the inbound and outbound CO2e emis-
sions of all vehicles manufactured in the reporting year."
"This ap-
proach applies to the CO2e contributions from transport logistics 
in the base year and in 2022."
"CO2e emissions for the years 2019 to 2021 were calculated in 
previous corporate reports using a variety of emissions factors."
"Between 2019 and 2022, the recording or assessment of CO2e 
from transport movements was consistently improved."
"In 
line with the range of factors and data sources used for emis-
sions from 2022 onward, a retrospective assessment of 
transport logistics emissions is carried out for the years 2019 to 
2021, following the same methodology as from 2022 onward."
"This involves using factory- or market-specific inbound and out-
bound CO2e emissions data from 2022 for the vehicles produced 
in each corresponding year."
"Vehicle variants from 2019 to 2021 
that are no longer produced in 2022 will be supplemented on the 
basis of existing derivatives with similar transport routes."
"Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU (Scope 3 
downstream, tank-to-wheel) 
The average carbon emissions of a manufacturer’s fleet (use

"This is based on the volume of new registra-
tions by a manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, 
in the calendar year and the individual vehicle-specific carbon 
emissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test 
procedure."
"The BMW Group’s fleet carbon emissions figure, as 
measured internally, includes a legally permitted allowance for

Group’s sales."
"The calculated figures are increased by 10% to 
account for possible discrepancies between cycle values and real

"This indicator also includes the upstream emissions of the en-
ergy sources (fossil fuels and electricity used for charging), in line 
with the well-to-wheel approach."
"This covers the entire impact 
chain behind vehicle motion, i.e."
"from the generation and supply

"This approach 
also includes the environmental impacts associated with the pro-
duction of fuel and electricity."

"D 
Deliveries 
A new or used vehicle will be recorded as a delivery once handed 
over to the end user."
"End users also include leaseholders under 
lease contracts with BMW Financial Services and – in the US and 
Canada – dealerships when they designate a vehicle as a service 
loaner or demonstrator vehicle."
"In the case of used vehicles, end 
users may include dealerships and other third parties when they 
purchase a vehicle at auction or directly from the BMW Group."
"Vehicles designated for the end user which suffer a total loss in 
transit are also recorded as deliveries."
"Deliveries may be made 
by BMW AG, one of its international subsidiaries, a BMW Group 
retail outlet, or independent dealerships."
"The vast majority of de-
liveries – and hence the reporting to BMW Group of deliveries – 
are made by independent dealerships."
"In the US and Canada, 
the period start and end dates for the reporting of deliveries de-
viate immaterially from the beginning and, respectively, end of

"This approach also 
includes the environmental impacts associated with the produc-
tion of fuel and electricity."
"For example, the BMW Group uses the 
current energy report from the International Energy Agency (IEA; 
reference basis: previous year) as the basis for calculating emis-
sions from electrified vehicles (provision of electrical energy)."
"As 
a result, this approach can be divided into the following two com-
ponents: 
The well-to-tank method takes into account the carbon emis-
sions from the supply chain as well as the upstream fuel supply 
from the oil well or the energy generation source."
"As such, this 
approach considers the impact chain that arises until the energy 
is supplied to the vehicle, but does not include the vehicle itself."
"By contrast, the tank-to-wheel method takes into account the im-
pact chain of energy received (fuel, electricity) until it is converted 
into kinetic energy by the vehicle."
"As such, this approach consid-
ers the impact chain that arises during the use of the vehicle."
"Working hours/working times
