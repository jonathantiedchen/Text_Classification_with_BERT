"Since then, I’ve had the opportunity to get to know 
the people and the products that make up this great company all around the world."
"I’ve spoken to our customers, our colleagues in the research labs and the green-
houses, our marketing experts, and the scientists responsible for developing new medi-
cines and agricultural products."
Bayer is home to a wealth of expertise and incredible creative potential.
"Each encounter 
I’ve had has only heightened my enthusiasm for this company and its possibilities."
"I say that even though we have experienced some difficult setbacks and are facing 
some material challenges."
Rest assured that we will not allow ourselves to become discouraged.
"On the contrary: 
These setbacks drive us to get so much better and to demonstrate the potential that 
this company holds."
"We are currently in the process of fundamentally changing the way 
our company operates – to make Bayer faster and better-performing."
"Adjusted guidance reached, but not satisfied with the results 
This report contains our 2023 business performance."
"Although we reached our  
adjusted guidance, we cannot be satisfied with the results."
"Our sales of €47.6 billion –  
adjusted for currency and portfolio effects – were one percent lower than in the  
prior year."
EBITDA before special items fell by some 13 percent to €11.7 billion.
"And our core earnings per share, at €6.39, were almost 20 percent lower year on year."
Business performance in our three divisions varied widely.
"While sales and earnings at 
Crop Science declined significantly compared with the prior year, business performance 
at Consumer Health continued to be positive."
"At Pharmaceuticals, sales were level year 
on year on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis, but earnings fell substantially."
"To our Stockholders

With regard to our dividend, we put forward a proposal to pay out only the legally  
required minimum for the next three years."
"We didn’t take this decision lightly, but one 
of the company’s top priorities is reducing debt and increasing flexibility."
"This would  
result in a dividend of €0.11 per share for fiscal year 2023, which we will propose at the 
Annual Stockholders’ Meeting."
"On top of our high debt load, we continue to be burdened by litigation in the  
United States."
"We have won some lawsuits but lost others, and we have seen some  
unprecedented damages awards."
"We have filed appeals against the adverse verdicts 
and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously."
"The scientific and regulatory facts are 
on our side, as was demonstrated again last year, when the safety of glyphosate was 
confirmed by its reapproval in the European Union."
"We will make every effort to ensure 
that the plaintiff attorneys are not allowed to misrepresent these facts in court."
"After all, 
we want to invest our resources in innovation, not in the US litigation industry."
"We faced another setback in November 2023, when a major Phase III trial investigating 
our anticoagulant asundexian in patients with atrial fibrillation and the risk of stroke was 
discontinued."
"That was a big disappointment for all of us, even though we are well 
aware that this is always a risk for every pharmaceutical company."
"It is an unavoidable 
part of the search for medical breakthroughs."
"We will continue to investigate  
asundexian and are proceeding with our trial of this substance in stroke prevention."
"Bayer CEO Bill Anderson

We also have other promising candidates in our portfolio and are making good  
progress with them."
These setbacks have had a very negative impact on our share price.
"Let’s be clear: The 
current trajectory is unacceptable."
"That’s why we have initiated a radical transformation 
of our company – and we’re committed to regaining trust."
"A new operating model to boost performance 
Bayer has huge potential."
"But as in many large companies, we often make life difficult 
for ourselves."
"There is a whole lot of coordination, monitoring and supervision going on."
"In some areas, we have 12 hierarchy levels between the CEO and the customer."
"Because this traditional approach of top-down management 
doesn’t place products and customers at the heart of daily work."
"Decisions take far too 
long."
Initiative and creativity are stifled by bureaucracy.
That’s why we want to turn our system on its head.
"In the future, 95 percent of the  
decision-making will shift to the people actually doing the work."
"We are introducing a 
new operating model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership."
"This new system will  
reduce hierarchy levels, eliminate bureaucracy and significantly accelerate decision-
making."
"We will primarily work in small, self-managed teams, totally focused on  
improving our products and the lives of our customers."
"This shift will enable us to  
unleash the entrepreneurial power of each individual and ensure that all of our efforts  
are focused on the needs of consumers, patients and farmers."
"Already, 4,000 colleagues are involved, and we plan to roll out the system to every part 
of Bayer."
We want to reach each area of the company by the end of 2024.
This change will also lead to a considerable number of job reductions.
"That is a  
necessary consequence of reducing hierarchy levels and making the company leaner."
"We will proceed in a fair and socially responsible manner, as has always been the way at 
Bayer."
"In Germany, we have reached an agreement with the employee representatives 
on the Supervisory Board in the form of a Joint Declaration."
"I am well aware that the changes within the company will have a significant impact on 
our employees."
"However, these steps are necessary to get Bayer swiftly back on track."
And the result will create much more meaningful jobs.
"The people of Bayer share this

view."
They are looking forward to holding greater responsibility for their company.
"And I would like to offer my sincere thanks to our employee representatives and our 
people worldwide for the excellent results they have achieved during the past year,  
despite some challenging conditions."
"Innovation to drive our mission forward 
Last year, Team Bayer once again demonstrated our creativity and innovative power."
Here are just a few examples of how we are driving our mission forward.
"Our team at Crop Science is launching innovation that will make agriculture both  
more productive and more environmentally friendly over the coming decades."
"One  
such innovation is the Preceon™ Smart Corn System, which makes corn more resilient 
in extreme weather conditions by reducing its height."
"We have also launched our  
new system for direct-seeded rice in India, which can lower greenhouse gas emissions  
and water consumption by up to 40 percent."
"At Pharmaceuticals, we have reached important milestones in our clinical trials in the 
field of cell and gene therapy for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease."
"In addition, two 
molecules from our chemoproteomics platform have also reached the clinical testing 
phase."
"We hope that these programs will one day enable us to help cancer patients 
whose needs are currently unmet."
"We have also made considerable progress in our late-stage pipeline, where seven of 
our drug candidates are now moving toward marketing authorization."
"We have seen 
very positive results in two studies of our potential blockbuster elinzanetant, which is 
being developed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms."
"Furthermore, we have  
received regulatory approval for Eylea™ 8 mg in both the European Union and Japan, 
which will put us in a position to sustain market leadership in the treatment of two  
serious forms of eye disease."
"And our recently launched products Nubeqa™ for cancer 
and Kerendia™ for heart and kidney disease are continuing to grow rapidly and in  
additional countries."
"At Consumer Health, we have set up a new Precision Health unit to develop custom-
ized digital solutions that help people make better-informed and more individualized 
self-care decisions."
We also had major product launches last year.
"In China, for  
example, we strengthened our Elevit™ nutritional supplement brand, and in Europe we 
entered the attractive probiotics market with an oral product for women’s intimate health."
"To our Stockholders
Chairman’s Letter
Bayer Annual Report 2023

We have also systematically implemented our sustainability strategy over the past  
year, and we remain on track to achieve our ambitious targets."
"One of the highlights  
in 2023 was the landmark agreement that we signed in the United States, which will  
enable us to secure 40 percent of our global electricity demand out of renewable  
energy sources in the future."
"We also presented our new water strategy at the  
UN Water Conference in New York, which will make water stewardship an integral  
part of our business and investment decisions."
"We are one of the first companies in  
the world to take such a step."
"All of these advances in innovation and sustainability show what our company is  
capable of."
And we are still hitting our stride.
"We will make every effort to realize this 
potential in full."
"We remain focused on our vital mission of Health for all, Hunger  
for none, and we will put aside everything that is off-mission."
"We have set ourselves  
ambitious targets to make sure that Bayer is a faster, better and more innovative  
company in the future, for the benefit of our shareholders and everyone else we serve."
Thank you for being a part of our journey.

Report of the Supervisory Board 
 
2023 was a challenging year for Bayer."
"Various external factors such as global crises, wars, high inflation 
and raw-material prices, and unfavorable exchange rate developments had a negative effect on Bayer’s 
business."
"From the Supervisory Board’s perspective, business performance was not satisfactory."
"In addition to performing extensive oversight around these issues, the Supervisory Board addressed in 
particular the reorganization of Bayer’s leadership team."
"In February, it appointed Bill Anderson as a 
member of the Board of Management effective April 1, and Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) 
effective June 1."
"The Supervisory Board also appointed a new Chief Talent Officer in 2023, making  
Heike Prinz a member of the Board of Management and Labor Director."
"In addition, the Supervisory 
Board engaged in deliberations in relation to its own composition."
"At the 2024 Annual Stockholders’ 
Meeting, it will propose the reelection of two members with a proven track record, as well as the election 
of three new members to succeed members who are stepping down."
"During 2023, the Supervisory Board monitored the conduct of the company’s business by the Board of 
Management on a regular basis with the aid of detailed written and oral reports received from the Board of 
Management, and also acted in an advisory capacity."
"In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
maintained a constant exchange of information with the respective Chairman and the other members of 
the Board of Management."
"In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was regularly in direct contact with 
the head of the Global Compliance and Data Privacy department, including outside of the meetings."
"The Supervisory 
Board was involved in decisions of material importance to the company."
"We discussed at length the busi-
ness trends described in the reports from the Board of Management and the prospects."
"Work of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board convened eight times in 2023."
"The attendance rate of the individual Supervisory 
Board members at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees is disclosed at the end of 
this Report."
The members of the Board of Management generally attended the meetings of the Supervisory Board.
"However, the Supervisory Board also met regularly without the Board of Management or with only the 
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) present."
"Each ordinary meeting formally includes an “execu-
tive session” as a separate agenda item, during which no Board of Management members are present."
"Ordinary Audit Committee meetings also include executive sessions that involve the Audit Committee con-
sulting with the auditor without the presence of the Board of Management."
"To our Stockholders

The employee representatives and the stockholder representa-
tives each held preparatory discussions prior to the ordinary 
meetings of the Supervisory Board."
"The deliberations of the Supervisory Board in 2023 primarily  
related to Bayer’s strategy and business performance, along with 
the composition of the Board of Management."
"The work of the 
Supervisory Board primarily covered the following focal points, 
with each topic discussed at several meetings: Firstly, the com-
position of the Board of Management, and especially the change 
in Chairman (CEO)."
"Secondly, Bayer’s economic position, the 
company’s strategic alignment and the introduction of a new op-
erating model, Dynamic Shared Ownership."
"Thirdly, the principal  
litigations, particularly relating to glyphosate and PCBs, which 
were extensively addressed by the full Supervisory Board and 
additionally by the Audit Committee."
"Fourthly, matters relating to 
Board of Management compensation and compensation report-
ing, which were covered in detail by the full Supervisory Board 
and additionally by the Human Resources and Compensation 
Committee."
"At its individual meetings, the Supervisory Board mainly focused on the following topics and passed the 
following written resolutions: 
1."
"At an extraordinary meeting in February, the Supervisory Board appointed Bill Anderson as a member 
of the Board of Management effective April 1, 2023, and as Chairman of the Board of Management 
(CEO) effective June 1, 2023."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board approved the early departure of  
Werner Baumann as Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) effective May 31, 2023, and the 
conclusion of a termination agreement with him."
"At another meeting in February, the Supervisory Board discussed the Annual Report for 2022, the 
Compensation Report, and the Notice of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting 2023."
"At its ordinary meeting ahead of the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in April, the Supervisory Board dis-
cussed the company’s business performance to date."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board approved the 
issuance of new bonds and dealt with matters relating to the upcoming Annual Stockholders’ Meeting."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board reelected Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann as Chairman of the Super-
visory Board, subject to his reelection as a Supervisory Board member at the Annual Stockholders’ 
Meeting."
"By way of a written resolution in May, the Supervisory Board approved the submission of a binding  
offer for an exclusive license with Bicycle Therapeutics for the development of peptide-based radiation 
therapies."

"At its June meeting, the Supervisory Board again dealt with Board of Management matters, including 
in particular the expiry of Sarena Lin’s contract on January 31, 2024, as well as Board of Management 
compensation."
"The Supervisory Board again looked at the status of the principal litigations and  
prepared for its strategy meeting in September."
"At its extraordinary meeting in August, the Supervisory Board appointed Heike Prinz as a member  
of the Board of Management and Labor Director effective September 1, 2023."
"It also approved the 
early departure of Sarena Lin effective August 31, 2023, and the conclusion of a termination agree-
ment with her."
"The Supervisory Board approved the issuance of a hybrid bond and again discussed 
the company’s strategic alignment."
It also prepared for the strategy meeting in September.
"In September, the Supervisory Board held meetings on two consecutive days in the Swiss city of  
Basel, where the Consumer Health Division is headquartered."
"During these meetings, the Supervisory 
Board took an extensive look at Bayer’s transition to a new operating model, Dynamic Shared Owner-
ship."
"It focused on the details of the model and the prerequisites for ensuring successful execution, 
with insights provided by organizational experts and presentations given by executives from other 
companies that had implemented similar transitions."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board addressed in 
detail the strategies of the Group and the three divisions, each as a separate agenda item."
"It also  
dealt with the company’s financial performance and approved a program involving several financing 
measures."
"The Presidial Committee was authorized to approve the individual measures under the pro-
gram."
"Other agenda items related to a report on Bayer’s business in Switzerland as well as a presen-
tation and discussion of possible structural measures for the Bayer Group."
"The Supervisory Board also 
dealt in detail with the status of the various litigations, and especially the glyphosate and PCB litiga-
tions."
"Together with its independent legal advisor, John H."
"Beisner, it discussed how the status and 
development of the litigations should be assessed."
"Outside of the meetings, the Supervisory Board 
met with some of the managers based at the site."
"By way of a written resolution passed in October, the Supervisory Board approved the implementation 
of several financing measures, including the issuance of bonds in 144A/RegS format, as well as the 
resulting expansion of the company’s financing framework."
"At an information session in November arranged at short notice, the Board of Management provided 
the Supervisory Board with detailed information on the discontinuation of the OCEANIC-AF Phase III 
trial investigating asundexian in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke."
"At its December meeting, the Supervisory Board discussed the progress made with the introduction  
of the Dynamic Shared Ownership operating model."
"The Supervisory Board discussed the provisional 
operational planning for 2024 and approved the scope of Bayer’s external financing."
"It addressed the 
public perception of the company and discussed planned communication measures."
"It examined the 
options for using artificial intelligence (AI) at Bayer and looked at the results of a self-assessment the  
Supervisory Board had undertaken with the support of external consultants."
"The Supervisory Board 
entrusted the Presidial Committee with the task of drawing up corresponding measures to act on the 
self-assessment findings."
"It resolved the regular declaration of compliance with the German Corporate 
Governance Code and discussed the planned modifications to the Board of Management compensa-
tion system, which is to be presented to the 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting."
"By way of a written resolution passed in December, the Supervisory Board approved the operational 
planning for 2024."
"Reports on 
the committee meetings were presented at the meetings of the full Supervisory Board."
"Presidial Committee: This comprises the Chairman and Vice Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board along 
with a further stockholder representative and a further employee representative."
"The Presidial Committee 
serves primarily as the mediation committee pursuant to the German Codetermination Act."
"It has the 
task of submitting proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of 
Management if the necessary two-thirds majority is not achieved in the first vote at a full Supervisory Board 
meeting."
"In addition, certain decision-making powers in connection with capital measures, including the 
power to amend the Articles of Incorporation accordingly, have been delegated to this committee."
"The  
Supervisory Board can also delegate certain responsibilities to the Presidial Committee on a case-by-case 
basis."
"Furthermore, the Presidial Committee may undertake preparatory work for meetings of the full  
Supervisory Board."
No meeting of the Presidial Committee had to be convened in 2023.
"The Supervisory Board entrusted  
the Presidial Committee with the task of drawing up the conclusions to be made from the findings of the 
Supervisory Board’s self-assessment."
"Audit Committee: The Audit Committee comprises three stockholder representatives and three  
employee representatives."
Other members of the committee also have expertise in these areas.
"The Audit 
Committee meets regularly five times a year."
"It also addresses relevant topics in the tax, finance and treasury areas."
"Further 
tasks include holding discussions with the Board of Management on the half-year financial reports and any 
quarterly reports or quarterly statements to be issued prior to their publication."
"The committee prepares 
the auditor selection process and submits a reasoned proposal to the Supervisory Board regarding the  
appointment of the auditor."
"It also prepares the agreements with the auditor (dealing in particular with the 
awarding of the audit contract, the determination of the main areas of focus for the audit and the audit fee 
agreement) and takes appropriate measures to determine and monitor the auditor’s independence."
"The 
Audit Committee regularly assesses the quality of the audit and resolves on the approval of any other con-
tracts awarded to the auditor, paying special attention to any potential implications for the auditor’s inde-
pendence."

audit planning, and the audit results with the auditor."

The Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) and the Chief Financial Officer regularly attended the 
meetings of the Audit Committee."
"Representatives of the auditor were also present at all the meetings and 
reported in detail on the audit work and the audit reviews of the half-year report and quarterly statements."
"Every ordinary meeting includes a part where the committee meets alone with the auditor, i.e."
"without the 
Board of Management present."
"The Audit Committee discussed developments in the area of corporate compliance and the latest reports 
from Internal Audit at each of its meetings, where necessary."
"The individual Audit Committee meetings also mainly focused on the following topics:  
1."
"At the February meeting, the Audit Committee discussed the financial statements of Bayer AG and the 
consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group."
"It also carefully considered the risk report, which 
covers the risk early warning system and other aspects, and the report on the internal control system 
(ICS)."
"In addition, the Audit Committee dealt with the yearly compliance report and the developments 
in compliance and legal cases."
"Other topics included the yearly report by Internal Audit and a report on

"The consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group 
were prepared according to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the  
European Union."
"The applicable further requirements of Section 315a of the German Commercial Code 
were also taken into account."
"The Combined Management Report was prepared according to the German 
Commercial Code."
"The auditor, Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, has audited the financial statements 
of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the Combined Management 
Report."
The auditor responsible for the audit was Michael Mehren.
"The conduct of the audit is explained in 
the auditor’s reports."
"The 
financial statements of Bayer AG, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group, the Combined 
Management Report and the audit reports were submitted to all members of the Supervisory Board."
They were discussed in detail by the Audit Committee and at a meeting of the full Supervisory Board.
"The 
auditor submitted a report on both occasions and was present during the discussions."
"We examined the financial statements of Bayer AG, the proposal by the Board of Management for the use 
of the distributable profit, the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group and the Combined 
Management Report."
"While examining the Combined Management Report, we also examined in particular 
the nonfinancial statement, which is fully integrated into the Management Report and was also examined 
by the auditor."
"We have no objections, and thus we concur with the result of the audit."
"We have approved the financial statements of Bayer AG and the consolidated financial statements of  
the Bayer Group prepared by the Board of Management."
"The financial statements of Bayer AG are thus 
confirmed."
"We are in agreement with the Combined Management Report and, in particular, with the as-
sessment of the future development of the enterprise."
"We also concur with the dividend policy and the  
decisions concerning earnings retention by the company."
"We assent to the proposal by the Board of  
Management for the use of the distributable profit, which provides for payment of a dividend of €0.11 per 
share and the allocation of the remaining amount to other retained earnings."
"The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Board of Management and all employees for their  
dedication and hard work in 2023."
"The guidance downgrade for full-year 2023 in July, the 
discontinuation of an important Phase III trial involving our investigational drug asundexian, and further 
uncertainties around the litigations were among the major headwinds."
"Additional factors included 
challenging market dynamics for Crop Science, ongoing price declines in key pharmaceutical markets, 
the rise in inflation and unfavorable exchange rate developments."
"Following the change at the helm of the company in the middle of the year, our new CEO Bill Anderson 
announced plans to work together with the entire workforce to accelerate innovation, improve performance 
and leverage the company’s full potential moving forward."
"Despite stabilizing toward the end of the year, Bayer stock closed the year down 27.5% against 2022, 
at €33.63 per share."
"The German stock index (DAX 40) was up 20.3% over the same period, while the 
EURO STOXX 50 rose by 22.2%."
Bayer AG’s market capitalization fell by €14.5 billion to €33 billion.
"These developments were reflected in the reports by sell-side analysts, who adjusted their models and 
share price targets accordingly."

Dividend policy to be amended in order to reduce debt 
Bayer AG plans to amend its dividend policy to pay out the legally required minimum for three years."
"The 
Board of Management and Supervisory Board will therefore propose a dividend of €0.11 per share for 
2023 (2022: €2.40)."
"The dividend proposal will help the company to reduce debt and, in turn, interest 
expense and improve its free cash flow situation."
"The dividend corresponds to 1.7% of 2023 core EPS 
(2022: 30%)."
"Based on the Bayer share price at the end of 2023, the dividend yield is 0.3% (2022: 5.0%)."
"At the end of the year, Bayer was ranked 13th in the DAX 40 
according to market capitalization."

"International ownership structure 
Our company’s global footprint is also reflected in our international ownership structure."
"The biggest 
share of our capital stock, at 34.2%, is held by investors in North America."
"This represents a decline of 
1.3 percentage points compared with the previous year."
"German-based stockholders remain a key group 
of investors, holding 23.5% of Bayer stock, while shareholders in the United Kingdom account for 11.3%."

"According to our share register, we had approximately 638,000 stockholders at the end of 2023."
"Bayer has a 100% free float as defined by Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange."
"Bayer management and the Investor Relations team continued to maintain their intensive dialogue with 
analysts and investors in 2023."
"As usual, this included numerous investor conferences and roadshows."
"Our capital-market communications largely centered around the change in CEO and the resulting effects 
on our company strategy, as well as updates on our latest innovations."
"This continuous dialogue with 
analysts and investors is an important way for us to receive their input and feedback."
"In total, Investor 
Relations participated in more than 500 engagements in 2023, both in person and in virtual settings."

In June, we held a Crop Science Innovation Summit in New York and a Pharmaceuticals R&D Day in 
Boston."
"During these events, we provided strategy updates on our research and development activities 
and shared insights into our innovation progress and ambitions."
"We also held our 2023 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in a virtual setting based on the new legislation, with 
stockholders essentially afforded the same rights as during an in-person Annual Stockholders’ Meeting."
This new format enabled direct dialogue with stockholders during the event via video communication.
"In particular, shareholders had the right to submit motions and election proposals during the virtual Annual 
Stockholders’ Meeting, as well as to speak."
"In addition, shareholders had the right to ask questions and 
obtain feedback during the event."
"Prior to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, stockholders were also able 
to submit written statements via the Stockholders’ Portal."
"Based on our positive experience last year, we will hold our 2024 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting in a virtual 
setting, too."
Stockholders will have the same rights as they had at last year’s event.
"In addition to bilateral investor conversations, conferences and roadshows, we also hosted two webinars 
during which we provided information on current topics."
"Here, we feel it is important to bring in experts 
from the divisions and central functions as this helps give capital market participants a deeper 
understanding of the various topics while also providing a direct channel for investors to communicate 
their needs to the company."
"With respect to the ESG ratings, our biggest accomplishment was being upgraded to “Prime” by ISS ESG."
"Overall, we have a good performance rating profile that reflects our ongoing transparency efforts."
"However, we continue to see room for improvement as regards certain ESG ratings on controversial 
issues, with occasional unfavorable ratings for topics such as glyphosate and GMOs."
"Success on the bond markets for Bayer – total issue volume exceeding €10 billion 
Central banks continued to maintain their restrictive monetary policy in 2023 as inflation rates remained 
high."
"The deposit facility rate of the European Central Bank rose from 2% to 4% over the course of the 
year, while the Federal Reserve hiked the US federal funds rate by a further 100 basis points to a range of 
5.25% to 5.50%."
"As a result, long-term interest rates also remained at a high level, and in some cases 
even continued to rise."
"Furthermore, uncertainty among market participants declined significantly compared with 2022."
"The 
predicted natural gas shortages in Europe had a much less significant impact on European economic 
output than initially assumed."
"The most important economic data in Europe and the United States was 
encouraging throughout the year despite high interest rates, and there were also some particularly 
promising signals from the unemployment figures."
"Although Russia continued its war in Ukraine, the 
conflict did not escalate to a global level as had been feared."
"All of these factors led to a tightening of 
credit spreads in 2023, and only the insolvency of two smaller US banks and Credit Suisse in spring 2023 
caused a brief opposing effect."

The interest rate environment in combination with rebounding confidence among market participants 
resulted in a productive 2023 on the bond markets."
"After plummeting in 2022, absolute issue volumes for 
corporate bonds returned to 2021 levels."
"Bayer was among the companies looking to capitalize on the 
positive market environment, and in 2023 placed three separate bonds with a total volume in excess of 
€10 billion."
"A €3 billion bond was placed on the euro market in May 2023, split into three tranches with maturities 
of 3.25, 6.25 and 10 years."
"Before issuing the bond, we held a roadshow that attracted a great deal of 
interest among investors, ultimately resulting in a heavily oversubscribed order book."
"A new hybrid bond with a volume of €1.75 billion was issued in September 2023, split into two tranches 
with noncall periods of 5.25 years and 8.25 years."
"The objective of the issuance was to facilitate the early 
partial refinancing of the €1.5 billion hybrid bond with an optional call date in 2024 and the €1 billion 
hybrid bond with an optional call date in 2025."
"In parallel with the new issuance, we offered existing 
investors the option of early redemption for these two hybrid bonds."
"The tender offer was accepted by 
investors representing approximately €1.4 billion of the nominal volume, enabling us to significantly lower 
our refinancing costs."
"In November 2023, we issued a US$5.75 billion bond on the US market."
"The volume was split over five 
tranches with maturities of three, just over five, seven, ten and thirty years."
"As Bayer had not been present 
on the US market since 2018, we held a two-day virtual roadshow ahead of the issuance that attracted a 
huge amount of interest among investors in that country."
"The company plans to mainly use the proceeds 
to repay financial liabilities due in 2024."
"Furthermore, bonds with a total volume of US$3.5 billion and €500 million were redeemed over the course 
of the year."

"Sarena Lin left the company effective August 31, 2023."
"Our divisions are active in the following areas: 
Crop Science is the world’s leading agriculture enterprise by sales, with businesses in crop protection, 
seeds and traits."
"We offer a broad portfolio of high-value seeds, improved plant traits, innovative chemical 
and biological crop protection products, digital solutions and extensive customer service for sustainable 
agriculture."
We market these products primarily via wholesalers and retailers or directly to farmers.
"Most of 
our crop protection products are manufactured at the division’s own production sites."
"Numerous 
decentralized formulation and filling sites enable the company to respond quickly to the needs of local 
markets."
"The breeding, propagation, production and/or processing of seeds, including seed dressing, take 
place at locations close to our customers, either at our own facilities or under contract."
"Pharmaceuticals concentrates on prescription products, especially for cardiology and women’s 
healthcare, and on specialty therapeutics focused on the areas of oncology, hematology, ophthalmology 
and, in the medium term, cell and gene therapy."
"In the area of cell and gene therapy, we operate a 
strategic unit spanning the entire value creation chain from research and development to marketing and 
patients."
"The division also comprises the radiology business, which markets diagnostic imaging equipment 
and digital solutions together with the necessary contrast agents."

Our company has a global footprint."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Bayer Group comprised 340 
consolidated companies in approximately 80 countries."
"As one of the world’s leading companies in the fields of health and 
nutrition, we can play a key role in devising solutions to tackle these challenges."
"To support our endeavors in this regard, we primarily rely on innovations – not only to develop new 
products and solutions, but also to drive the digitalization of our business processes."
"We are active in 
regulated and highly profitable businesses that are driven by innovation and in which we have the objective 
to grow ahead of the competition."
"At the same time, we are also working on optimizing our resource 
allocation and cost base."
"Growth and sustainability go hand in hand; our business activities have the 
potential to make a significant contribution to achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs)."
"We also pursue resolute, science-based climate action along our entire value chain."
"Our strategy is subject to regular review to ensure adjustments can be made to reflect changes that arise 
across the economic and political landscape."
"We are currently working on a radical realignment of our 
operating model as a top priority."
"This new model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), is 
designed to put patients, farmers and consumers front and center, while also accelerating the pace of 
innovation and unlocking the potential of each and every employee."
"The DSO model envisages that our employees work in small, self-managed teams that are focused on a 
customer or a product."
"Activities are prioritized on the basis of their contribution to the mission, and 
progress is measured in short, 90-day cycles, giving us much greater agility."
"It also enables us to eliminate 
coordination work and reduce management layers."
"These challenges have spurred 
rapid, disruptive changes in the industry, changing competition across the value chain, creating new 
players and opening up new sales opportunities."
"In this dynamic environment, the speed and scale of innovation and a focus on sustainable results for our 
customers are crucial factors for success."
"We develop intelligent and integrated approaches for 
our customers, such as our Preceon™ Smart Corn System, our next-generation herbicide-tolerant 
soybean varieties, wheat hybrids, direct-seeded rice (DSR), biotechnology traits for corn in Africa and Asia, 
and carbon farming."
"An additional concept we are involved in is CoverCress™ for biofuels, which 
encompasses an oilseed for biofuels that offers cover-crop benefits for the ecosystem."
"Combining our portfolio with digital insights increases the efficacy of our products and the benefits for 
farmers, as is the case with our Climate FieldView™ digital software platform, for example."

Our mission is to transform the agricultural sector at scale on the basis of regenerative farming and to 
create a more sustainable food production system."
"For us, regenerative agriculture is an outcome-based 
production model based on two key building blocks: productivity, which focuses on helping farms to 
produce more with less; and regeneration, which focuses on delivering a positive impact on nature."
"As part of our commitment to sustainable agriculture, we are pursuing ambitious sustainability targets for 
2030."
"We aim to enable our farming customers to reduce their on-field greenhouse gas emissions per 
mass unit of crop produced by 30% compared to the overall base year emission intensity1."
"This applies to 
the highest greenhouse gas-emitting crop systems in the regions Bayer serves with its products.2 We also 
aim to reduce the environmental impact of our global crop protection portfolio per hectare by 30% against 
a 2014-2018 average baseline."
"Pharmaceuticals 
Driven by an aging population, the incidence of chronic diseases is on the rise, and an increasing number 
of patients are suffering from multiple conditions affecting their quality of life."
"Scientific breakthroughs in 
fields such as cell and gene therapy and precision medicine have the potential to cure patients with the 
highest unmet needs or even prevent diseases in the first place."
"In this regard, the pharmaceuticals market 
offers significant opportunities."
"At the same time, we also see risks arising from the global pressure on 
pricing coupled with rising costs and increased pressure to deliver value."
"We have therefore defined clear 
strategic priorities: maximizing the operational performance of our marketed products and renewing our 
topline with successful launches and advances in our late-stage research and development pipeline."
"We are concentrating on leveraging our current portfolio to its fullest potential, while simultaneously 
renewing our topline by building on three new medicines with significant sales potential."
"Two of them – 
Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ – are already on the market."
"The third compound, elinzanetant, is making good 
progress in our late-stage R&D pipeline."
"In addition, we will continue investigating the active ingredient 
asundexian in a study, and are currently reevaluating additional indications in patients in need of 
antithrombotic treatment."
"We are therefore focusing our marketing and R&D resources on ensuring the 
success of these strategic products."
"Furthermore, we own the full global marketing rights for the above-
mentioned products."
"In line with this approach, we are investing to further grow and build our US

"We 
leverage an agile innovation model and collaborate with external partners to provide consumers with 
innovative solutions that best address their everyday health needs."
"Through acquisitions and partnerships, 
we have gained access to new business models and capabilities to provide personalized diagnostics and 
treatment solutions."
We pursue ambitious sustainability targets.
"By 2030, we aim to expand access to self-care for 100 million 
people in economically or medically underserved communities."
"We are executing this ambition by fully 
embedding sustainability across our operations to offer solutions that best serve consumers, in particular 
those for whom self-care is the primary form of care."
"Climate action and decarbonization 
Climate change impacts us all and poses one of the greatest challenges for the future of humankind."
"We 
support the Paris Agreement and its objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial 
levels."
"Bayer’s Climate Program is built on three pillars: 
// Reducing our own emissions: Decarbonization is a top priority for us and we are committed to reducing 
the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with our products."
"We have set ourselves the goal of 
achieving net zero GHG emissions (including across our entire value chain) by 2050 or earlier."
"The 
targets we pursue as part of our decarbonization program have been confirmed by the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"The first step is to reduce our emissions by more than 42% by the end of 2029 
compared with the 2019 baseline."
"This will involve a variety of measures, such as switching to 
renewable sources for 100% of the electricity we purchase."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
1.2 Strategy and Management 
34
// Transforming our product portfolio and leveraging new business models: The adjustments and 
changes that climate change will bring for our business fields are embedded in our strategies and 
processes."
We intend to mitigate the risks and capitalize on the opportunities.
"To achieve this, we 
continuously analyze the impact of climate change on our own business operations as well as on the 
activities in our upstream and downstream value chain."
"We publish our Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report each year to increase transparency."
"As a science-based company, 
we place particular emphasis on our innovation capabilities in all divisions."
"// Reducing emissions within and outside our value chain: We are also cooperating with our suppliers and 
customers to reduce GHG emissions along the upstream and downstream value chain by at least 
12.3% by 2029 compared with the 2019 baseline."
"We additionally aim to reduce emissions outside our 
value chain by 2030, helping to achieve global climate targets."
"This involves our company purchasing 
certificates from certified climate protection projects that satisfy externally recognized quality standards."
"Alongside these commitments, our Crop Science Division is delivering innovations to strengthen climate 
resilience, with further significant contributions being made in the value chains of the agricultural 
industry."
"Nonfinancial Group targets 
To advance and measure the implementation of our strategy, we have set nonfinancial Group targets."
8 Values for 2022 were updated due to new findings in category 3.1.
"9 To be offset by purchasing certificates from verified climate protection projects, primarily in forestry and agriculture 
 
In our Crop Science Division, we support smallholder farmers by supplying high-quality seeds and crop 
protection products, technologies and services."
"In 2023, together with the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation, the Bayer Foundation continued to support Mercy Corps AgriFin’s Digital Farmer II program, 
for example."
"The program is aimed at providing smallholder farmers in Africa with access to digital 
offerings, such as information and financial products and services, through 2025."
"In 2023, we supported 
53 million smallholder farmers (2022: 52 million) in low- and middle-income countries."
"Due to the 
divestment of the Environmental Science Professional business in October 2022, the number of 
smallholder farmers no longer contains the respective Vector Control reach from 2023 onwards."
"Alongside product sales, we are also engaged in partnerships like “The Challenge 
Initiative” with the Gates Institute at Johns Hopkins University."
"The partnership programs we support 
help numerous women in Asia and Africa gain access to modern contraception, irrespective of the method 
or manufacturer."
"In 2023, we were able to increase the number of women reached to 46 million (2022: 
44 million)."
"In our Consumer Health Division, we advance access to everyday health for people in underserved 
communities."
"We leverage our global brands and partnerships to develop and adapt self-care solutions for 
low-income consumers, bring targeted health education to communities who need it most, establish 
critical distribution channels, and advocate globally for science-based and accessible self-care."
"Our 
signature program, the Nutrient Gap Initiative, aims to tackle malnutrition brought about by widespread 
micronutrient deficiency in underserved communities around the globe, preventing irreversible health 
damage and breaking the cycle of poverty."
"Through our global partnership with Vitamin Angels, we focus 
on underserved pregnant women and their babies who are particularly vulnerable, improving access to 
micronutrients for 4 million mothers and babies globally every year."
"Through all our direct efforts and 
partnerships, we reached 51 million people in 2023 (2022: 49 million), and an additional 23 million in India."
"Bayer was ranked #1 in Nutrition in the 2023 Food and Agriculture Benchmark which assessed 350 of the 
most influential food and agriculture companies around the world, up from #23 in 2021."
"As part of our climate strategy, we reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 0.03 million 
metric tons of CO2 equivalents (–0.9%) year on year in 2023, mainly due to a greater share of electricity 
being purchased from renewable energy sources."
"In the Scope 3 Science Based Targets (SBT) categories 
that are relevant for our company, our emissions fell by 0.54 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents, 
representing a decrease of 6.0% compared with 2022."
"The fall in Scope 3 emissions in the SBT-relevant 
Scope 3 categories was largely attributable to reduced purchasing volumes (Scope 3.1) and the 
associated logistics operations (Scope 3.4)."
"In addition, we offset 0.6 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents through external projects to achieve 
carbon neutrality at our own sites."
"The planning and steering process is 
complemented by the continuous monitoring of business developments, with key financial and nonfinancial 
management and performance indicators being updated regularly."
"Sales growth is 
measured in terms of the change in sales after adjusting for currency and portfolio effects (Fx & portfolio 
adj.) in order to reflect the operational business development of the Group and the divisions."
"A key 
measure of profitability is the EBITDA margin before special items, which is the ratio of EBITDA before 
special items to sales."
"Another important profitability indicator for the Bayer Group is core earnings per 
share, which is the core net income divided by the weighted average number of shares."
"Free cash flow – 
an absolute indicator – shows the generation of freely available financial resources and also reflects the 
company’s financial strength and earning power."

Patents 
We routinely apply for patent protection for our innovations in both chemical crop protection and 
seed / biotechnology."
The link between patents and products is relatively complex.
"Products often combine 
multiple technologies that are patented differently in different areas of the world, with patents often granted 
only late in the product life cycle."
"Although the patents have already expired for some of our crop protection active ingredients, such as 
glyphosate, trifloxystrobin, prothioconazole, bixafen7 or imidacloprid, we have a portfolio of patents on 
formulations, mixtures and / or manufacturing processes for these active ingredients."
"In addition, fluopyram 
is patent-protected until 2025 in the United States and Brazil, and there are supplementary protection 
certificates granted in several European countries including Germany, France and the United Kingdom until 
2024."
"The younger active ingredient tetraniliprole has patent protection until 2029 in Germany, France, the 
United Kingdom, Brazil, Canada and other countries, and in the United States its patent protection 
extends until 20308."
"The patent coverage on 
our current generation of soybean traits (Roundup Ready 2 Xtend™, XtendFlex™ and Intacta 2 Xtend™) 
runs until at least the end of the decade."
"In corn seed and traits, most farmers have already upgraded to next-generation branded corn traits."
SmartStax™ and SmartStax™ PRO have patent coverage running until at least 2028.
"For cotton seed and 
traits, Bollgard™ 3 XtendFlex™ has patent coverage until at least the mid-2030s."
"Partnerships and collaboration 
We partner with innovators from across the world to bring the disruptive new technologies that farmers 
need to market more quickly and efficiently, in collaborations that allow us to leverage our specialized 
expertise and resources."
"Biologicals 
In January, we announced a partnership with M2i Group to supply fruit and vegetable growers around the

2022."
"Fast Track Designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug 
candidates to treat serious medical conditions and address unmet medical needs."
"// In November, we decided not to initiate Phase III development of asundexian in patients with an acute 
myocardial infarction."
"// Also in November, we announced the decision to stop the Phase III study, OCEANIC-AF, investigating 
asundexian compared to apixaban (a direct oral anticoagulant) in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for 
stroke."
"This decision was based on the recommendation of the study’s Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) as part of ongoing surveillance which showed asundexian 50 mg was not as effective 
as the FXa comparator in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF)."
// The IDMC recommends continuing the OCEANIC-STROKE Phase III study as planned.
"Darolutamide 
// In March, we further expanded the global clinical development program for darolutamide in prostate

(VMS, also known as hot flashes) associated with menopause."
"Elinzanetant successfully met all four 
primary endpoints in both studies, demonstrating statistically significant reductions in the frequency and 
severity of moderate to severe VMS from baseline to week 4 and 12 compared to placebo."
"Both studies 
also achieved all three key secondary endpoints, showing a statistically significant reduction in the 
frequency of VMS from baseline to week 1, as well as statistically significant improvements in sleep 
disturbances and menopause-related quality of life compared to placebo."
"The safety profile observed in 
the OASIS 1 and 2 studies is overall consistent with previously published data on elinzanetant."

"For more than 10 years, Bayer’s LIFE values (Leadership, Integrity, Flexibility and Efficiency) have guided 
us in our activities."
These stand for our values and leadership principles.
"Attributes define each value’s 
practical meaning and behaviors, laying the foundation for how employees work at Bayer."
Employees at all Bayer sites around the world have the right to elect their own representatives.
"In 2023, 
the working conditions for around 52% (2022: 53%) of our employees worldwide were governed by 
collective or company agreements."
"Employee data 
On December 31, 2023, we employed 99,723 people (2022: 101,369) worldwide."
"In Germany, we had 
22,172 (2022: 22,569) employees, representing 22.2% of the total Group workforce (2022: 22.3%)."
"In 2023, the Bayer Group hired 9,247 new employees (accounting for 9.3% of our workforce)."
"On the 
reporting date, our employees had worked for the Bayer Group for an average of 11 years (2022: 11)."
"Our

"Restructuring measures 
We act with social responsibility when changes and restructuring measures are necessary."
"In all countries, 
we aim to minimize the impact on employees and find mutually agreeable solutions in cases where job 
reductions are necessary."
"This is also the case in Germany, where agreements are in place with employee 
representatives that fundamentally rule out dismissals for operational reasons in the intercompany 
personnel network of Bayer AG in the country until the end of 2026."
"With regard to the program to accelerate our transformation which we announced in 2020, we anticipate 
that all of the major restructuring measures will be implemented by the end of 2024."
"Flexible models with 
attractive conditions have been offered to employees of various age groups."
"Introduction of a new operating model 
We are currently working on making our organization even more closely aligned to our mission “Health for

of our present and former employees after their retirement."
"Retirement benefit plans are available to 79% 
(2022: 79%) of Bayer employees worldwide to complement national pension systems."
"This 
was mainly due to lower provisions for variable compensation under the Group-wide short-term incentive 
(STI) program."
Our compensation principles consist of providing fair compensation to all employees.
"Vocational and ongoing training 
To meet our need for skilled employees, we hire apprentices in Germany in more than 28 different

"To this end, we promote DE&I in all 
business areas and regions."
"We attach great importance to equal pay for men and women in comparable roles with similar levels of 
experience."
"The initial findings of a global review indicate minor gender-specific differences of less than 
2%."
"Further analysis will be conducted in 2024 to determine whether the identified differences in pay are 
due to factors other than gender, with targeted adjustment measures to follow."
Our Business Resource Groups (BRG) are part of our DE&I strategy.
"These are groups of volunteers, 
supported by the company, who work together to promote cultural diversity, equity and awareness for 
DE&I."
"Each global BRG is sponsored by a member of the Board of Management and an Executive Sponsor 
from the business."
"Their role is to act as mentors and provide guidance to ensure that critical DE&I 
objectives are achieved."
"In return, they receive insights from diverse perspectives and in this way can help 
shape how we engage with customers, community and our culture."
"In addition, we are integrating DE&I into core people processes such as talent acquisition and talent 
management."
"With 41,676 women employed at Bayer, the proportion of women in the workforce remained almost 
constant at 42.1% (2022: 42.0%12)."
We are specifically targeting a greater gender balance in management.
The proportion of women in management in 2023 was 43.6% (2022: 43.2%13).
"The proportion of women in 
top management, which encompasses the highest levels of management, including the Board of 
Management, increased again compared to previous years."
"At the end of 2023, it was made up of 31.8% 
women (2022: 27.9%14) and 68.2% men (2022: 72.1%15)."
Top management comprises 556 people in total.
"Our top management currently comprises 40 nationalities (2022: 37), with around 69% (2022: 67%) of its 
members working in their native country."
"Information on diversity in our Board of Management and our 
Supervisory Board can be found in our Corporate Governance Report."
People with disabilities are an integral part of our workforce.
"Based on voluntary statements by employees, 
we employ around 2,130 people with disabilities, 45% of whom are women and 55% men."
"That represents 
around 2.4% of our workforce in countries where disabilities are tracked."
"In 2021, we announced commitments for gender balance throughout the Bayer Group."
"We aspire to 
increase the proportion of women on the entire top management level year by year to 33% by 2025."
"In 
addition, we intend to increase the average proportion of women at all management levels to 50% by 
2025, and beyond."
"We then aim to increase the overall proportion of women in top management to 50% 
by 2030 as well."
"We have also defined additional commitments for further dimensions of diversity for 2025 and 2030, 
covering generations, nationality, career experience, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities, among others."
"Further aspects such as ethnic background are integrated into our commitments for our regions and 
country organizations."
"11 Bayer generally reports its KPIs for Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) in terms of headcount (HC)."
"As of 2023, key figures in the DE&I 
chapters of the annual and sustainability reports are therefore based on HC as well, in order to cover the individual characteristics of our 
employees independent of their working hours."
"To ensure comparability, we are presenting the 2022 figures in this chapter in HC as well."
"Key 
figures in other chapters may differ from those in this chapter as they are still based on full-time equivalents (FTE)."
"Not only economic but also ethical, social and ecological principles are therefore anchored in 
our Procurement Policy, which is binding for all employees worldwide."
"As a cross-divisional enabling function, Procurement leverages synergies by bundling know-how and 
procurement spend."
"In 2023, we had a total of around 86 thousand (2022: 91 thousand) suppliers."
"Our 
procurement spend was €22.7 billion (2022: €23.3 billion)."
"Our main direct procurement materials include active ingredients, raw materials, intermediates, finished 
products and seeds."
"Technical goods and services, research and development (R&D) resources, and 
marketing and IT services are important components of our indirect procurement portfolio."
Procurement operates according to advanced procurement and supplier management processes.
"Long-
term contracts and dedicated supplier management for strategically important goods and services are key 
elements here."
"They serve to minimize procurement-specific risks such as supply disruptions or significant 
price fluctuations, while also helping to safeguard our company’s competitiveness and ensure smooth 
production processes."
"To meet our climate protection targets, Procurement takes and supports measures to reduce greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions in our supply chain (Scope 3)."
"We advanced our activities from 2022 and initiated 
new ones in 2023."
"In 2023, we focused our efforts among other things on organizing training sessions on human rights in the 
supply chain for our procurement employees and suppliers, as well as on enhancing our procurement 
processes in order to comply with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCDDA)."
"Likewise in 2023, we introduced the Bayer Supplier Inclusion & Diversity Program, which is designed to 
ensure that there are consistent and equitable opportunities for small and diverse-owned suppliers 
throughout the global supply chain."
"Our global teams have continued to take extensive action to increase the resilience of our supply chain 
and mitigate the impact of the war in Ukraine."
"In 2023, we signed a long-term structured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase agreement with Cat 
Creek Energy (CCE), a renewable energy Independent Power Producer, to significantly increase the 
proportion of renewable energy used in our own production facilities."
"Sustainability in the supply chain 
Clear sustainability criteria and standards are in place for our supply chain on both a global and regional 
level."
"With the goal of improving sustainable practices in our supply chain, we operate a Group-wide four-
step management process that comprises the following elements: raising awareness, supplier nomination, 
supplier evaluation and supplier development."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
1.6 Sustainability Management 
58
Our sustainability requirements are established in the Bayer Supplier Code of Conduct, which is based on 
our Bayer Human Rights Policy and the principles of the UN Global Compact."
"This code serves as the 
basis for selecting and evaluating our suppliers and is integrated into electronic ordering systems 
throughout the Bayer Group."
"Furthermore, our standard supply contracts contain a clause that authorizes 
us to verify suppliers’ compliance with our sustainability requirements."
"The Bayer Supplier Code of 
Conduct Guidance was updated in 2023 and also contains GSCDDA-specific requirements."
We verify suppliers’ observance of the code requirements with the aid of online assessments or audits.
"We 
evaluate suppliers of relevant importance and suppliers with a high sustainability risk (in terms of both 
country and category risks)."
"We also consider in our processes existing evaluations performed within the 
scope of the two sustainability industry initiatives we are a part of."
"In total, our service provider EcoVadis 
assessed 1,118 (2022: 1,145) suppliers on our behalf in 2023."
"Also in 2023, we arranged for 134 (2022: 
113) of our suppliers to be audited by internal and/or external, independent auditors."
"If critical results are recorded as a result of a serious violation or several major shortcomings being 
identified during a supplier’s sustainability performance evaluation, specific improvement measures are 
then jointly defined."
"We monitor the implementation of these activities through re-assessments or follow-up 
audits."
"We reserve the right to terminate a supplier relationship if insufficient improvements are observed 
during re-evaluations."
"In 2023, we were not prompted to end any supplier relationship solely due to 
sustainability performance."
"1.6 Sustainability Management 
Sustainability is one of our strategic levers."
"That means that our business activities are systematically 
geared toward generating a positive impact for people and the planet."
"Effective sustainability management 
throughout the organization is ensured by clearly defined roles and responsibilities."
"The Chairman of the 
Board of Management (CEO), in his capacity as Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), and the entire Board of 
Management hold first-level responsibility for this strategy."
"An external Sustainability Council advises the 
Board of Management on all matters relating to sustainability and offers a critical, constructive perspective."
"In addition, we have a Human Rights Officer who oversees the management of risks relating to human 
rights and provides updates to the Board of Management."
"In 2022, we established a separate Supervisory 
Board committee for the areas of environmental protection, social affairs and corporate governance (ESG 
Committee)."
"The committee oversees and advises management on integrating sustainability into the 
business strategy and corporate governance, as well as on sustainability-related opportunities and risks, 
including potential consequences for the company’s reputation."
"In addition, the Public Affairs, Science and 
Sustainability; Health, Safety, Environment (PASS & HSE) enabling function supports the CSO and Board 
of Management in identifying risks and opportunities, developing strategies and defining sustainability 
management targets and guidelines."
It also provides governance for sustainability topics.
"Sustainability 
management is integrated into the existing management and governance structures and the core 
processes of the entire organization."
"Our commitment to the UN Global Compact and the Responsible Care™ initiative of the chemical industry 
and our involvement in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) underline our 
profile as a company that acts sustainably."
"The results of this reveal the latest developments along with sustainability-related 
opportunities and risks."
"Areas of activity with a very high level of relevance from an internal and external 
perspective are accounted for in our strategic lever of sustainability and reflected in our nonfinancial Group 
targets."
"As part of our stakeholder engagement process, which is underpinned by a dedicated guideline, we 
approach key social and political players and seek dialogue from the outset in strategic decision-making 
processes regarding new projects such as investment projects and launches of new products."
"Social engagement 
We are committed to supporting science, society and the common good."
"As part of these endeavors, we increasingly support social innovation 
and social enterprises."
"Responding to disasters by providing humanitarian aid also plays a crucial role in 
our social commitment."
"Through our disaster relief programs, we support communities affected by natural 
disasters and public health crises."
"In 2023, we provided around €52 million for social impact programs worldwide."
"This included products 
costing around €18 million that we donated to organizations in countries and communities in need."
"66% of 
our (cash and product) contributions went to low- and middle-income countries."
Our workforce is likewise personally involved in community volunteering.
"In 2018, for example, our 
employees founded the PROSI (Pro Social Initiatives) program, which brings together employees 
worldwide to engage in social volunteering."
"Building on the successes of PROSI, 2023 also saw the 
introduction of the Group’s “Corporate Volunteering” framework, which allows employees to spend at least 
one workday per year volunteering with social organizations."
"Germany implemented the concept in 
October – other countries will follow."
"Employees can use an online platform for volunteering to search for 
organizations and also propose projects themselves."
Existing volunteer programs (e.g.
"in the United 
States) will be continued or combined under the “Corporate Volunteering” scheme."
"Our charitable contributions are recorded and approved centrally, which 
provides a transparent overview of our contributions to supporting social causes around the world."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
1.7 Product Stewardship

Respect for human rights  
Respecting human rights is fundamental to the way we operate."
"We have documented our stance in a 
globally binding corporate policy entitled the Bayer Human Rights Policy."
"In 2023, we further developed 
our corresponding strategy and updated our human rights policy."
"The position of Human Rights Officer 
has been in place in our organization since October 2022."
"This function is tasked with performing risk 
management oversight and providing the Board of Management with updates on human rights topics."
"The 
Board of Management received such updates on three occasions in 2023."
Human rights due diligence is a continuous process that we constantly adapt and improve.
"To specifically 
ensure respect for human rights in the value chain, we employ a due diligence approach based on the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises."
"We take steps to ensure human rights are respected both within our own company and along 
our entire value chain."
"Corporate policies, processes, and management and monitoring systems are in 
place to govern the implementation of human rights standards."
"We offer special training programs to 
continuously enhance employees’ awareness of the importance of human rights in their day-to-day 
activities."
The “Respecting Human Rights at Bayer” basic training course is one such example.
"We also 
demand that our business partners, particularly our suppliers, fully respect human rights."
"As part of our risk management process, we conduct overarching and detailed risk analysis to examine the 
potentially adverse consequences our operating activities could have for human rights."
"See the 
Opportunity and Risk Report for the risk status identified for this area in 2023."
"We did not identify any 
potentially negative effects that were reportable under the CSR Directive Implementation Act."
"1.7 Product Stewardship 
For Bayer, product stewardship involves ensuring that our products satisfy the highest quality standards 
and are safe for people and the environment when used correctly."
"We respect the legal requirements and 
even go beyond them in various areas through voluntary commitments and internal standards."
"We have 
put in place suitable directives and management systems for the implementation of regulatory and 
voluntary product stewardship requirements that are steered by our Sustainability, Safety, Health & 
Environment (SSHE) enabling function and the quality functions of the divisions."
"Assessment and testing of active ingredients and products 
Our substances and finished products undergo extensive assessment and testing along the entire value 
chain."
"Based on these results, we develop measures to minimize health and environmental risks."
"Our 
divisions have quality management systems in place that are based on international industry-specific 
standards."
"By implementing a binding company-wide quality assurance system, we aim to guarantee high-
quality, safe and effective products and services that satisfy all internal and external requirements and 
meet customer expectations."
"This helps to avoid customer complaints, product recalls and other 
problems."
"For all chemical substances, we compile safety data sheets targeting professional users."
"End 
consumer products contain appropriate information in their packaging, with one example being package 
inserts for pharmaceuticals."
"We also conduct environmental risk assessments and implement risk 
management measures after a product has been registered."
"At Crop Science, we steer product stewardship through the strategy and sustainability function."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
1.7 Product Stewardship 
61
Every single R&D project must undergo a safety assessment based on our high internal product safety 
standards, which often go beyond local regulatory requirements."
"This assessment also takes into account 
local circumstances in relation to the combination of crops and countries, as well as application patterns."
"All of this is supplemented by our voluntary safety commitments: We have not marketed any crop 
protection products that are classified by the WHO as being highly toxic (WHO Tox Class I) since as early 
as 2012."
"In addition, since 2016 we have marketed only crop protection products with active ingredients 
that have a registration in at least one OECD country, and only new active ingredients for which an OECD 
data package has been compiled."
"Furthermore, our customers are provided with comprehensive and transparent information on our 
products."
"Through a variety of extensive programs, we train farmers, seed treatment professionals, dealers 
and other users in the effective and safe handling and use of our products."
"This covers aspects such as 
the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the proper handling of empty containers."
"During the production, packaging, storage and transport phase, we rely on a globally applicable health, 
safety and environmental protection management system."
We aim to strengthen all stakeholders’ confidence in our products through transparency.
"Details on our 
product stewardship and high internal product safety standards are publicly available on our website."
"In 
addition, we were one of the first companies in agriculture to make safety-relevant data on crop protection 
products and genetically modified seed publicly accessible."
"Summaries of scientific studies for 30 of our 
active ingredients submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the context of registration 
procedures are available on our website."
"These reports include information on toxicological and 
ecotoxicological studies and investigations into the biodegradability of crop protection products."
"Also 
available are summaries of scientific studies on 16 traits of our genetically modified crops that were 
evaluated by US regulatory authorities."
"Complete study reports on our registration studies for the approval 
of our crop protection products and genetically modified crops are available on specific request."
"In the Pharmaceuticals Division, we assess the medical benefit-risk profile of our pharmaceutical and 
medicinal products throughout their entire product life cycle."
"The efficacy, safety and tolerability of 
pharmaceuticals are already investigated in preclinical and Phase I to III clinical development studies."
"These results and the benefit-risk assessment are submitted to the relevant authorities during the 
pharmaceutical registration process."
"We continue to compile safety-relevant information in a dedicated 
database following market launch of the product."
Post-Authorization Safety Studies (PASS) are also conducted after approval.
"The results are entered into 
the PASS registry in compliance with EU pharmacovigilance legislation."
"After proving the efficacy and safety of a nonprescription (OTC) medicinal product, Consumer Health 
receives marketing authorization from the relevant authorities."
"We continuously ensure the favorable 
benefit-risk profile of these products by conducting post-marketing surveillance and generating scientific 
evidence throughout the entire product life cycle."
"In addition to these OTC products, Consumer Health 
also provides consumers access to other self-care solutions, cosmetics, nutritional supplements and 
medical devices."
"We conduct ongoing monitoring and measurements to ensure safety, efficacy and 
compliance with regulatory requirements around the world."
"We also monitor ingredients across all product 
categories and act on any concerns that are identified to provide the best-quality products for our patients 
and consumers."
"Animal welfare in active ingredient testing 
Animal studies are legally required and essential from a scientific viewpoint for assessing the safety and 
efficacy of our products."
"Such studies must comply not only with legal requirements but also with Bayer’s 
principles on animal welfare and animal studies."
"The latter also apply both to the research institutes we 
commission and to our suppliers, whose compliance with our animal welfare requirements we monitor 
regularly."
"We aim to minimize the use of study animals and to employ alternative methods whenever 
possible."
"At the same time, the very purpose of agriculture is to provide a safe and secure food 
supply for humans, which can lead to a loss or reduction of biodiversity, for example through land-use 
change, degradation or fragmentation of habitats."
"To foster production which minimizes the impact on the 
environment, we are investigating and developing cultivation systems that help achieve a better balance 
between productivity and the conservation of soil health and habitats."
"In many of our field trials, we 
evaluate how our solutions – in combination with practices such as no till, cover crops or wider crop 
rotation – help to improve soil health without compromising farmers’ profitability."
"In addition, we have 
various cooperation projects involving the Bayer ForwardFarms and nature conservation experts where we 
research how a better balance could be achieved in various countries and regions."
"We therefore conduct comprehensive field trials 
under agronomic conditions in various crops around the globe with the objective of deriving 
recommendations regarding the best positioning of our products within an IPM system to protect 
pollinators and beneficials."
"We promote the responsible use of natural resources, both complying with international and national 
legislation as well as respecting biodiversity."
"Our principles on biodiversity are set forth in a corporate 
policy and a separate position paper on this issue."
"In this, we express our commitment to the objectives of 
the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, which includes the fair and equitable sharing of the 
benefits arising from the use of genetic resources."
"We also have a supplementary corporate policy in place 
that is designed to ensure compliance with international and national legislation on access to genetic 
resources and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources."
"Through monetary and nonmonetary contributions to the establishment of new gene banks that serve to 
preserve the genetic diversity of crops, we help to facilitate the conservation and sustainable use of plant 
genetic resources."
"In addition, we participate in a variety of projects with public partners to enable 
improved local food crops and promote the build-up of capacities to breed better crops, while also 
supporting other global efforts to preserve biodiversity."
"Furthermore, we continually deploy plant breeding 
innovations that help improve the genetic diversity of crops, food security and ecological sustainability."
"Biotechnology 
We apply biotechnological methods in biopharmaceutical production (e.g., Kogenate™, Kovaltry™, Jivi™) 
and the development of innovative biopharmaceuticals, and cell and gene therapies."
"In addition, we apply 
biotech-based methods to seeds (e.g., SmartStax™ PRO with RNAi Technology corn, Intacta 2 Xtend™ 
soybeans, and Bollgard™ 3 with XtendFlex™ cotton)."
"In plant breeding, we use a variety of methods, 
including conventional breeding approaches and genetic engineering."
"Genetically modified crops can help 
increase the sustainability of food production because they enable farmers to produce more food with less 
impact on natural resources."
"For us, the safety of people and the environment is always the top priority in the use of biotechnology."
"In 
addition to meeting legal and regulatory requirements, we have specified the responsible use of genetic 
engineering and strict, globally applicable safety measures for handling biological substances in 
corresponding corporate policies."
"The development and commercialization of genetically improved seeds are also subject to stringent laws 
and regulations."
"In addition, we have established internal processes to ensure the responsible use of 
biotechnologically manufactured products throughout their life cycle."
"Furthermore, our Crop Science 
Division maintained its membership in the Excellence Through Stewardship organization in 2023."
We focus on all stages of the product cycle – from manufacturing to safe use and disposal.
"At our production sites around the world, regulatory authorities and external assessors monitor compliance 
with wastewater thresholds."
"Internal experts also perform corresponding audits of the production sites at 
regular intervals."
"We take appropriate action in our production facilities to avoid or reduce emissions from 
production, such as the release of active ingredients into the environment."
"Alongside the regulatory 
standards, such action also comes in the form of our own, more far-reaching environmental standards, for 
instance as outlined in our corporate policies."
"We are also working to develop further effective risk 
minimization measures in various research projects."
"With regard to the application of crop protection products, the potential environmental impact is 
investigated in ecotoxicological studies during development and prior to the official product approval 
process."
"The responsible authorities receive an extensive environmental risk assessment and can specify 
risk minimization measures as appropriate."
"Environmental risk assessments are also conducted in Europe and the United States for the official 
approval of human pharmaceuticals."
"1.8 Environmental Protection and Safety 
We are working on ways to further reduce the environmental impact of our business activities and develop 
solutions that relieve the burden on the environment."
"Responsibility for this lies with the Sustainability, 
Safety, Health & Environment (SSHE) enabling function, which defines framework conditions in the form of 
corporate policies and other measures."
"We use management systems to control operational 
implementation in the divisions."
"Energy consumption 
Bayer’s total energy consumption decreased by 1.3% year on year to 35.0 petajoules in 2023 (2022: 
35.5 petajoules)."
"This includes both primary energy consumption, which mainly relates to fossil fuels, and 
secondary energy consumption."
"The decline was attributable to lower production volumes at our sites in 
Soda Springs, United States, and Antwerp, Belgium."
"Energy efficiency reported as the ratio of energy consumed to external sales came in at 
204 kWh/€ thousand in 2023, compared with 194 kWh/€ thousand in 2022."
"Greenhouse gas emissions  
We consider climate protection and the related reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to be a top priority."
"We have therefore set ourselves ambitious targets in this area, and these are explained in more detail in 
Chapter 1.2.1 Strategy and Targets."
"In line with the GHG Protocol, we also report the direct emissions that arise through the generation of energy that we sell to other companies 
as a site service."
"Consequently, the figures for direct emissions of the Bayer Group are higher than the actual emissions resulting from Bayer’s 
business activities alone."
"In 2023, 97.2% of direct greenhouse gas emissions were carbon dioxide emissions."
"Other greenhouse gases such as 
nitrous oxide, partially fluorinated hydrocarbons and methane made a negligible contribution to direct greenhouse gas emissions."
"2 Indirect emissions result from the procurement of electricity, steam and cooling energy (Scope 2)."
3 Scope 3 emissions were subjected to a limited assurance review.
7 Values for 2022 were updated due to new findings in category 3.1.
"In 2023, we cut Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 0.03 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents, 
or 0.9%."
"The main reasons for this reduction are the increased share of electricity purchased from 
renewable sources (Scope 2)."
"In the Scope 3 Science Based Targets (SBT) categories that are relevant for our company, our emissions 
fell by 0.54 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents, representing a decrease of 6.0% compared with 2022."
"The reduction in Scope 3 emissions in the SBT-relevant Scope 3 categories was largely attributable to 
lower purchasing volumes (Scope 3.1) and the associated logistics operations (Scope 3.4)."
"Emissions in 
the non-SBT-relevant categories (Scope 3.5, 3.7 and 3.12) decreased slightly year on year, by 
4,500 metric tons (–0.6%)."
"To achieve carbon neutrality at our own sites, we financed reforestation and forest conservation projects in 
countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Cambodia, Colombia and Uruguay."
"The climate protection certificates 
generated as a result enabled us to offset greenhouse gas emissions amounting to 0.6 million metric tons 
of CO2 equivalents."
"Water 
We use water resources as sparingly as possible and are endeavoring to further reduce emissions into 
water."
"All relevant sites in areas identified as being threatened by water scarcity through 2030 have a 
water management system in place."
"Total water use in 2023 remained level year on year at 53 million cubic meters (2022: 53 million cubic 
meters)."
"32.4% of all water used by Bayer is cooling water that is only heated in the process and does not 
come into contact with products."
"It can be returned to the water cycle, in line with the relevant official 
permits."
"At our production facilities, we endeavor to use water several times and to recycle it."
"All wastewater is 
subject to thorough checks before it is discharged into the various disposal channels."
"All our industrial and 
mixed wastewater is purified in wastewater treatment plants (Bayer or third-party facilities) where 
necessary, categorized as environmentally safe according to official provisions and returned to the natural 
water cycle."
"The total quantity of industrial and mixed wastewater came in at 25 million cubic meters in 
2023 and was thus 2.8% higher than the previous year (2022: 24 million cubic meters)."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

Waste and recycling 
We aim to minimize material consumption and disposal volumes through systematic waste management."
"In accordance with Bayer’s corporate policies, all production sites are required to prevent, reduce and 
recycle waste, and to dispose of it safely and in line with good environmental practices."
"The total quantity of waste generated rose to 1,164,000 metric tons in 2023 (2022: 1,038,000 metric 
tons), mainly due to increased production at the Dormagen site in Germany and the completion of 
construction work at the Leverkusen site in Germany."
"The volume of hazardous waste rose by 14.4% to 316,000 metric tons (2022: 276,000 metric tons) due to 
the increase in production at the Dormagen site."
"The volume of hazardous waste from production in this 
figure, including hazardous waste from wastewater treatment plants, also increased against the prior year, 
rising from 273,000 metric tons to 312,000 metric tons."
"Process and plant safety 
We aim to design and operate our processes and production facilities in such a way that they do not pose 
any inappropriate risks to employees, the environment or neighboring communities."
"We are working to 
further develop our safety culture and the expertise of our employees."
"Principles of process and plant 
safety are laid out in our globally applicable corporate policies."
"Compliance with internal and external 
safety regulations is verified in internal audits."
"To prevent the release of substances and energy, the causes of process safety incidents (PSIs) are 
analyzed and relevant findings are communicated throughout the Bayer Group."
"For this purpose, we use a 
globally standardized key performance indicator (KPI) – the Process Safety Incident Rate (PSI-R) – that is 
integrated into the Group-wide reporting system."
"The PSI-R indicates the number of PSI incidents per 
200,000 hours worked."
"In 2023, the PSI-R was 0.11 (2022: 0.11)."
"Transportation safety 
Transportation and warehouse safety is part of HSE management and is implemented by networks of 
supply chain experts."
"In addition to complying with legal regulations, we have implemented supplementary 
standards and requirements that are defined in corporate policies."
"This ensures that our materials are 
handled and transported in accordance with their respective potential hazards and applicable regulations."
"There were 18 transport incidents in 2023 (2022: 17), primarily involving road transport accidents."
"We 
define transport incidents as accidents that cause personal injury or significant damage to property, 
environmental impact resulting from the release of substances, or leakage of hazardous goods."
"Safe and health-promoting working conditions 
Protecting the health of our workforce and the employees of contractual partners who work on our factory 
premises is our top priority."
We are now also extending these ambitions to our supply chains.
"We are 
committed to systematic prevention measures for healthy working conditions and safety in everyday work, 
in production facilities and during work-related travel and transportation."
"This involves preventing 
occupational accidents and occupational illnesses, assessing potential hazards, ensuring comprehensive 
risk management and creating a healthy working environment."
"The “Recordable Incident Rate” (RIR) was 0.42 accidents per 200,000 working hours in 2023 (2022: 0.37)."
This corresponds to 457 occupational accidents worldwide.
"Despite all the safety measures, serious and extremely serious accidents cannot be completely ruled out."
"In 2023, we reported seven fatal accidents (all traffic accidents) at work involving a Bayer employee."
"We 
will not let up in our efforts to further reduce risks and risky behavior."
"Moreover, our Purchasing and R&D teams work to reduce the severity of any accidents and to ensure 
accountability to avoid incident recurrences."
"We focus on the prevention of incidents and the effectiveness 
of corrective and preventive measures."
"The focus was also on reporting on identified risks, analyzing the 
causes of potentially serious incidents, evaluating the effectiveness of corrective measures and passing on 
the knowledge gained."

Furthermore, we published global road safety standards and implementation guidance in 2023, and 
started collecting traffic accident data to track progress."
"In order to protect the mental health of our employees and their families, we remain committed to taking 
active steps to counteract the development of mental illnesses through a variety of target group-specific 
information and programs."
"One example is the central “House of Health” intranet platform, which lists a 
large variety of information and training offerings."
"In addition, we provided “Employee Assistance Program” 
offers for 97% of employees and their families worldwide in 2023."
"Run by external providers, they offer 
support services and information from mental health specialists."
"EU taxonomy 
Our sustainability targets (Chapter 1.2.1/1) help us to realize our mission of “Health for all, Hunger for 
none.” In addition, we also report on other nonfinancial aspects."
"Company activities are assessed for taxonomy eligibility based on the economic activities described in 
Annexes I and II to the Delegated Act of June 4, 2021, and Annexes I through IV to the Delegated Act of 
June 27, 2023."
"To avoid double-counting, results are documented for example at product master data 
level."
"Taxonomy alignment is evaluated based on the technical screening criteria for each economic 
activity, which are also defined in the aforementioned Annexes."
"We use our own interpretation when applying the EU taxonomy as definitions are not yet available and the 
wording used is unclear."
"The FAQ documents published by the European Commission as of December 31, 
2023, were duly taken into account."
"Reporting on turnover 
The definition of turnover according to EU taxonomy corresponds with the sales reported in the 
consolidated financial statements (see Note [6])."
Sales of the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health divisions can be attributed to this economic activity.
The determination of taxonomy-eligible sales takes place at product level.
"According to our interpretation, 
sales generated from medicinal products that are merely resold, repackaged or mixed are not taxonomy-
eligible."
"Taxonomy-eligible sales amounted to €18,299 million in 2023 (2022: €0 million), and taxonomy-non-
eligible sales amounted to €29,338 million (2022: €50,739 million)."
"The proportion of taxonomy-eligible 
sales was thus 38.4% (2022: 0%)."
"Due to the simplified reporting requirements for 2023 with respect to 
the four environmental objectives to be applied for the first time, there are no taxonomy-aligned sales to 
disclose."
"Also included were investments in tangible and intangible 
assets due to business combinations."
"For further details, see Notes [14] and [15]."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

The taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure is determined by linking the capital expenditure undertaken with 
the taxonomy-eligible products (Category a)."
"Capital expenditure that cannot be clearly assigned is taken 
into consideration on the basis of allocation keys."
"Capital expenditures for the purchase of products from 
taxonomy-eligible economic activities or individual measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
(Category c) are also included in this figure."
"As explained in the previous section, no taxonomy alignment review was undertaken in 2023 for the 
economic activity “manufacture of medicinal products.” Furthermore, at present there is no process for 
reliably verifying the acquisition of taxonomy-aligned products in Category c."
"The procedure for the 
remaining capital expenditure in connection with the environmental objective climate change mitigation is 
described below."
"We examine whether or not an economic activity contributes substantially to climate change mitigation 
based on the individual asset."
"To rule out significant harm being caused to other environmental objectives, we assess the respective 
criteria at various levels."
"The criteria for climate change adaptation are assessed at site level, while the in 
some cases highly granular requirements for the other environmental objectives are examined at the 
individual asset level."
"Compliance with the minimum safeguards is examined at Group level, taking into account existing 
corporate policies and risk management processes with respect to human rights, compliance, 
anticorruption and other aspects."
We incurred taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) of €543 million in 2023 (2022: €390 million).
"Taxonomy-non-eligible capital expenditure amounted to €2,798 million (2022: €3,250 million)."
"The 
proportion of taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure therefore came to 16.3% (2022: 10.7%)."
"We were once 
again unable to identify any taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (2022: €0 million)."
"Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure amounted to €161 million (2022: €0 million), and taxonomy-non-
eligible operating expenditure amounted to €7,043 million (2022: €7,460 million)."
"The proportion of 
taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure therefore came to 2.2% (2022: 0%)."
"Due to the simplified 
reporting requirements for 2023 with respect to the four environmental objectives to be applied for the first 
time, there is no taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure to disclose."
"Report on Economic Position

2.1.1 Economic Position and Target Attainment 
2023 was a challenging year for our company."
"Sales edged back 1.2% on a currency- and portfolio-
adjusted basis (Fx & portfolio adj.), while EBITDA before special items fell by a considerable 13.4%."
"The 
EBITDA margin before special items came in at 24.6%, down 2.0 percentage points against the previous 
year."
"This was largely due to the decline in business at Crop Science, which, in turn, was mainly 
attributable to significantly lower prices for our glyphosate-based products."
"Sales in that division fell 
accordingly, moving back by 3.7% (Fx & portfolio adj.), and EBITDA before special items declined by 
26.6%."
Sales at Pharmaceuticals were at the prior-year level (Fx & portfolio adj.
"–0.4% ), while EBITDA 
before special items fell by 11.6%."
"Consumer Health registered encouraging sales growth of 6.3% (Fx & 
portfolio adj.) and a 3.2% increase in EBITDA before special items."
"Our business was impacted by 
substantial currency headwinds overall."
"Group earnings per share (total) came in at minus €2.99 in 2023, 
and were mainly weighed down by impairment losses."
"Core earnings per share dropped by a considerable 
19.5% to €6.39."
"In the Group outlook published in March, we anticipated sales of €50 to €51 billion, corresponding to an 
increase of 2% to 3% on a currency- and portfolio-adjusted basis."
"EBITDA before special items was 
forecast to come in at €12.5 to €13 billion, and earnings per share before special items at €7.20 to €7.40."
Free cash flow was projected to be around €3.0 billion.
The forecast was revised in August due to the weaker-than-expected business performance.
"As part of 
this updated guidance, we anticipated sales of €46.8 to €47.8 billion, corresponding to a currency- and 
portfolio-adjusted decline of 2% to 3%."
"EBITDA before special items was predicted to come in at €11.3 to 
€11.8 billion, and core earnings per share at €6.20 to €6.40."
"Free cash flow was expected to be 
approximately €0 billion."

the EU and China for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer 
(mHSPC) in 2023."
"Based on the recommendation of the study’s Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), we decided 
to stop OCEANIC-AF, a Phase III study investigating our development candidate asundexian."

Functional costs 
The special effects accounted for in EBIT and EBITDA before special items were attributable to the 
functional costs as shown in the following table."
"After adjusting for special items and 
currency effects, the cost of goods sold increased by 10.1%."
"This was primarily due to higher raw material 
costs and inflation-related cost increases within the Crop Science Division."
"Selling expenses decreased by 11.4% to €12,482 million and accounted for 26.2% (2022: 27.8%) of sales."
"After adjusting for special items and currency effects, selling expenses were down by 3.7%."
"This was 
mainly driven by Pharmaceuticals, where the decline was partly due to lower investment in marketing 
activities for our more mature product portfolio."
"Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased by 18.3% to €5,371 million, and the ratio of R&D 
expenses to sales came in at 11.3% (2022: 13.0%)."
"This decrease resulted from lower special charges in 
the Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals divisions and from currency effects."
"After adjusting for special 
items and currency effects, R&D expenses fell by 3.9%."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

General administration expenses fell by 13.6% to €2,453 million."
"The ratio of general administration 
expenses to total sales fell to 5.1% (2022: 5.6%)."
"Adjusted for special items and currency effects, general 
administration expenses were 9.3% lower, mainly due to significantly lower expense for the Group-wide 
incentive programs."
"The balance of other operating expenses and other operating income came in at minus €6,970 million, 
representing a substantial deterioration against the prior year (2022: minus €362 million) that was 
predominantly due to impairment losses on goodwill."
"Overall, all functional costs were diminished by the lower expense for the Group-wide incentive programs."
"Financial result and income before income taxes 
After a financial result of minus €2,233 million (2022: minus €2,342 million), income before income taxes 
amounted to minus €1,621 million (2022: €4,670 million)."
"The improvement in the financial result was 
largely due to a net positive change in the fair value of financial investments and higher interest income 
from investments in particular."
"These effects were partly offset by higher interest expense and negative 
currency effects related to the Argentinian peso."
"Income taxes  
Income tax expense of €1,321 million was recorded in 2023 (2022: €504 million)."
"The year-on-year 
increase in tax expense was mainly due to a decline in deferred tax income arising from the recognition of 
temporary differences, tax loss and interest carryforwards, and tax credits."
"The decline in taxes 
paid/accrued reflected the company’s general business performance."
"Net income  
After income tax expense and income attributable to noncontrolling interest, there was a net loss of 
€2,941 million in 2023 (2022: net income of €4,150 million)."
"2.2.2 Business Development by Division 
Crop Science 
Market 
The global seed and crop protection market recorded a decline (approximately –4%) in 2023, which was 
largely due to significantly lower glyphosate prices but partially offset by growth in the fungicides, corn and 
cereals segments."

result of decreased commodity prices had a positive impact."
"The impairment loss reversal for Corn Seed &

contrast, earnings were diminished by an increase in costs, particularly in the cost of goods sold, which

There was a positive currency effect of €24 million (Q4 2022: €64 million).
The EBITDA margin before special items increased by 4.3 percentage points to 19.0%.
"EBIT increased to €975 million in the fourth quarter (Q4 2022: €127 million) after net special gains of 
€579 million (Q4 2022: net special charges of €126 million) that related to net impairment loss reversals on 
intangible assets."
"We recorded impairment losses on goodwill (€633 million) that were mainly attributable 
to a deterioration in business prospects and an inflation-driven increase in costs."
"By contrast, we 
recognized impairment loss reversals in the cash-generating units Corn Seed & Traits (€1,130 million) and 
Soybean Seed & Traits (€65 million) that were largely due to a decline in the weighted average cost of 
capital overall."

"Compared with the previous year, ROCE fell at Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals but improved at 
Consumer Health."
"In the Crop Science Division, the decline in operating profit coupled with special charges from impairment 
losses resulted in negative EBIT and ROCE."
"The average capital employed also decreased due to the 
impairment losses; this effect was partly offset by a decrease in provisions for litigations due primarily to 
payments to resolve legal proceedings, as well as by the increase in the capital base in 2022."
"At Pharmaceuticals, lower operating profit and higher special charges due to the absence of prior-year 
divestment gains resulted in a decline in EBIT, thus yielding lower ROCE."
"ROCE was also diminished by 
the increase in the average capital employed that was partly due to milestone payments in connection with 
business combinations made in previous years and the decline in the respective liabilities."
"Consumer Health registered higher EBIT, driven by increased operating profit and special gains from 
impairment loss reversals, and a stable capital base, and therefore saw its ROCE improve."

Financial management of the Bayer Group 
The financial management of the Bayer Group is conducted centrally."
"Capital is a global resource, 
generally procured centrally and distributed within the Bayer Group."
"The foremost objectives of our 
financial management are to help bring about a sustained increase in corporate value and to ensure the 
Group’s liquidity and creditworthiness."
"This involves optimizing the capital structure and effectively 
managing risks."
"The management of currency, interest-rate, commodity-price and default risks helps to 
reduce the volatility of our earnings."
"We have the ambition to reduce our financial debt 
considerably, to increase profit and cash flow and to improve our current investment grade ratings toward 
the “A” category."
"As a matter of principle, we pursue a prudent debt management strategy to ensure flexibility, drawing on a 
balanced financing portfolio."
"This is fundamentally based on bonds in various currencies, syndicated credit 
facilities, bilateral loan agreements and a global commercial paper program."
"We use financial derivatives to hedge against risks arising from business operations or financial 
transactions but do not employ contracts in the absence of an underlying transaction."
"It is our policy to 
diminish default risks by selecting trading partners with a high credit standing."
"We closely monitor the 
execution of all transactions, which are conducted in accordance with Group-wide policies."
"Payments to resolve 
proceedings in the litigations surrounding dicamba, Essure™ and particularly PCBs and glyphosate led to 
a net outflow of €2,089 million (2022: €1,165 million)."
"That total comprised payments resulting from 
settlement agreements as well as court judgments."
"Net operating cash flow also included payments of 
€411 million (2022: €0 million) from banks from the transfer of trade receivables that were not yet due or 
settled by customers as of December 31, 2023."
"Net cash used in investing activities 
Net cash used in investing activities amounted to €3,517 million in 2023 (2022: €2,381 million)."
"Cash 
outflows for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets decreased to €2,751 million (2022: 
€2,949 million), with the decline mainly attributable to the Crop Science Division."
"Cash inflows from the 
sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets amounted to €215 million (2022: €1,130 million)."
"These inflows partly resulted from the sale of rights to our dermatological products A+D™, Solarcaine™, 
Cortate™ and Complex 15™ (€62 million) and our hormone replacement products Progynova™ and 
Cyclo-Progynova™ (€68 million)."
"Outflows for noncurrent financial assets amounted to €332 million (2022: 
€1,182 million)."
"Of the high prior-year figure, €557 million was attributable to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG 
and Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG drawing on their effective initial funds."
"Outflows for acquisitions, less 
acquired cash, amounted to €662 million (2022: €89 million) and largely related to milestone payments in 
connection with the acquisition of US-based Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc."
"(AskBio) and Vividion 
Therapeutics, Inc., and the UK company Blackford Analysis Ltd."
"The net cash outflow for current financial

"The largest 
capital expenditure projects in 2023 included investments in the sourcing of an important raw material 
used in the production of glyphosate in the United States (around €156 million)."
"Crop Science also 
invested in the expansion of research and development facilities at its site in Monheim, Germany (around 
€16 million), as well as in the expansion of fungicide production in Germany (around €25 million)."
"Furthermore, an additional sum of around €23 million was invested in the expansion of corn seed 
production capacities in Ukraine (Pochuyki) in 2023."
"Alongside these projects, the development of digital 
solutions for our customers was a key investment in 2023 and will remain so in the coming years."
"Capital expenditure for intangible assets included 
milestone payments to Hua Medicine (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., China (around €149 million)."

Financial liabilities increased by €3.3 billion overall.
"// Supply chain financing programs (also known as reverse factoring) are used in the Bayer Group that 
enable suppliers to choose to have individual invoices paid prior to their due date."
"As part of such 
programs, the supplier concludes a financing agreement with a bank or platform operator without 
Bayer’s involvement and, upon request, is paid the invoice amount by the bank in advance less an 
interest component."
"Bayer generally pays the invoice amount to the bank when due; the payment 
deadlines lie within the usual scope for the industry."
"Bayer has assessed these programs based on 
various criteria and concluded that the associated liabilities retain the character of trade accounts 
payable."
"The related payments to the bank are therefore classified as a cash outflow from operating 
activities."
"2.3 Alternative Performance Measures Used 
by the Bayer Group 
The Combined Management Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group are 
prepared according to the applicable financial reporting standards."
"In addition to the disclosures and 
metrics these require, Bayer publishes alternative performance measures (APMs) that are not defined or 
specified in these standards and for which there are no generally accepted reporting formats."
"Bayer 
calculates APMs to enable a comparison of performance indicators over time and against those of other 
companies in its industry sectors."
"These APMs are calculated by making certain adjustments to items in 
the statement of financial position or the income statement prepared according to the applicable financial 
reporting standards."
"Such adjustments may result from differences in calculation or measurement 
methods, nonuniform business activities or special factors affecting the information value of these items."
"The APMs determined in this way apply to all periods and are used both internally for business 
management purposes and externally by analysts, investors and rating agencies to assess the company’s 
performance."
"It shows the percentage by which sales varied from 
the previous year."
"The currency-adjusted or currency- and portfolio-adjusted change in sales shows the percentage change 
in sales excluding the impact of exchange rate effects and, in the latter case, disregarding material 
acquisitions and divestments as well."
"Exchange rate effects are generally calculated on the basis of the 
functional currency valid in the respective country."
"An exception existed in Argentina, primarily in our crop 
protection business, where the currency effect was calculated on the basis of the US dollar instead of the 
functional currency."
"This performance indicator neutralizes the effects of the financial result along with 
distortions of operational performance that result from divergent depreciation and amortization methods 
and the exercise of measurement discretion."
"EBITDA is EBIT plus the amortization of intangible assets and 
the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, plus impairment losses and minus impairment loss 
reversals, recognized in profit or loss during the reporting period."
"EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) serves to present a company’s performance while eliminating the 
effects of differences between local taxation systems and different financing activities."
"EBITDA before special items and EBIT before special items show the development of the operational 
business irrespective of the effects of special items, i.e., special effects for the Bayer Group with regard to 
their nature and magnitude."
"These may include acquisition costs, divestments, litigations, restructuring, 
integration costs, impairment losses and impairment loss reversals."
"In the calculation of EBIT before 
special items and EBITDA before special items, special charges are added and special gains subtracted."
"Clean depreciation and amortization exclude the effect of (corresponding) special items on the 
depreciation and amortization figures."
"The EBITDA margin before special items is a relative indicator used by Bayer for internal and external 
comparisons of operational earnings performance."
"It is the ratio of EBITDA before special items to net 
sales."
"The APM core earnings per share (core EPS) from continuing operations is based on the concept of 
earnings per share (EPS) as defined in IAS 33."
"This enables a comparison 
of performance over time."
Core EBIT is reconciled to core net income from continuing operations.
"This is 
calculated by adding the core financial result to core EBIT."
"Special items in the financial result include 
nonrecurring financial expenses or income that are not part of our normal financing activities."
"Income taxes – net of special items – are then deducted from this figure to give 
core net income."
"Special items relating to income taxes include material effects from tax reforms, among 
other things."
Core EPS is then calculated by dividing core net income by the weighted average number of shares.
"As core EPS is calculated for each interim reporting period, core EPS for the fiscal year or for each interim 
reporting period up to the respective closing date may deviate from the cumulated core EPS for the 
individual interim reporting periods."
"Net financial debt is an important financial management indicator for the Bayer Group and is used both 
internally and externally in assessing its liquidity, capital structure and financial flexibility."
"The return on capital employed (ROCE) measures the capital return over a specified period and is 
employed as a strategic indicator to evaluate value creation."
"It is the ratio of net operating profit after 
taxes (NOPAT) to the average capital employed in a fiscal year."
"NOPAT is calculated by subtracting 
income taxes from EBIT."
"Income taxes are calculated by multiplying EBIT by a uniform tax rate that is 
based on a historical average of tax rates."
"The capital employed by Bayer is the total carrying amount of operational noncurrent and current assets, 
minus liabilities that are largely non-interest-bearing in character and/or would distort the capital base."
"An 
average value, calculated from the values at the end of the prior year and of the reporting year, is used to 
depict the change in capital employed during the reporting year."
"The ROCE is compared to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which is the return expected by 
the providers of equity and debt."
"If the ROCE exceeds the WACC, return expectations have been 
exceeded, indicating that value has been created."
"The WACC is based on an after-tax approach and calculated at the start of the year as the weighted 
average of the equity and debt cost factors."
"The cost of equity is determined using the capital asset 
pricing model (CAPM), while the debt-capital cost factor is calculated based on the average returns of ten-
year Eurobonds issued by industrial companies."
"Further information on the segment-specific capital cost 
factors used in impairment testing is provided in Note [4] to B Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Free cash flow (FCF) is an alternative performance measure that is based on the cash flow from operating 
activities under IAS 7."
"FCF illustrates the cash flows available for paying dividends and reducing debt as 
well as for investing in innovation and acquisitions."
"The forward-looking key performance indicators published in the forecast for key financial data are based 
on data that is determined in the course of our planning process."
"The key financial data in the forecast is 
determined in accordance with the applied accounting policies and with the calculation models for 
alternative performance measures described in this chapter."

"Ongoing crises and wars will likely continue to weigh on the global economy, as will more restrictive 
monetary and fiscal policies."
"We expect the global seed and crop protection market to recover in 2024, with moderate growth of 
approximately 2%18 (2022: approximately –4%)."
"Prices for agrochemical products, including glyphosate, 
are expected to stabilize and gradually return to normal levels."
"The continued organic growth of the crop 
protection segments, especially insecticides, is driving the growth of the overall crop protection market."
"The positive development anticipated in the seeds and traits segment will likely be driven by acreage 
increases in corn and soybeans, particularly in Latin America, with further growth coming from vegetable 
seeds and cereals."
"The potential impacts of current geopolitical events and disruptions will require further 
analysis."
We expect the pharmaceuticals market to expand by approximately 7%19 in 2024 (2023: +9%).
"Innovative 
products will continue to drive growth and more than offset losses due to the expiration of patents."
"However, uncertainty remains over how heavily the pharmaceuticals market will be impacted by external 
factors such as the war in Ukraine, inflationary pressure and health system reforms."
"At around 5%20, we anticipate that growth of the consumer health market in 2024 will roughly be on a par 
with the 2023 level (+5%) as economic and pricing conditions stabilize and upper respiratory conditions 
continue to resume historical patterns."
"3.1.2 Corporate Outlook  
The following forecast is based on the current business development and our internal planning."
"To 
enhance the comparability of operational performance, we are also presenting this guidance on a 
currency-adjusted basis, applying the average monthly exchange rates from 2023."
"Overall, it should be noted that a 1% appreciation (depreciation) of the euro against all other currencies 
would decrease (increase) sales by some €400 million on an annual basis."

Opportunity and risk management is therefore an integral part of corporate management at Bayer.
"We regard opportunities as positive deviations, and risks as negative deviations, from projected or target 
values for potential future developments."
"We augment our risk definition process by also taking into 
account any potential adverse effects that our business operations could have on people and/or the 
environment."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 
102
Opportunity management system 
We identify opportunities as part of the annual planning cycle, during which we analyze internal and 
external factors that may affect our business."
"These may be factors of a social, economic or environmental 
nature, for example."
Our planning process starts with a comprehensive analysis of the markets.
"We build 
on this by analyzing the respective market environments to identify opportunities."
"These analyses are 
based on different time periods since trends or developments may impact our business over the short, 
medium or long term."
"In addition, we identify and leverage opportunities as part of our regular business 
operations and through our daily observation of internal processes and markets."
"Depending on 
developments, factors affecting our business, such as market risks, may result in either risks or 
opportunities."
"Risk management system 
We have implemented a holistic and integrated risk management system designed to ensure the continued 
existence and future target attainment of the Group through the early identification, assessment and 
treatment of risks."
"Our risk management system is aligned to internationally recognized standards and principles such as the 
ISO 31000 risk management standard of the International Organization for Standardization, and is defined 
and implemented with the help of binding corporate policies."
"Structure of Bayer’s risk management system

Enterprise risk management incl."
"It examines the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system at least once a 
year, as does the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee."
"In addition, a corresponding report is provided to 
the full Supervisory Board."
"The Bayer Assurance Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, with a second Board of 
Management member participating on a rotating basis."
"Besides ensuring that appropriate action is taken 
to control any substantial risks, the Bayer Assurance Committee regularly discusses and reviews the risk 
portfolio and the status of the risk control measures."
"Responsibility for the identification, assessment, treatment and reporting of risks lies with the operational 
business units in the divisions and enabling functions."
"It establishes a consistent framework and uniform standards for the risk early warning system 
throughout the Bayer Group."
The Enterprise Risk Management department steers and coordinates said risk management system.
"It 
provides overarching standards, methods and tools, is responsible for the risk early warning system, steers 
the annual ERM process and works on ensuring continuous monitoring and improvement."
"This system 
comprises suitable structures and workflows that are defined and implemented throughout the 
organization."
"The purpose of our ICSOFR is to ensure proper and effective accounting and (Group) 
financial reporting in accordance with the relevant reporting principles."
"The ICSOFR is designed to 
guarantee timely, uniform and accurate accounting for all business transactions based on applicable 
statutory regulations, accounting and financial reporting standards, and the internal Group policies that 
are binding on all consolidated companies."
"Risks are identified and assessed, and appropriate 
countermeasures are taken to mitigate them."
"Mandatory Group-wide standards such as system-based 
and manual reconciliation processes and functional separation have been derived from these frameworks 
and promulgated throughout the Bayer Group."
"These standards are implemented by the Bayer Group 
companies."
Compliance with these standards is the responsibility of the respective management teams.
"However, it should be noted that an internal control system, irrespective of its design, cannot provide 
absolute assurance that material misstatements in the financial reporting will be avoided or identified."
"Compliance management system  
Our compliance management system is aligned to the company’s risk status and aims to ensure lawful 
and responsible conduct by our employees."
"It is designed to identify potential violations in advance and 
systematically prevent their occurrence."
"The compliance management system thus contributes significantly 
to the integration of compliance into our operating units and their processes."
"Detailed information on the 
compliance management system can be found in Chapter A 4.2 “Compliance,” which describes in 
particular the process of identifying risks and taking measures to mitigate them."
"The tasks, powers and responsibilities of Internal 
Audit, as well as its position within the Bayer Group, are defined and established in the rules of procedure."
"The department’s management adheres to the mandatory elements of the International Standards for the 
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)."
"The Chief Audit Executive 
(CAE) regularly reports to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee on Internal Audit’s 
compliance with the code of ethics and the standards."
"The CAE also regularly reports to the Board of 
Management and Audit Committee on the results of the audit assignments, as well as, for example, on 
Internal Audit’s quality assurance and improvement program."
"This includes aspects such as relevant 
results of internal and external assessments carried out at least once every five years by a qualified 
independent assessor."
"The most recent assessment was concluded in the fourth quarter of 2022, yielding 
the best results possible."
"In addition, the fundamental suitability of the early warning system is assessed by 
the external auditor as an independent external body as part of its audit of the annual financial statements."
"This lays the foundation for a risk culture with independent, proactive and 
systematic risk management involving clearly defined roles and responsibilities, principles, standards, 
methods, tools and training measures."
"The aims of the risk management system are to achieve risk 
transparency, which also encompasses the early detection of risks, to support risk-based (treatment) 
decisions and to ensure compliance with legal requirements."
"ERM: risk management process 
Identification: Risks are identified by risk owners in the divisions and enabling functions."
"To help ensure 
we identify risks as comprehensively as possible, we maintain a risk universe that reflects the company’s 
potential risk categories."
"The Bayer Risk Universe, which is regularly updated, also expressly accounts for 
risks of a nonfinancial nature that are linked to our business activity or to our business relationships, 
products and services."
"Risks pursuant to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Directive 
Implementation Act that relate to environmental, employee and social issues, human rights, corruption and 
bribery (compliance) are included as well."
"Further information on the nonfinancial statement can be found 
in the “About this Report” section."
"Assessment: Where possible, the identified risks are evaluated with regard to their potential impact and 
likelihood of occurrence using the matrix below."
"Risks are assessed on a net basis, taking into account the 
risk control measures in place to mitigate the potential impact and/or likelihood of occurrence."
The extent of the impact is rated in quantitative and/or qualitative terms.
"The quantitative assessment 
reflects a potentially negative effect on cash flows."
"A qualitative assessment of the impact is based on 
criteria such as the effect on our strategy or reputation, the potential loss of stakeholder confidence, and 
potential impact on people and/or the environment."
"The higher rating – qualitatively or quantitatively – 
determines the overall assessment."
"The likelihood of occurrence is calculated based on a maximum period 
of 10 years."

We aggregate risks to ensure the early detection of risks that could combine or correlate to potentially 
endanger our company’s continued existence."
"Using methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, we 
estimate the potential aggregated impact that our main risks could have on our cash flow."
"We compare 
the resulting aggregated risk situation with the risk-bearing capacity approved by the Board of 
Management."
"The outcome of this comparison is factored into the Board of Management’s overall 
assessment of the company’s risk status."
"Treatment: The risk owners decide on a targeted risk level based on a cost-benefit analysis and define a 
risk management strategy as well as risk management measures."
"These include risk avoidance, risk 
reduction, risk transfer and risk acceptance."
"Reporting: The results are reported to the Bayer Assurance Committee by the Enterprise Risk 
Management department within the Internal Audit & Risk Management enabling function."
"In addition, new 
risks above a defined threshold are reported to Enterprise Risk Management on an ad-hoc basis and, if 
relevant, to the Bayer Assurance Committee."
"A report on the risk portfolio is submitted to the Board of 
Management and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board at least once a year."
"ERM: monitoring and improvement 
The Enterprise Risk Management department within the Internal Audit & Risk Management enabling 
function continuously evaluates whether the principles, standards, methods and tools are appropriate and 
up to date."
"Assessment of the risk management and internal control systems pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 3 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act  
The overarching requirements for all management systems in place at Bayer are defined by the integrated 
management system (IMS)."
"Controls and monitoring are generally performed as part of the respective 
management systems, focusing on the risks that need to be mitigated."
"The Board of Management has defined and implemented a procedure to ensure compliance with 
requirements pursuant to Section 91, Paragraph 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act with regard to the 
risk management system and the internal control system."
"This procedure is regularly reviewed and further 
developed as required."
"Accordingly, the Board of Management is focused particularly on the four management systems of 
enterprise risk management, internal control system for (Group) accounting and financial reporting 
processes, compliance, and internal audit."
"These four management systems form the core of our risk 
management and internal control systems."
"The results of these 
reviews are regularly reported to the Board of Management."
"The review by the Board of Management did not identify any relevant indications that, in their entirety, 
would call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems for 2023."
"However, it is important to bear in mind that, irrespective of their design or evaluation, risk management 
and internal control systems cannot ensure with absolute certainty that all risks are identified before they 
materialize and that the envisaged controls uncover all weaknesses."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 
106
3.2.2 Opportunity and Risk Status  
In this section, we report on material, reportable risks pursuant to German Accounting Standard No."
"These include all financial and nonfinancial risks that have been classified as high or medium and are at 
least significant in terms of potential impact after taking into account the risk control measures in place 
(net risk)."
They encompass risks falling within the black outline in the rating matrix A 3.2.1/2.
"In addition, 
we report relevant risks that (from a financial point of view) may not be sufficiently or meaningfully 
assessable, if at all."
"We also report on the principal opportunities identified in the course of our opportunity 
management."
"Furthermore, we assess the probability that the effects of individual risks could change 
significantly during the forecast period."
"Our most recent evaluation did not find this to be case, with the 
following exception: Legal proceedings may generally involve substantial estimation risks."
"Against the 
background of the proceedings in the glyphosate matter and PCB matters, in particular, outcomes of 
mediation and/or the ongoing litigations may lead to adjustments of the provisions established in 
connection with these series of litigations."
"Such adjustments may materially impact the forecast issued 
with respect to the financial position and cash flows."
"See also Note [30] in B Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
Comparable risks existing in different divisions of the company are grouped together where applicable.
"The section below details the individual risk categories that fall within the “Risks to be reported externally” 
area outlined in the risk matrix, as well as how they have been classified21 and the divisions concerned."
The order in which the risks are listed does not imply any order of importance.
"We also describe 
opportunities and risks of a division-specific nature where relevant."
"The divisions mentioned are those that 
have identified material risks."
Other divisions may also be affected to a lesser extent.
"Material risks 
reported by enabling functions are categorized under “Group,” although they may also affect the divisions."
"Social and macroeconomic trends  
(High: Group; Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals)  
We continue to see the risk of geopolitical shifts and tensions that may impact our global business."
"Competition between global powers and geostrategic rivalries are calling established economic paradigms 
into question and may adversely impact investment decisions, supply chains and international trade flows."
"While global trade remains highly interconnected, globalization is undergoing a period of transition that 
may have ramifications for our business environment: Decoupling in various areas (e.g."
"capital markets, 
technological standards) is causing many states to become increasingly focused on securing access to 
critical commodities and strategically important technologies."
"This may lead to the introduction of a greater 
number of restrictive commercial measures or investment controls relating to critical infrastructure, which 
may impact us directly or indirectly."
"Geopolitical risks continue to relate primarily to Russia’s war in 
Ukraine."
"We see risks both directly for our production and customers, as well as indirectly through the 
impact on our suppliers and supply chains (see also the “Supply of products” section)."
"Shifts in these underlying conditions may negatively impact our sales and margins, for example."
"Furthermore, our market environment and, consequently, our business performance may be adversely 
impacted."
"The environment in which we operate is becoming increasingly harsh overall, which may 
continue to lead to increased attacks on critical infrastructure."
"We are preparing for these challenges with 
global and local operational crisis management, task forces and other interdisciplinary teams, as well as by 
diversifying our energy sources."
21 The classification pertains to the risks.
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 
107
The growing world population, coupled with rising food demand, gives rise to opportunities for our Crop 
Science Division."
"In addition, changing consumption patterns and increasing public awareness of the 
importance of healthy eating and sustainability, paired with new digital technologies, are giving rise to new 
pools of value in the agriculture market."
"Therefore, while high-quality seeds and crop protection will remain 
at our core, we see opportunities to capture additional value by tapping new customer segments, sales 
platforms and digital capabilities."
"Furthermore, the aging population gives rise to opportunities for our Pharmaceuticals Division, with the 
incidence of chronic diseases on the rise and an increasing number of patients suffering from multiple 
conditions affecting their quality of life."
"To address the growing demand for innovative healthcare products 
to treat age-related diseases, our Pharmaceuticals Division has streamlined its R&D activities toward 
precision medicine with a narrower therapeutic area focus but a wider range of modalities."
"Moreover, a negative public perception of Bayer represents a risk."
"For example, modern agricultural 
methods, such as the application of certain classes of crop protection products and the use of 
biotechnology, are often the subject of intense public debate, which may adversely affect our reputation."
"We are engaged in 
constant dialogue with interest groups and regulators to promote scientifically founded, rational and 
responsible discussions and decision-making processes."
"Furthermore, negative developments of a macroeconomic nature, such as crises in important sales 
markets for our company, could weigh on our business and reduce our earnings."
"Our seed and crop 
protection business in particular is cyclical and shaped by economic developments and factors, including 
fluctuating weather conditions and pest pressure that may adversely impact our Crop Science business."
Forecasts concerning climate change indicate that these risks may possibly increase in the long term.
"We 
address these influences through our globally diversified business, flexible supply chain, comprehensive 
monitoring and assessment of market developments, and our ability to adjust production volumes to the 
level of demand forecast in sales and distribution planning."
"Market developments (Medium: Crop Science) 
In the Crop Science Division, we could face increased competition in the seed and crop protection 
industry."
"The successful market launch of new generations of products is also subject to external factors 
that we have only limited control over."
"In addition, new competitors entering the market and aggressive 
marketing and pricing strategies – not only for generic products – could have a largely negative impact on 
our profitability and market position."
"In addition, increasing digitalization in the agriculture sector could lead 
to the rise of new players and alter the market."
"To take account of these developments, we are realigning 
our business models, engaging in scientific and commercial partnerships, and utilizing our own R&D 
capabilities."
We see opportunities for our Pharmaceuticals Division.
"Scientific breakthroughs in fields such as cell and 
gene therapy and precision medicine have expanded the toolbox of innovative therapies."
"This provides 
opportunities to cure patients with the highest unmet needs or even prevent diseases in the first place."
"At 
the same time, data science and AI are leading to improved diagnostic methods, enabling diseases to be 
diagnosed and treated in a more targeted way."
"For example, further restrictions could 
be imposed on the sale and use of various crop protection products."
"Conserving biodiversity is one of the topics at hand in this respect, together with potential 
restrictions on the manufacture and use of certain chemical substances."
"Approval conditions may also 
become even more challenging for the Pharmaceuticals Division."
"In addition, the pricing of pharmaceutical 
products could become more strictly regulated – not only for products already exposed to generic 
competition, but also for innovative, patent-protected products."
"Residues of agrochemical products, 
pharmaceutical compounds or microplastics in the environment could also become subject to more 
stringent regulation."
"In addition, regulatory changes could affect agricultural imports from other parts of 
the world and therefore our business in those regions."
"We also need to prepare for regulatory changes in 
the field of AI in the future."
"Regulatory changes could also cause uncertainty over our products’ patent 
protection, potentially resulting in financial losses that may even include the repayment of license fees."
"Regulatory changes may also lead to higher product development costs and longer development times, or 
even necessitate adjustments to our product portfolio, which in turn may negatively impact our reputation."
"We counter such risks by monitoring changes in regulatory requirements in order to adequately address 
them within the company."
"We pursue a global strategy that bundles our strong product portfolio and 
sustainability commitments, and leverages our global business presence."
"We also deploy in-house R&D 
capacities, make acquisitions and enter into collaborations, while aligning our product portfolio to reflect 
anticipated changes."
"We also address these risks by engaging in dialogue with the authorities with the 
goal of promoting science-based decision-making, and by appropriately participating to defend against 
challenges to product approvals."
"Business strategy (Medium: Pharmaceuticals, Group) 
Our business strategy is geared toward innovation, which is inherently associated with risks."
"In our 
Pharmaceuticals Division, we see challenges in setting up new therapy platforms, such as for cell and 
gene therapy, and in further developing established therapeutic areas through innovative solutions."
"On a 
Group level, we might encounter challenges in our endeavors to implement our voluntary sustainability 
commitments in a timely manner, which may also be due to external factors."
"We may face negative 
financial repercussions and/or damage to our reputation, for example, if such risks were to materialize."
We counter these risks by aligning our organization and our processes to existing challenges.
"In the 
Crop Science Division, for example, our digital farming activities are supplemented by strategic 
partnerships with leading IT companies where necessary."
"In the Pharmaceuticals Division, meanwhile, 
we have established a cell and gene therapy unit, for example."
"In the Pharmaceuticals 
Division, opportunities arise from data science and AI and associated new R&D methods that save time 
and enhance R&D productivity."
"In addition, new, unique screening technologies facilitate the identification 
of new lead structures to unlock previously undruggable targets, with the potential to develop new and 
innovative products."
"We also rely on networking, both within the company and with external partners, to 
boost our innovation capabilities."
This stimulates the development of new products.
"Technological advances in pharmaceutical product development may at the same time also represent a 
risk for our company should we not be in a position to play a role in shaping such advances."
"Securing 
access to new technologies and identifying a sufficient number of research candidates in general while 
also ensuring their appropriate development represents a particular challenge."
"Targeting in-licensing and 
acquisitions as additional ways to strengthen our company involves the risk that we may be unable to 
identify a sufficient number of suitable candidates on financially acceptable terms."
"We cannot ensure that 
all of the development candidates we currently have in our pipeline, or will have in the future, will be 
developed to the stage at which they are ready to be launched on the market, or that they will obtain their 
planned approval/registration or achieve commercial success."
"These goals may not be reached if, for 
example, we are unable to satisfy technical or capacity requirements or meet time constraints in product 
development, fail to achieve study objectives or do not allocate financial resources optimally."
"Delays or 
cost overruns may occur during product registration or launch."
"We counter this risk through holistic 
portfolio management, by estimating the probability of success and prioritizing development projects."
"We plan to further leverage the strengths of our R&D platform to deliver 
pioneering technologies faster."
"In addition, we will leverage our existing expertise and strategically invest in 
new capabilities to unlock and capture new market segments."
"In addition, some of our production facilities are located in areas that may be 
affected by natural disasters such as flooding or earthquakes."
"The materialization of any of these risks 
could lead to production disruptions or stoppages, result in personal injury and damage to our reputation, 
lead to declines in sales and/or margins, and necessitate the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure."
"If 
we are unable to meet product demand, sales may undergo a structural decline because patients may in 
the meantime be receiving alternative treatments and may not switch back to our products."
"We address 
this risk for certain products by building up safety stocks and by spreading production across multiple 
sites, for example."
"Furthermore, an emergency response system based on a corresponding corporate 
policy has been implemented at all our production sites."
Disruptions in our upstream supply chain may also negatively impact our own supply capability.
"The 
substances we procure, and the companies that manufacture them, must meet all necessary regulatory 
requirements."
"These substances must also be suitable for fulfilling regulatory requirements further down 
the value chain."
"Certain materials, particularly in our Pharmaceuticals Division, are offered by only a small 
number of suppliers."
"We counter these risks by establishing relationships with alternative suppliers, 
concluding long-term agreements, expanding inventories and producing raw materials ourselves."
"Supplier 
risks are regularly reviewed and evaluated."
"As a result of geopolitical risks and the international (supply chain) disruption they are causing, risks 
relating to the availability of necessary production materials and supply chain stability, for example, remain 
at the same high level as the previous year."
See also the “Social and macroeconomic trends” section.
"As a result, product launch concepts – including those related to clinical trials – and the 
planning or implementation of the distribution strategy could turn out to be inefficient or inadequate in 
terms of scheduling."
"In addition, if competitors’ marketing activities – including price competition from 
generics – or advertised product characteristics surpass our own efforts in this regard, this may represent 
a risk for sales of our products."
"We address these risks by conducting a forward-looking analysis of 
possible scenarios and devising suitable strategies for projects such as planned product launches."
"Human resources (Medium: Group) 
Skilled and dedicated employees are essential for our company’s success."
"Difficulties in recruiting, hiring 
and retaining urgently needed specialized employees (on a regional level) – also in view of competition 
between employers – and in employee development could have significant adverse consequences for our 
company’s future development."
"Developments such as the growing relevance of disruptive technologies 
and the new operating model we intend to adopt, together with new ways of working, will require new, 
innovative skillsets from our employees."
"Based on our analysis of future requirements, we counter these 
risks by designing appropriate employee recruitment and development measures."
"In addition, we align our 
corporate culture toward diversity and employee needs based on data, analyses and insights, enabling us 
to tap the full potential of the employment market."
"Information technology (High: Group) 
Our business and production processes and our internal and external communications are dependent on 
global IT systems."
"Ensuring the optimal alignment of our IT architecture, which also encompasses the use 
of cloud-based services and management of any service providers commissioned, therefore represents a 
challenge."
"This means that system reliability and the confidentiality of internal and external data are of 
fundamental importance to us."
"If our governance fails to adequately address this challenging environment, 
our operational stability could negatively impact our business and our information security requirements 
may not be met adequately."
"If the risk of a breach of data confidentiality, integrity or authenticity, for 
example due to (cyber) attacks, were to materialize, it could lead to the manipulation and/or uncontrolled 
outflow of data and knowledge, and to reputational damage."
"Such attacks may also be carried out by  
in-house personnel."
"Our business and/or production processes could also be temporarily disrupted by 
(cyber) attacks."
"To counter these risks, we evaluate and utilize new technologies."
"Projects and measures 
have also been implemented to keep technical security precautions up to date and proactively identify and 
examine new threats."
"In addition, security measures implemented by the Corporate Cyber Defense Center 
protect our IT infrastructure against unauthorized access."
"Finance and tax (Medium: Group) 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risks are defined as the possible inability of the Bayer Group to meet current or future payment 
obligations."
"They are determined and managed by the Group Finance enabling function as part of our 
same-day and medium-term liquidity planning."
"We hold sufficient liquidity to ensure the fulfillment of all 
planned payment obligations throughout the Bayer Group at maturity."
"Furthermore, a reserve is maintained 
for unbudgeted shortfalls in cash receipts or unexpected disbursements, and its balance is regularly 
reviewed and adjusted."
"Credit facilities also exist with banks, including, in particular, an undrawn 
€4.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with a current maturity of 2025."
"Credit risks 
Credit risks arise from the possibility that the value of receivables or other financial assets of the Bayer 
Group may be impaired because counterparties cannot meet their payment or other performance 
obligations."
"The maximum default risk is reduced by existing collateral, especially our global credit 
insurance programs."
"To manage credit risks from trade receivables, the invoicing companies appoint credit 
managers who regularly analyze customers’ creditworthiness."
"We generally agree reservation of title with 
our customers."
Credit limits are set for all customers.
"In addition, all credit limits for debtors where total 
exposure is €10 million or more are evaluated both locally and centrally."
"Credit risks from financial 
transactions are managed centrally in the Group Finance enabling function."
"To minimize risks, financial 
transactions are only conducted within predefined exposure limits and with banks and other partners that 
preferably have investment-grade ratings."
"Risks are mitigated through the 
use of derivative financial instruments."
"The type and level of currency, interest-rate and commodity-price 
risks are determined using sensitivity analyses as per IFRS 7 that are based on hypothetical changes in 
risk variables (such as interest curves) to gauge the potential effects of market price fluctuations on equity 
and earnings."
"Although they fall below the external reporting threshold under our ERM system, we report 
on interest-rate and commodity-price risks in this section in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 7."
"Foreign currency opportunities and risks for our company arise from changes in exchange rates and the 
related changes in the value of financial instruments (including receivables and payables) and of anticipated 
payment receipts and disbursements not in the functional currency."
"Receivables and payables in liquid 
currencies from operating activities and financial items are generally fully exchange-hedged through cross-
currency interest-rate swaps and forward exchange contracts."
"Anticipated exposure from planned 
payment receipts and disbursements in the future is hedged through forward exchange contracts and 
currency options according to management guidelines."
"Sensitivities were determined on the basis of a 
hypothetical scenario in which the euro appreciates or depreciates by 10% against all other currencies 
compared with the year-end exchange rates."
"In this scenario, the estimated hypothetical increase or 
decrease in cash flows from derivative and nonderivative financial instruments would have improved or 
diminished earnings as of December 31, 2023, by €15 million (December 31, 2022: €64 million)."
"Derivatives used to hedge anticipated currency exposure that are designated for hedge accounting would 
have improved or diminished equity (other comprehensive income) by €474 million (December 31, 2022: 
€471 million)."
"Of this amount, €158 million is related to the Brazilian real (BRL), €119 million to the Chinese 
renminbi (CNY), €42 million to the Japanese yen (JPY) and €38 million to the Canadian dollar (CAD)."
Currency effects on anticipated exposure are not taken into account.
"Interest-rate opportunities and risks for our company arise from changes in capital market interest rates, 
which in turn could lead to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments and changes in 
interest payments in the case of floating-rate instruments."
"Interest-rate swaps are concluded to achieve 
the target structure for Bayer Group debt."
"Commodity-price opportunities and risks arise from the volatility of raw material prices, which could lead to 
an increase in the prices we pay for seeds and energy."
"We reduce commodity-price risks by using 
commodity-price derivatives such as futures, which are mainly designated as hedge accounting."
"In addition, Bayer has concluded a long-term structured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase 
agreement to satisfy its renewable energy needs in the United States."
"The agreement contains a contract 
for difference that is separately accounted for as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss and is 
affected by energy prices."
"A sensitivity analysis with a hypothetical 10% change in commodity prices for 
derivatives used for hedging purposes indicated an effect of €58 million on equity (December 31, 2022: 
€38 million)."
"A hypothetical 10% change would have resulted in a gain of €54 million or a loss of 
€68 million, respectively, through profit or loss."

Financial risks associated with pension obligations 
The Bayer Group has obligations to current and former employees relating to pensions and other post-
employment benefits."
"Changes in relevant measurement parameters such as interest rates, mortality and 
salary increase rates may raise the present value of our pension obligations."
"This may lead to increased 
costs for pension plans or diminish equity due to actuarial losses being recognized in other comprehensive 
income in the statement of comprehensive income."
"A large proportion of our pension and other post-
employment benefit obligations is covered by plan assets, including fixed-income securities, shares, real 
estate and other investments."
"Declining or even negative returns on these investments may adversely 
affect the future fair value of plan assets."
"Both of these effects may negatively impact the development of 
equity and/or earnings, and/or may necessitate additional payments by our company."
"We address the risk 
of market-related fluctuations in the fair value of our plan assets through balanced strategic investment, 
and we constantly monitor investment risks in regard to our global pension obligations."
"Tax risks 
Bayer AG and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are thus subject to many different national tax laws 
and regulations."
"The companies are regularly audited by the tax authorities in various countries where they 
are tax residents."
"Significant acquisitions, divestments, restructuring programs and other reorganizational 
measures that we undertake could also have a negative impact on such items."
"We counter the resulting 
risks by continuously identifying and evaluating the tax framework."
"We establish provisions for taxes, 
based on estimates, for liabilities to the tax authorities of the respective countries that are uncertain as to 
their amount and the probability of their occurrence."
"Major programs (Medium: Group)  
We are introducing a realigned operating model that we call Dynamic Shared Ownership, which aims to 
significantly enhance the Bayer Group’s focus on our mission, accelerate the pace of innovation and more 
effectively harness our growth potential."
"In this connection, we face the challenge of ensuring that we can 
adequately leverage the benefits we expect to arise from this transformation."
"Please see the Group 
Strategy section of the Strategy and Targets chapter for details."
"In addition, our ambitious objectives to 
standardize IT processes and systems may take longer to implement than planned or may not be 
completely fulfilled."
"Materialization of these risks could result in consequences such as increased costs 
and/or disruptions in service continuity."
"We counter these risks by deploying dedicated teams and 
multipliers to drive forward these projects with the Board of Management’s full backing."
"External partner compliance (Medium: Group) 
There is a risk that our partners, such as suppliers, do not pay due attention to our corporate values and 
requirements concerning ethics, compliance – including the observance of human rights – and 
sustainability."
"To 
address these risks, we have clear sustainability criteria and standards in place for our supply chain on 
both a global and regional level."
"With the goal of improving sustainable practices in our supply chain, we 
operate a Group-wide four-step management process that comprises the following elements: raising 
awareness, supplier selection, supplier evaluation and supplier development."
"We address the distinct 
human rights challenges in the seed supply chain by applying a separate human rights management 
process for seed producers."
"Misconduct or noncompliance with legal requirements or 
Bayer Group standards may result in personal injury, damage to property, reputation or the environment, 
loss of production, business interruptions and/or liability for compensation payments."
"We have put in place principles, standards and measures aimed at ensuring 
that our requirements are adequately communicated and optimally implemented."
"Intellectual property (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals) 
Our portfolio largely consists of patent-protected products."
"Generic manufacturers in particular attempt to 
contest or circumvent patents prior to their expiration."
"We are currently involved in legal proceedings to 
enforce patent protection for our products."
"Converseley, legal action by third parties for alleged 
infringement of patent or other property rights by Bayer may impede or even halt the development or 
manufacturing of certain products."
"We may also be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to third 
parties."
"Our patents department regularly reviews the patent situation in collaboration with the respective 
operating units and monitors for potential patent infringements so that legal action can be taken if 
necessary."
"Legal/compliance (Group) 
We are exposed to risks from legal disputes or proceedings to which we are currently a party or which 
could arise in the future."
"See Note [30] to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group under 
“Legal risks.” The legal proceedings outlined there are those currently considered to involve material risks 
and do not represent an exhaustive list."
"The general risks to which we are currently and/or potentially 
exposed include but are not limited to those in the areas of product liability, securities law, breach of 
contract, competition and antitrust law, anti-corruption law, patent law, tax law, data privacy and 
environmental protection."
"Investigations of possible legal or regulatory violations may result in the 
imposition of civil or criminal penalties – including substantial monetary fines – and/or other adverse 
financial consequences."
"Payments may also need to be made under out-of-court settlements or adverse 
court decisions."
"The materialization of any of these risks may harm our reputation and hamper our 
commercial success."
"We have established a global compliance management system to ensure the 
observance of laws and regulations."
"Glyphosate matter  
A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to glyphosate-based products 
manufactured by Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”) have been served upon Monsanto 
in the United States."
"Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a number of Monsanto’s herbicides, 
including Roundup™-branded products."
"Plaintiffs allege personal injuries resulting from exposure to those 
products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and are seeking compensatory 
and punitive damages."
"The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that the glyphosate-based herbicide products 
are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of the risks allegedly associated with such 
products and failed to adequately warn its users."
Additional lawsuits are anticipated.
"The majority of 
plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and California."
"As of January 31, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial 
number of claims."
"Of the approximately 167,000 claims in total, approximately 113,000 have been settled 
or are not eligible for various reasons."
"As of January 31, 2024, there have been 19 Roundup™ trials concluded before both federal and state 
courts in California, Missouri, Oregon and Pennsylvania."
"In 10 of those trials, the juries reached verdicts in 
favor of Monsanto."
"In the other nine trials, the plaintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and a 
multiple thereof in punitive damages."
"A few of these cases have been settled later, but in most cases 
Monsanto has filed post-trial motions or appealed the jury verdicts, or plans to do so."
"In our opinion, these 
verdicts are based on numerous evidentiary and legal errors, as well as unconstitutionally excessive 
damage awards."
"Bayer has two appeals pending in federal court on preemption grounds: Carson, pending 
in the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and Schaffner, pending in the Third Circuit Federal Court of 
Appeals."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

114
As of December 31, 2023, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled US$6.3 billion 
(€5.7 billion)."
"Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with the 
products mentioned above."
"As of January 31, 2024, a total of 32 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup™ had been served upon 
Bayer, including 11 seeking class action certification."
"Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the safety of glyphosate and our 
glyphosate-based formulations vigorously."
"PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for various 
purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979."
"In 2020, Bayer entered into a class settlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of 
approximately 2,500 municipal entities."
"In 2022, the court issued its final approval of the class settlement."
"There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, 62 of which have now filed lawsuits: 
California cities, counties and municipalities (City of Los Angeles, County of San Mateo, County of Marin 
and County of Contra Costa), Illinois (City of Chicago, City of Evanston and City of East St."
"Louis), 
Washington (City of Seattle) and Wisconsin (City of Milwaukee)."
"Currently, there are five pending state attorney general cases: Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey 
and Vermont."
"Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington D.C., Washington, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately 
US$456 million."
"The Company also settled a pending matter with the State of Oregon for US$698 million, 
reflecting unique circumstances in that State."
The Vermont Attorney General case is different from the others in scope.
"In June 2023, the Vermont 
Attorney General filed suit in state court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the 
state’s environment and its school buildings."
"The same month, a second and similar complaint (Addison 
Central School District) was filed in federal court (District of Vermont) by private lawyers representing 93 
Vermont school districts alleging PCB contamination in school buildings."
"In addition, there is a pending 
case in Vermont on behalf of the Burlington School District and related personal injury claims (see below)."
"Monsanto also faces numerous lawsuits claiming personal injury due to use of and exposure to PCB 
products in school buildings."
"One group of cases with approximately 200 plaintiffs claims a wide variety of 
personal injuries allegedly due to PCBs in the building products of a school (Sky Valley Education Center) 
in King County, Washington."
"As of January 31, 2024, nine trials had been completed in these matters, 
involving a total of 65 plaintiffs."
"20 of these plaintiffs were not successful as the juries decided in favor of 
Monsanto or a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a decision."
"The other 45 plaintiffs 
were awarded a total of approximately US$300 million in compensatory and a multiple thereof in punitive 
damages."
"The undisputed evidence in these cases does not, in Bayer’s opinion, support the conclusions 
that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs or that any exposure could have caused their claimed 
injuries."
"Each of the adverse verdicts are in different stages of post-trial motions and appeal due to 
numerous significant trial errors."
"In September 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother 
on behalf of her three children who attended a local school."
"She alleges they are at increased risk of 
cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medical monitoring."
"The complaint identifies 26 allegedly 
contaminated schools, and the proposed class is defined as all individuals who attended or worked at one 
of the contaminated schools."
"There are also five pending personal injury cases related to the Burlington, 
Vermont, high school."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
3.2 Opportunity and Risk Report 
115
There are additional personal injury cases stemming from non-school PCB exposure."
"In August 2023, nine 
cases were filed in Massachusetts state court involving 16 plaintiffs who allege various personal injuries 
from alleged exposure to PCBs in or near a former General Electric landfill."
"A personal injury and wrongful 
death action was filed by 169 current or former employees at Clark County Government Center in Nevada."
"These plaintiffs allege that PCBs contaminated the Center through prior operations by Union Pacific 
Railroad at the site."
"The Nevada action was dismissed by the court, and the plaintiffs have appealed."
"Lastly, there are four cases involving seven plaintiffs claiming injury due to exposure to PCBs near 
Monsanto’s former Krummrich plant."
"We believe that we also have meritorious defenses in these matters and intend to defend ourselves 
vigorously."
"To recover costs associated with the PCB-related litigation, Bayer filed a complaint in August 2022 in the 
Circuit Court of St."
"Louis County for the State of Missouri to enforce its rights under certain indemnity 
contracts."
"Under these contracts, the companies who purchased PCBs for use in their products agreed to 
indemnify Monsanto for PCB-related litigation costs, including settlements."
"We may incur considerable financial disadvantages from pending lawsuits and/or potential future cases if, 
for example, we are ordered to pay compensatory and possibly punitive damages or if we assume 
payment obligations under out-of-court settlements."
"We could be compelled to cover any such increased 
financial requirements by issuing additional external debt, increasing our equity capital or divesting assets 
– possibly on unfavorable terms – or through combinations of these measures."
"The terms on which we 
obtain external financing could become less favorable as a result of any increased financial requirements."
"The materialization of any of these risks may also adversely affect our reputation and our commercial 
success."
"Product safety and stewardship (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals) 
Despite extensive studies prior to approval or registration, products may be partially or completely 
withdrawn from the market due, for example, to the occurrence of unexpected side effects or negative 
effects of our products."
Such a withdrawal may be voluntary or result from legal or regulatory measures.
"In 
the agriculture business in particular, there is an additional risk that our customers could use our products 
incorrectly."
"Furthermore, the presence of traces of unwanted genetically modified organisms in agricultural 
products and/or foodstuffs may have wide-ranging negative repercussions."
"The materialization of any of 
these risks could, for example, lead to a loss of sales and earnings, a negative impact on our reputation 
and potential liability claims."
"We counter them by taking comprehensive measures in the areas of 
pharmaceutical and crop protection product safety and testing, including, in particular, a comprehensive 
stewardship program for genetic product integrity and quality with regard to seeds."
"These measures are 
based on globally defined principles and include analysis and monitoring measures, an alert system and 
training programs."
"Quality and regulatory requirements (Medium: Crop Science, Pharmaceuticals, Group) 
In almost every country in which we operate, our business activity is subject to extensive regulations, 
standards, requirements and inspections that also apply to our local contract manufacturers."
"In the area of 
health, this largely pertains to clinical studies and manufacturing processes, but also to production 
materials, for example."
"At our Crop Science Division, extensive requirements apply along the value chain, 
such as in our production activities, and also with respect to the external partners involved."
"Acquisitions 
may at times also be subject to requirements, compliance with which must be ensured both during and 
after the integration process."
"Potential infringements of regulatory requirements may result in the 
imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, restrictions on our freedom to 
operate, and/or other adverse financial consequences."
"They could also harm our reputation and lead to 
declining sales and/or margins."
"We counter these risks through binding principles, standards and the 
control mechanisms in place."
"Quality requirements are defined and implemented in global quality 
management systems."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

Security (Medium: Group) 
Potential criminal activities targeting our employees, property or business activities represent a risk for our 
company."
"These include intellectual property theft, vandalism, physical attacks and sabotage."
"In addition, 
counterfeit versions of our products could be put into circulation."
"There is also the risk of crisis situations 
such as a pandemic or a prolonged power outage that could lead to a breakdown of our critical (IT) 
infrastructure and our production."
"We counter these risks – which in addition to financial effects could also 
negatively affect our reputation in some cases if they were to materialize – through our (local) crisis 
organizations, which produce response plans and take further measures."
"We have implemented a variety 
of early warning systems."
"Operating globally, our security and crisis management department ensures 
continuous reporting of security incidents and carries out regular crisis simulation exercises worldwide."
"3.2.3 Overall Assessment of Opportunities and Risks 
by the Board of Management  
In the opinion of the Board of Management, based on the current evaluations, none of the risks described 
above endanger the company’s continued existence."
"Nor could we identify any potential threat to our 
continued existence, including when comparing our risk-bearing capacity with our aggregated risk 
situation."
"We currently have not identified any material change in our risk status compared with the 
assessment given in the 2022 Annual Report."
"We remain convinced that we can take advantage of the 
opportunities arising from our entrepreneurial activity and successfully master the challenges resulting from 
the risks stated above."

"The contents of the 
Corporate Governance Report are also included in the Management Report."
"In accordance with 
Section 317, Paragraph 2, Sentence 6 of the German Commercial Code, the information contained in the 
Declaration by Corporate Management is not taken into account in the audit of the financial statements."
"Corporate governance practices that go beyond the legal requirements are derived from our mission, 
guiding principles and target behaviors, which form the basis of the respectful working relationship 
between our employees and with our external partners, and cover all stages of the value chain."
"The main 
guidelines are summarized primarily in our corporate policies on compliance, human rights, and fairness 
and respect at work, as well as in our Supplier Code of Conduct and the Bayer Societal Engagement 
(BASE) principles."
"The organization and oversight obligations of the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board are mainly ensured by compliance management and risk management systems."
"In April and May, it included a 
seventh member on a transitional basis."
"The Board of Management runs the company on its own 
responsibility with the goal of achieving defined corporate objectives and sustainably increasing the 
company’s enterprise value."
"With regard to the composition of the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board takes into account 
specialist expertise and personal aptitude, as well as aspects such as age, gender, education and 
professional background."
"Pursuant to Section 76, Paragraph 3a of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG), the Supervisory Board must ensure that the Board of Management includes at least one woman 
and at least one man if it consists of three or more members."
"An additional aspect relating to the composition of the Board of Management that the Supervisory Board 
has resolved to pursue is diversity."
"Without basing selection decisions on this aspect in individual cases, 
the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that different age groups are adequately represented on the Board 
of Management, while also taking into account the experience required for a position on the Board of 
Management."
"Irrespective of this, members of the Board of Management should generally step down from 
that office when they turn 62."
"The composition of the Board of Management should adequately reflect the 
company’s international operations."
"The Supervisory Board therefore endeavors to include on the Board of 
Management several members of different nationalities or with an international background (e.g., several 
years of career experience outside Germany or the oversight of foreign business activities)."
"The 
Supervisory Board also strives to ensure diversity with regard to the educational and professional 
backgrounds of the members of the Board of Management."
"In addition to the specific professional 
expertise and the management and leadership experience required for the given task, members of the 
Board of Management should cover the broadest possible spectrum of knowledge, experience, and 
educational and professional backgrounds."
"These objectives are taken into account when selecting candidates to fill open positions on the Board of 
Management."
"In accordance with the statutory requirements of the Second Leadership Positions Act (FüPoG II), there 
are also targets pertaining to the proportion of women at the first and second management levels below 
the Board of Management."
"The Board of Management has set targets of 35%22, 23 women at the first 
management level of Bayer AG and 35%23, 24 women at the second management level."
"These targets are 
to be attained by June 30, 2027."
"As part of the succession planning process, the Board of Management informs the Supervisory Board 
about candidates who have been identified as having the potential to become a member of the Board of 
Management."
"Among other things, the Supervisory Board places emphasis on intensive human resources 
development at the management level below the Board of Management while taking into account the 
diversity criteria outlined above."
"The Supervisory Board endeavors to meet the respective candidates 
personally during presentations given to the Supervisory Board or its committees, or on other occasions."
"The company has identified candidates who would be able to step in to replace individual Board of 
Management members and assume their roles at short notice if required."
"Whenever it becomes clear that 
there will be an empty seat on the Board of Management, efforts are undertaken to identify and evaluate 
prospective candidates inside and outside the company."
"When necessary, an HR consulting firm is 
brought in to aid the process."
"22 Formal target pursuant to FüPoG II: 36 16/19% 
23 Based on the target size, the formal target pursuant to FüPoG II indicates the percentage to be specified that results in a whole headcount 
based on the current size of the group."
"Werner Baumann and the Supervisory Board had previously agreed that 
Baumann’s contract as member and Chairman of Bayer’s Board of Management (CEO), which was set to 
run until April 30, 2024, should be terminated prematurely."
"Baumann’s service contract and term of office 
came to an end by mutual consent on May 31, 2023."
"Heike Prinz was appointed to the Board of Management effective September 1, 2023, and became the 
company’s Labor Director."
She also serves as Chief Talent Officer.
"Prinz succeeded Sarena Lin, who 
vacated her seat on the Board of Management on August 31, 2023."
"Implementation status of the objectives 
In line with the objectives, different age groups are represented on the Board of Management, while also 
taking into account the experience required for Board of Management positions."
"The ages of the members 
of the Board of Management ranged from 50 to 59 years as of December 31, 2023."
"Three of the six 
members of the Board of Management serving as of December 31, 2023, are citizens of a country other 
than Germany."
"All members of the Board of Management have amassed many years of career experience 
outside Germany."
The members of the Board of Management also have diverse professional backgrounds.
"The legal requirement that the Board of Management must include at least one woman and at least one 
man has been met."
"Procedures and committees 
The Board of Management performs its tasks according to the law, the Articles of Incorporation and the 
Board of Management’s rules of procedure, which govern the provision of information to the Supervisory 
Board, for example."
It also works with the company’s other governance bodies in a spirit of trust.
"There 
are no Board of Management committees."
"Supervisory Board 
Composition and objectives (diversity concept and expertise profile) 
Under the German Codetermination Act, half of the Supervisory Board’s 20 members are elected by the 
stockholders and the other half by the company’s employees."
"The Supervisory Board endeavors to ensure that its members collectively possess the necessary expertise, 
skills and professional experience to properly perform their duties."
"The Supervisory Board has also resolved to pursue diversity in its composition, for instance with regard to 
age, gender, education and professional background."
"This is aimed at ensuring that the oversight of the 
company incorporates the broadest possible range of perspectives, and at keeping the candidate pool as 
large as possible."
"With respect to the international business alignment of Bayer AG, the Supervisory Board 
strives to ensure at all times that several of its members have international business experience or an 
international background in other respects."
"With a view to avoiding potential conflicts of interest 
and taking into account the ownership structure of the company and the number of independent 
Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board has set itself the goal that more than half of the 
stockholder representatives be independent."
"The Supervisory Board assesses the independence of its 
members according to the recommendation contained in Section C.7 of the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"The Supervisory Board endeavors to ensure that the terms of service of its members 
are evenly spread, with members serving for no longer than 12 years."
"This restriction on the term of 
service will take effect from fiscal 2024 and will apply for serving members once their current elected term 
comes to an end."
"The Nomination Committee and the full Supervisory Board take these objectives into consideration when 
nominating candidates to fill open positions on the Supervisory Board."
"The stated objectives refer to the 
 
 
Bayer Annual Report 2023 
A Combined Management Report
4.1 Declaration by Corporate Management Pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code 
120
Supervisory Board as a whole, unless otherwise determined."
"However, since the Supervisory Board can 
only nominate candidates for election as stockholder representatives, it can only take the objectives into 
account in these nominations."
"One objective for Supervisory Board elections is that neither women nor 
men account for less than 30% of the membership, in line with the legal requirements."
"Implementation status of the objectives 
The Supervisory Board has several members with international business experience or an international 
background."
"The ages of the members of the Supervisory Board ranged from 51 to 69 years as of 
December 31, 2023."
"One member of the Supervisory Board, Dr. Paul Achleitner, has been a member of 
the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years."
"As such, the Supervisory Board does not consider him to 
be independent as defined in Section C.7 of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"However, the 
Supervisory Board does not harbor any concerns about Dr. Achleitner’s impartiality or any potential 
conflicts of interest."
"The Supervisory Board considers the stockholder representatives Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah, Horst Baier, 
Dr. Norbert Bischofberger, Ertharin Cousin, Colleen A."
"Goggins, Kimberly Mathisen, Alberto Weisser, 
Prof. Dr. Otmar Wiestler and Prof. Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann to be independent."
"The proportion of women 
on the Supervisory Board is currently 45% for the full Supervisory Board; 50% for the employee 
representatives and 40% for the stockholder representatives."
"Seven of the 20 members of the Supervisory 
Board are citizens of a country other than Germany."
"Numerous other members have many years of 
international business experience."
"The members of the Supervisory Board have also completed a whole 
range of vocational training and study courses."

and as the CFO of a publicly listed company."
"Norbert Winkeljohann, Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
and a member of the Audit Committee, has special expertise in the field of auditing."

about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees."
"In addition to the Presidial Committee and 
the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board also has an Innovation Committee and an ESG 
Committee to oversee and advise the Board of Management on matters relating to innovation and 
sustainability, respectively."
"Furthermore, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee deals 
intensively with succession planning and the compensation of the Board of Management."
"The Audit 
Committee discusses the audit risk assessment, the audit strategy and audit planning, as well as the audit 
results with the auditor."
"As part of this process, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discusses 
the progress of the audit with the independent auditor, including during conversations held outside the 
meetings of the Audit Committee, and reports to the Committee."
"The Audit Committee consults with the 
independent auditor on a regular basis, both with and without the Board of Management present."
The Supervisory Board has set itself rules of procedure that are published on the company’s website.
"These rules govern various aspects, such as how conflicts of interest are handled."
Training events are held for the members of the Supervisory Board at regular intervals.
"In 2023, they 
focused largely on digitalization issues."
"In 2023, the Supervisory Board conducted a self-assessment to 
evaluate how effectively it performs its duties."
An external consultant was brought in to aid the process.
"The transactions reported to Bayer AG in 2023 
were duly published and can be viewed on the company’s website."
"4.2 Compliance 
We define compliance as legally impeccable conduct by all employees in their daily work, because the way 
they carry out their duties affects our company’s reputation."
"We do not tolerate any violation of applicable 
laws, codes of conduct or internal regulations."
"Compliance is essential for our long-term economic 
success."
"The following compliance principles apply throughout the Bayer Group: 
// We compete fairly in every market."
// We act with integrity in all our business dealings.
// We balance economic growth with ecological and social responsibility.
// We observe trade controls that regulate our global business.
// We safeguard equal opportunity in securities trading.
// We keep accurate books and records.
// We treat each other with fairness and respect.
// We protect and respect intellectual property rights.
// We act in Bayer’s best interest.
// We protect and secure personal data.
"All employees are required to observe the compliance principles and to immediately report any violation of 
the Corporate Compliance Policy."
Infringements are sanctioned.
"This applies in particular to managerial 
employees, who, for example, may lose their entitlement to variable compensation components and be 
subject to further disciplinary measures if violations that they could have prevented have occurred in their 
sphere of responsibility."
"Compliant and lawful conduct also factors into the performance evaluations of all 
managerial employees."
"The global compliance management system is steered by a central compliance organization within the 
Bayer Group that reports to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and to the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board."
"The CFO is responsible for the compliance organization, while the Audit Committee of 
the Supervisory Board oversees the effectiveness and further development of compliance within the 
Group."
"Potential compliance risks (such as corruption) are identified together with the operational units to ensure 
the systematic and preventive detection and assessment of risks."
"Potential risks are then entered into 
global databases that we use to develop suitable measures for specific processes, business activities or 
countries, for example."
"In addition, we assess our business partners according to risk criteria as we look 
to identify potential compliance risks."
"Adherence to the corporate compliance principles is among the 
subjects covered in audits conducted by Bayer’s Internal Audit and in the analyses and investigations by 
the legal and compliance organization."
"The heads of these organizations provide regular reports on the 
findings of the audits and analyses to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, while summary 
reports are presented at least once a year."
"Reports can be submitted either online or by telephone, with calls answered by trained, 
independent specialists."
Those submitting reports can do so in their preferred language.
"The hotline is also 
accessible to the general public."
"In 2023, the Compliance organization received a total of 595 compliance reports in this way."
"In addition, there is a so-called “speak-up inbox” at Bayer for the submission of suspected compliance 
violations."
"Alternatively, suspected violations may also be reported to the local Compliance function, 
Internal Audit, Human Resources or directly to the supervisor."
"Suspected compliance violations may also 
be reported by logging an incident request on a platform."
"Moreover, the Compliance function records and 
processes compliance violations discovered as part of monitoring activities."
"In 2023, there was a total of 
1,494 suspected compliance violations."
"Compliance violations include all possible types of infringements of internal and external requirements and 
are systematically sanctioned."
"The action taken depends on factors including the gravity of the compliance 
violation and applicable law."
"Compliance training and communications activities 
We support all employees in acting with integrity and proactively avoiding potential violations by 
implementing Bayer-wide training measures that are tailored to target groups and based on identified 
needs, flanked by communication campaigns."
"Supervisors and/or compliance managers can be consulted 
if there are any questions about lawful behavior."
"In 2023, some 95.7% of Bayer’s managerial employees worldwide completed at least one compliance 
training program."
"Overall, around 83.1% of employees took part in the global web-based training program 
on anti-corruption."
"Marketing compliance and applicability of accepted standards 
We are committed to responsible marketing practices."
"Our efforts in this regard are guided by our 
Corporate Compliance Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and rules of conduct for responsible marketing, for 
example."
"We have also put in place directives and corporate policies that are designed to prevent price fixing and 
ensure data protection."
"Various industry codes such as those of the International Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA) and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Industries and Associations (EFPIA) also apply in marketing and distribution."
"As regards the advertising of 
human pharmaceutical products, we comply with the IFPMA Code of Practice as the minimum global 
standard, along with the regulations set out in the applicable regional and national codes."
"Pharmaceuticals 
observes the applicable transparency rules (e.g., the Physician Payments Sunshine Act in the United 
States) and participates in voluntary programs such as the EFPIA Disclosure Code."
"As set out in this code of conduct, our company did not make any donations to political parties, politicians 
or candidates for political office in 2023."
"Effective January 1, 2022, we abolished our applicable exemption 
for the United States, meaning that we no longer donate directly as a company."
"However, one special 
aspect continues to apply: employees can make private donations in support of political nominees at the 
federal level through so-called “political action committees.” These voluntary donations are made only by 
employees, not the company."
"Decisions on how the donations made through Bayer’s political action 
committee, BAYERPAC, are allocated are made by an independent committee made up of employees."
"The 
allocation criteria it applies reflect societal challenges, among other factors."
"These donations are subject to 
narrow conditions and mandatory transparency measures."
"We also apply the Bayer Societal Engagement 
(BASE) principles, which are afforded the status of a global corporate policy and serve to codify our 
standards and values to an even greater degree."
"4.3 Disclosures Pursuant to Sections 289b Through e and 
315b and c of the German Commercial Code 
The Bayer Group meets the requirements for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Sections 289 b 
through e and 315 b and c of the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"The relevant disclosures pertaining to 
the nonfinancial statement in accordance with the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive Implementation 
Act (CSR-RUG) are integrated into the Management Report, with the GRI standards (Section 289d HGB) 
serving as a framework."
"The Supervisory Board fulfilled its auditing duty for the nonfinancial statement pursuant to Section 170, 
Paragraph 1 and Section 171, Paragraph 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The capital stock and the number of shares were thus unchanged 
from the end of the previous year."
Each share confers one voting right.
"A small number of shares may be 
subject to temporary trading restrictions, such as retention periods, in connection with employee stock 
participation programs."
"We received no notifications in 2023 of direct or indirect holdings of shares in 
Bayer AG that exceed 10% of the capital stock."
"The company thus is not in possession of any notifications 
of holdings that exceed 10% of the capital stock."
"The appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Management are subject to the provisions of 
Sections 84 and 85 of the German Stock Corporation Act, Section 31 of the German Codetermination 
Act and Section 6 of the company’s Articles of Incorporation."
"Pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 1 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Board of Management are appointed and dismissed 
by the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board may appoint one member of the Board of Management 
to be the Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) pursuant to Section 84, Paragraph 2 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act and Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Incorporation."
"Pursuant to 
Section 84, Paragraph 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board must grant a 
Board of Management member’s request to revoke their appointment to the Board of Management in 
certain cases, and must also guarantee that member’s reappointment after certain periods."
"Since 
Bayer AG falls within the scope of the German Codetermination Act, Section 31 of that act governs the 
voting majority required for the appointment or dismissal of members of the Board of Management as 
well as the voting procedure within the Supervisory Board."
"Under Section 6, Paragraph 1 of the Articles 
of Incorporation of Bayer AG, the number of members of the Board of Management is determined by the 
Supervisory Board but must be at least two."
"As a publicly listed company that is subject to the German 
Codetermination Act, Bayer AG must ensure under Section 76, Paragraph 3a of the German Stock 
Corporation Act that its Board of Management includes at least one man and one woman if the number 
of members is greater than three."
"Any amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made pursuant to Section 179 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act and Sections 10 and 17 of the Articles of Incorporation."
"Under Section 179, Paragraph 1 
of the German Stock Corporation Act, amendments to the Articles of Incorporation require a resolution of 
the Stockholders’ Meeting."
"Pursuant to Section 179, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act, 
this resolution must be passed by a majority of three-quarters of the voting capital represented at the 
meeting, unless the Articles of Incorporation provide for a different majority."
"However, where an 
amendment relates to a change in the object of the company, the Articles of Incorporation may only 
specify a larger majority."
"Pursuant to Section 10, Paragraph 9 of the 
Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may resolve on amendments to the Articles of 
Incorporation that relate solely to their wording."
"The Annual Stockholders’ Meeting held on April 26, 2019, resolved that the Board of Management be 
authorized to purchase and dispose of own shares representing up to 10% of the capital stock existing at 
the time the resolution was adopted."
"This authorization expires on April 25, 2024."
"The authorization to 
purchase own shares also includes the purchase of own shares using put or call options (derivatives) up to 
a volume of 5% of the capital stock existing at the time the resolution was adopted or at the time the 
authorization is exercised."
"Stockholders’ subscription rights may be excluded, depending on the purpose 
for which the purchased own shares are to be used."
This facility is available until December 2025.
"The participating banks are entitled to terminate 
the credit facility in the event of a change of control at Bayer and demand repayment of any loans that may 
have been granted under this facility up to that time."
"A similar clause is contained in the terms of a 
syndicated credit facility amounting to €3 billion that was fully drawn by Bayer AG in May 2022 and fully 
repaid in December 2023."
"In 2018, Bayer Capital Corporation B."
"issued a bond with a nominal volume of €5 billion and Bayer US 
Finance II LLC issued, in 144A/RegS format, a US$15 billion bond and another US$5.7 billion bond."
"All 
three bonds are guaranteed by Bayer AG."
"As of December 31, 2023, the original US$15 billion bond had an outstanding 
amount of US$9 billion, the original US$5.7 billion bond had an outstanding amount of US$4.7 billion and 
the original €5 billion bond had an outstanding amount of €3.3 billion."
"The terms of the €3 billion note issued by Bayer under its Debt Issuance Program in 2023, the full amount 
of which was outstanding as of December 31, 2023, also contain a corresponding change-of-control 
clause associated with a deterioration of the credit rating within 120 days."
"In the case of the US$5.75 billion bond, the period for 
a potential deterioration of Bayer AG’s credit rating is only 60 days."
"In the event of a change of control, members of the Board of Management are entitled to a severance 
payment of 250% of annual base compensation if certain narrow conditions are met."
"The payment is 
limited to the compensation for the remaining term of the contract, capped at twice the annual 
compensation."

"Information on Bayer AG 
Business lease agreements exist between Bayer AG on the one hand, and Bayer CropScience AG and 
Bayer Pharma AG – the former parent companies of the divisions Crop Science and Pharmaceuticals – on 
the other."
"Bayer AG as lessee manages these two companies’ operational businesses on the basis of 
these agreements."
"In addition to its holding company function, Bayer AG thus also performs the parent 
company functions with respect to the two divisions."
"Bayer AG is a generator and supplier of utilities at multiple locations and thus an energy utility as defined in 
Section 3, No."
18 of the German Energy Industry Act (EnWG).
"Since utility supply networks are operated 
by a subsidiary, Bayer AG also constitutes a vertically integrated energy utility under Section 3, No."
"However, regarding its own activities, it is only subject to the separate accounting obligation 
and not the obligation to prepare activity reports."
"The financial statements of Bayer AG are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"Because the company is an integrated energy utility, 
the provisions of Section 6b of the EnWG are also observed."
"As expected, sales declined in the 
Pharmaceuticals Division, where the performance of the main product Xarelto™ was weaker than 
projected."
"This was offset by some products exceeding expectations, especially our new product 
Kerendia™ as well as Adempas™."
"Sales from the internal charging-on of costs for services remained level 
and internal sales at Crop Science slightly exceeded expectations."
"There was an operating loss of roughly €1.3 billion, which was €1.2 billion 
narrower than planned."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

Sales of Bayer AG declined by about 3% to €15,961 million in 2023 (2022: €16,470 million)."
"Sales at the Crop Science Division came in at €4,994 million, exceeding the prior-year level (2022: 
€4,817 million)."
"This positive business performance was attributable to higher prices for crop protection 
products."
"Intra-Group sales rose to €4,584 million (2022: €4,434 million)."
"External sales also improved, 
coming in at €410 million (2022: €383 million), mainly due to the expansion of business at SeedGrowth."
"The Fungicides and Insecticides business units saw sales rise to €2,111 million (2022: €1,897 million) and 
€857 million (2022: €843 million), respectively, in 2023, while sales at Herbicides fell to €1,263 million 
(2022: €1,341 million)."
"On a regional level, sales climbed to €2,300 million (2022: €2,021 million) in 
Europe/Middle East/Africa and €1,168 million (2022: €1,114 million) in North America, mainly due to the 
increase in sales at the SeedGrowth and Fungicides business units."
"Sales in the Asia/Pacific and Latin 
America regions declined to €986 million (2022: €1,117 million) and €540 million (2022: €565 million), 
respectively, largely due to lower sales at Fungicides and SeedGrowth."
"The Pharmaceuticals Division posted a decline in sales to €9,732 million (2022: €10,383 million)."
"Intra-
Group sales fell to €8,881 million (2022: €9,475 million) and external sales to €851 million (2022: 
€908 million)."
"The decline in Xarelto™ sales to €3,289 million (2022: €3,753 million) was primarily due to 
lower demand in Russia."
"The decline in Adempas™ sales to €572 million (2022: €648 million) was 
attributable to lower demand due to an inventory-related effect in 2022 in the United States, and the 
decline in Adalat™ sales to €401 million (2022: €674 million) was mainly attributable to tender procedures 
in China."
"The increase in Kerendia™ sales to €335 million (2022: €102 million) was primarily due to the 
product’s launch in the United States in 2021 and the resulting increase in demand."
"On a regional level, 
sales at the Pharmaceuticals Division declined to €4,655 million (2022: €4,937 million) in Europe/Middle 
East/Africa, largely due to lower demand for Xarelto™ in Russia."
"The decline in sales in North America to 
€2,233 million (2022: €2,301 million) was mainly attributable to lower demand for Adempas™, although 
this was largely offset by increased demand for Kerendia™."
"Sales in Asia/Pacific decreased to 
€2,330 million (2022: €2,711 million), mainly as a result of weaker demand for Adalat™ in China."
"The 
increase in sales in Latin America to €514 million (2022: €434 million) was primarily driven by higher 
demand for Xarelto™."
"Sales at Enabling Functions fell to €1,235 million (2022: €1,270 million)."
"Other operating income dropped to €3,731 million (2022: €4,294 million), due especially to the decline in 
exchange gains to €2,930 million (2022: €3,852 million)."
"In addition, an insurance claim resulted in 
compensation of €200 million."
"The cost of materials decreased by around 3% year on year to €11,204 million (2022: €11,597 million)."
"Personnel expenses declined to €2,340 million (2022: €3,431 million), primarily due to lower expenses for 
company pension plans as a result of modified pension trend assumptions, as well as reduced provisions 
for variable compensation components."
"Other operating expenses fell to €7,580 million (2022: €8,637 million)."
"These effects were partly offset by an 
increase in rental and leasing expenses to €445 million (2022: €357 million) and a rise in expenses for 
impairment losses on receivables to €78 million (2022: €7 million)."
"Research and development expenses, consisting of related personnel and nonpersonnel costs within the 
respective expense item, amounted to €2,532 million (2022: €2,520 million)."
"Of the total expenses, 
€677 million (2022: €747 million) was attributable to the Crop Science Division and €1,855 million (2022: 
€1,773 million) to the Pharmaceuticals Division."
"The decline at Crop Science was due to a decrease in the 
intra-Group charging-on of costs, while the increase at Pharmaceuticals was mainly attributable to projects 
in advanced clinical development."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were 4,577 employees (FTEs) working

in research and development."
"Research and development expenses corresponded to a 16% (2022: 15%) 
share of sales."
"The company recorded an operating loss of €1,327 million for 2023 (2022: €3,074 million)."
"The balance of income and expenses from investments in affiliated companies was €7,126 million (2022: 
€9,257 million), and thus down year on year."
"Dividends and similar income from subsidiaries rose 
significantly to €1,104 million (2022: €291 million)."
"This development was mainly attributable to the 
dividend payment of €1,000 million by Bayer Hispania, S.L.U., Spain (2022: €0 million)."
"The balance of 
income and expenses from profit and loss transfer agreements with subsidiaries improved to 
€2,092 million (2022: minus €601 million)."
"This was driven by the profit transferred by Bayer Pharma AG 
(€1,759 million; 2022: €120 million) – due mainly to higher profit and loss transfers and the sale of 
investments in affiliated companies – and the profit transferred by Neunte Bayer VV GmbH (€604 million; 
2022: minus €785 million)."
"Net interest expense in 2023 declined to €622 million (2022: €1,199 million), largely due to effects from the 
unwinding of the discount on pension and noncurrent personnel-related commitments and the 
development of plan assets."
"The balance of income/expense from the unwinding of discount and the 
development of plan assets improved to €439 million (2022: minus €1,210 million)."
"This mainly reflected 
the balance of income from plan assets of Bayer Pension Trust e."
"(BPT) (€531 million; 2022: expense of 
€970 million), which was due to the favorable development of the fair value of the assets held by BPT, and 
interest expense from the unwinding of discount on pension provisions (€92 million, 2022: €240 million)."
"The balance of other financial expenses and other financial income was positive, at €22 million (2022: 
minus €27 million)."
"In 2023, the company generated income of €5,199 million before income taxes (2022: €4,957 million)."
"After deduction of €49 million (2022: €193 million) in taxes, net income amounted to €5,150 million (2022: 
€4,764 million)."
"After allocating €2,575 million of this net income to other retained earnings, the 
distributable profit amounted to €2,575 million."

"Noncurrent assets climbed to €85,457 million overall (2022: €82,799 million)."
"Intangible assets and

"Financial assets increased to €85,069 million (2022: €82,438 million)."
"Loans to subsidiaries declined by €1,525 million to 
€12,441 million, mainly due to a €1,424 million repayment by Bayer CropScience AG."
"The €125 million 
decrease in other loans to €1,354 million resulted from Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG repaying portions of its 
effective initial fund (€126 million)."

"Accounts receivable from subsidiaries, which mainly comprised loan 
receivables and receivables under profit and loss transfer agreements, fell to €1,525 million (2022: 
€5,388 million)."
"The increase in other assets to €680 million (2022: €426 million) largely resulted from 
higher tax receivables."
"Holdings of marketable securities declined to €1,328 million (2022: €3,652 million) 
due to the sale of euro and US dollar investments with indefinite maturities."
"Equity rose by €2,792 million to €36,042 million (2022: €33,250 million)."
"Provisions fell to €5,460 million (2022: €6,947 million)."
"The provisions recognized for the excess of pension 
liabilities over plan assets declined to €3,232 million (2022: €3,676 million)."
"This change was partly 
attributable to an increase in fund assets due to the favorable development of the fair value of the assets 
held by BPT, and lower obligations from pension entitlements due to modified pension trend assumptions."
"Provisions for taxes fell to €488 million (2022: €630 million), primarily due to the change in provisions for 
income taxes not yet finally assessed."
"Miscellaneous provisions fell to €1,740 million (2022: 
€2,641 million), with personnel-related provisions decreasing to €1,032 million (2022: €1,513 million)."
"This 
was mainly attributable to a decline in provisions for variable compensation components to €146 million 
(2022: €410 million), and a decrease in provisions for personnel-related restructuring measures to 
€615 million (2022: €750 million)."
"Other miscellaneous provisions fell to €708 million (2022: €1,128 million), 
mainly due to a decline in provisions for the assumption of costs for restructuring measures to €97 million 
(2022: €459 million), and a decrease in provisions for impending losses to €453 million (2022: 
€589 million)."
"Liabilities and deferred income – net of deductible receivables – fell to €55,698 million (2022:

"Liabilities to banks declined from €3,000 million to €27 million (2022: €3,009 million), mainly due to the 
repayment of loans."
"The decline in trade accounts payable to €2,118 million (2022: €2,164 million) mainly 
pertained to trade accounts payable to subsidiaries."
"Payables to subsidiaries fell to €34,814 million (2022: 
€40,579 million), largely due to a decline in loans to €32,468 million (2022: €36,107 million)."
"Miscellaneous 
liabilities rose to €803 million (2022: €521 million), mainly because of additions to commercial paper."

"Intra-Group financial obligations 
decreased by €1,794 million to €38,445 million, with short-term loans accounting for €4,485 million of this 
figure, the increase in liabilities from call deposits for €1,845 million, and higher loan liabilities for €846 
million."
"Liabilities to third parties rose by €677 million to €18,332 million, with the €3,361 million increase in 
liabilities for bonds to €17,911 million partially offset by the €2,982 million decline in loans from banks to 
€27 million, as the primary factor."

debt increased to €52,440 million (2022: €50,621 million) after deduction of €4,337 million (2022:

"Our strategy is subject to regular review to ensure adjustments can be made to reflect changes that arise 
across the economic and political landscape."
"We are currently working on a radical realignment of our 
operating model as a top priority."
"This new model, which we call Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), will 
put patients, farmers and consumers front and center, while also accelerating the pace of innovation and 
unlocking the potential of each and every employee."
"The DSO model envisages that our employees work in 
small, self-managed teams that are focused on a customer or a product."
"Activities are prioritized on the 
basis of their contribution to the mission, and progress is measured in short, 90-day cycles, giving us 
much greater agility."
It also enables us to eliminate coordination work and reduce management layers.
"Personnel-related expenses for termination agreements in connection with the transformation are taken 
into account in the forecast."
"Bayer AG is expected to generate sales of approximately €15.5 billion and an operating loss of around 
€2.5 billion in 2024."
"These figures include Bayer AG’s own operational business and the businesses leased 
from Bayer CropScience AG and Bayer Pharma AG."
"For Bayer AG, we expect slight sales declines for Xarelto™ and Adalat™ in the Pharmaceuticals Division in 
2024, which will be also reflected in operating earnings."
"Sales from the intra-Group charging-on of services 
will be at approximately the same level as in 2023."
"Internal sales in the Crop Science Division will also 
decline slightly, which will additionally lead to a slight deterioration in operating earnings."
"In addition, the 
earnings of most German subsidiaries are transferred directly to Bayer AG under profit and loss transfer 
and control agreements."
"On account of the interdependencies between Bayer AG and its subsidiaries, the 
outlook for the Bayer Group thus largely also reflects the expectations for Bayer AG."
"Bayer AG plans to 
amend its dividend policy to pay out the legally required minimum in 2024."

"In May 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows) and IFRS 7 (Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures) with a new disclosure requirement for supplier finance arrangements."
"These 
amendments to IAS 7 add a disclosure requirement stating that a company must disclose information on 
its supplier finance arrangements that enables users of its financial statements to assess the impact of 
these arrangements on the company’s liabilities and cash flows."
"In addition, IFRS 7 was amended to add 
supplier finance arrangements as an example within the requirement to disclose information about a 
company’s exposure to concentration of liquidity risk."
"To meet this disclosure requirement, Bayer will 
report the relevant information for any supplier finance arrangements of material importance for the Bayer 
Group."
"The changes are not expected to significantly affect the presentation of the Bayer Group’s financial 
position or results of operations."
"The applicable further requirements of Section 315e of the German Commercial Code 
were also taken into account."
The consolidated financial statements were drawn up in euros.
"Except where otherwise indicated, amounts 
are stated in millions of euros (€ million) and rounded to the nearest million."
"Adding the individual figures 
may therefore not always result in the exact total given."
"In the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial position, 
statement of cash flows and statement of changes in equity, certain items are combined for the sake of 
clarity."
These are explained in the Notes.
"The income statement was prepared using the cost-of-sales 
method."
Assets and liabilities are classified by maturity.
"They are regarded as current if they mature within 
one year or within the normal business cycle, which usually does not exceed one year, or are held for sale."
"The normal business cycle is defined for this purpose as beginning with the procurement of the resources 
necessary for the production process and ending with the receipt of cash or cash equivalents as 
consideration for the sale of the goods or services produced in that process."
"Inventories and trade 
accounts receivable and payable are always presented as current items."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
and pension provisions are always presented as noncurrent items."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 
141
The financial statements of the individual companies consolidated are prepared according to uniform 
recognition and measurement methods."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management must make certain assumptions and 
estimates that may substantially impact the presentation of the Group’s financial position and/or results of 
operations."
"Essential estimates and assumptions that may affect reporting in the various item categories of the 
financial statements are described in the following sections of this Note."
"Estimates are based on historical 
experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under given circumstances."
"They are 
continually reviewed but may vary from the actual values."
"New or revised financial reporting standards often contain options regarding the first-time application of 
new recognition and measurement methods."
"The income statement for the previous year and the opening 
statement of financial position for that year may be adjusted depending on the option Bayer exercises."
"For 
further information on the standards applied for the first time as of January 1, 2023, see Note [2]."
"Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates."
"The financial statements of the individual companies consolidated are prepared as of the closing date of 
the Group financial statements."
"If financial statements of joint ventures and associates have a different 
closing date, adjustments are made for material transactions or events between that date and the closing 
date of the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group."
"Subsidiaries are companies over which Bayer AG is currently able to exercise power by virtue of existing 
rights."
"Power means the ability to direct the relevant activities that significantly affect a company’s 
profitability."
"Control is therefore only deemed to exist if Bayer AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with a company and has the ability to use its power over that company to 
affect the amount of that company’s returns."
"The ability to control another company generally derives from 
Bayer AG’s direct or indirect ownership of a majority of the voting rights."
"In the case of structured entities, 
however, control is based on contractual agreements."
"Inclusion of an entity’s accounts in the consolidated 
financial statements begins when the Bayer Group is able to exercise control over the entity and ceases 
when it is no longer able to do so."
"A joint operation or a joint venture exists where the Bayer Group controls an entity’s activities jointly with a 
third party on the basis of a contractual agreement and decisions about the relevant activities require the 
unanimous consent of the parties sharing control."
"The parties to a joint operation have rights to the assets, 
and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement."
"The Bayer Group recognizes its share of the 
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with its 
rights and obligations."
"The parties jointly controlling a joint venture have rights to the net assets of the 
arrangement."
Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
"Associates are companies over 
which Bayer Group companies hold a voting interest of between 20% and 50% or for which there are 
relevant indicators of significant influence."
They also are accounted for using the equity method.
"The 
carrying amount of a company accounted for using the equity method is adjusted monthly by the change 
in its equity corresponding to Bayer’s percentage interest in the company."
"Differences arising upon first-
time inclusion using the equity method are accounted for according to full-consolidation principles."
"Bayer’s 
share of changes – recognized in profit or loss – in these companies’ equity, including impairment losses 
recognized on goodwill, are reflected in equity-method income/loss."
"Gains and losses from the sale 
of investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in equity-method income/loss."
"Interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates that do not have a material impact on the Group’s 
financial position or results of operations, either individually or in aggregate, are not consolidated but 
recognized as financial investments in equity instruments."
"Foreign currency translation 
The assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that do not use the euro as their functional currency are 
translated into euros at closing rates."
"All changes occurring during the year and all income and expense 
items and cash flows are translated into euros at average monthly rates."
"For subsidiaries with a 
hyperinflationary functional currency, currencies are always translated at the respective closing rates."
"Equity components are translated at the historical exchange rates prevailing at the respective dates of 
their first-time recognition in Group equity."
"When a company is deconsolidated, 
such exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognized in other operating 
income/expenses."
"On the date of first-time 
application, the adjustment of the carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets and liabilities was recognized 
in equity based on the general price index."
The effects in initial accounting are immaterial for the Group.
"Gains and losses incurred from the current hyperinflation of nonmonetary assets and liabilities and of 
equity are recognized in the income statement as other operating income and expenses."
"In Argentina, hyperinflation is based on the index “IPC Nacional Empalme IPIM” (2017=100) with an index 
value of 3,533 as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 1,135), and an annual inflation rate of 211% 
(2022: 95%)."
"In Turkey, hyperinflation is based on the “Consumer price index (2003=100)” with an index 
value of 1,859 as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 1,128), and an annual inflation rate of 65% 
(2022: 64%)."
"Foreign currency measurement 
Monetary items, such as receivables and liabilities, that are denominated in currencies other than a 
Group company’s functional currency are measured at closing rates."
"Related exchange differences are 
recognized as exchange gains or losses under other financial income or expenses."
"Sales, refund liabilities, right-of-return assets and contract liabilities 
All revenues derived from the selling of products, rendering of services or from licensing agreements are 
recognized as sales."
"Revenues are based on customer contracts and the performance obligations 
contained therein, which are individually identified and may be presented separately for the purpose of 
revenue recognition."
"Revenues are recognized in profit or loss when or as soon as the entity transfers 
control of goods or services to a customer either over time or at a point in time."
"Control lies with the 
customer if the customer can independently determine the use of, and consume the benefit derived from, 
a product or service."
"Revenues from product deliveries are recognized at a point in time based on an 
overall assessment of the existence of a right to payment, the allocation of ownership rights, the transfer of 
physical possession, the transfer of risks and rewards, and acceptance by the customer."
"In the case of 
product deliveries undertaken by the Bayer Group, the transfer of risks and rewards and the right to 
determine the product shipment destination are particularly important."
"Depending on the transfer of 
control, revenues from services are recognized either at a point in time or over the period of time when 
services are rendered and in accordance with a reasonable measure of progress."
"Net sales are limited to the amount the Bayer Group expects to receive for the fulfillment of performance 
obligations."
Payment components to be withheld for third parties are deducted.
"Sales are therefore 
reduced by sales taxes and by actual and expected sales deductions resulting from rebates, discounts 
and bonuses."
"Furthermore, sales are reduced by the amount of the refund liability for expected returns of 
defective goods or of saleable products that may be returned under contractual arrangements, with this 
reduction taking place at the date of revenue recognition or when a reliable estimate can be made."
"Refund 
liabilities are recognized for expected sales deductions and product returns."
"Sales deductions and refund 
liabilities are estimated primarily on the basis of historical experience, specific contractual terms, price 
information and thus future expectations of sales development."
"The underlying assumptions applied for 
refund liabilities are reviewed at each closing date and revised where necessary."
"For 
unilaterally fulfilled customer contracts where more than one year passes between performance and 
payment, significant financing components are accounted for separately based on their present values and 
the subsequent unwinding of the discount."
"The underlying discount rate takes into account the individual 
credit risk of the contracting party that receives the financing."
"Revenues from contracts involving noncash 
consideration, such as exchange transactions, are measured at the fair value of the assets received or the 
right to receive them."
"Some of the Bayer Group’s revenues are generated on the basis of licensing agreements under which third 
parties have been granted the right to use or access products and technologies."
"A right-to-use license is 
characterized by the underlying technology remaining essentially unchanged over the period for which the 
rights are granted."
"With a right-to-access license, by contrast, the customer’s interest is directed toward 
the consistent further development of that intellectual property."
"Revenues from right-to-use licenses are 
recognized at a specific point in time, while those from right-to-access licenses are recognized over time 
according to the underlying measure of progress."
"Milestone payments related to right-to-access licenses 
are allocated to satisfied and unsatisfied portions of the underlying performance obligation, as applicable."
Consideration relating to already satisfied obligations is recognized as catch-up adjustments to revenue.
Payment elements still to be earned are deferred as contract liabilities.
"Sales- or usage-based royalties 
agreed in connection with outlicensing arrangements are only recognized if the sale or the usage is 
sufficiently verified and the underlying performance obligation has been fulfilled."
"In the Crop Science segment, Bayer conducts barter transactions in certain geographies to grant its 
customers longer payment terms while at the same time reducing the credit risk."
"For example, payment 
may be made in the form of a subsequent delivery of soybeans or corn, or crops may be pledged as 
collateral."
Any commodity-price risk that Bayer is exposed to as a result is hedged using derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in other operating income and expenses.
"If 
Bayer assumes control of goods (such as soybeans) instead of receiving a cash payment, their resale is 
accounted for in other operating income, and their derecognition in other operating expenses, since 
transactions of this nature do not form part of normal business operations."
"Research and development expenses 
Research expenses are recognized through profit or loss."
"Development expenses are only capitalized as 
internally generated intangible assets if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are met."
"These 
include sufficient certainty that the development activity will give rise to future financial cash flows that also 
cover the respective development expenses."
"Since our own development projects are often subject to 
regulatory approval procedures and other uncertainties, the conditions for the capitalization of costs 
incurred before receipt of approvals generally are not satisfied."
Development costs for internal software projects can be capitalized.
"Costs in connection with the 
implementation of cloud applications are usually recognized through profit or loss."
"If the definitions and 
recognition criteria of IAS 38 are met, which can be the case with interfaces, for example, the costs are 
capitalized as an intangible asset."
"Capitalized development expenses are recognized at the cost of 
generation and amortized over their expected useful lives."
"Impairment testing is also performed on an 
annual or event-driven basis."
"Income taxes 
Income taxes comprise the taxes levied on taxable income in the individual countries along with changes 
in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recognized in profit or loss."
"This also includes current income 
taxes resulting from tax laws that have come into force or been adopted to implement the Pillar Two Model 
Rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."
"The income 
taxes recognized are reflected at the amounts likely to be payable under the statutory regulations in force, 
or already enacted in relation to future periods, at the end of the reporting period."
"Complex tax regulations 
may give rise to uncertainties with respect to their interpretation and the amounts and timing of future 
taxable income."
"Liabilities to tax authorities that are uncertain as to their amount and the 
probability of their occurrence are recognized as tax liabilities based on reasonable estimates."
"The 
amounts recognized are based on various factors, such as experience with previous tax audits and 
differing legal interpretations by the taxable entity and the responsible tax authority."
"In compliance with IAS 12 (Income Taxes), deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position prepared 
according to IFRS and their tax bases."
"Deferred taxes are also recognized for loss carryforwards, interest 
carryforwards and tax credits that are likely to be usable."
"Based on the exception stated in IAS 12.4A, 
deferred taxes related to Pillar Two are not recognized nor is information thereon disclosed."
"Deferred tax 
assets relating to deductible temporary differences, tax credits, loss carryforwards and interest 
carryforwards are recognized where it is probable that taxable income or sufficiently taxable temporary 
differences will be available in the future to enable them to be used."
"Deferred tax liabilities are recognized 
on temporary differences taxable in the future."
"Deferred taxes are calculated at the rates which – on the 
basis of the statutory regulations in force, or already enacted in relation to future periods, as of the closing 
date – are expected to apply in the individual countries at the time of realization."
"Deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities are offset if Bayer has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities and these are levied by the same taxation authority."
"Material effects of changes in tax 
rates or tax law on deferred tax assets and liabilities are generally accounted for in the period in which the 
changes are enacted."
"Such effects are recognized in profit or loss except where they relate to deferred 
taxes that were recognized outside profit or loss, in which case they are recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity."
"Deferred and current taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless they relate to items recognized outside 
profit or loss in other comprehensive income, in which case they, too, are recognized in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity."
"The probability that deferred tax assets resulting from 
temporary differences, loss carryforwards or interest carryforwards can be used in the future is the subject 
of forecasts by the individual consolidated companies regarding their future earnings situation and other 
parameters."
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on planned dividend payments by subsidiaries.
"Where 
no dividend payment is planned for the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized on the 
difference between the proportionate net assets according to IFRS and the tax base of the investment in 
the subsidiary."
"Goodwill  
In a business combination, goodwill is capitalized at the acquisition date (see “Acquisition accounting”)."
"Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication of 
possible impairment."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 
146
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are capitalized at the acquisition date at their cost of acquisition or generation."
"Those with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following periods, except 
where their actual depletion demands a different amortization pattern."
"In addition, a review is conducted as of each closing 
date to ascertain whether there are any indications of impairment, and impairment testing may then 
potentially be performed."
"Should inlicensing result in consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property, this is capitalized as an 
intangible asset."
"If the transaction also includes research and development activities, the share of 
consideration attributable to these activities is deferred and recognized through profit and loss according 
to the utilization thereof."
"If separately capitalizable intangible assets are acquired within the scope of software projects (such as 
S/4HANA implementation), the related costs are correspondingly capitalized."
"Emission allowances meet the criteria of intangible assets and are not subject to amortization due to their 
indefinite useful life."
"If emission allowances are granted to the company free of charge by a statutory 
authority in connection with regulatory requirements, like the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), no 
amount is recognized for emission allowances."
"If more emissions are emitted than the allocated emission 
allowances permit, additional allowances are purchased and recognized as intangible assets at cost."
"Corresponding provisions are recognized in the period in which the emissions are emitted and usually 
reflect the cost of acquisition of the emission certificates."
"If the emissions in a specific period exceed the 
corresponding emission allowances, this portion of the provision is measured at the current market value 
of the allowances."
"When the allowances are retired, the intangible assets are derecognized and the 
corresponding provisions are reversed."
"If they are 
used in the production process or are intended for sale within the normal course of business, they are 
recognized in inventories."
"If the certificates are retired immediately upon acquisition for the purpose of 
offsetting, they are recognized directly in functional costs."
"Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is initially recognized at the cost of acquisition or construction plus the 
estimated amounts of any redevelopment or decommissioning costs."
"Thereafter it is depreciated by the 
straight-line method over its expected useful life, except where use-related depreciation is more 
appropriate."
"When assets are sold, closed down or scrapped, the difference between the net proceeds 
and the net carrying amount of the assets is recognized as a gain or loss in other operating income or 
expenses, respectively."
"Investment property comprises land and buildings not being used for operational or administrative 
purposes."
It is measured using the cost model.
"The fair value of this property reported in the Notes is 
primarily determined on the basis of internal valuations using the income approach, while that of 
undeveloped sites is mainly calculated using the market comparison approach."
"Impairment testing 
An impairment test is performed if there is an indication of possible impairment for an intangible asset, 
an item of property, plant and equipment, or a cash-generating unit or unit group to which goodwill has 
been allocated."
"Other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (such as the Bayer Cross trademark), 
intangible assets that are not yet available for use (such as R&D projects) and cash-generating units or 
unit groups to which goodwill has been allocated are additionally tested annually for impairment."
"A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets generating cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets."
"The Bayer Group primarily regards 
product families as well as seeds and the corresponding traits as cash-generating units and subjects them 
to impairment testing."
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting segment level.
"Impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit or unit group, 
intangible asset or item of property, plant and equipment to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of 
its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, 
an impairment loss must be recognized for the difference."
"In this case an impairment loss is first 
recognized on any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit or unit group."
"Any remaining impairment 
loss is allocated among the other noncurrent nonfinancial assets in proportion to their carrying amounts, 
unless this is prohibited under any other rule."
"The resulting expense is reflected in the operating expense 
item in which the depreciation or amortization of the respective asset is recognized."
"The same applies to 
income from impairment loss reversals."
"Impairment losses recognized on goodwill are included in other 
operating expenses."
"The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of the fair value less costs of disposal, 
taking into account the present value of the future net cash flows as market prices for the individual units 
are not normally available."
"These are forecasted on the basis of the Bayer Group’s current planning, which 
has a planning horizon of up to four years and includes exchange rate assumptions at the time of planning."
"Forecasting involves making assumptions, especially regarding future selling prices, sales volumes, costs, 
market growth rates and economic cycles."
"These assumptions are based on internal estimates along with 
external market studies."
"Where the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs of disposal, 
measurement is undertaken from the viewpoint of an independent market participant."
"Where 
the recoverable amount is the value in use, the object of valuation is measured as currently used."
"In either 
case, net cash flows beyond the planning period are determined on the basis of long-term business 
expectations using individually calculated growth rates."
"The fair value less costs of disposal is determined 
on the basis of unobservable inputs (Level 3)."

The net cash inflows are discounted at a rate equivalent to the weighted average cost of equity and debt 
capital."
"The cost 
of equity corresponds to the return expected by stockholders, while the cost of debt is based on the 
conditions on which comparable companies can obtain long-term financing."
"Both components are derived 
from capital market information."
"This could lead to the recognition of additional impairment losses in the future or – except in the case of 
goodwill – to reversals of previously recognized impairment losses."
"Leases 
A lease is established by a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a 
period of time in exchange for consideration."
"As lessee, Bayer generally recognizes the present value of the future lease payments as a financial liability."
The lease payments are split into principal and interest portions according to the effective-interest method.
"In line with this and taking into account any further cost components, the right-of-use asset (the asset that 
reflects the right to use the underlying asset) is capitalized under property, plant and equipment at the 
inception of the lease."
"The right-of-use asset is recognized at amortized cost and depreciated by the 
straight-line method."
"Use is made of the recognition exemptions for certain leases in which the underlying assets are of low 
value and also for short-term leases."
"The lease payments under these contracts are recognized as other 
operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
"Bayer exercises the accounting policy option under IFRS 16 (Leases) available for lessees not to apply this 
standard to leases of intangible assets."
"For certain contracts with both lease and nonlease components, Bayer as lessee applies the practical 
expedient not to separate these components but to recognize them collectively as a single lease 
component."
"Payments under intra-Group leases are generally presented as expenses or income in segment reporting in 
line with the internal reporting system."
"Lease contracts in which Bayer acts as the lessor and substantially all the risks and rewards of utilizing the 
underlying asset are transferred to the lessee are classified as finance leases."
"The net investment in the 
lease is recognized as a receivable."
"In the case of operating leases where Bayer is the lessor, the leased 
assets continue to be capitalized, and the lease payments are recognized in income on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term."

Financial assets 
Financial assets comprise receivables, acquired equity and debt instruments, cash and cash equivalents, 
and derivatives with positive fair values."
"A financial asset is initially recognized on the settlement date at fair 
value, plus transaction costs in most cases."
"The classification and measurement of financial assets is based in each case on the business model and 
the characteristics of the cash flows."
"Equity instruments 
are generally held for medium- to long-term strategic purposes and are therefore measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income."
"Otherwise, they are measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
like for example the shares in Century Therapeutics, Inc., United States, and Pyxis Oncology, Inc., United 
States."
"Under the simplified impairment model, a default on receivables measured at amortized cost using the 
effective-interest method that is expected over the respective term (stage 2 of the impairment model) is 
determined for trade accounts receivable based on portfolio-specific default rates."
"These expected default 
rates are mainly based on the average defaults on receivables in recent years."
"These default rates are 
adjusted during the year for the respective customer portfolio if a significant change in the default rate is 
expected in the future."
"In determining the expected default rates, we take into account the business 
model, the respective customer and the economic environment of the geographic region."
"This is achieved 
by applying specific default rates for the individual Group companies and, in the case of smaller 
companies, making a standard calculation in countries with a comparable credit risk."
"Further differentiation 
is achieved by taking into account the segments’ various customer groups."
"Throughout the Bayer Group, 
customers are also assigned to risk classes with different expected default rates depending on their 
individual credit risk assessments."
"In addition, all receivables more than 90 days past due are individually tested for 
impairment during the year."
"An impairment loss is recognized if there are objective 
indications of an impairment."
"Financial assets are derecognized when contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets 
expire or the financial assets were transferred together with all material risks and benefits."
"Receivables are 
also derecognized if they have been finally assessed as irrecoverable and we have ceased efforts to collect 
them following the completion of insolvency proceedings, for example."
"Receivables are not derecognized 
while they remain subject to enforcement."
"Inventories 
Inventories are recognized at their cost of acquisition or production (production-related full costs) – 
calculated by the weighted-average method – or at their net realizable value, whichever is lower."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 
150
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash includes cash in hand, checks received and balances with banks and companies."
"Cash equivalents 
are financial investments with maximum maturities of three months from the acquisition date that are 
subject to no more than insignificant fluctuations in value and will give rise to predefined cash inflows."
Cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortized cost.
"Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
Within the Bayer Group, post-employment benefits are provided under defined contribution and/or defined 
benefit plans."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to publicly or 
privately administered pension plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis."
"Once the 
contributions have been paid, the company has no further payment obligations."
"The regular contributions 
constitute operating expenses and as such are included in the respective income statement items."
"All remaining commitments under pension and other post-employment benefit plans are measured in terms 
of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) using the projected unit credit method, with entitlements already 
earned being measured at the present value of the DBO."
"This is based on factors such as expected future 
salary and pension increases, changes in healthcare costs, mortality rates and beneficiary structure."
"The 
uniform discount rates are based on the yields of high-quality bond portfolios (AA-rated corporate bonds) 
in specific currencies, extrapolated where necessary to cover the future period for which sufficiently 
accurate bond yields are not available."
"Where there is insufficient empirical data on corporate bond yields 
with longer-term residual maturities, the yield structure is derived from government bond yields plus 
spread to reflect the higher risk of default."
"The bond portfolios consist of bonds with weighted residual 
maturities approximately equal to the duration of the expected disbursements from the pension plans."
"The 
pension service cost and the net interest on the net liability are determined on the basis of the 
assumptions as of the previous closing date."
"For funded obligations, the net liability is determined by deducting the fair value of plan assets."
"The 
obligations and plan assets are measured at regular intervals."
"Where no quoted prices for plan assets exist 
in active markets, their fair values are determined by applying the usual measurement methods and on the 
basis of freely accessible data such as interest rate curves and credit spreads."
"The net defined benefit 
asset is recognized in other receivables."
Current and past service cost and effects of plan settlements are recognized in operating income.
"The net interest on the net liability is reflected in the financial result under other financial income and 
expenses."
"The effects of remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are reflected in the statement 
of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income."
"They consist of actuarial gains and losses, the 
return on plan assets and changes in the effects of the asset ceiling, less the amounts included in net 
interest and related deferred taxes."
"Other provisions  
Other provisions are recognized for present legal and constructive obligations arising from past events that 
will probably give rise to a future outflow of resources, provided that a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligations."
"They are established at the present value of the expected future cash outflows 
and recognized in the respective operating expense items."
"The interest cost is reflected in the financial 
result under other financial income and expenses."
"If the projected obligation declines as a result of a 
change in the estimate, the provision is reversed by the corresponding amount and the resulting income 
recognized in the operating expense item(s) in which the original charge was recognized."
"If changes in the estimates require the provisions to be 
adjusted, the carrying amounts of the respective assets are reduced or increased accordingly."
"Estimating the future costs for environmental protection and similar measures involves, in particular, 
uncertainties with regard to the applicable laws and regulations and the actual local conditions."
"Changes in these 
assumptions could impact future reported results of the Group."
"Taking into consideration the experience 
gained to date and the knowledge and circumstances as of the closing date, provisions are believed to be 
adequate."
"However, material additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that result in 
additional expenses in subsequent periods."
"Provisions for employee termination benefits are established where the amounts of severance payments, 
additional pension plan modules to be granted or other benefits can be reliably estimated."
"However, 
material additional costs could be incurred beyond the amounts accrued that result in additional expenses 
in subsequent periods."
"Obligations arising from stock-based programs that involve cash settlement pursuant to IFRS 2 (Share-
based Payment) are covered by provisions in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of 
the closing date."
All resulting changes in value are recognized in profit or loss.
Provisions for litigations are established under certain conditions in the case of legal risks.
"Litigations and 
other judicial proceedings often raise complex issues and are subject to many uncertainties and 
complexities including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the 
jurisdiction in which each suit is brought and differences in applicable law."
"The outcome of any current or 
future proceedings cannot normally be predicted."
"It is particularly difficult to assess the likely outcomes of 
class actions for damages or mass compensation claims in the United States, which may give rise to 
significant financial risks for the Bayer Group."
"The Bayer Group considers the need for accounting measures in respect of pending or future litigations, 
and the extent of any such measures, on the basis of the information available to its legal department and 
in close consultation with legal counsel acting for the Bayer Group."
"Where it is more likely than not that 
such a litigation will result in an outflow of resources that is already reasonably estimable, a provision for 
litigation is recorded in the amount of the present value of the expected cash outflows."
"Such provisions 
cover the estimated payments to the plaintiffs, court and procedural costs, attorney costs and the cost of 
potential settlements."
"It is sometimes impossible to reliably determine the existence of a present obligation or reasonably 
estimate the probability that a potential outflow of resources will result from a pending or future litigation."
The status of the material “legal risks” is described in Note [30].
"Due to the special nature of these 
litigations, provisions generally are not established until initial settlements allow an estimate of potential 
amounts or judgments have been issued."
"Provisions for legal defense costs are established if it is probable 
that material costs will have to be incurred for external legal counsel to defend the company’s legal 
position."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 
152
Internal and external legal counsel evaluate the current status of the Bayer Group’s material legal risks at 
the end of each reporting period."
"The need to establish or adjust a provision and the amount of the 
provision or adjustment are determined on this basis."
"Adjusting events are reflected up to the date of 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements."
"The measurement of provisions in the case of class 
actions or mass compensation claims is mainly based on any settlements reached during the past year 
and on pending or anticipated future claims."
"Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost using the effective-interest method."
"Derivatives with negative fair values, liabilities for contingent consideration in business combinations and 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value."
"Financial liabilities are derecognized when the contractual obligation is discharged or canceled, or has 
expired."
"Supply chain financing programs (also known as reverse factoring) are used in the Bayer Group that 
enable suppliers to choose to have individual invoices paid prior to their due date."
"As part of such 
programs, the supplier concludes a financing agreement with a bank or platform operator without Bayer’s 
involvement and, upon request, is paid the invoice amount by the bank in advance less an interest 
component."
"Bayer generally pays the invoice amount to the bank when due; the payment deadlines lie 
within the usual scope for the industry."
"Bayer has assessed these programs based on various criteria and 
concluded that the associated liabilities retain the character of trade accounts payable."
"The related 
payments to the bank are therefore classified as a cash outflow from operating activities."
"Derivatives 
The Bayer Group uses derivatives to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates, interest rates or 
commodity prices (such as for soybeans and corn) and to hedge the stock-based compensation programs 
issued until 2020."
"The instruments used include forward exchange contracts, interest-rate swaps, forward 
commodity contracts and forward stock transactions."
"Derivatives are recognized at the trade date and are 
remeasured to fair value on each closing date."
"Positive fair values are reflected in financial assets, negative 
fair values in financial liabilities."
"Contracts for the purchase and sale of nonfinancial items (such as raw material supply contracts) that are 
concluded for the company’s own purposes are treated as pending transactions (own-use exemption) and 
not accounted for as derivatives."
"Other contracts for the purchase and sale of nonfinancial items are 
accounted for as derivatives at fair value through profit or loss under certain conditions (such as 
nonfulfillment of own-use exemption)."
"Where embedded derivatives are identified in contracts, they are assessed for any close economic 
relationship with the host contract."
"If no such relationship is found, they are accounted for separately as 
derivatives."
"Embedded derivatives that are contained in financial assets are not separated; instead, the 
entire instrument is measured at fair value through profit and loss."
Such host contracts are generally sale or purchase agreements relating to the operational business.
"The 
embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from the contracts to vary with exchange-rate or price 
fluctuations, for example."
"The internal measurement of embedded derivatives is performed using 
appropriate valuation models, such as discounted cash flow models, which are based on unobservable 
inputs (Fair Value Level 3)."
"The relevant models include planned sales and purchase volumes, and prices 
derived from market data."
"Fair value changes over the contract term are recognized in other operating 
income or expenses."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Bayer Group 
153
Derivatives are recognized at fair value through profit or loss unless they qualify for hedge accounting."
"This 
mainly applies to the exchange hedging of accounting risks, the effects of which are reflected in other 
financial income and expenses as exchange gains or losses."
"The effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is initially recognized outside profit or 
loss in other comprehensive income."
Any ineffective portions are recognized directly in profit or loss.
"Only 
when the hedged item is recognized through profit or loss is the effective portion of the hedging instrument 
also recognized in the income statement."
"In the case of commodity futures and options that hedge purchase prices, reclassification is to the cost of 
goods sold."
"For commodity futures that hedge selling prices, reclassification is to sales."
"The effects of 
interest-rate hedges are reflected in interest income or expense."
"The effects of the hedging of forecasted 
sales transactions in foreign currencies are recognized in other operating income or expenses at the time 
of revenue recognition."
"The hedging of stock-based employee compensation is recognized in the 
respective operating expense items of “Enabling Functions and Consolidation” over the duration of the 
Aspire programs."
"Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized in income along 
with the adjustments in the carrying amounts of the hedged items."
"The effects of interest-rate hedges are 
reflected in interest income or expense."
"Acquisition accounting  
An acquisition is a transaction or other event that involves the purchase of an integrated set of activities 
and assets that include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly 
contribute to the ability to create outputs."
"Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition 
method, which in principle requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their 
respective fair values on the date Bayer obtains control."
"The difference between the consideration 
transferred (plus the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree in the case of step 
acquisitions) and the fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recognized as goodwill."
"The results of foreign currency cash flow hedges are factored into the translation of foreign currency 
purchase price payments."
"For significant acquisitions, the purchase price allocation is carried out with 
assistance from independent third-party valuation specialists."
"The related valuations are based on the 
information available at the acquisition date."
"Ancillary acquisition costs are recognized as expenses in the 
periods in which they occur."
"The transferred consideration can include contingent consideration that is payable to the previous owners 
of the acquired company following the acquisition date upon reaching certain milestones, such as 
progress in the trial or regulatory approval process or surpassing certain sales thresholds."
"This is 
recognized at fair value as part of the consideration transferred for the acquired company and is generally 
recognized as a financial (purchase price) liability."
"All changes in fair value after the acquisition date are 
recognized under EBIT in the consolidated financial statements."
"However, changes in the fair value of the 
contingent consideration that are based on circumstances already existing on the date of acquisition are 
adjusted outside profit or loss within the measurement period of 12 months."
Measurement is based to a large extent on anticipated cash flows.
"If actual 
cash flows vary from those used in calculating fair values, this may materially affect the Group’s future 
results of operations."
"The acquisition costs are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities 
at the acquisition date based on their fair values."
Such a transaction or event does not result in goodwill.
"This also applies if the optional concentration test finds that the transaction in question does not constitute 
the acquisition of a business."
"Divestment accounting 
Divestments of shares in subsidiaries that result in a loss of control are generally accounted for in profit or 
loss."
"When shares in a subsidiary are gradually divested in several tranches, a reduction in the majority 
shareholding without the loss of control is reflected outside profit or loss and results in an increase in the 
equity attributable to noncontrolling interest."
"After the loss of control, the interest remaining at the time of 
the loss of control is recognized at fair value."
"Impact of the macroeconomic situation 
In 2023, Bayer was impacted particularly by the geopolitical situation, inflation and the development of 
interest rates."
"The Group’s sales and earnings as well as its financial position and results of operations were only 
marginally impacted by the war in Ukraine and its direct consequences in 2023."
"Together, Russia and 
Ukraine accounted for about 3% of our sales in 2023."
"As in the previous year, we did not register any 
major increase in past-due receivables in Russia or Ukraine."
"Based on a risk analysis conducted at the 
level of individual customers, there were no significant write-downs of receivables."
"The stability of international payment transactions involving Russia is still subject to considerable 
uncertainties, and we are continually evaluating suitable risk mitigation measures."
"There are currently no 
significant restrictions."
"We are continually analyzing the future direct and indirect effects of economic developments and sanctions 
on the valuation of individual assets and liabilities."
"The conflict in the Middle East did not have a material impact on Group sales and earnings, the financial 
position or the results of operations in 2023."
Energy procurement costs rose by around 8.7% (€74 million) year on year in 2023.
"The developments 
pertaining to LNG procurement, the further development of energy-efficiency measures, the filling of gas 
storage facilities in Germany and the easing of the situation on the gas markets currently mean that supply 
chains and our production are not impeded."
"We nevertheless continue to monitor both global-market and 
political developments."
"Beyond this, we did not see any material financial impact in 2023."
"Due to their potential impact on our financial position and results of operations, climate-related risks are 
included in our Group-wide enterprise risk management (ERM) system."
"In addition, we are conducting a 
continuous analysis of the impact of climate change on our business operations as well as activities in 
upstream and downstream value chains."
"The dimensions of climate-change impact analyzed include both 
drivers of transition effects as well as drivers of immediate and long-term physical effects."
"Physical climate-
related risks can arise as a result of longer-term shifts in general climate conditions, while transition 
climate-related risks may result for companies from the transition toward a low-carbon economy."
"The climate models we have analyzed project that, over the long term, there will be an increase in extreme 
weather conditions (such as droughts, heavy rains and storms) in terms of frequency and intensity, as well 
as a shift in climate zones."
"Potential financial consequences resulting for our sites due to climate-related 
natural events are hedged through insurance coverage to the extent customary in the industry."
"One 
example of a climate-related natural event was Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused production 
disruptions that year at our sites in Soda Springs and Luling, United States."
"We therefore received 
insurance compensation of €195 million in 2023 as a result of our property and business interruption 
insurance coverage (see Note [7])."
"In 2023, climate-related matters did not necessitate any changes to the expected useful lives of Group 
assets, such as due to changing regulatory requirements or climate-related natural events."
"Likewise, 
physical or transition-related climate risks did not lead to any significant depreciation or amortization."
"We 
are committed to continuously developing our portfolio of assets by investing in sustainable technologies in 
order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"The shift in climate zones also presents an elevated risk of crop losses and thus risks for the agricultural 
value chain as a whole."
"Weather and climate effects are of particular significance for the Crop Science 
Division and its downstream value chain in crop cultivation."
"We are working to advance climate change 
adaptation while also aiming to counteract changing environmental conditions through innovation and new 
approaches in order to help strengthen climate resilience."
"The objective is to offer solutions that put our 
customers, patients and consumers in a better position to overcome the challenges."
"Transforming our product portfolio and leveraging new business models is therefore one of the three pillars 
of our greenhouse gas reduction program (see Management Report A 1.2.1 “Strategy and Targets”)."
"Our 
efforts to support climate change adaptation can be seen in our innovative plant breeding activities, for 
example."
"Our Preceon™ Smart Corn System, for instance, produces hybrid seed varieties that grow into 
short-stature corn crops that potentially do not bend or break as easily as standard-height corn in strong 
winds or heavy rain, thus minimizing crop losses."
"Our Preceon™ Smart Corn System is set to be launched 
for the first time in 2024 and is included in our product innovation pipeline (see Management Report A 1.3 
“Focus on Innovation”)."
"Our business planning takes account of research and development expenses for 
product innovations that can help adapt our business model to the impact of climate change."
"The other two pillars of our greenhouse gas reduction program concern the continual reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions at our company and across our entire value chain to help limit global warming 
to 1.5° Celsius in accordance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement."
"As 
part of our greenhouse gas reduction program, we aim to reach net zero emissions, including throughout 
our entire value chain, by 2050 or earlier."
"We define net zero greenhouse gas emissions as a 90% 
reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) and across our value 
chain (Scope 3) compared with the 2019 baseline."
Bayer is looking to become carbon-neutral at all of its sites (Scope 1 and 2) by 2030.
"By the end of 2029, 
we aim to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations by 42% (in absolute terms) 
compared with the 2019 baseline."
"This includes direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2, market-based) 
emissions produced by Bayer sites with an annual energy consumption in excess of 1.5 terajoules."
"With respect to our value chain, our target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the relevant Scope 3 
categories by at least 12.3% (in absolute terms) by 2029 (compared with the 2019 baseline)."
"Total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
cover all categories defined in the GHG Protocol."
An important lever for achieving our climate targets is the purchase of electricity from renewable sources.
"By 2029, we aim to ensure 100% of the electricity we procure is from renewable energy sources."
"We 
therefore conclude direct supply agreements for electricity from renewable energy sources or purchase 
corresponding renewable energy credits."
"In May 2023, we announced the signing of a long-term 
structured renewable energy credit (REC) purchase agreement in the United States under which up to 
1.4 TWh of renewable energy will be generated annually and accordingly up to 1.4 million RECs can be 
acquired by us annually."
"The agreement will secure 40% of Bayer’s global and 60% of Bayer’s US-
purchased electricity demand out of renewable sources."
"The contract is designed as a contract of 
difference between fixed strike prices and energy prices."
"Full capacity is currently expected to be reached 
during 2028."
"The agreement has an expected initial term of 24 years during which RECs can be 
purchased."
"As operations of the facilities have not yet started, no RECs were purchased in 2023."
"The first 
RECs are expected to be generated, purchased and retired in 2024 (for further information, see Note [27])."
"In addition, we actively participate in the voluntary carbon market, where we both purchase carbon offsets 
from verified climate protection projects as well as provide our own carbon offsets."
"In 2023, we offset 0.6 
million metric tons of CO2 equivalents via external projects to achieve climate neutrality at our sites."
"Besides the voluntary carbon market, we also participate in mandatory emissions trading."
"For further 
information on how carbon credits and offsets are accounted for, see Note [3]."
"The Crop Science Division’s medium-term planning contains climate-related investments in connection 
with the implementation of the greenhouse gas reduction program that are also taken into account in 
impairment testing."
"Since the risks and opportunities from the impact of climate change are balanced, 
there is currently no need to revise the long-term growth rate."
"Based on currently available information, 
there are no indications that additional impairment losses will be required over and above the impairment 
losses already recognized (see Note [14])."
"We continuously monitor the risks resulting from climate-related matters and develop innovative and 
sustainable methods to minimize them."
"Based on present information and assumptions, we do not 
currently see any fundamentally changed expectations with regard to the Group’s financial position and 
results of operations."

"Segment reporting 
At Bayer, the Board of Management – as the chief operating decision maker – allocates resources to the 
operating segments and assesses their performance."
"The reportable segments and regions are identified, 
and the disclosures selected, in line with the internal financial reporting system (management approach) 
and based on the Group accounting policies outlined in Note [3]."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Bayer Group comprised the three reportable segments Crop Science, 
Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health."
"The information provided under “Enabling Functions and Consolidation” mainly relates to Group-wide 
competence centers and business support services as well as “Leaps by Bayer,” which focuses on the 
development of crucial, cross-species innovations."
"“All Other Segments” and “Enabling Functions and 
Consolidation” in the Management Report are combined under the Reconciliation."
"It also includes the 
increase or decrease in expenses for Group-wide long-term stock-based compensation (Aspire) arising 
from fluctuations in the performance of Bayer stock and other factors, and the consolidation of 
intersegment sales (2023: €57 million; 2022: €22 million)."
"Also recognized are gains and losses incurred 
upon the ongoing revaluation of nonmonetary assets and liabilities and of equity under IAS 29 for Bayer 
S.A."
"in Argentina and for Bayer Türk Kimya Sanayii Limited Sirketi, Monsanto Gida Ve Tarim Ticaret Ltd 
Sirketi and Bayer Tohumculuk ve Tarim Limited Sirketi in Turkey."
"Included here in addition are income and 
expenses resulting from certain contingent liabilities unrelated to the current business along with those 
pertaining to the comparable central functions of the acquired Monsanto Group."
"Chief among the latter are 
the matters relating to lawsuits concerning polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) referred to in Note [30],  
“Legal risks”."
"The segment data is calculated as follows:   
// The intersegment sales reflect intra-Group transactions effected at transfer prices fixed on an arm’s-
length basis."
"// The net cash provided by operating activities is the cash flow from operating activities as defined in 
IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows)."
"// Leases between fully consolidated companies continue to be recognized as operating leases under 
IAS 17 within the segment data in the consolidated financial statements of the Bayer Group even after 
the first-time application of IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019."
"This does not have any relevant impact on 
the respective key data used in the steering of the company and internal reporting to the Board of 
Management as the chief operating decision maker."
"This collaboration is included in the 
consolidated financial statements as a joint operation."
"Bayer and Merck & Co., Inc., have mutually agreed 
to collaborate on the development, production, life-cycle management and marketing of active ingredients 
and products in the field of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) modulation."
"In addition, shares in 42 (2022: 43) associates and four (2022: five) joint ventures were accounted for in 
the consolidated financial statements using the equity method."
"Details of these companies are given in 
Note [16]."
"The immaterial subsidiaries accounted for less than 0.1% of Group sales, less 
than 0.3% of equity and less than 0.2% of total assets."
"This 
information can also be accessed at www.bayer.com/shareownership2023."
"5.2 Business combinations and other acquisitions 
Acquisitions in 2023 
On February 13, 2023, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares in Blackford Analysis Ltd., 
United Kingdom, a global provider of radiology AI platform technology."
"Bayer paid an upfront consideration 
of around €46 million to acquire Blackford."
"Further amounts of up to around €54 million are payable upon 
the achievement of predefined research and development milestones."
"A liability of €30 million, weighted

"The 
purchase price mainly pertained to goodwill, which in turn largely reflected the anticipated innovation 
potential and amounted to around €68 million based on the purchase price allocation."
"In addition, an 
amount of around €10 million was recognized for patents and technologies, some €2 million for other 
assets, and approximately €7 million for liabilities."

Blackford provides platform infrastructure and access to a rich clinical application (ClinApp) ecosystem 
focused on medical imaging and analytics."
"The acquisition follows a development and license agreement 
between the two companies in 2020 that laid the foundation for Bayer’s recently launched medical imaging 
platform, Calantic™ Digital Solutions."
"The acquired companies are assigned to the Pharmaceuticals 
segment."
"Acquisitions in 2022 
On June 28, 2022, Bayer acquired 30% of the shares in Natsana GmbH, Germany, for a purchase price of 
around €96 million."
The acquired shares are accounted for using the equity method.
"Natsana is an online-
only provider focused on the sale and development of natural supplements such as vitamins, minerals, 
nutrients and probiotics."

Health segment."
"On August 1, 2022, Bayer increased its existing interest in CoverCress Inc., United States, from 5.7% to 
64.7% for a purchase price of around €111 million."
"Since the minority shareholders Bunge and Chevron 
retained extensive rights relevant to business decisions, the acquired interest is recognized as an interest 
in an associate and accounted for using the equity method."
"In addition, there is an option to acquire the 
remaining 35.3%, which is anticipated to become available from 2027."
"CoverCress™ is a rotational cash

were derived primarily from product deliveries (€43,352 million; 2022: €46,412 million) and licenses 
(€3,528 million; 2022: €3,504 million)."
"The license revenues amounted to €2,721 million (2022:

(2022: €3 million) for Consumer Health."
"Breakdowns of net sales by segment and geographical area are 
given in the overview in Note [4]."
"Sales of €2,026 million were recognized in 2023 (2022: €1,960 million) from performance obligations 
already satisfied in previous years."
"These sales primarily resulted from right-to-use licenses granted against 
sales-based royalties and from adjustments to refund liabilities for expected product returns and rebates to 
be granted."
"Contract liabilities mainly result from advance payments by customers for product deliveries and are 
predominantly recognized as sales within one year."

"The remaining amount comprised a number of individually immaterial

"For information on the legal risks and the provisions established for this purpose, see Notes [30] and [23]."
"Miscellaneous operating expenses also included expense of €15 million (2022: income of €77 million) as a 
result of the ongoing hyperinflation of nonmonetary assets and liabilities as well as equity in Argentina and 
Turkey."
"Personnel expenses and employee numbers 
Personnel expenses decreased by €1,928 million in 2023 to €10,691 million (2022: €12,619 million)."
"The decline was mainly attributable to lower provisions for variable compensation under the Group-wide 
short-term incentive (STI) program."
"The total number of employees on the closing date was 99,723 (2022: 101,369)."
"Financial result

"The deferred tax assets and liabilities were allocable to the following items in the statements of

B 11/2 
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
 
Dec."
"Of this amount, €78 million was recognized as deferred tax expense in the income statement 
and €119 million mainly as a reduction in other comprehensive income and as expenses relating to 
ongoing hyperinflation."
"The change in other comprehensive income mainly relates to the remeasurement of 
the net defined benefit liability for post-employment benefit plans."
"The use of tax loss carryforwards reduced current income taxes in 2023 by €20 million (2022: 
€422 million)."
The use of tax credits reduced current income taxes by €50 million (2022: €283 million).
"Deferred tax assets of €713 million (2022: €524 million) were recognized for the amount of tax loss and 
interest carryforwards expected to be usable."
"The use of €13,431 million of tax loss and interest 
carryforwards, including interest carryforwards of €1,934 million (2022: €12,196 million, including interest 
carryforwards of €956 million) was subject to legal or economic restrictions."
"Consequently, no deferred tax 
assets were recognized for this amount."
"The addition of usable tax loss and interest carryforwards mainly 
resulted from the measurement of loss carryforwards in the United States at the state level."
"If these tax 
loss and interest carryforwards had been fully usable, deferred tax assets of €1,410 million (2022: 
€1,115 million) would additionally have been recognized."
"Tax credits of €635 million (2022: €1,029 million) were recognized as deferred tax assets in 2023."

The use of €1,045 million (2022: €3,513 million) of deductible temporary differences was subject to legal 
or economic restrictions."
"Consequently, no deferred tax assets were recognized for this amount."
"The 
decline is mainly due to a remeasurement of the deductible temporary differences in connection with the 
settlement agreements in the United States."
"If these temporary differences had been fully usable, deferred 
tax assets of €256 million (2022: €857 million) would have been recognized."
"In 2023, subsidiaries that reported losses for 2023 or 2022 recognized net deferred tax assets totaling 
€1,922 million (2022: €2,720 million) from temporary differences, tax credits, and tax loss and interest 
carryforwards."
"These assets were considered to be unimpaired because the companies concerned were 
expected to generate taxable income in the future or sufficiently taxable temporary differences."
"Deferred tax liabilities of €106 million were recognized in 2023 (2022: €92 million) for planned dividend 
payments by subsidiaries."
"Deferred tax liabilities were not recognized for differences on €14,612 million 
(2022: €23,838 million) of retained earnings of subsidiaries because these earnings are to be reinvested 
for an indefinite period."
This average rate was determined on the basis of expected tax rates for the individual Group companies.
"The reduction in the expected tax expense year on year was largely due to the fact that tax income is 
expected due to the pre-tax loss and that the weighted, expected tax rate for countries with income led to 
additional tax relief and a higher expected tax rate."
"The €1,314 million in tax expenses from other tax effects primarily comprised effects of €1,671 million due 
to non-tax-deductible impairment losses on goodwill."
"This line item also included tax benefits from the 
utilization and initial allocation of tax credits, from an extended deduction of charitable donations and tax-
deductible indirect taxes, as well as tax expenses from tax provisions established for controlled foreign 
corporation taxation."
"The Bayer Group falls within the scope of the global minimum taxation rules (“Pillar Two”), which entered 
into force in Germany on December 28, 2023, in the form of the Minimum Tax Act (MinStG)."
"As the 
Minimum Tax Act applies for the first time for fiscal years beginning after December 30, 2023, there was 
no minimum tax exposure for the fiscal year 2023."
"The implementation of the global minimum tax rules into 
domestic legislation in other jurisdictions also did not result in any minimum tax being levied in 2023."
"Under the Minimum Tax Act, the Bayer Group must pay a top-up tax for each jurisdiction in which the 
effective tax rate is below 15%."
"Bayer will exercise this option, which, based on the 2023 fiscal 
year, would lead to the company being exempt from minimum taxation in 83% of jurisdictions."
"The top-up tax is expected to be in the double-digit millions and thus not 
material for the Bayer Group compared with the tax expense of €1,321 million in 2023."
"In order to 
preliminarily identify jurisdictions with an effective tax rate below 15%, the reported IFRS earnings before 
taxes and consolidation effects were adjusted for dividend income and goodwill impairments attributable to 
acquisitions of enterprises."
"Jurisdictions in which a pre-tax loss was reported after these adjustments were 
not included in the identification process."
"If the Pillar Two rules had already been applicable in the 2023 
reporting period, Switzerland, Cyprus and Brazil in particular would have contributed to a top-up tax."
"Income / losses attributable to noncontrolling interest 
Income attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to €6 million (2022: €19 million)."
"Losses 
attributable to noncontrolling interest amounted to €7 million (2022: €3 million)."
"Earnings per share  
Earnings per share are determined according to IAS 33 (Earnings Per Share) by dividing the net income for 
the period attributable to Bayer AG stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding shares."
"As no dilutive financial instruments were in circulation at the end of the 2022 and 2023 reporting periods, 
diluted earnings per share were equivalent to basic earnings per share."
"The amortization of trademarks and of marketing and 
distribution rights is generally reflected in selling expenses, and the amortization of production rights in the 
cost of goods sold."
"The amortization of patents and technologies is mainly included in the cost of goods 
sold or in research and development expenses."
"Acquired goodwill, research and development projects, 
and advance payments made are not subject to amortization."
"Unscheduled impairment testing was conducted in the first quarter of 2023 for the Crop Science 
segment’s cash-generating unit glyphosate after a weak start to 2023 led to revised full-year expectations, 
mainly due to significantly reduced market price expectations for glyphosate."
"In addition, lower 
expectations for volumes also had an impact."
"Impairment testing gave rise to impairment losses of 
approximately €278 million, attributable entirely to property, plant and equipment."
"The impairment losses 
were allocated to the cost of goods sold, with the respective figures determined on the basis of fair value 
less costs of disposal while applying an after-tax cost of capital rate of 11.5%."
"Impairment testing was conducted in the second quarter of 2023 in the Crop Science segment due to a 
further deterioration in business prospects and updated long-term corporate planning."
"In the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health segments, updated long-term corporate planning did not 
necessitate impairment testing."
"The unscheduled impairment testing in the Crop Science segment resulted in net impairment losses on 
intangible assets totaling €2,020 million."
"An impairment loss of €2,436 million was recognized on goodwill 
due to deteriorating business prospects overall, largely driven by significantly lower price expectations for 
glyphosate."
"The impairment loss reversal for Soybean Seed & Traits was largely 
due to reduced expectations for the cost of goods sold as a result of lower commodity prices."
"The 
impairment loss reversal for Vegetable Seeds was due to improved business prospects as a result of 
increased market penetration and growing market share in Asia."
"The impairment loss at Corn Seed & Traits was mainly driven by the 
anticipated long-term normalization of commodity prices."
"The impairment loss for Cotton Seed was 
primarily attributable to persistent competitive pressure."
"The impairment loss for glyphosate was mainly 
due to significant further declines in market price expectations."
"In addition, further reductions in 
expectations with regard to volumes also had an impact."
The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses.
"The impairment losses 
and impairment loss reversals on the assets of the cash-generating units were allocated to the cost of 
goods sold, selling expenses, and research and development expenses."
"The impairment losses and 
impairment loss reversals reflected the difference between the respective carrying amounts and their fair 
value less costs of disposal."
"Impairment testing was conducted in the third quarter of 2023 due to interest-rate developments at that 
time and their related impact on the weighted average cost of capital."
"The impairment testing did not give rise to any material impairment losses or impairment loss reversals in 
the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health segments."
"In addition, there 
were impairment losses in the cash-generating unit Soybean Seed & Traits (€330 million, comprising 
€38 million on research and development projects, €255 million on patents and technologies, €30 million 
on trademarks and €7 million on marketing and distribution rights)."
"The impairment losses on goodwill 
were recognized in other operating expenses and those on the assets of the cash-generating units were 
allocated to the cost of goods sold, selling expenses, and research and development expenses."
"The 
impairment losses were primarily attributable to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital and 
reflected the difference between the respective carrying amounts and their fair value less costs of disposal."
"Our regular annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2023 resulted in the recognition of net 
impairment loss reversals of €562 million on intangible assets in the Crop Science segment."
"This included 
€633 million in impairment losses on goodwill, which were primarily the result of a deterioration in business 
prospects, particularly in the area of crop protection, and an inflation-driven increase in costs."
"This effect 
was offset by a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital compared to the third quarter of 2023."
"These 
impairment loss reversals were mainly attributable to a decrease in the weighted average cost of capital 
compared to the third quarter of 2023."
The impairment losses on goodwill were recognized in other operating expenses.
"The impairment losses 
and loss reversals on the assets of the cash-generating units were included in the cost of goods sold, 
selling costs, and research and development expenses."
"The impairment losses and impairment loss 
reversals reflected the difference between the respective carrying amounts and their fair value less costs of 
disposal."
"The table below indicates the capital cost factors used in the impairment testing on the cash-generating 
units of the Crop Science segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the second, third and fourth quarters 
of 2023."
"In addition, impairment losses of €76 million were recognized in 2023 – on top of those 
recorded in the fourth quarter – due to the ongoing evaluation of individual research and development 
projects during the year."
"The impairment losses were allocated to selling expenses, and research and 
development expenses."
"In the Consumer Health segment, regular annual impairment testing resulted in impairment loss reversals 
totaling €153 million on trademarks, of which €116 million pertained to the Claritin™ (allergy business) and 
€37 million to Afrin™ (cough and cold business)."
"These were mainly the result of a decrease in the 
weighted average cost of capital compared to the third quarter of 2023."
"The weighted average cost of 
capital in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 6.2% (Q3 2023: 6.7%) for Claritin™ and 6.6% (Q3 2023: 7.2%) 
for Afrin™."
The impairment losses were recognized in the selling expenses.
"A 
long-term growth rate of 2% and an after-tax cost of capital of 10.1% were applied in the testing of 
goodwill for impairment in the Crop Science segment in the second quarter of 2023."
"Impairment losses of 
€734 million were recognized on goodwill in the Crop Science segment in 2022."
"In the case of 
research and development projects, the point in time from which a capitalized asset can be expected to 
generate an economic benefit for the company cannot be determined."
"Such assets are therefore classified 
as having an indefinite useful life and are subjected to annual impairment testing."
"Another unamortized intangible asset is the Bayer Cross, which was reacquired for the North America 
region in 1994, having been awarded to the United States and Canada under the reparations agreements 
at the end of the First World War."
"The period for which the Bayer Group will derive an economic benefit 
from this name cannot be determined as Bayer intends to make continuous use of it."

capitalized at €108 million (2022: €108 million)."

"The contracted rating agencies assess Bayer as follows: 
S&P Global assigns a long-term rating of BBB and a short-term rating of A-2 with a positive outlook, 
Moody’s a Baa2/P-2 with a negative outlook, and Fitch Ratings a BBB+/F2 with a negative outlook."
"These 
investment grade ratings from all three agencies reflect the company’s high solvency and ensure access to 
a broad investor base for financing purposes."
"In addition to utilizing cash inflows from our operational business to reduce net financial debt, we are 
implementing our financial strategy by way of vehicles such as subordinated hybrid bonds and a potential 
share buyback program."
"Net financial debt comprises bonds, liabilities to banks, lease liabilities, liabilities 
from derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities less receivables from derivative financial 
instruments, cash and cash equivalents as well as current financial assets."
"Bayer is not subject to any minimum capital requirements from major financing measures at the 
Group level."
"Capital stock and capital reserves 
The capital stock of Bayer AG on December 31, 2023, amounted to €2,515 million (2022: €2,515 million), 
divided into 982,424,082 (2022: 982,424,082) registered no-par shares, and was fully paid in."

Accumulated comprehensive income 
Accumulated comprehensive income comprises retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive 
income."
"The retained earnings comprise prior years’ undistributed income of consolidated companies and 
all remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability for pension or other post-employment benefits that 
are recognized outside profit or loss."
"The accumulated other comprehensive income comprises exchange 
rate effects recognized outside profit or loss that arise from the translation of the annual financial 
statements of subsidiaries outside the eurozone, the changes in fair values of equity instruments and cash 
flow hedges."
"Dividend 
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the dividend payment is determined by the distributable 
profit reported in the annual financial statements of Bayer AG, which are prepared according to the 
German Commercial Code."
"Retained earnings were diminished by payment of the dividend of €2.40 per 
share for 2022."
"The proposed dividend for the 2023 fiscal year is €0.11 per share, which – based on the 
current number of shares – would result in a total dividend payment of €108 million."
"Payment of the 
proposed dividend is contingent upon approval by the stockholders at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting 
and therefore is not recognized as a liability in the consolidated financial statements."
"Provisions for pensions and other  
post-employment benefits 
Provisions were established for defined benefit obligations pertaining to pensions and other post-
employment benefits."
"The net liability was accounted for as follows: 
B 22/1 
Net Defined Benefit Liability Reflected in the Statement of Financial Position 
 
Pensions
Other post-
employment benefits
Total
€ million 
Dec."
"Of this amount, €484 million (2022: 
€2,632 million) related to pension obligations, minus €8 million (2022: €9 million) to other post-employment 
benefit obligations and minus €52 million (2022: minus €84 million) to the effects of the asset ceiling."
Plan curtailments of minus €15 million were made in 2023 (2022: minus €2 million).
"In Germany, current employees accounted for about 27% 
(2022: 29%), retirees or their surviving dependents for about 64% (2022: 62%) and former employees with 
vested pension rights for about 9% (2022: 9%) of entitlements under defined benefit plans."
"In the United 
States, current employees accounted for about 23% (2022: 24%), retirees or their surviving dependents 
for about 61% (2022: 60%) and former employees with vested pension rights for about 16% (2022: 16%) 
of entitlements under defined benefit plans."
"The actual gains on the assets of defined benefit plans for pensions and for other post-employment 
benefits amounted to €1,423 million (2022: loss of €3,650 million) and €40 million (2022: loss of 
€104 million), respectively."
"The following table shows the defined benefit obligations for pensions and other post-employment benefits 
along with the funded status of the funded obligations."
"The benefits vary depending on the legal, fiscal and economic 
conditions of each country."
"A substantial part of the pension entitlements consists of defined contribution 
obligations, where the minimum benefit amount is based directly on the contribution level."
"The obligations 
relate both to existing retirees’ pensions and to pension entitlements of future retirees."
Bayer has set up funded pension plans for its employees in various countries.
"A strategic target investment portfolio is then developed in line with the plan’s 
risk structure, taking capital market factors into consideration."
"Further determinants are risk diversification, 
portfolio efficiency and the need for both a country-specific and a global risk/return profile centered on 
ensuring the payment of all future benefits."
"As the capital investment strategy for each pension plan is 
developed individually in light of the plan-specific conditions listed above, the investment strategies for 
different pension plans may vary considerably."
"The investment strategies are generally aligned less toward 
maximizing absolute returns and more toward the maximum probability of being able to finance pension 
commitments over the long term."
"For pension plans, stress scenarios are simulated and other risk 
analyses (such as value at risk) undertaken with the aid of risk management systems."
"Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG, Germany (Bayer-Pensionskasse), is one of the most significant post-
employment benefit plans."
It has been closed to new members since 2005.
"This legally independent fund 
is regarded as a life insurance company and therefore is subject to the German Insurance Supervision Act."
"The benefit obligations covered by Bayer-Pensionskasse comprise retirement, surviving dependents’ and 
disability pensions."
"It constitutes a defined-benefit, multi-employer plan, to which the active members and 
their employers contribute."
"The company contribution is a certain percentage of the employee 
contribution."
"It takes into account the differences between the actuarial 
estimates and the actual values for the factors used to determine liabilities and contributions."
"Bayer may 
also adjust the company contribution in agreement with the plan’s executive committee and its supervisory 
board, acting on a proposal from the responsible actuary."
"The plan’s liability is governed by Section 1, 
Paragraph 1, Sentence 3 of the German Law on the Improvement of Occupational Pensions (BetrAVG)."
"This means that if the pension plan exercises its right under the articles of association to reduce benefits, 
each participating employer has to make up the resulting difference."
"Bayer is not liable for the obligations 
of participating employers outside the Bayer Group, even if they cease to participate in the plan."
"Pension entitlements for people who joined Bayer in Germany in 2005 or later are granted via Rheinische 
Pensionskasse VVaG, Germany."
"Future pension payments from this defined-benefit, multi-employer plan 
are based on contributions and the return on plan assets; a guaranteed interest rate applies."
"All of the 
German Insurance Supervision Act regulations and BetrAVG provisions described in the section above on 
Bayer-Pensionskasse apply analogously to Rheinische Pensionskasse."
Another important financing vehicle is Bayer Pension Trust e.
"This covers further 
retirement provision arrangements of the Bayer Group, such as deferred compensation, pension 
obligations previously administered by Schering Altersversorgung Treuhand e."
"V., Germany, and 
components of other direct commitments."
"The defined benefit pension plans in the United States are frozen and no significant new entitlements can 
be earned under these plans."
"The assets of all the US pension plans are held by a master trust for reasons 
of efficiency."
"The applicable regulatory framework is based on the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act (ERISA), which includes a statutory 80% minimum funding requirement to avoid benefit restrictions."
"The actuarial risks, such as investment risk, interest-rate risk and longevity risk, remain with the company."
"The defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom have been closed to new members for some 
years."
"Plan assets in the UK are administered by independent trustees, who are legally obligated to act 
solely in the interests of the beneficiaries."
"A technical assessment is performed every three years in line 
with UK regulations."
"This serves as the basis for developing a plan to cover any potential financing 
requirements."
"Here, too, the actuarial risks remain with the company."
"The other post-employment benefit obligations outside Germany mainly comprised healthcare benefit 
payments for retirees in the United States."
"The other plan assets comprised mortgage loans granted, other receivables and qualified insurance 
policies."
"Risks 
The risks from defined benefit plans arise partly from the defined benefit obligations and partly from the 
investment in plan assets."
"These risks include the possibility that additional contributions will have to be 
made to plan assets in order to meet current and future pension obligations, and negative effects on 
provisions and equity."
"This could happen as a result of a drop in share prices, increases in market rates of interest 
for certain bonds, default of individual debtors or the purchase of low-risk but low-interest bonds, for 
example."
"Interest-rate risk 
A decline in capital market interest rates, especially for high-quality corporate bonds, would increase the 
defined benefit obligation."
"This effect would be at least partially offset by the ensuing increase in the 
market values of the corresponding debt instruments held."
"The projected future benefit increase in Germany was adjusted to 2.10% and would have been 2.40% 
based on the previous estimate method, which had combined long-term expectations and cumulative 
inflation in a uniform benefit increase rate (2022: 2.70%)."
"The estimate method was refined compared with 
the previous years to directly account for cumulative inflation up to the next benefit increase when 
measuring the individual obligations in question."
"The refined process thus takes into account cumulative 
inflation and long-term inflation forecasts, demographic specifics, as well as the adjustment mechanism at 
Bayer."
"The refinement increased the defined benefit obligation by €38 million at the expense of other 
comprehensive income."

Provisions are also established for the obligations, mainly of US subsidiaries, to provide post-employment 
benefits in the form of healthcare cost payments for retirees."
"The valuation of healthcare costs was based 
on the assumption that they will increase at a rate of 6.8% (2022: 7.0%)."
"It was assumed that this rate of 
increase will gradually decline to 5.0% (2022: 5.0%) by 2031 (2022: by 2031)."
"For its 
US pension plans, Bayer did not make any deficit contributions in 2023 or in 2022, and expects to make 
zero or only very low regular payments in 2024 as most of these plans are closed and frozen."
"The weighted average term of the obligations for other 
post-employment benefits in other countries is 9.1 years (2022: 9.1 years)."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements

23."
These reimbursement claims primarily related to product liability.
"Environmental protection 
Provisions for environmental protection are mainly established for the expected costs of ensuring 
compliance with environmental regulations, remediation work on contaminated land, recultivation of 
landfills, and redevelopment and water protection measures."
"Restructuring 
Provisions for restructuring only cover expenses that arise directly from restructuring measures, are 
necessary for restructuring and are not related to future business operations."
"Such expenses include 
severance payments to employees and compensation payments in respect of rented property that is no 
longer used."
"Restructuring measures may include the sale or termination of business units, site closures, relocations of 
business activities or fundamental reorganizations of business units."
"Provisions for restructuring included €889 million (2022: €1,233 million) for severance payments and 
€13 million (2022: €27 million) for other restructuring expenses."
"The breakdown of provisions by segment 
was as follows: €125 million (2022: €170 million) at Crop Science, €403 million (2022: €633 million) at 
Pharmaceuticals, €13 million (2022: €20 million) at Consumer Health and €361 million (2022: €437 million) 
in Enabling Functions/All Other Segments."
"In 2023, Bayer announced the introduction of a new operating model for the entire Group."
"The aim of the 
new system, which is called Dynamic Shared Ownership (DSO), is to ensure we adopt an even stronger 
orientation toward customer needs and deploy resources more efficiently."
"In late 2023, the company began to undertake its first specific communication measures to inform affected 
employees and employee representatives, which meant that corresponding provisions had to be 
established under IAS 37."
"Future provisions will need to be established depending on the development of 
detailed formal plans for the planned measures and the communication thereof to the affected employees."
"The decline in provisions for restructuring at Crop Science was particularly attributable to the ongoing 
severance payments resulting from reorganization measures due to the Monsanto integration."
"This global 
program was aimed at driving a fundamental organizational transformation in step with the long-term 
strategy and Bayer’s aspiration as a leading science company to deliver groundbreaking innovation."
"The ongoing utilization of the existing provisions in conjunction with the current transformation initiative 
also led to a decrease in the restructuring-related provisions for Consumer Health."
"The decline for Enabling Functions/All Other Segments was largely due to the further utilization of the 
existing provisions for the headcount reduction measures defined in previous years."
"Trade-related commitments 
Trade-related provisions are recorded mainly for obligations related to services performed but not yet 
invoiced and to sales commissions not recognized under trade accounts payable."
"Litigations 
The legal risks currently considered to be material, and their development, are described in Note [30]."
"Personnel commitments 
Personnel-related provisions include those for variable, performance-related one-time payments to 
employees, stock-based payments, and payments related to long-service anniversaries, early retirement 
programs and pre-retirement part-time working arrangements."
"Provisions for severance payments resulting 
from restructuring are reflected in provisions for restructuring."
"Stock-based compensation programs 
Bayer offers the stock-based compensation programs Aspire 2.0, Aspire 3.0 and BayShare 2023 
collectively to different groups of employees."
"The Aspire 2.0 and Aspire 3.0 programs are accounted for in 
accordance with the requirements of IFRS 2 concerning cash-settled share-based payment transactions."
"By contrast, the BayShare stock-based compensation program is accounted for in line with the 
requirements of IFRS 2 concerning equity-settled share-based payment transactions."
"Provisions are 
established for all awards to be made under the Aspire 2.0 and Aspire 3.0 programs."
"The provisions are 
recognized in the amount of the fair value of the obligations existing as of the date of the financial 
statements."
All resulting changes in value are recognized in profit or loss.
"The net gain for all stock-based compensation programs was €153 million (2022: expense of €365 million) 
and included expenses of €5 million (2022: €5 million) for the BayShare stock participation program."
"The 
decline in provisions was primarily due to the development of the underlying parameters to determine the 
fair value of liabilities, such as Bayer’s share price and ROCE."
"For information on the hedging of stock-
based compensation for our employees and the resulting additional effects on the income statement, see 
Note [27.3]."
"Long-term incentive program Aspire 2.0 
Aspire 2.0 is based on a percentage of each employee’s annual base salary, the percentage varying 
according to their position."
"This target value is multiplied by the employee’s STI (short-term incentive) 
payment factor for the previous year to give the Aspire grant value."
"The STI payment factor reflects the 
business performance under the global short-term incentive program."
"The Aspire grant value is converted 
into virtual Bayer shares by dividing it by the share price at the start of the program."
"The program’s 
performance is based on these virtual shares."
Each tranche runs for four years.
"Detailed information on the 
stock-based compensation of the Board of Management can be found in the Compensation Report 
(www.bayer.com/cpr)."
"The fair value of the obligations is determined from the price of Bayer stock at year-end and the 
dividends paid up to that time."
"The payment made at the end of each tranche is determined by multiplying 
the number of virtual shares by the Bayer share price at that time and adding an amount equivalent to the 
dividends paid during the period of the tranche."
"The maximum payment for Aspire 2.0 is 250% of the 
Aspire grant value."
"At the start of 2024, a payment of 60% was made for the tranche issued in 2020."
"Long-term incentive program Aspire 3.0 
Due to the introduction of Aspire 3.0 in 2020, Bayer’s long-term compensation program now includes a 
series of additional strategic performance indicators that are aligned toward the company’s strategy."
Eligibility was limited to the members of the Board of Management in the first year of the program.
"However, since the beginning of 2021, it has also been made available to eligible employees below this 
level."
"As with Aspire 2.0, the annual tranches are granted over a four-year term in the form of virtual shares."
"This 
program is also based on a percentage of each employee’s annual base salary (the so-called LTI target 
amount), the percentage varying according to their position."
"The number of virtual shares is determined by 
dividing the LTI target amount by the price of Bayer shares at the beginning of the program."
"However, the 
individual STI payout factor is no longer taken into consideration when calculating the number of virtual 
shares."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 
200
The fair value of the obligations continues to be determined from the price of Bayer stock and the 
dividends already paid."
"Compared with Aspire 2.0, however, there is also an additional performance factor 
to be taken into account that comprises three weighted performance components: relative capital market 
performance (40%), return on investment (40%) and sustainability (20%)."
"The final LTI payout is determined 
by multiplying the number of virtual shares by the Bayer share price at the end of the performance period 
and the performance factor mentioned above, and then adding an amount equivalent to the dividends paid 
during the performance period."
The maximum payout is 250% of the LTI target amount.
"Detailed 
information on the stock-based compensation of the Board of Management and the three performance 
components mentioned above can be found in the Compensation Report (www.bayer.com/cpr)."
"BayShare 2023 
All management levels and nonmanagerial employees in Germany are offered a stock participation program 
known as BayShare, under which Bayer subsidizes their personal investments in the company’s stock."
"On November 9, 2023, approximately 576,000 Bayer AG shares (2022: 492,000 shares) were purchased at 
a price of €41.85 per share (2022: €50.11 per share) for this purpose in accordance with Section 71, 
Paragraph 1, No."
8 of the German Stock Corporation Act.
"These shares corresponded to €1.5 million 
(2022: €1.3 million), or 0.06% (2022: 0.05%), of the capital stock."
"At the time of purchase, the value of the 
shares was €24 million (2022: €25 million)."
"The shares were deposited in employees’ securities accounts in 
late 2023, meaning that Bayer AG did not hold any own shares as of December 31, 2023."
The discount granted under this program in 2023 was 20% (2022: 20%) of the subscription amount.
Employees stated a fixed amount that they wished to invest in shares.
"The maximum subscription amount 
in Germany was set at €2,500 (2022: €2,500) or €5,000 (2022: €5,000), depending on the employee’s 
position."
"The shares purchased must be retained until December 31, 2024."
"Miscellaneous 
Miscellaneous provisions include those for interest payments on income taxes and other taxes, for other 
liabilities, except where these are allocable to other provision categories, and for decommissioning and 
similar obligations."
"A sensitivity analysis undertaken for certain provisions that examined the impact of a five-percentage-point 
change in the probabilities of occurrence in each case did not produce any material deviations from the 
amount of provisions established."
"Financial liabilities

"2 Date of first option to redeem the bond early at par 
3 Some of the hybrid bonds were repurchased before the first call date."
"Hybrid bonds 
The hybrid bonds issued by Bayer AG are subordinated, and 50% of their amount is treated as equity by 
three contracted rating agencies."
"They therefore have a more limited effect on the Group’s rating-specific 
debt indicators than senior borrowings."
"In 2023, Bayer AG repurchased €1.4 billion in hybrid bonds maturing in 2074 (callable on July 1, 2024) and 
2079 (callable on February 12, 2025) before the first call date."
"To finance the repurchase, new hybrid 
bonds with a total volume of €1.75 billion were placed."
The two tranches have a final maturity of 60 years.
"The first tranche in the amount of €750 million with a noncall period of 5.25 years pays a coupon of 
6.625%."
"The second tranche in the amount of €1.0 billion with a noncall period of 8.25 years pays a 
coupon of 7.000%."
Bayer AG had placed hybrid bonds with a total volume of €1.3 billion in 2022.

"The second tranche in the amount of €800 million with 
a noncall period of 8.5 years pays a coupon of 5.375%."
"Other bonds 
In 2023, Bayer AG placed new senior bonds with a total volume of €3 billion under its Debt Issuance 
Program."
"The three tranches with volumes of €750 million, €750 million and €1.5 billion have maturities of 
3.25 years, 6.25 years and 10 years, respectively."
"The coupons of the notes are 4.000%, 4.250% and 
4.625%, respectively."
"In addition, Bayer US Finance LLC, United States, placed bonds with a volume of US$5.75 billion 
(€5.3 billion)."
"Furthermore, two bonds with a total volume of US$3.5 billion (€3.2 billion) and one bond with a nominal 
volume of €500 million were redeemed at maturity in 2023."
"In 2021, Bayer AG placed bonds with a total volume of €4 billion."
"The four tranches with volumes of 
between €0.8 and €1.2 billion have maturities of 4 years, 8 years, 10.5 years and 15 years."
"The coupons 
on the notes are 0.05% p.a., 0.375% p.a., 0.625% p.a."
"and 1.00% p.a., respectively."
"In 2022, two bonds with a total volume of US$250 million (€229 million) were redeemed before maturity, 
while two bonds with a total volume of €1.75 billion and one with a nominal volume of JPY10 billion 
(€73 million) were redeemed at maturity."
"Liabilities to banks 
The decrease in liabilities to banks is due to repayment of the €3 billion credit line with banks that had 
been drawn upon in May 2022."
"Lease liabilities 
Further information on lease liabilities is given in Note [28]."
"Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities as of December 31, 2023, included €1,867 million in commercial paper (2022: 
€80 million)."
"Other information 
A total of €4.5 billion in undrawn credit facilities remained available to the Bayer Group as of December 31, 
2023 (December 31, 2022: €4.5 billion)."
Further information on the accounting for liabilities from derivatives is given in Note [27].
"Trade accounts payable 
Trade accounts payable comprised €7,414 million (2022: €7,490 million) due within one year and 
€42 million (2022: €55 million) due after one year."
"This figure included invoices of €224 million (2022: €215 million) in connection with supply chain

"These payments were effected in January 2023 after having been reclassified

attributable to the milestone payments in connection with the acquisitions of the US-based companies 
Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc."
"(AskBio), BlueRock Therapeutics LP (BlueRock) and Vividion 
Therapeutics, Inc."
"The decline amounted to €461 million for Vividion and €185 million for 
AskBio and BlueRock in 2023."
"This results in remaining possible milestone payments under 
miscellaneous liabilities of €956 million (2022: €1,241 million) attributable to the US-based companies 
AskBio and BlueRock."
"The deferred income included €27 million (2022: €26 million) in grants and subsidies received from 
governments, of which €3 million (2022: €8 million) was reversed through profit or loss."
It also contains more detailed information on individual market-price risks.
"27.1 Financial instruments by category 
The following tables show the carrying amounts and fair values of the individual financial assets and 
liabilities by category of financial instrument under IFRS 9 and a reconciliation to the corresponding line 
items in the statements of financial position."
"Trade accounts receivable are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income if they can potentially be transferred as part of factoring agreements."
"In case of a 
transfer, all of the risks and opportunities contained in these agreements are transferred, resulting in complete 
derecognition of the receivables."
"The fair values of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost that are given for information 
are the present values of the respective future cash flows."
"The present values are determined by 
discounting the cash flows at a closing-date interest rate, taking into account the term of the assets or 
liabilities and also the creditworthiness of the counterparty in certain cases."
"Where a market price is 
available, however, this is deemed to be the fair value."
"The fair values of derivatives for which no publicly quoted prices exist in active markets (Level 1) are 
determined using valuation techniques based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting 
period (Level 2)."
"In applying valuation techniques, credit or debt value adjustments are determined to 
account for the credit risk of the contractual party or Bayer."
"Currency and commodity forward contracts are measured individually at their forward rates or forward 
prices on the closing date."
"These depend on spot rates or prices, including time spreads."
Fair values measured using unobservable inputs are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
"This essentially applies to certain debt or equity instruments, in some cases to the fair values of embedded 
derivatives, and to obligations for contingent consideration in business combinations."
"Credit risk is 
frequently the principal unobservable input used to determine the fair values of debt instruments classified 
as “FVTPL – at fair value through profit or loss” by the discounted cash flow method."
"Here the credit 
spreads of comparable issuers are applied."
"A significant increase in credit risk could result in a lower fair 
value, whereas a significant decrease could result in a higher fair value."
"However, a relative change of 10% 
in the credit spread does not materially affect the fair value."
"Changes in these estimates may lead 
to significant increases or decreases in fair value."
"Embedded derivatives are separated from their respective host contracts if the contracts do not represent 
financial assets and are not closely related to them."
"Such host contracts are generally sale or purchase 
agreements relating to the operational business."
"The embedded derivatives cause the cash flows from the 
contracts to vary with exchange-rate or price fluctuations, for example."
"The internal measurement of 
embedded derivatives is performed using appropriate valuation models, such as discounted cash flow 
models, which are based on unobservable inputs."
"The relevant models include planned sales and 
purchase volumes, and prices derived from market data."
"Regular monitoring is carried out based on these 
fair values as part of quarterly reporting."
"The purchase agreement falls under the own use exemption in accordance with IFRS 
9.2.4, but also contains a contract for difference, which meets the definition of an embedded derivative 
measured at fair value through profit and loss."
"At inception, the fair value of the embedded derivative 
equaled the transaction price of zero."
"Fair value changes over the contract term are mostly influenced by 
future energy prices and are recognized in other operating income or expenses."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
the positive fair value was €31 million."
"If the expected energy prices had been 10% higher (or lower) as of 
December 31, 2023, the fair value of the embedded derivative would, all other things being equal, have 
been €54 million higher (€68 million lower)."
"The maximum default risk from financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and are subject to the 
impairment model is €16,012 million (2022: €15,717 million)."
"The maximum default risk from existing loan commitments that are subject to the impairment model is 
€1,097 million (2022: €1,108 million)."
"In this connection, expected credit losses totaling €1 million (2022: 
€2 million) were reversed through profit or loss."
"The maximum default risk from financial assets not subject to the impairment model is €6,565 million 
(2022: €7,208 million)."
"A Bayer subsidiary holds a share – in the form of a contractually linked instrument – in a fund with which a 
customer finance program was established."
"This fund is a nonconsolidated structured entity that settles 
payments owed to Bayer by customers on their behalf, whereupon the contractual rights to payment from 
these claims expire and the associated claims are fully derecognized by Bayer upon receipt of the 
payment."
"The fund’s right to payment from the customer is based on a separate agreement with the 
customer, the promissory note."
"The fund is financed by investors who have purchased shares, with Bayer 
holding a 13.5% share of the fund volume."
"The fund can hold promissory notes with a value of up to 
€185 million."
The shares are reported under other receivables and measured at amortized cost.
"The 
carrying amount of the shares held by Bayer as of December 31, 2023, was €25 million."
"The maximum 
default risk is equal to the respective carrying amount."
"If customers are unable to service their promissory 
notes, defaults would initially be borne by an investor in an amount of 1.5% of the fund volume; thereafter, 
Bayer would be subject to losses amounting to as much as 13.5% of the fund volume, while all other 
losses would be borne by a bank."
"The fund is not consolidated as Bayer cannot exercise any control over 
its relevant activities."
"The changes recognized in profit or loss were included in other operating income/expenses, as well as in 
the financial result in interest income, exchange gains or losses, and other financial income and expenses."
"The interest income and expense from assets and liabilities within the AC category also included income 
and expenses from interest-rate derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting."
"Income and expenses 
from lease receivables and lease liabilities, respectively, are also included here."
"The changes in the fair value of assets within the FVTPL category mainly included changes in the fair value 
of the interests in Century and Pyxis, as well as changes in the fair value of investments in money market 
funds and mixed funds."
"The changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting related mainly to forward commodity contracts and embedded derivatives."
"Changes in the fair value of (nonderivative) liabilities within the FVTPL category mainly included changes in 
the fair value of obligations for contingent consideration in connection with business acquisitions."
"The volume of such derivatives with positive fair values was €118 million (2022: €188 million), and 
the volume with negative fair values was €322 million (2022: €310 million)."
"Included here is an amount of 
€109 million (2022: €152 million) in positive and negative fair values of derivatives concluded with the same 
contracting party."
"27.2 Maturity analysis 
The liquidity risks to which the Bayer Group was exposed through its financial instruments at the end of 
the reporting period comprised obligations for future interest and repayment installments on financial 
liabilities and the liquidity risk arising from derivatives."
"In 2022, Bayer-Pensionskasse and Rheinische Pensionskasse drew amounts with a nominal volume 
of €500 million and €57 million, respectively, from their effective initial funds as per the corresponding 
agreement."
"At the same time, the agreed commitment volume in the effective initial fund agreement 
between Bayer-Pensionskasse and Bayer AG was increased by €500 million."
"The undiscounted, contractually agreed cash inflows/outflows (notional amounts) from financial 
instruments are shown in the following tables: 
B 27.2/1  
Maturity Analysis of Financial Instruments 
 
Dec."
Derivatives are used to reduce this risk.
"In some cases, they are designated as hedging 
instruments in a hedge accounting relationship."
"Currency risks 
Foreign currency receivables and liabilities are hedged using foreign exchange derivatives without the 
existence of a hedge accounting relationship."
"Fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from forecasted foreign currency transactions and procurement 
activities are avoided partly through derivatives contracts, most of which are designated as cash flow 
hedges."
"Interest-rate risk 
The interest-rate risks from fixed-interest borrowings are managed in part using interest-rate swaps."
"Two 
interest-rate swaps totaling US$500 million were designated as fair value hedges for the US$2.5 billion 
bond issued in 2018 and maturing in 2025."
"The carrying amount of this bond as of December 31, 2023, 
was €2,258 million (2022: €2,336 million)."
"Hedge-related fair value adjustments of €7 million (2022: 
€18 million) reduced the carrying amount to €2,251 million (2022: €2,318 million)."
"No material ineffective 
portions of these hedges required recognition through profit or loss."
"Interest-rate risks in connection with the issuance of new bonds were partially hedged through interest-
rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges."
"The fair values of these derivatives as of the issuance 
date will be amortized from reserves for cash flow hedges into interest income and expense over the term 
of the bonds."
"Most of 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges."
"Hedging of obligations under stock-based employee compensation programs (Aspire) 
A portion of the obligations to make stock-based payments to employees was hedged against share price 
fluctuations using derivatives contracts that were settled in cash at maturity."
"These derivatives were 
designated as cash flow hedges."
"Further information on cash flow hedges 
Other comprehensive income from cash flow hedges decreased in 2023 by €162 million (2022: by 
€181 million) due to changes in the fair values of derivatives."
"Total changes of €12 million in the fair values 
of derivatives were recognized as expense in 2023 (2022: €463 million) through profit or loss."
2 Derivatives with positive fair values are recognized under “Other financial assets” in the statement of financial position.
3 Derivatives with negative fair values are recognized under “Financial liabilities” in the statement of financial position.
4 Derivatives with negative fair values are recognized under “Other liabilities” in the statement of financial position.
5 The portion of the fair value of long-term interest-rate swaps that relates to short-term interest payments is reported as current.

"Leases 
The accounting policy options exercised with respect to leases are outlined in Note [3]."
"Lease contracts in which Bayer is the lessee mainly pertain to real estate, machinery, equipment or 
vehicles."
"Lease contracts are negotiated individually and each contain different arrangements on 
extension, termination or purchase options, for example."
Land and building leases in which Bayer is the lessee have average terms of 8.1 years (2022: 7.8 years).
"In 
many cases, the payments agreed under these leases are adjusted annually based on the development of 
the consumer price index for the respective country."
"Building leases generally contain clauses that prohibit 
subleasing except with the consent of the lessor."
"Leases of assets other than land or buildings have 
average terms of 5.8 years (2022: 6.8 years)."
"Like in the previous year, approximately half of all contracts (excluding vehicle leases) contain an option for 
Bayer as lessee to terminate the lease on a date specified in the contract."
"As in the prior year, roughly half 
of all contracts with a fixed minimum term (excluding vehicle leases) grant Bayer as lessee an extension 
option."
Vehicle leases generally contain a right of early return and an extension option.

"Both the assessment of the contingent liabilities and the assessment of 
the probability of the outflow of resources are subject to a high degree of uncertainty."
"Other financial commitments 
The other financial commitments were as follows:  
B 29/1 
Other Financial Commitments 
€ million 
Dec."
"The amounts shown represent the maximum payments to be 
made, and it is unlikely that they will all fall due."
"Since the achievement of the conditions for payment is 
highly uncertain, both the amounts and the dates of the actual payments may vary considerably from those 
stated in the table."
"Legal risks 
As a global company with extensive business activities, the Bayer Group is exposed to numerous legal 
risks, particularly in the areas of product liability, competition and antitrust law, anticorruption, patent 
disputes, tax assessments and environmental matters."
"The outcome of any current or future proceedings 
cannot normally be predicted."
"The legal proceedings 
referred to below do not represent an exhaustive list of all legal proceedings, but such legal proceedings 
we currently consider to be material."
"Product-related litigation 
Essure™: In the United States, a large number of lawsuits by users of Essure™, a medical device offering 
permanent birth control with a nonsurgical procedure, have been served upon Bayer."
"Plaintiffs allege 
personal injuries from the use of Essure™, including hysterectomy, perforation, pain, bleeding, weight 
gain, nickel sensitivity, depression and unwanted pregnancy, and seek compensatory and punitive 
damages."
Almost all of the US claims have been settled.
"The remaining provision for settlements and legal 
fees amounts to approximately US$65 million (€60 million) as of January 31, 2024."
"At the same time, we 
continue to support the safety and efficacy of the Essure™ device and are prepared to vigorously defend it 
in litigation where no amicable resolution can be achieved."
"As of January 31, 2024, two Canadian lawsuits relating to Essure™ seeking class action certification had 
been served upon Bayer."
One of the proposed class actions has been certified.
"In addition, approximately 
170 single-plaintiff claims have been served upon Bayer."
"Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and 
intends to defend itself vigorously."
"Class actions over neonicotinoids in Canada: Proposed class actions against Bayer have been filed in 
Quebec and Ontario (Canada) concerning crop protection products containing the active substances 
imidacloprid and clothianidin (neonicotinoids)."
"The plaintiffs are honey producers, who have filed a 
proposed nationwide class action in Ontario and a Quebec-only class action in Quebec."
"The plaintiffs are 
claiming for compensatory damages and punitive damages and allege Bayer and another crop protection 
company were negligent in the design, development, marketing and sale of neonicotinoid pesticides."
"The 
proposed Ontario class action is in a very early procedural phase."
"In Quebec, a court certified a class 
proposed by plaintiffs in 2018."
"Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself 
vigorously."
"Roundup™ (glyphosate): A large number of lawsuits from plaintiffs claiming to have been exposed to 
glyphosate-based products manufactured by Bayer’s subsidiary Monsanto Company (“Monsanto”) have 
been served upon Monsanto in the United States."
"Glyphosate is the active ingredient contained in a 
number of Monsanto’s herbicides, including Roundup™-branded products."
"Plaintiffs allege personal 
injuries resulting from exposure to those products, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple 
myeloma, and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages."
"The plaintiffs are claiming, inter alia, that 
the glyphosate-based herbicide products are defective and that Monsanto knew, or should have known, of 
the risks allegedly associated with such products and failed to adequately warn its users."
"Additional 
lawsuits are anticipated."
"The majority of plaintiffs have brought actions in state courts in Missouri and 
California."
"As of January 31, 2024, Monsanto had reached settlements and/or was close to settling in a substantial 
number of claims."
"Of the approximately 167,000 claims in total, approximately 113,000 have been settled 
or are not eligible for various reasons."
"As of January 31, 2024, there have been 19 Roundup™ trials concluded before both federal and state 
courts in California, Missouri, Oregon and Pennsylvania."
"In 10 of those trials, the juries reached verdicts in 
favor of Monsanto."
"In the other nine trials, the plaintiffs were awarded compensatory damages and a 
multiple thereof in punitive damages."
"A few of these cases have been settled later, but in most cases 
Monsanto has filed post-trial motions or appealed the jury verdicts, or plans to do so."
"In our opinion, these 
verdicts are based on numerous evidentiary and legal errors, as well as unconstitutionally excessive 
damage awards."
"Bayer has two appeals pending in federal court on preemption grounds: Carson, pending 
in the 11th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, and Schaffner, pending in the Third Circuit Federal Court of 
Appeals."
"As of December 31, 2023, Bayer’s provision for the glyphosate litigation totaled US$6.3 billion 
(€5.7 billion)."
"Bayer continues to believe there is no reason for safety concerns in connection with the 
products mentioned above."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
B Consolidated Financial Statements
Notes to the Statements of Financial Position 
218
As of January 31, 2024, a total of 32 Canadian lawsuits relating to Roundup™ had been served upon 
Bayer, including 11 seeking class action certification."
"Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend the safety of glyphosate and our 
glyphosate-based formulations vigorously."
"Dicamba: In 2016, Bader Peach Farms filed a lawsuit against Monsanto and BASF SE (“BASF”) in Missouri 
state court."
"Subsequently, lawsuits from approximately 250 plaintiffs were filed in both US state and 
federal courts in Missouri, Tennessee and Texas alleging crop damage claims against Monsanto, primarily 
for soybeans."
"The general claims are that off-target movement from the dicamba herbicide and/or the 
Xtend™ system has damaged non-dicamba-tolerant soybean and other crops."
"The Bader Peach Farms 
case was settled in 2022 without admission of liability."
Bayer continues to receive new dicamba-related claims that could be potential future lawsuits.
"The most 
significant of those was a claim by Frey Farms, which is a producer of watermelons, pumpkins and other 
vegetables."
"In April 2023, the parties entered into an agreement to resolve all of the claims of Frey Farms."
"With respect to all of the other dicamba cases except for Frey Farms and a small number of newly filed 
lawsuits and claims, Monsanto has entered into a mass tort settlement agreement."
"The settlement will 
provide for the payment of substantiated claims by soybean growers in crop years 2015 to 2020 who can 
demonstrate a yield loss due to the application of dicamba products to an Xtend™ crop."
"That portion of 
the settlement is capped at US$300 million."
"The settlement also provides for additional funds of up to 
US$100 million to pay for dicamba damage claims made by growers of other, non-soybean crops, as well 
as attorneys’ fees, litigation costs and settlement administration costs."
"The settlement claims administrator 
is currently in the process of determining claim eligibility and the amounts to be awarded to eligible 
claimants."
"Taking into account the payments already made, the remaining provision for settlements 
amounts to approximately US$70 million (€63 million) as of December 31, 2023."
"However, the accounting 
measures relating to, in particular, Essure™ and Roundup™ (glyphosate) claims exceed the available 
insurance coverage."
"In 2020, the Brazilian patent 
office, in the court proceedings, acknowledged the validity of all four challenged patents."
"Two of the 
patents are also being challenged in administrative nullity proceedings before the Brazilian patent office."
"One of the patents, the promoter patent which expired in 2022, is also at issue in a patent invalidation 
action filed in Brazilian federal court by the Soybean Growers Association from the State of Mato Grosso 
(Aprosoja/MT) in 2017 regarding the Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean technology."
"In addition to the patent 
invalidity claims, both lawsuits seek a refund of paid royalties."
"Both lawsuits were filed as collective actions 
and are proceeding before the same federal judge."
"Bayer’s Intacta RR2 PRO™ soybean technology is 
presently protected by four patents."
"In 
2021, the Brazilian federal court decided to grant the requests by further soybean grower associations and 
the Cotton Producers Association of the State of Mato Grosso (AMPA) to be admitted as co-plaintiffs to 
this lawsuit."
"One of the two patents, the promoter patent, also covers Bollgard II RR Flex™ and is at issue 
in the disputes with AMPA."
"Aprosoja/MT argues that the term of the patents had been determined 
unconstitutionally."
"This will apply 
retroactively to certain patents, thereby shortening their term."
"However, Bayer believes that neither 
Aprosoja/MT nor other associations are entitled to a refund of paid royalties or to a reduction of ongoing 
royalty payments."
"MON 87429/MON 94313: In 2022, Corteva Agriscience LLC (“Corteva”) filed a complaint in a US federal 
court against Bayer."
"Corteva alleges infringement of three patents held by Corteva by Bayer’s herbicide 
tolerance technologies MON 87429 (corn) and MON 94313 (soybeans), respectively."
"However, Bayer 
asserts that its technologies do not infringe any valid patent claim of Corteva and that all three patents of 
Corteva are invalid."
"Roundup Ready™ Soybean, Event GTS40-3-2 
In October 2023, Bayer’s subsidiaries Monsanto Company and Monsanto do Brasil were served with an 
action filed in the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice by the rural unions of Sertão, Passo Fundo and 
Santiago in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS)."
"The action challenges a 2019 decision by the court that 
had confirmed the protection of Roundup Ready™ soybeans under Brazilian patent law independent from 
plant variety protection and denied claims for a refund of paid royalties."
"Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses in the above patent disputes and intends to defend itself 
vigorously."
"Further legal proceedings 
BASF arbitration: In 2019, Bayer was served with a request for arbitration by BASF."
"BASF alleged 
indemnification claims under asset purchase agreements related to the divestment of certain Crop Science 
businesses to BASF."
"BASF alleged that particular cost items, including certain personnel costs, had not 
been appropriately disclosed and allocated to some of the divested businesses."
"In 2022, the arbitral 
tribunal dismissed BASF’s claims in their entirety."
"In April 2023, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am 
Main (Germany) rejected BASF’s motion to set aside the award."
"However, the court found that the arbitral 
award was technically invalid because it did not comply with a German procedural rule regarding the 
signatures of the tribunal members."
"According to the court decision, the original arbitration proceedings 
have not yet come to an end and still have to be concluded by a valid arbitration award that fully complies 
with the procedural rules."
Bayer disagrees with the court decision.
Both parties have appealed.
"Newark Bay environmental matters: In the United States, Bayer is a backup indemnitor for certain 
environmental liabilities in the Lower Passaic River and/or the Newark Bay Complex which are being 
satisfied by an unrelated company."
"Bayer is currently unable to determine the extent of its potential future 
liability for this matter."
"Mine permit Idaho: In 2019, the United States Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) granted a permit to 
Bayer’s subsidiary P4 Production, LLC, for a new phosphate mine in Idaho."
"Phosphorus is needed for 
glyphosate, which is contained in a number of Bayer’s herbicides, including Roundup™ agricultural 
herbicides."
"In 2021, three non-governmental organizations challenged the permit in the United States 
District Court for the District of Idaho."
P4 Production joined the proceeding as an intervenor.
"In June 2023, 
the court vacated the permit."
"Bayer has prepared a new mine permit application and is evaluating other 
phosphate ore mining opportunities."
BLM has formally initiated its evaluation of P4’s application.
"We and 
the plaintiffs have appealed the court’s decisions."
"Asbestos: In many cases, plaintiffs allege that Bayer and co-defendants employed third parties on their 
sites in past decades without providing them with sufficient warnings or protection against the known 
dangers of asbestos."
"Additionally, a Bayer affiliate in the United States is the legal successor to companies 
that sold asbestos products until 1976."
Union Carbide has agreed to indemnify Bayer for this liability.
"Similarly, Monsanto faces numerous claims based on exposure to asbestos at Monsanto premises without 
adequate warnings or protection and based on the manufacture and sale of asbestos-containing products."
Bayer believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.
"PCBs are chemicals that were widely used for 
various purposes until the manufacture of PCBs was prohibited by the EPA in the United States in 1979."
"In 2020, Bayer entered into a class settlement, valued at approximately US$650 million, to settle claims of 
approximately 2,500 municipal entities."
"In 2022, the court issued its final approval of the class settlement."
"There were approximately 84 opt-outs of the class settlement, 62 of which have now filed lawsuits: 
California cities, counties and municipalities (City of Los Angeles, County of San Mateo, County of Marin 
and County of Contra Costa), Illinois (City of Chicago, City of Evanston and City of East St."
"Louis), 
Washington (City of Seattle) and Wisconsin (City of Milwaukee)."
"Currently, there are five pending state attorney general cases: Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey  
and Vermont."
"Prior cases filed or threatened by Washington D.C., Washington, New Mexico, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Virginia were settled for a combined total of approximately 
US$456 million."
"The Company also settled a pending matter with the State of Oregon for US$698 million, 
reflecting unique circumstances in that State."
The Vermont Attorney General case is different from the others in scope.
"In June 2023, the Vermont 
Attorney General filed suit in state court alleging claims for damages related to PCB contamination of the 
state’s environment and its school buildings."
"The same month, a second and similar complaint (Addison 
Central School District) was filed in federal court (District of Vermont) by private lawyers representing 93 
Vermont school districts alleging PCB contamination in school buildings."
"In addition, there is a pending 
case in Vermont on behalf of the Burlington School District and related personal injury claims (see below)."
"Monsanto also faces numerous lawsuits claiming personal injury due to use of and exposure to PCB 
products in school buildings."
"One group of cases with approximately 200 plaintiffs claims a wide variety of 
personal injuries allegedly due to PCBs in the building products of a school (Sky Valley Education Center) 
in King County, Washington."
"As of January 31, 2024, nine trials had been completed in these matters, 
involving a total of 65 plaintiffs."
"20 of these plaintiffs were not successful as the juries decided in favor of 
Monsanto or a mistrial was declared after the jury was unable to reach a decision."
"The other 45 plaintiffs 
were awarded a total of approximately US$300 million in compensatory and a multiple thereof in punitive 
damages."
"The undisputed evidence in these cases does not, in Bayer’s opinion, support the conclusions 
that plaintiffs were exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs or that any exposure could have caused their claimed 
injuries."
"Each of the adverse verdicts are in different stages of post-trial motions and appeal due to 
numerous significant trial errors."
"In September 2023, a putative class action lawsuit (Neddo) was filed in the District of Vermont by a mother 
on behalf of her three children who attended a local school."
"She alleges they are at increased risk of 
cancer from PCB exposure and seeks the cost of medical monitoring."
"The complaint identifies 26 allegedly 
contaminated schools, and the proposed class is defined as all individuals who attended or worked at one 
of the contaminated schools."
"There are also five pending personal injury cases related to the Burlington, 
Vermont, high school."
There are additional personal injury cases stemming from non-school PCB exposure.
"In August 2023, nine 
cases were filed in Massachusetts state court involving 16 plaintiffs who allege various personal injuries 
from alleged exposure to PCBs in or near a former General Electric landfill."
"A personal injury and wrongful 
death action was filed by 169 current or former employees at Clark County Government Center in Nevada."
"These plaintiffs allege that PCBs contaminated the Center through prior operations by Union Pacific 
Railroad at the site."
"The Nevada action was dismissed by the court, and the plaintiffs have appealed."
"Lastly, there are four cases involving seven plaintiffs claiming injury due to exposure to PCBs near 
Monsanto’s former Krummrich plant."
"We believe that we also have meritorious defenses in these matters and intend to defend ourselves 
vigorously."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

To recover costs associated with the PCB-related litigation, Bayer filed a complaint in August 2022 in the 
Circuit Court of St."
"Louis County for the State of Missouri to enforce its rights under certain indemnity 
contracts."
"Under these contracts, the companies who purchased PCBs for use in their products agreed to 
indemnify Monsanto for PCB-related litigation costs, including settlements."
"Shareholder litigation concerning Monsanto acquisition: In Germany and the United States, investors 
have filed lawsuits claiming damages suffered due to the drop in Bayer AG’s share price."
"Plaintiffs allege 
that Bayer AG’s capital market communication in connection with the acquisition of Monsanto was flawed 
and that the information provided by Bayer on the risks, in particular regarding glyphosate product liability 
claims in the United States, was insufficient."
"In Germany, approximately 30 claims by approximately 340 
plaintiffs had been filed and served upon Bayer as of December 31, 2023."
"In 2022, the Cologne Regional 
Court initiated a model case proceeding in accordance with the Capital Markets Model Case Act."
"This 
does not include a decision on the merits of the matter."
"In the parallel proceeding in the United States, the 
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, certified a class 
in May 2023."
"Bayer believes it has duly complied with its capital markets law obligations at all times in 
connection with the acquisition of Monsanto and its disclosures concerning glyphosate product liability 
claims and intends to defend itself vigorously against the claims in all shareholder lawsuits."

222
Notes to the Statements 
of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows shows how cash inflows and outflows during the fiscal year affected the cash 
and cash equivalents of the Bayer Group."
"Of the cash and cash equivalents, there were no significant sums that had limited availability due to foreign 
exchange restrictions in 2023 or 2022."
"The cash flows reported by consolidated companies outside the eurozone are translated at average monthly 
exchange rates."
Cash and cash equivalents are translated at closing rates.
"The “Change in cash and cash 
equivalents due to exchange rate movements” is reported in a separate line item."
"For subsidiaries with a 
hyperinflationary functional currency, currencies are always translated at the respective closing rates."
"Net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing 
and financing activities 
Net operating cash flow in 2023 amounted to €5,117 million (2022: €7,093 million)."
"Payments to resolve 
proceedings in the litigations surrounding dicamba, Essure™ and, in particular, PCBs and glyphosate 
resulted in a net outflow of €2,089 million (2022: €1,165 million)."
"That total comprised payments resulting 
from agreements as well as court judgments."
"Total income taxes paid in 2023 amounted to €1,770 million 
(2022: €2,125 million)."
"Net operating cash flow included payments from banks of €411 million (2022: 
€0 million) from the transfer of trade receivables that were not yet due or settled by customers as of 
December 31, 2023."
"Net cash used in investing activities in 2023 amounted to €3,517 million (2022: €2,381 million)."
These amounts were therefore accounted for within investing activities under divestments.
"Cash outflows for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to €2,751 million (2022: 
€2,949 million)."
"Cash inflows from the sale of property, plant and equipment and other assets amounted 
to €215 million (2022: €1,130 million)."
"These inflows resulted partly from the sale of rights to our 
dermatological products A+D™, Solarcaine™, Cortate™ and Complex 15™ (€62 million) and to our 
hormone replacement products Progynova™ and Cyclo-Progynova™ (€68 million)."
"Outflows for 
noncurrent financial assets amounted to €332 million (2022: €1,182 million)."
"Of the high prior-year figure, 
€557 million was attributable to Bayer-Pensionskasse VVaG and Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG 
drawing on their effective initial funds."
"Cash outflows for acquisitions less acquired cash amounted to 
€662 million (2022: €89 million) and were largely attributable to milestone payments in connection with 
the acquisition of US-based Asklepios BioPharmaceutical, Inc."
"(AskBio) and Vividion Therapeutics, Inc., 
and Blackford Analysis Ltd., United Kingdom."
"The net cash outflow for current financial assets came to 
€113 million (2022: €1,828 million) and largely pertained to investments in money market funds due to 
increased liquidity as a result of newly placed bonds."
"There was a net cash outflow of €679 million for financing activities (2022: €4,220 million)."
"This figure 
included net borrowings of €3,253 million (2022: net loan repayments of €974 million)."
"Net interest 
payments increased to €1,506 million (2022: €1,251 million)."
"The Bayer Group paid out €2,379 million in 
dividends (2022: €1,985 million), of which €2,358 million (2022: €1,965 million) to Bayer AG stockholders."

"In addition, we have audited the combined 
management report for the parent and the group of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, Leverkusen/Germany, for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal requirements, 
we have not audited the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the 
appendix to the auditor’s report."
"In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents 
the opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion on the combined management 
report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the 
appendix to the auditor’s report."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations 
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management 
report."
"We performed the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on 
Auditing (ISA)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further 
described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of 
the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group 
entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional 
law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare 
that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on 
these matters."
"In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
2."
"Presentation of risks arising from product-related legal disputes  
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: 
a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) 
b) auditor’s response 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
a) In the consolidated financial statements of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, an amount of EUR 32,299 million 
(28% of the Group’s total assets) is presented under the item of the statement of financial position 
“goodwill”."
"The Company allocates goodwill to the reporting 
segments within the Bayer Group."
"Regular impairment tests of goodwill and R&D projects as well as 
ad-hoc impairment tests of other intangible assets are carried out by comparing the respective carrying 
amounts with their respective recoverable amounts."
"Generally, the recoverable amount is determined 
on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell."
"Such determination is based on capital value-oriented 
methods as market values are usually unavailable for the individual strategic business entities."
"The fair 
value is calculated using discounted cash flow models based on the Bayer Group’s medium-term 
planning prepared by the executive directors and extrapolated on the basis of assumptions regarding 
long-term growth rates."
"Discounting is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the respective 
cash-generating units concerned."
"Against this background and in view of the underlying complexity of 
the valuation models, this issue was of particular importance in the context of our audit."
"The statements made by the executive directors on the subject of goodwill and other intangible assets 
are contained in sections 3 and 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"b) As part of our audit, we reconstructed, among other matters, the methodology used to perform the 
impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted cost of capital."
"We assured ourselves 
of the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the valuation by, among other things, 
a walkthrough and critical assessment of the underlying planning process."
"We also assessed the 
appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the valuation, in particular by comparing this 
information with the Company’s medium-term planning and by checking selected planning 
assumptions against general and industry-specific market expectations."
"We intensively studied the 
parameters used to determine the discount rate applied and assessed the completeness and 
accuracy of the calculation scheme."
"In addition, due to the material significance of goodwill, we 
complementarily performed our own sensitivity analyses for the reportable segments (carrying amount 
in comparison to the recoverable amount)."
"We also consulted internal specialists from the Valuation 
Services department on specific areas of the audit."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

2."
"Presentation of risks arising from product-related legal disputes 
a) Companies of the Bayer Group are involved in both court and out-of-court proceedings with public 
authorities, competitors and other parties."
"These proceedings give rise to legal risks, in particular in the 
areas of product liability, competition and anti-trust law, patent law, tax law and environmental 
protection."
"Lawsuits seeking compensatory and punitive damages have been brought in the United States against 
Monsanto Company, St."
"Louis/U.S.A., (Monsanto), a subsidiary of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, among 
others."
"In one of these litigation complexes, the plaintiffs allege that they were exposed to glyphosate-
based products manufactured by Monsanto, and that the exposure to these products resulted in 
personal injuries."
"In addition, Monsanto has been named in lawsuits brought by various governmental 
entities in the United States, which claim that Monsanto and its predecessor companies, as 
manufacturers of PCBs, are responsible for a variety of damages due to PCBs in the environment, 
including in bodies of water."
"In the above-mentioned litigation complexes, Bayer has successively 
concluded settlement agreements of varying scope with some of the plaintiffs or plaintiffs‘ attorneys 
since 2020 to resolve parts of the litigations concerned."
"Monsanto is also facing several lawsuits 
alleging personal injury and property damage from the use of and exposure to PCB products."
"Whether and to what extent it is necessary to recognize provisions to cover the risk resulting from one 
or more of the present legal disputes is determined to a large extent by estimates and discretionary 
assumptions of the executive directors."
"Against this background and in view of the monetary amount of 
the claims asserted, the above-mentioned product-related disputes of the Bayer Group were, in our 
opinion, of particular significance for the audit."
"The statements made and explanations provided by the executive directors regarding the legal 
disputes mentioned above are contained in section 30 of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"b) As part of our audit, we assessed, among other matters, the process established by the Company to 
recognize court and out-of-court proceedings, estimate their outcomes and appropriately present legal 
disputes in the statement of financial position."
"Moreover, we held regular discussions throughout the 
year with the Company’s internal legal department in order to have current developments and reasons 
that led to the corresponding estimates regarding the expected outcome of the proceedings explained 
to us."
"We critically examined and assessed the respective explanations as well as the information and 
evidence received."
"We also checked the recognition and the measurement of the provisions for the 
settlement agreements already partially concluded as part of the significant litigation complexes by 
performing sample-based comparisons with the underlying settlement agreements."
"The evolution of the 
significant legal disputes, including estimations regarding the possible outcomes of the proceedings, 
was made available to us in writing by the Company."
"As at the reporting date, we furthermore obtained 
and critically assessed external attorney confirmations."
"Taking into account the estimations of the 
Company, we also critically assessed the assumptions underlying the provisions for expected defense 
costs and evaluated the plausibility of the provision amounts based on experience from similar 
proceedings in the past and other evidence."

Other Information 
The executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information."
"The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board and the foreword to the 
compensation report."
"Otherwise the executive directors are 
responsible for the other information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do 
not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of 
assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based 
on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and this combined management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher 
than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"// evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, 
future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"// obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
"// evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial 
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"// perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the 
combined management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in 
particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective 
information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions 
used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the “Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm has applied the requirements of the IDW Quality 
Management Standards."
"1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial 
statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part 
of the financial reporting process."
"We 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit."
"// obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls."
"// evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF 
documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force 
at the reporting date, on the technical specification for this electronic file."
"// evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the 
audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report."
"Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation 
We were elected as group auditor by the shareholders’ meeting on April 28, 2023."
"We were engaged by the 
supervisory board on June 28, 2023."
"We have been the group auditor of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, 
Leverkusen/Germany, without interruption since the financial year 2017."
"We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the additional report 
to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report)."
"OTHER MATTER – USE OF THE AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and 
the audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely 
together with the audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form."
"GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT 
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Michael Mehren."
"Our assurance engagement does not cover external documentation sources mentioned in the 
additional non-financial information."
"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined 
necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial reporting that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that 
are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been 
published in every case."
"Therefore, the executive directors have laid down their own interpretation of the 
EU Taxonomy Regulation and of the Delegated Acts adopted thereon in section 1.8 of the combined 
management report."
They are responsible for the justifiability of this interpretation.
"The legal conformity of 
the interpretation is subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be 
interpreted differently."
"The preciseness and completeness of environmental data of the additional non-financial information is 
subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the way the data was collected and calculated and from 
assumptions made."
"Independence and quality assurance of the independent practitioner 
We have complied with the German professional requirements on independence and other professional 
rules of conduct."
"Responsibilities of the independent practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the additional non-financial information based on our work 
performed within our limited assurance engagement."
"We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements  
(ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor-
mation”, issued by the IAASB."
"The choice of  
assurance work is subject to the practitioner’s professional judgment."
"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive 
directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms."
"The legal conformity of their interpretation and, 
accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently."
"We do not express a conclusion on the external sources of documentation stated in the additional  
non-financial information."
"We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted 
for the Company’s purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the  
result of the assurance engagement."
"Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the 
aforementioned."
"Hence, this report should not be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision."
We are solely responsible to the Company.
"However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties."
Our conclusion was not modified in this respect.
"In this letter I address several key areas of focus for the 
Supervisory Board and realigned Human Resources and Compensation 
Committee in relation to the compensation of the Board of Management:   
1."
"Extensive engagement with stockholders and responsive actions taken 
2."
"2023 pay outcomes and their alignment with company performance 
3."
"Compensation in connection with the appointment of our new CEO 
4."
"Improved compensation system for the Board of Management effective 
for 2024  
 
Supervisory Board actions responsive to stockholder feedback 
Engaging with our stockholders is a top priority for Bayer and the Supervisory Board."
"We regularly meet 
with stockholders representing approximately 40% of shares outstanding (which is 59% of shares held by 
institutional investors) in addition to the normal course, investor relations-driven discussions."
"As 
Supervisory Board Chairman, I lead many of these engagements and am grateful for the constructive 
dialogue with and comprehensive feedback shared by stockholders."
"Since the 2022 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting, a primary focus for these discussions has been on Board of 
Management compensation."
"The feedback from our stockholders is reflected in both the 2023 Compensation Report, which includes 
enhanced disclosures and payouts reflective of performance, and the go-forward compensation system 
effective for 2024 subject to stockholder approval."
"While the views of stockholders varied and were not 
consistent in all areas, we did our best to reflect consensus feedback in our actions while also making a 
commitment to transparency around our decision-making processes."
Details on our responsive actions can be found in the table in Section 1.1.2 of the Compensation Report.
"2023 performance and alignment with pay outcomes 
2023 was a challenging year for Bayer, and we are disappointed with how our company performed overall."
"The Crop Science Division experienced significant headwinds due to declines for glyphosate-based 
products."
"The Pharmaceuticals Division saw declines due to an unfavorable product mix and pricing 
pressure from generics."
"Conversely, the Consumer Health Division, despite unfavorable market dynamics, 
performed well against its peers, through improving operating efficiencies and price management efforts."
"This is based on the below-target attainment levels for all three equally weighted components of 
the STI."
"Core earnings per share, which came in at €6.39 reflecting Bayer’s operational performance, 
resulted in below-target attainment of 0%."
"Free cash flow was €1,311 million, in line with our updated 
guidance, but missed the stretched incentive goal and resulted in attainment of 0%."
"Finally, the Crop 
Science, Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health divisional components, which are based on EBITDA 
margin and sales growth, resulted in attainment levels of 0.0%, 35.0% and 101.5%, respectively."
"Average direct compensation awarded to the Board of Management in 2023 amounted to 13.0% of target 
direct compensation, compared with 87% in 2022 and 92% in 2021, demonstrating strong alignment 
between pay and company performance."
"Compensation in connection with the appointment of our new CEO 
Appointing a new CEO was a top priority of the Supervisory Board in 2023, and it was a task that we 
undertook acknowledging stockholder calls for a change in strategy and leadership."
"We are incredibly 
pleased to have Bill Anderson as our CEO leading us forward as we embark on a refreshed strategy that 
best leverages the tremendous assets of Bayer to drive better performance and overcome our recent 
challenges."
"He was not granted any other one-time 
incentives."
"The Supervisory Board thanks our former CEO, Werner Baumann, for his many years of service with Bayer."
"Werner Baumann is being compensated for the remaining term of his contract (until April 2024) in line with 
his service contract provisions."
"Beyond that, no additional compensation was paid to Werner Baumann, 
and his outstanding LTI tranches are not subject to accelerated vesting or early payment and will be 
earned only if the original performance criteria are met."
"While these three LTI tranches ultimately may not 
pay out, the fair value of the outstanding tranches must be reported as a lump sum in this year’s tables 
based on accounting rules."
"Key changes include:  
// Within the STI 
– Litigation-related expenses will no longer be excluded from the calculation of free cash flow and 
ultimate payout."

"1.1 Review of 2023 
1.1.1."
"Performance in 2023  
Sales of the Bayer Group declined to €47,637 million in 2023."
"Sales at Crop Science fell significantly 
against the strong prior year (Fx & portfolio adj."
"–3.8%1), primarily due to the decline in prices for our 
glyphosate-based products."
Sales at Pharmaceuticals were level with the previous year (Fx & portfolio adj.
"Significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™ and continued sales growth for 
Eylea™ and our Radiology business were mainly offset by declines in China."
"Consumer Health posted an 
increase in sales (Fx & portfolio adj."
"+5.8%1), largely thanks to strong performance in the Dermatology and 
Pain & Cardio categories."
"EBITDA before special items of the Bayer Group fell to €11,706 million, while the EBITDA margin before 
special items decreased from 26.6% in 2022 to 24.6% in 2023."
"Crop Science registered a drop in EBITDA 
before special items (EBITDA margin before special items: 21.7%) that was largely due to the decline in 
prices for our glyphosate-based products."
"Earnings were also diminished by a mainly inflation-related 
increase in the cost of goods sold."
"Pharmaceuticals likewise recorded a decrease in EBITDA before 
special items (EBITDA margin before special items: 28.7%)."
"This was primarily attributable to an 
unfavorable product mix, inflation-driven cost increases, and R&D investments."
"Consumer Health posted 
an increase in EBITDA before special items (EBITDA margin before special items: 23.4%), mainly driven by 
our multi-year efficiency program, price management efforts and sustained sales growth."
"Core earnings per share decreased year on year to €6.39 due to the decline in earnings in the Crop 
Science and Pharmaceuticals divisions."
"Incentivized free cash flow in 2023 came in below target at 
€3.4 billion, resulting in a target attainment level of 0%."
"This was partly due to the aforementioned decline 
in earnings in our core business."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report

"However, the 2021 
Compensation Report was endorsed by only 24.11% of the participating stockholders when it was 
submitted to a vote at the 2022 Annual Stockholders’ Meeting."
"The 2022 Compensation Report was 
presented to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 28, 2023, and approved by 52.33% of the eligible 
votes."
"// Under the compensation system approved in 2020, litigation-related payments were excluded from 
consideration under the definition of the free cash flow component."
"// Under the updated compensation system for 2024, the free cash flow metric in the STI will not be adjusted for 
payments in connection with litigation and will align with values published in the Annual Report."
"Alignment of 
compensation system 
with go-forward strategy 
Some stockholders shared that the updated compensation system should align to the go-forward strategic 
priorities of the new CEO."
"// Metrics within the updated compensation system for 2024 will align to the go-forward strategy, with a focus on 
debt reduction, sales growth and strategy execution in the STI."
"In addition, the weighting of relative TSR in the 
LTI will increase from 40% to 80% to align with the focus on improving the share price."
"Target setting 
Some stockholders would like targets to be ambitious, simple to understand, and aligned with external guidance."
"// As previously committed in 2023, targets will be robust and aligned to capital market guidance (where 
applicable)."
"Extraordinary events 
Some stockholders indicated that the Supervisory Board should be able to adjust payouts in the case of 
extraordinary events, which is not permitted in the current system."
The rationale for any adjustment will be transparently disclosed.
"Long-term stockholder 
alignment  
Some stockholders sought increased alignment of performance measures with the long-term stockholder 
experience, including a more ambitious target attainment level for the relative TSR metric."
"// In the updated compensation system for 2024, the proportion of LTI payout linked to relative TSR will increase 
from 40% to 80% to emphasize alignment with long-term stockholder value creation and focus on improving 
the share price."
"// In addition, the relative TSR metric will now require outperformance of the benchmark index at the 60th 
percentile to achieve target payout."
"Focus on ESG 
Some stockholders sought assurance that ESG would remain a focus in the compensation system."
"// The updated compensation system for 2024 will continue to include sustainability targets weighted as 20%

"Compensation for 
outgoing CEO 
Some stockholders expressed concern that former CEO Werner Baumann would receive inflated compensation 
related to his departure from Bayer."
// Werner Baumann is being compensated for the remaining term of his contract.
"Beyond that, he received no 
additional compensation."
"The value of Werner Baumann’s payout in 2023 reflects our contractual obligations, 
standard market practice and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, associated 
with his salary for the remainder of the term of his contract (through to April 30, 2024)."
"// His outstanding LTI tranches are not subject to accelerated vesting or early payment and are subject to their 
original performance conditions."
"These LTI awards will be earned and paid out only if the performance criteria is

At its meeting on February 8, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG unanimously appointed Bill 
Anderson to become Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) of Bayer, effective June 1, 2023."
"He 
joined Bayer as a member of the Board of Management on April 1, 2023."
"Werner Baumann and the 
Supervisory Board had previously agreed to prematurely terminate Baumann’s contract as a member and 
Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO) of Bayer AG, which had originally been scheduled to end on 
April 30, 2024."
"His service contract and term of office ended by mutual agreement on May 31, 2023."
"At its meeting on August 21, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG unanimously appointed Heike Prinz 
to become a member of the company’s Board of Management, as well as Chief Talent Officer and Labor 
Director, effective September 1, 2023."
"Sarena Lin and the Supervisory Board had previously agreed not to 
extend Lin’s contract as a member of the Board of Management beyond January 31, 2024."
"Her term of 
office ended by mutual agreement on August 31, 2023."
"1.2 Design of Board of Management compensation 
The Supervisory Board sets the Board of Management’s compensation pursuant to Section 87, Paragraph 
1 of the AktG."
"The current compensation system for the Board of Management of Bayer AG applies in the 
version approved by a large majority (94.02%) at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 28, 2020."
"The 
compensation system is submitted to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting for approval whenever significant 
changes are made to this system, or at least every four years."
"As such, a new compensation system will 
be presented to the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 26, 2024."
"A detailed description of the compensation system can be found at www.bayer.com/cpr and 
in Chapter 1.3 (Compensation components in detail)."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report

"Compensation of the Board of Management

1.2.1 Design of compensation system 
The total compensation of the members of the Board of Management of Bayer AG comprises fixed and 
variable components."
"2 In isolated cases, the specific, individual compensation structure in a fiscal year may deviate slightly from the structure presented above due to 
compensation adjustments made during the course of the year."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"The payment is limited 
in either case to the compensation for the remaining term of the respective contract, capped at twice the 
annual compensation."
"Bayer conducts benchmarking with its comparison 
groups at least every three years."
"External comparison of compensation 
The DAX companies, as well as international competitors that are comparable in terms of size and 
industry, serve as a benchmark when setting compensation levels."
"The DAX companies are a suitable primary comparison group, especially in terms of the aspects of size 
and country."
"Bayer’s economic position is factored in by regularly reviewing the company’s relative 
positioning in the DAX in terms of size as measured by sales, number of employees and market 
capitalization."
"On this basis, Bayer aims to ensure its relative positioning within the DAX is in the top third

in terms of target total compensation."
"Reviewing compensation levels and taking into account size criteria 
over time ensures that the compensation the members of the Board of Management of Bayer AG receive 
appropriately reflects the company’s positioning."
"The international comparison group is taken into account as an additional indicator to validate the 
competitiveness of Board of Management compensation on an international level, too."

Development of compensation vs."
"workforce 
In setting Board of Management compensation, the Supervisory Board also takes into account the 
company’s internal compensation structure in Germany."
The Supervisory Board set Bill Anderson’s target compensation as part of the CEO appointment process.
"Appointing a new CEO was one of the Supervisory Board’s top priorities in 2023, with the decision made 
following an extensive selection process."
See the compensation tables in Chapter 3.4 for further details.
"1.2.3 Target-setting and attainment process 
The Supervisory Board aims to set ambitious yet attainable targets that are in step with the expectations of 
investors and the capital market."
"// The targets used in the short-term incentive program are based on the main KPIs employed to measure 
the organization’s operational success in the current fiscal year."
// The targets used in the long-term incentive system are aimed at incentivizing long-term value creation.
"Alongside ROCE and ESG-related KPIs, target attainment is largely dependent on the company’s 
absolute share price development relative to the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return, which serves to ensure 
close alignment between investor interests and management incentivization."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
252
Using the operational planning as a baseline, the Supervisory Board sets a minimum value, a target 
corridor, a maximum value and additional benchmarks at the start of each fiscal year."
"The target values for these objectives are also determined 
on the basis of KPIs where possible."
"After the year has ended, the Supervisory Board evaluates the performance of the Board of Management 
members based on the level of target attainment for the individual financial and nonfinancial KPIs."
"Special 
factors and significant unplanned and nonrecurring effects are evaluated based on the guidelines in place, 
ensuring that they are handled consistently when determining target attainment."
"Special factors and significant unplanned and nonrecurring effects  
Special factors in determining EBITDA before special items and core EPS are described in Chapter 2.3 of 
the Management Report."
"In addition, significant unplanned and nonrecurring effects may arise that cannot 
be planned for with sufficient reliability with respect to their occurrence, timing and magnitude, and that 
may potentially have a significant impact on operational performance in the performance period."
"In line 
with the respective planning assumptions, certain effects can – based on a set catalog of criteria – be 
excluded from consideration when measuring target attainment, provided they exceed certain thresholds."
The Supervisory Board is responsible for making any such decisions.
"In 2023, no adjustments were made due to significant unplanned and nonrecurring effects."
"1.3 Compensation components in detail  
1.3.1 Base compensation  
The base compensation is fixed, contractually agreed annual compensation that is paid out in monthly 
installments within a calendar year."
"The level of fixed compensation reflects the role on the Board of 
Management, the area of responsibility and market conditions."
"1.3.2 Short-term variable cash compensation (STI) for 2023 
The short-term variable cash compensation depends on the success of the business in the respective 
year."
It incentivizes operational success and profitable growth within the defined strategic framework.
"It 
also sets targeted incentives to increase profitability (core EPS) and cash flow (free cash flow) 
development."
"In addition, the individual performance of the Board of Management members is evaluated 
using a performance factor that permits the establishment of further targets, particularly nonfinancial ones."
"The target attainment for the STI depends on the three equally weighted financial components and the 
individual performance factor."
"A cap of 200% is in place for the individual financial target components and 
for the STI overall."
"The components of the short-term variable cash compensation are shown in the 
graphic below."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report

"Using core EPS for 
this component provides specific incentives to raise profitability in the Bayer Group."

"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report

"Compensation of the Board of Management

Group component II 
Group component II is determined by the free cash flow at Group level."
"This component is aimed at 
incentivizing an increase in the cash flow available for paying dividends, reducing debt and making 
acquisitions, and ensures the Bayer Group’s liquidity."
"These payments are therefore irrelevant for setting targets and 
measuring attainment."
"For 2023, the target corridor for the incentivized free cash flow was set at 
€5.0 billion to €5.5 billion."
"The incentivized free cash flow for 2023 came in at €3.4 billion, meaning that 
target attainment fell below the minimum threshold and therefore amounted to 0%."
"Divisional component 
This component is calculated for each division by setting the EBITDA margin before special items against 
currency- and portfolio-adjusted sales growth in a matrix."
"Members of the Board of Management with 
divisional responsibility are assessed solely based on the respective division’s performance, while those 
with functional responsibility are assessed based on the weighted average performance of all divisions."
"This average performance is determined using the following weightings: 45% Crop Science, 45% 
Pharmaceuticals and 10% Consumer Health."
"This matrix serves to specifically incentivize profitable growth 
in each division."
"Growth should only be generated while maintaining profitability, and raising profitability in 
the short term should not be incentivized at the expense of growth."
"At the end of each year, the EBITDA 
margin before special items and the currency- and portfolio-adjusted sales growth actually achieved by the 
individual divisions are compared to the target matrix previously set for that year."
"Failure to meet one of the 
two minimum values results in a target attainment level of 0% for the divisional component."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report

"= currency- and portfolio-adjusted; CS = Crop Science; PH = Pharmaceuticals; CH = Consumer Health

"This resulted in a target attainment level of 25.9% for Board of Management members with functional 
responsibility."
"Performance factor 
In addition, team targets are agreed to reflect the collective responsibility of the members of the Board of 
Management as a governance body."
"These team targets are based on the Group targets set by the Board 
of Management for 2023 and approved by the Supervisory Board."
"For 2023, the team targets were in 
many cases achieved."
"The table below provides an overview of the subject areas along with their specific 
targets and corresponding KPIs."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
Target attainment is evaluated individually following the end of the fiscal year.
The attainment levels for the team and individual targets are evaluated by the Supervisory Board.
"The 
multiplier applied to the attainment of the financial targets can range from 0.8 to 1.2 for each individual 
Board of Management member."
The table below shows the target attainment levels for 2023.
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
257
Payment of the short-term variable compensation (STI)  
The STI is paid out in the following year at the earliest possible opportunity."
"In the event of a Board of 
Management member stepping down before the end of his or her term of office, individual arrangements 
are usually agreed for the LTI tranches granted in that year and in preceding years."
"Since 2020, the annual Aspire 3.0 tranches have been allocated in the form of virtual shares with a 
performance period of four years for each tranche."
"The final number of virtual shares depends on the target attainment levels for the three components: 
relative capital market performance, return on investment and sustainability."
"These three components have 
weightings of 40%, 40% and 20%, respectively."
The sustainability component was introduced in 2021.
"For 
the tranches allocated in fiscal 2020, the relative capital market performance and the return on investment 
therefore each have a 50% weighting."
"To determine the final number of virtual shares, the conditionally 
allocated number of virtual shares is multiplied by the weighted total target attainment of the three (or two, 
as the case may be) components."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
258
The payout is calculated by multiplying the final number of virtual shares by the arithmetic mean of the 
XETRA closing prices for Bayer stock on the 30 stock exchange trading days immediately preceding the 
end of the performance period."
"In addition, the participants receive a dividend equivalent based on the 
sum of the dividends paid on each conditionally allocated virtual share during the four-year period."
"The 
components of the long-term variable cash compensation (LTI) are shown in the graphic below."
"The TSR shows 
how Bayer shares performed over the four-year performance period, including relative share price 
development and hypothetically reinvested gross dividends."
"This takes account of Bayer’s capital market 
performance in relation to the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return."
"The initial and final values for calculating the 
TSR are based on the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices for Bayer stock on the 30 stock 
exchange trading days immediately preceding the start and the end of the respective four-year 
performance period."
"The final value also includes the hypothetically reinvested gross dividends during that 
time."
"Target attainment is determined from the difference between Bayer’s TSR over the period and that of 
the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return."
"If the difference is zero – i.e., performance is on a par with that of the 
index – target attainment is 100%."
"If the difference is more than –30 percentage points, target attainment 
is 0%."
"If the difference equals –30 percentage points, target attainment is 40%."
"If the difference is +50 
percentage points or more, target attainment is 200%."
"The target attainment curve for the relative TSR 
target is given in the graphic below."

The four-year performance period of the 2020 Aspire 3.0 tranche ended in 2023."
"The TSR for this period 
was –45.29% for Bayer and 29.99% for the EURO STOXX 50 Total Return, resulting in a TSR 
outperformance of –75.28 percentage points."
This corresponds to a target attainment level of 0%.
"Return on investment  
The return on investment is based on the return on capital employed (ROCE) at Group level."
"The annual 
comparison of the ROCE to the weighted average cost of capital indicates the value generated by the 
company."
The ROCE is a metric that is applied as part of Bayer’s corporate steering system.
"At the start 
of each tranche, the Supervisory Board sets a minimum value, a target corridor, a maximum value and 
additional benchmarks for ROCE in the final year of the four-year performance period."
"The minimum value 
is based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the date the respective tranche is issued."
"The 
target corridor for 100% target attainment is based on the WACC and an ambitious premium."
"At the end of 
the four-year performance period, the ROCE achieved in the final year of the performance period is 
compared to the target corridor set for that tranche of the LTI."
"If the target corridor has been achieved, 
target attainment is 100%."
"If performance is above or below the target corridor, target attainment 
corresponds to the target function within an interval of 0% to 200%."
"Actual ROCE 
came in at 0.7%, corresponding to a target attainment level of 0%."
"Sustainability  
Starting with the 2021 tranche, the Supervisory Board defines specific sustainability targets for the four-
year performance period that are taken into account with a weighting of 20%."
"Sustainability targets at both 
divisional and Group level can be taken into account."
"Furthermore, they are an integral part of the business strategy, 
providing access to new customer groups and contributing to greater supply security, for example."
"All the 
sustainability targets below are given the same weighting."
"The Supervisory Board also set a minimum 
value, a target corridor and a maximum value for the individual sustainability targets."
"If performance is 
above or below the target corridor, the target attainment corresponds to a target function within an interval 
of 0% to 200%."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023

"Where applicable, any 
adjustments the Supervisory Board makes to sustainability target values will also be explained, along with 
the reasoning behind those changes."

amount that deviates from the sum actually paid out."
"4 Prorated entitlement (11/12) due to join date of February 1, 2021 
 
1.3.4 Fringe benefits 
Fringe benefits include costs assumed by the company for health screening and various work-related 
insurance policies."
"Each member of the Board of Management has access to a company car, including a 
driver, for business and a reasonable amount of private use, or receives a corresponding budget."
"In 
addition, the company pays the cost of security installations at each member’s private residence."
"Work-
related moving expenses are either individually reimbursed or compensated in the form of a flat-rate 
allowance."
"Any indemnity payments to new members of the Board of Management for variable 
compensation forfeited on termination of previous employment also constitute fringe benefits."
"1.3.5 Pension entitlement/installment  
Members of the Board of Management appointed after January 1, 2020, are not entitled to a company 
pension plan but instead receive a pension installment, which is paid out directly."
"The pension installment 
is equivalent to 40% of the respective base compensation."
"For the company, this avoids all the interest-
rate and biometric risks involved in financing a pension entitlement, and also eliminates the complex 
actuarial calculations and administrative procedures involved."
"In addition, it means that the members of the 
Board of Management are responsible for making their own pension arrangements."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
263
Members of the Board of Management appointed prior to January 1, 2020, retain their contribution-based 
pension entitlements."
"Bayer makes company contributions to complement the personal contributions of 
2% up to the ceiling for statutory pension contributions in Germany."
"The company contributions are 
currently set at 8% to Bayer-Pensionskasse or 2% to Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG on fixed annual 
compensation up to the ceiling for statutory pension contributions in Germany."
"In addition, Bayer provides 
a hypothetical annual contribution equal to 42% of the amount by which the respective base compensation 
exceeds that ceiling."
"This percentage is comprised of a basic contribution of 6% and a matching 
contribution of 36%, which is four times the member’s personal contribution of 9%."
"The total annual 
contribution is converted into a pension component according to the annuity table for the applicable tariff 
of the Rheinische Pensionskasse VVaG pension fund."
"Future pension payments are reviewed annually and 
adjusted in line with the respective entitlements."
"If the contract of a member of the Board of Management is terminated due to permanent incapacity to 
work before he or she reaches the age of 60, an invalidity pension is granted."
"As of May 1, 2016, the day he 
was appointed Chairman of the Board of Management (CEO), his pension was switched over to a 
contribution-based entitlement."
"In connection with this, he received an additional, vested entitlement to 
an annual pension of €200 thousand starting on his 60th birthday."
"Baumann was granted the option of 
receiving his pension entitlements from Bayer AG or its subsidiaries as a one-time payment (excluding 
the entitlements existing with the Bayer-Pensionskasse pension fund)."
"If he exercises this option, which 
is available until December 31, 2027, the pension entitlements will be settled with a one-time payment in 
the amount of the provisions established according to IFRS."
"// In view of his split contract, Heiko Schipper participates in pension plans in Germany (30%) – for his 
service on the Board of Management of Bayer AG – and in Switzerland (70%) – under his contract as 
head of Consumer Health at BCC AG in Basel – on a prorated basis."
"Schipper’s pension entitlement in 
Switzerland arises from a defined benefit plan in which contributions accumulate in an account and are 
then disbursed as a retirement annuity."
Certain assets are administered by Bayer Pension Trust e.
"under a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) 
to cover pension entitlements resulting from direct commitments in Germany."
"This provides substantial 
additional security – beyond the benefits from the Pension Insurance Association – for the respective 
pension entitlements of the Board of Management members and other managerial employees in Germany."
"The service cost according to IFRS is calculated based on contractual obligations and actuarial 
assumptions."
"It reflects the amount, calculated actuarially, that was earned by the respective Board of 
Management member in the respective year through their work and that was recognized through profit or 
loss."
"It corresponds to the present value of the newly earned future pension payments, and is impacted by 
updated actuarial adjustments."
"The service cost does not reflect a payout amount or payments currently 
being made to Board of Management members."
"A lower discount rate at the start of the year, higher 
anticipated salary and pension increases, and a shorter vesting period in years are factors that result in a 
higher service cost."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
264
The current service cost for the pension entitlements of the Board of Management members recognized in 
2023 according to IFRS was €1,707 thousand (2022: €2,284 thousand)."
"The following table shows the 
service cost according to IFRS and the settlement or present value of the pension obligations attributable 
to the individual members of the Board of Management."

2 The service cost for the pension entitlements earned in the period up until his departure amounted to €458 thousand.
"The service cost for the 
pension component granted in conjunction with his termination agreement amounted to €864 thousand."
The service cost according to IFRS can therefore fluctuate from one year to the next.
"The existing pension 
entitlements of a Board of Management member cannot legally be unilaterally adjusted by Bayer."
"1.3.6 Caps on variable compensation components and total compensation  
If targets are not attained, variable compensation can fall to as low as zero."
"However, if targets are clearly 
exceeded, the payout is limited to 200% (STI cap) or 250% (LTI cap) of the individual target amount."
"The Supervisory Board has set an absolute amount in euros for the maximum total compensation granted 
in a fiscal year pursuant to Section 87a, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2, No.1 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act."
"The maximum total annual compensation is €12 million for the Chairman of the Board of Management 
(CEO) and €7.5 million for the other members of the Board of Management."
"This means that for fiscal years 2021 to 2023, this can only be reported on after 
expiration of the respective LTI four-year performance periods."
"The respective actual compensation levels for the 2020 reference year were significantly below the 
established maximum compensation levels for all Board of Management members."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"The Supervisory Board may, in the 
proper exercise of its discretion, also require that all or part of any gross amount that has already been 
paid out be repaid to the company (clawback)."
"This applies even if the defectiveness of the 
consolidated financial statements is not attributable to any fault on the part of the members of the Board of 
Management."
"Irrespective of the above, a legal basis also exists for payment reductions or regress in the 
event of a damaging breach of duty by members of the Board of Management."
"In 2023, the Supervisory Board did not see any cause to reduce any variable compensation that had not 
yet been paid out (malus) or reclaim variable compensation that had already been paid out (clawback)."
"1.3.8 Share Ownership Guidelines 
The Bayer Share Ownership Guidelines are also an integral factor in the compensation system."
"They serve 
to further align the interests of the Board of Management with those of our stockholders and to strengthen 
sustainable development."
"Under the Bayer Share Ownership Guidelines, members of the Board of 
Management are required to build substantial positions in Bayer shares within four years of joining the 
Board."
"They must purchase shares to the value of 200% of base compensation in the case of the 
Chairman (CEO) and 100% in the case of the other members of the Board of Management, and retain 
them for the remainder of their service on the Board of Management and for two years thereafter."
"If they 
cannot provide evidence of this share ownership, they will not be entitled to payment of the LTI."
"The virtual 
shares allocated as part of the LTI program do not count toward the number of Bayer shares to be 
purchased under the Share Ownership Guidelines."
"An overview of the current Share Ownership Guidelines can be found below: 
C 1.3/16 
Share Ownership Guidelines – Status 
Serving Board of Management members as of Dec."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
1."
"Compensation of the Board of Management 
266
Payments of variable compensation are made on the dates and at the conditions originally agreed, and are 
not brought forward."
"In doing so, Bayer observes the principles of good corporate governance: LTI 
allocations already granted are paid out to departing Board of Management members according to the 
original payment plans and calculated according to the previously agreed rules."
"Change of control 
To ensure their independence, members of the Board of Management are also entitled to a severance 
payment in the event of a change of control as defined in the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover 
Act, provided certain narrow conditions are met."
"This entitlement does not exist if termination takes place for cause as defined in 
Section 626 of the German Civil Code."
"Post-contractual noncompete agreements 
Post-contractual noncompete agreements are in place with the members of the Board of Management, 
providing for indemnity payments to be made by the company for the two-year noncompete period."
"The 
indemnity payment for each of the two years amounts to 100% of a member’s average base compensation 
for the 12 months preceding his or her departure."
"In the event a service contract is terminated early, any 
severance payment for the remaining part of the original term of the contract is deducted from the 
indemnity payment."
"Upon contract termination, the company may waive the post-contractual noncompete 
agreement, in which case no indemnity is paid."
"Unfitness for work 
In the event of temporary unfitness for work, members of the Board of Management continue to receive 
their contractually agreed compensation."
"If a Board of Management member has been continuously unfit 
for work for at least 18 months and is likely to be permanently incapable of fully performing his or her 
duties (permanent incapacity to work), the Supervisory Board may terminate his or her service contract 
early."
"1.3.10 Payment for service on governance bodies and third-party compensation 
Any compensation a member of the Board of Management receives for service on the supervisory board of 
a Bayer Group company is deducted from his or her base compensation."
"Any membership in a supervisory 
board of a company outside the Bayer Group must be approved in advance by the Supervisory Board."
"Where a member of the Board of Management serves on the supervisory board of a company outside the 
Bayer Group, the Supervisory Board of Bayer Aktiengesellschaft decides whether and to what extent a 
deduction is to be made."
"No deductions are being made for Board of Management members currently 
serving on external supervisory boards."
"No member of the Board of Management received compensation from a third party in 2023 for serving on 
their management and/or supervisory boards."

3 Heike Prinz’ fringe benefits for 2023 include a one-time relocation assistance payment of €25 thousand.
"1.4.2 Compensation awarded and due 
The tables below show all fixed and variable compensation components along with their respective relative 
shares for each member of the Board of Management."
"Awarded compensation encompasses 
compensation for services that have been fully rendered once the fiscal year ends, even though actual 
payment will not be made until the subsequent fiscal year."
"Due compensation comprises compensation 
that is legally due but has not yet actually been paid out to the Board of Management member."
"The fact that the payouts will not actually be made until the subsequent year is overlooked in 
order to present the link between the compensation and performance of the Board of Management in the 
same period."
"Werner Baumann and Sarena Lin stepped down from the Board of Management of Bayer AG by mutual 
agreement effective May 31, 2023, and August 31, 2023, respectively."
"The compensation entitlements 
earned until the respective departure date are contained in the table for Board of Management members 
who stepped down in 2023."
"In line with the Board of Management compensation system, standard market 
practice and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (especially G."
"13), Werner 
Baumann and Sarena Lin have been granted compensation for the remaining terms of their service 
contracts, as well as an indemnity payment due to their post-contractual noncompete agreements."
"The payouts will be based on the originally agreed conditions, and will not be

"However, as the work duties required for earning the Aspire tranches were performed in 
full, the Aspire tranches need to be presented as awarded compensation according to Section 162 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The respective compensation data shown in the table 
“Compensation Awarded and Due to Former Board of Management Members” merely reflects the 
provisions established based on the fair value as of December 31, 2023."
"Payment will not be brought 
forward."
"The actual payments at the end of the respective four-year performance period may therefore 
deviate considerably from the values shown."
"The service cost according to IFRS is additionally shown as a part of Board of Management compensation,

"The STI for the period June 1, 2023, until December 31, 
2023, is to be paid out based on the actual level of target attainment, with the individual performance factor set at 1.0."
"Target attainment for 
both the STI for the period January 1, 2024, until April 30, 2024, and the 2024 LTI tranche was set at 100%."

is offset against both the compensation for the remaining term of his service contract and future pension payments."
"The severance cap set out 
in Recommendation G.13 of the April 28, 2022, version of the German Corporate Governance Code – twice the annual compensation – is 
therefore not exceeded."

"This 
compensation exclusively covers the commitments she would have been entitled to had her service contract run for the original term."
"This 
includes base compensation, fringe benefits, STI, LTI and pension installment, in each case for the period September 1, 2023, until January 31, 
2024."
The prorated 2024 LTI tranche is subject to such a tranche actually being granted.
"The STI for the period September 1, 2023, until

compensation for each of the two years and is offset against the compensation for the remaining term of her service contract."
"The severance 
cap set out in Recommendation G.13 of the April 28, 2022, version of the German Corporate Governance Code – twice the annual 
compensation – is therefore not exceeded."
"4 The total compensation awarded to Werner Baumann in 2023 amounted to €7,637 thousand, comprising €822 thousand as a serving Board of

"Compensation of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board is compensated based on the relevant provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, 
which were last amended by the resolution adopted at the Annual Stockholders’ Meeting on April 27, 
2021."
"2.1 Principles applied for Supervisory Board compensation 
A company’s Supervisory Board is tasked with advising and supervising the Board of Management, which 
directs the company and its business on its own responsibility."
"Pursuant to Section 113, Paragraph 1, 
Sentence 3 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation of Supervisory Board 
members should bear a reasonable relation to their tasks and the company’s situation."
"In setting 
Supervisory Board compensation, consideration should be given to the demands of the office of the 
Supervisory Board member, the time involved and the responsibility borne by the Supervisory Board 
members for the company."
"Appropriate Supervisory Board compensation ensures that a company will 
remain able to attract outstandingly qualified domestic and international candidates as Supervisory Board 
members."
"Supervisory Board compensation thus contributes sustainably to advancing a company’s 
business strategy and to its long-term development."
"2.2 Design of Supervisory Board compensation 
The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation and additional compensation 
for chairing and membership of Supervisory Board committees, plus reimbursement of their expenses."
"In 
accordance with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, additional 
compensation is paid to the Chairman and Vice Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board, and for chairing 
and membership of committees."
"In addition, Supervisory Board members receive an attendance fee each 
time they take part in a meeting of the Supervisory Board or of a committee."
"Bayer Annual Report 2023 
C Compensation Report
2."
"If less than 85% of the fixed compensation is 
transferred, the voluntary pledge applies to the portion not transferred."
"By voluntarily pledging to invest in 
and hold Bayer shares, the Supervisory Board members reinforce their interest in the company’s long-
term success."
"The tables below show the components of the compensation awarded and due to each 
Supervisory Board member as well as the relative shares of the respective components in overall 
compensation."
"Awarded compensation encompasses compensation for services that have been fully 
rendered once the fiscal year ends."

"2 There is always a difference between the compensation awarded in previous years (due to a Board of Management member having fully 
performed their work duties up until their departure) and the actual payout effected years later under an LTI program."
"If the actual payout is 
lower than the awarded compensation shown for the previous years, it results in a negative amount being presented."
"If the payout is higher 
than the awarded compensation originally shown, it results in a positive amount being presented."
"Since the payout is only ever effected in the 
year after the four-year performance period ends, the above difference is not shown as awarded until the year of the payout in the case of 
departed Board of Management members."
"For serving Board of Management members, however, this takes place in the fourth year of the 
performance period."
"As such, pursuant to Section 162 of the Stock Corporation Act, no awarded compensation is usually shown for former 
Board of Management members in the year after they step down."
"3 During the last year of service on the Board of Management, various agreements may potentially be reached under the respective termination 
agreements with respect to severance payments to cover compensation components already granted as well as indemnity payments."
"The 
severance payments comprise, for example, base compensation, STI and LTI and pension entitlements granted to them under their original 
Board of Management contract until its termination."
"4 For technical reasons, the average compensation paid to employees is presented on an FTE basis, while Board of Management compensation 
is not."
"For nonmanagerial employees, the 13th monthly salary and the contractually agreed vacation bonus were taken into 
account."
"Fringe benefits taken into account comprised employer contributions to social insurance and, for eligible employee groups, the 
budget provided for a company car."
"Expenditures for other fringe benefits (such as home security equipment or indemnity payments for lapsed 
variable compensation components granted by former employers) were not taken into account due to their irregular nature."
"We have not audited the content of the foreword by the chairman of the 
supervisory board that goes beyond the scope of Section 162 AktG nor the section “Overview of 
Compensation in 2023”."
"Auditor’s Responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this compensation report, including the related disclosures, 
based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards  
for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"These Standards 
require that we fulfill the professional responsibilities and that we plan and perform the audit so that we 
obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the compensation report, including the related disclosures, is 
free from material misstatements."
"An audit involves performing audit procedures in order to obtain audit evidence for the amounts stated in 
the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"The choice of the audit procedures is subject 
to the auditor’s professional judgment."
"This includes assessing the risk of material misstatements, whether 
due to fraud or error, in the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"In assessing these 
risks, the auditor considers the system of internal control, which is relevant to preparing the compensation 
report, including the related disclosures."
"Our objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an audit opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Company’s system of internal control."
"An audit also comprises an evaluation of the accounting policies 
used, of the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the executive directors and the supervisory 
board as well as an evaluation of the overall presentation of the compensation report, including the related 
disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  
our audit opinion."
"Audit Opinion 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the compensation report for the 
financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, including the related disclosures, complies, in all 
material respects, with the accounting principles of Section 162 AktG."
"Our audit opinion on the 
compensation report does not cover the content of the above-mentioned foreword by the chairman of  
the supervisory board that goes beyond the scope of Section 162 AktG nor the section “Overview of 
Compensation in 2023”."
"Since our audit 
opinion on the audit of the content is unmodified, this audit opinion includes that the disclosures required 
under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG are contained, in all material respects, in the compensation report."
"Other Information 
The supervisory board is responsible for the other information."
"The other information comprises the 
foreword by the chairman of the supervisory board on the compensation report and the section “Overview 
of Compensation in 2023”."
"Our audit opinion on the compensation report does not cover the other information, and consequently we 
do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.
"Intended Use of the Report  
We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company."
"The audit has been 
performed for the purposes of the Company and the report is solely intended to inform the Company 
about the result of the audit."
"Liability  
This report is not intended to be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision."
