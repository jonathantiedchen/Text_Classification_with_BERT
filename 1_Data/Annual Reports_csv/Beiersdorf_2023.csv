Skin cell rejuvenation is possible in 
principle."
"This is backed up by the results of 
intensive research in the field of epigenetics 
conducted by Beiersdorf scientists for 
over 15 years."

corresponding active ingredients could 
soon be on the market."

Turning back 
the skin’s 
“age clock”

ANNUAL REPORT 2023
Gene reactivation
Looking young into old age is 
 
something many people dream of 
while knowing it is not possible."
"But 
research shows that how we age is 
by no means predetermined."
"The 
assumption that the aging process 
is solely genetic is also wrong."
"This is 
because the appearance of our skin is 
influenced by many external factors: 
diet and exercise, stress and sleep 
patterns, sun exposure and lifestyle, 
and many other aspects."
"“And since 
our skin cells ‘use’ genes – for exam-
ple to renew and repair themselves 
– these external factors also have an 
effect on the activity of the genes."
"They can even block or silence 
 
genes,” explains Dr. Marc Winnefeld, 
Head of the Applied Skin Research 
Department at Beiersdorf."
"Pioneers of epigenetics
The good news is that blocked and 
silenced genes can be reactivated – 
and thus improve the appearance of 
the skin again."
"Exactly how this works 
is the subject of the research field of 
epigenetics – a discipline that has 
been making great strides since the 
early 2000s."
"Beiersdorf is one of the pioneers 
of epigenetic skin research."
"Since 
2008, an interdisciplinary team of 
20 specialists has been looking into 
epigenetic changes to the skin as it 
ages."
"The goal: to use the individual 
epigenetic pattern to find out which 
blockages contribute to skin aging 
and how they can be resolved."
"New evolutionary stage 
 
“In recent years, we have analyzed 
skin samples from more than 1,000 
people and measured over 850,000 
methylation sites per person,” says 
Dr. Elke Grönniger, Head of the 
 
Skin Aging Laboratory at Beiersdorf."
"“With the help of these methylation 
sites, we can find out which block- 
ages are associated with skin aging.” 
The findings were incorporated in 
an “age clock” of skin cells."
"This is 
an algorithm that helps to find skin 
care solutions with epigenetic active 
ingredients for skin rejuvenation."
"Around 50,000 substances and ex- 
tracts have now been scrutinized to 
identify and qualify natural active 
 
ingredients for skin rejuvenation."
"Many scientists associate epigenetics 
with a new evolutionary stage in anti- 
aging because it makes it possible to 
fundamentally rejuvenate skin cells, 
not just compensate for individual 
deficits."
"“Research is now within 
touching distance of a substantial 
epigenetic rejuvenation of the skin,” 
says Dr. Marc Winnefeld."
"We are planning to launch the first 
product with corresponding active 
ingredients in the near future."
"We 
will then gradually introduce further 
products to the market and integrate 
them into our various ranges."
"Given the pace of research, we 
 
assume that there will be numerous 
product innovations in the coming 
years."
"Their active ingredients will come 
ever closer to the goal of not only 
stopping the aging process, but also 
actually rejuvenating skin cells."
"Bringing 
together 
people 
with 
 
different expertise and experience 
and forming interdisciplinary teams 
is crucial, which is why we always 
strive for integrated and cross-de-
partmental collaboration."

“Sales in the sub-Saharan region were 
unusually high last year."
"They climbed 
by more than 60 percent in Nigeria 
and over 20 percent in South Africa,” 
says Godwin Harrison, the Managing 
Director of Beiersdorf South Africa."
"“We think this strong growth will con-
tinue in 2024 as well."
"The growth will 
be fueled by rising purchasing power 
and an expanding middle class that 
loves such brands as NIVEA because 
these products enable them to look 
great and feel good.”
The most successful product by far: 
NIVEA Body Lotion."
"No other country 
in the world sells as much NIVEA 
Body Lotion as South Africa."
"The 
 
NIVEA Radiant & Beauty Lotion, a 
product that was specially developed 
for the African market and melanin-
rich skin, is particularly popular."
"“In South Africa and Nigeria, 70 per-
cent of the population is younger 
than 35."
"This is why we are focusing 
in particular on this target group and 
are increasingly communicating with 
members of this group via digital

"E-commerce is not yet very 
well developed, but that will change

INDIA  
Targeting GenZ
“We have been active in India for around 
20 years and have grown very dynami-
cally in the process,” says Sunil Gadgil, 
the Marketing Director of Beiersdorf in 
India."
"“And the next 20 years will also be 
very dynamic."
"The Indian market offers 
all sorts of growth potential to us."
"In ur-
ban India, NIVEA is now one of the most 
trusted brands in skin care, particularly 
among young people."
"“This is why we think that we have a 
good opportunity to accelerate the 
market penetration of our iconic skin 
care products like NIVEA Soft and 
 
NIVEA Body Milk."
"NIVEA Soft even has 
the potential to become ‘the first skin 
care product’ among India’s adoles-
cents."
"We intend to increase our mar-
ket share in the body care category, 
expand our global product range and 
enter the face care market, an area that 
is many times larger than the skin care 
market."
"We also view the introduction 
of value-added body care products as 
a way of offering something extra to our 
existing customers."
"In the process, we 
will focus on having a strong presence 
in retail stores and in urban markets."
"“We are optimally positioned to seize 
these growth opportunities."
"After all, 
NIVEA has tremendous brand value."
"“Young people in particular 
invest an enormous amount of time and 
effort to look as perfect and young as 
possible."
"More than in any other region 
in the world, they are intensively en-
gaged with the products and are 
 
impressively well informed about active 
 
ingredients and other ingredients used.”
Not least because of this, China, Korea, 
and Japan are among the five largest 
skin care markets in the world."
"How- 
ever, the markets in Thailand and In-
donesia are also developing extremely 
dynamically."
"This is because many con-
sumers in these countries see a close 
relationship between good looks and 
 
a successful life."
"“Market conditions vary greatly from 
country to country."
"But all countries 
have one thing in common: They place 
a high priority on innovation and highly 
effective ingredients."
"This is why we 
pick up on trends at an 
early stage and explain 
our products inten- 
sively on social media."
"“Women in Circularity” 
strengthens the circular economy in 
emerging economies and collects and 
 
recycles around 15,000 metric tons of 
plastic annually."
"More than 1,600 women 
benefit from the initiative by gaining 
 
income and development opportunities 
that strengthen themselves, their families, 
and their communities."
"Clinical studies and 
intensive collaboration with dermatologists 
have been instrumental in this success."
"“It is a process in which 
dermatologists play a key role."
"We 
work together with them to study the 
objective condition of the skin before 
treatment and the improvement of 
the skin’s condition following the 
 
application of our dermocosmetic 
products.”
In 2023, about 140 such trials were 
conducted for Eucerin alone."
"“This 
close working relationship with der-
matologists is part of Eucerin’s DNA,” 
Dr. Zorica Milinic adds."
"“Eucerin is the 
first dermocosmetic skin care brand 
in the world."
"Its success is based on 
groundbreaking scientific work and 
LIFE-CHANGING POWER  
Scientifically proven effect
trail-blazing innovations."
"Following the successful introduc-
tion of Thiamidol in the anti-pigment, 
acne, sun and anti-aging series, 
the active ingredient is increasingly 
being used in Eucerin body care."
"“Last year, we achieved our goal of 
breaking the €1 billion barrier in sales 
much earlier than planned."
"We really 
believe that the rapid-paced growth 
will continue."
"And scientific studies 
and a close working relationship 
with skin experts from all parts of the 
world will do their part here as well.”
LATIN AMERICA 
In the fast lane
We’ve seen demand for Eucerin and 
Aquaphor 
increase 
considerably 
across all regions of the world."
"But 
the most impressive growth rates 
have been in Latin America: “With an 
 
average yearly growth rate of 30% 
during the last five years, the Derma 
business has been overwhelmingly 
successful here,” says Ivan Reyes, 
Head of Derma Latin America at 
 
Beiersdorf."
"“We expect that this trend 
will continue for some years to come.”
One reason for this is that Latin Ameri- 
can consumers really like Eucerin and 
Aquaphor, particularly in the cate- 
gories of sun care, hyperpigmentation, 
and acne."
"These are areas where the 
patented active ingredient Thiamidol 
plays a key role."
"Another reason is the 
tremendous growth potential."
"Even 
though Beiersdorf’s Derma products 
are well-established in various re- 
gions of Latin America, such countries 
as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia have 
huge growth potential that is just 
 
waiting to be tapped."
"“We intend to 
accelerate the pace of our Derma 
 
business by working closely with 
dermatologists, conducting digital 
marketing and e-commerce – and 
improving the lives of people in Latin 
America who suffer from skin prob- 
lems over the long term,” Reyes says."

"To change 
this situation, Beiersdorf’s Derma 
brands have created a social 
 
mission: Eucerin and Aquaphor 
are involved in social projects in 
15 countries to improve the lives 
of people with skin ailments."
"A large number of different skin 
ailments are addressed: In the 
United 
States, 
Beiersdorf 
is 
 
working with the Foundation for 
Ichthyosis & Related Skin Types 
(FIRST) to support young adults 
with ichthyosis."
"In Italy, the com-
pany is collaborating with the 
International Institute for Social 
Medicine and Anthropology to 
provide both dermatological and 
 
psychological care to home-
less people."
"And in Germany, 
 
Beiersdorf is campaigning to put 
an end to the stigmatization sur-
rounding psoriasis in an alliance 
with the Hamburg-Eppendorf 
University Medical Center and the 
German Psoriasis Association."
"•
A new packaging concept for Eucerin’s 
 
Hyaluron-Fillers has been developed: When 
a cream is used up, only the inner jar 
 
containing fresh cream will serve as a refill 
package."
The outer jar and lid can be reused.
"This change will reduce plastic consumption 
from 89 grams to 8 grams of packaging 
weight – a reduction of about 90 percent."
"Another milestone: Since the end of 2023, 
the entire Eucerin cosmetics range has 
 
been free from microplastics1."

"In the immediate vicinity, a 
hub for Beiersdorf’s European supply 
chain network will also be built by 
2027 with an investment volume of 
over €200 million."
"The high level of investment in

CARE BEYOND SKIN."
"The 
 
facility meets the very highest 
environmental standards."
"The 
plant’s new technical capabil-
ities will enable the company 
to introduce innovative and 
more sustainable packaging 
solutions to the marketplace 
 
– including aerosol cans made 
of recycled aluminum."
"By using renewable energies 
and biogas to generate heat, 
the plant is nearly 100 per-
cent carbon neutral."
"Valuable 
resources such as heat, waste- 
water, and ethanol will be 
 
recovered and recycled at the 
new plant."
"The company plans to operate 
the plant as an Energy+ site 
and produce more electricity 
than it uses, thanks in part to 
photovoltaics."
"“We have a very experienced, highly 
 
qualified team here that always finds 
practicable solutions and ensures full 
production efficiency,” says the head of 
Beiersdorf’s plant in Poznań, Poland."
"The site has been systematically ex- 
panded since 2020 and around 150 
 
additional employees have been hired 
since then."
"The work should be com-
pleted in the coming year."
"The plant in 
Poznań will then be one of the largest 
production units in the entire Group."
“Face care is the heart of our portfolio.
"It must be continuously improved in 
order to keep up with the latest trends 
and set new competitive standards,” 
Natalia Koryzna says."
"“This is why we 
have specialized in the introduction and 
scaling of new compounding technolo-
gies and packaging formats."
"Dwi Mudriah: “Demand for our de-
odorants and body care products in In-
donesia has been growing by around 20 
percent annually for years."
"That is why 
we increased the plant’s compounding 
and production capacity between 2020 
and 2022 by 140 percent."
"Dwi Mudriah: “Firstly, the Indonesian 
government has introduced restric- 
tions on the import of goods, including 
cosmetics – primarily to protect local 
manufacturers."
"Secondly, it allows us 
to produce more specific products for 
 
target groups."
"This is important because 
 
all products for the Indonesian market 
will have to meet halal requirements 
by 2026."
"To achieve this, not only the 
 
products but also the production 
 
processes must be halal-certified.”
There is an above-average number 
of women in the supply chain team."
"Dwi Mudriah: “In fact, around 60 
percent of my team is female."
"This is 
 
because the proportion of working 
 
women in Indonesia is very high."
"But it is 
also the result of our efforts to promote 
 
diversity."
"The new tesa site in Haiphong was 
built in just 18 months."
"It will pro- 
duce 40 million square meters of 
 
adhesive tape annually, especially for 
the automotive and electronics indus-
tries."
"“We are proud of what the team 
has achieved within this ambitious 
schedule."
"The site, which was built 
in accordance with the LEED Gold 
Standard, has expanded our regional 
production capacities, meaning that 
we can supply our customers even 
faster and in a more targeted manner."
"In addition, 50 percent of the pro-
ducts manufactured in Haiphong 
are water-based adhesives,” says 
Stefan Schmidt, Head of tesa Supply 
 
Network."
"tesa is also pursuing the goal of more 
sustainable production at its site in 
the United States, which has been ex-
panded to a total area of over 16,000 
square meters."
"“Thanks to the new 
solvent-free production facilities, the 
tesa site in Sparta has been able to 
significantly reduce its carbon foot-
print."
"This is an important milestone 
on the road to climate-neutral pro-
duction by 2030."
"In addition, in the 
new Customer Solution Center, we 
can test products and application 
solutions extensively on-site with our 
North American customers and start 
production as quickly as possible,” 
adds Schmidt."
"The global expansion of the produc-
tion network is making supply chains 
more resilient and shorter."

ANNUAL REPORT 2023

Dear Shareholders, dear Readers,
The year 2023 was exciting, it was challenging, it was intense — and it was a compelling illustration of 
Beiersdorf’s successful and progressive course of recent years."
"It underscored our momentum and 
showcased our robust and crisis-resistant business model."
"The past year was one of geopolitical volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties, which sadly led to 
horrendous suffering and humanitarian tragedies in several parts of our world."
"We all hope these 
conflicts will be brought to a peaceful end as soon as possible."
"Simultaneously, the pressure concerning 
societal or sustainable issues remains high, and rightfully so."
"We can neither foresee nor control the 
majority of these volatile factors and developments, but we can face up to them, remain confident in 
our long-term course, keep growing, and take responsibility regarding the most pressing issues of our 
time."
That is what we did in 2023.
That is how we succeeded in 2023.
"And that is how we are setting the 
course for a promising future."
"The adverse market conditions fostered an exceptional sense of unity within the international Beiersdorf 
team, which is why I am particularly proud that Beiersdorf’s excellent performance of recent years 
continued with record sales in 2023, fueled by outstanding double-digit organic sales growth."
"We were 
the fastest-growing beauty company in the world in the past year."
We saw rising demand in all regions.
"Our trusted iconic brands, our deep understanding of ever-changing consumer needs, and our 
fantastic people once more collectively proved to be a dependable, strong, and future-ready partner 
for our shareholders."
"At the same time and despite significant 
investments, the operating result (EBIT), excluding special factors, increased from €1,158 million in 
2022 to €1,268 million, resulting in an improved EBIT margin of 13.4% (previous year: 13.2%)."
"The main 
sales driver was our Consumer Business Segment, with the NIVEA and Labello business (16.2% organic 
sales growth) as well as our Derma brands Eucerin and Aquaphor (24.0% organic sales growth) at the 
head of the line with outstanding results."
"Overall, the capital markets recognized the strong

performance as well as the upcoming opportunities for Beiersdorf with a very positive share price 
performance in 2023."
"We finished the year with a stock price of €135.70, and thereby 26.6% above the 
year-end price in 2022."
"The tesa business segment achieved sales of €1,667 million despite a 
challenging market environment."
In organic terms sales grew by 3.2%.
"Main drivers of this positive 
development were the automotive business which achieved double-digit growth in 2023 and the 
Consumer as well as the Industry division which both grew slightly."
"Following this exceptional business performance of Beiersdorf in recent years, the Executive and 
Supervisory Boards plan to increase the dividend for fiscal year 2023."
"With a significant increase of 43% 
to the previous year, a dividend of €1.00 per dividend-bearing share will be proposed to the Annual 
General Meeting on April 18, 2024, and thus enable our shareholders to participate in Beiersdorf’s 
profitable growth."
"At the same time, Beiersdorf will also start a share buyback program equivalent to up 
to €500 million."
"Getting future-ready to become the best skin care company
So, we are on the right path and our strategic choices are yielding the intended results."
"This success 
instills a strong confidence in our vision to become the best skin care company, a goal that requires 
continuous effort and an unwillingness to rest on our laurels."
"Consequently, 2023 was a year marked by 
substantial investments aimed at ensuring the long-term success of our company."
We invested heavily in our global supply chain as well as in our digital infrastructure in the past year.
"The investments in our production sites adhered to the highest environmental and technological 
standards, thus enabling long-term and sustainable growth of our brands."
"Our new site in Leipzig 
(Germany), with a capacity of up to 450 million products per year, started producing in September 2023 
and is already one of the largest Beiersdorf plants on the globe."
"Our plants in Poznań (Poland) and Silao 
(Mexico) will follow this state-of-the-art blueprint in 2024."
"An important milestone on the digital front 
was the seamless switch to the newest SAP technology for all our global affiliates."
"Thereby we enhanced 
the efficient digital transformation of Beiersdorf as the implementation of the cutting-edge SAP 
S/4HANA system enables faster, further standardized, and automated global business processes."
"Becoming future-ready also means putting a tremendous effort into the realization of our CARE 
BEYOND SKIN Sustainability Agenda."
"This ranks Beiersdorf as one of only 10 companies worldwide to lead 
the sustainability transformation – out of over 21,000 companies scored."
"Our sustainable product 
transformation is of vital importance here: In 2022 and 2023 we successfully reworked, among other 
products, the formula of our NIVEA Soft, and in 2024 our iconic NIVEA Creme will follow with a more 
sustainable packaging."
"We are proud that our actions are already creating a viable impact, although we 
are still just at the beginning of this crucial journey."
"To eventually become the best skin care company, you also need the best people in the industry."
"In 
2023, we made significant progress not only to attract and retain the best talent in the market, but also 
to shape the ideal environment for them at our company."
"In our founding city of Hamburg (Germany), 
we opened our new global headquarters and the expanded research center on an area of 51,000 
square meters."
"Our employees significantly shaped this new global heart of our organization and 
influenced the creation of a modern and sustainable work environment, which embraces the future of 
work, the well-being of our employees, and the exchange of ideas."
"Innovation and further growth can

only emerge from exchange and inspiration."
"This is precisely what has made us and our brands such as 
NIVEA, Eucerin, and Aquaphor so strong and unique for decades."
"Also on a global scale, we are continuously improving our working environment."
"We committed in 2021 
to achieving a 50:50 gender-balanced leadership across all management levels worldwide by 2025."
"Already by September 2023, the representation of women in management positions had increased to 
50.3%."
"That means we achieved our gender parity ambition 18 months ahead of schedule — a great 
success and an important step."
"However, we are not done yet."
"We must maintain our commitment, 
continue our efforts, and ensure that achieving a 50:50 gender balance remains not just a milestone but 
a legacy."
"Looking ahead, our commitment extends to broader initiatives that go beyond gender, 
emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion as integral components of our culture."
"We actively embrace 
the diversity of genders, origins, backgrounds and cultures, sexual orientation and gender identities, as 
well as generations and include people of all abilities."
"Reaching and understanding our consumers
For over 140 years, prioritizing the consumer has been the central guiding principle for our actions."
"Today, we find ourselves confronted by swiftly shifting consumer needs, driven by societal progress and 
continuous digitalization."
"As new consumer behaviors emerge, we are adapting alongside them – 
sustainably and digitally, never letting go of our consumer focus."
"Our e-commerce business continues 
to thrive on a global scale and is a major contributor to the growth of our excellent sales figures."
"Over 
the past fiscal year, we have seen significant growth of 19% in e-commerce, once again positioning us 
among the top performers in our industry."
"Embracing such digitally focused developments and pairing them with our innovative pioneering spirit 
leads to successful digital skin care innovations."
"In 2023, we increased our utilization of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to shape the skin care of the future: for example, as an integral part of our unrivaled 
SKINLY study that is one of the world's largest consumer skin care studies."
"AI facilitate smart data 
collection and analysis in this context, which not only provides insights about the effectiveness of 
consumers’ skin care routines but moreover leads subsequently to the product innovations of 
tomorrow."
"We are also increasingly utilizing AI in the development and optimization of our product 
formulas."
"Beyond the digital space, our skin care innovations remain a central reason for our current success and 
optimistic outlook into the future."
"In 2023, we managed to incorporate our key patented ingredients 
such as Thiamidol, Q10, or LUMINOUS630® into a variety of new skin care segments, thereby not only 
creating new and successful innovations but also strengthening our market leadership positions with 
our Derma and NIVEA business."
"Another tremendous innovation lies within the field of skin 
rejuvenation: We will enter the market for the first time with a product in the dynamic and exciting field 
of epigenetics in 2024."
"Overall, NIVEA delivered record growth levels across all regions and 
categories, while also ensuring the best mix between volume and value."
"This led to over €5 billion sales 
in 2023, and we aim to keep this course with NIVEA in 2024 and beyond; the sky is truly the limit for our 
iconic brand."
"Our Sun products within NIVEA and Derma were also a major growth driver in 2023 as well as the 
impressive acceleration of our sales in the Latin America region."
"The potential of this region remains 
huge and we are confident that this success story can be continued in 2024."
"This led to the decision to utilize 2023 as a transition year to clean up 
stocks and normalize inventory levels."
"Hence, we are now expecting a bounce-back effect in 2024 and a 
return to growth."
"Together toward a successful future
The exceptional financial performance in 2023 reflects our resilience, our flexibility, and the value of our 
iconic brand portfolio in the eyes of our consumers."
"On behalf of my colleagues from the Executive 
Committee, I sincerely want to thank all employees around the world for their passionate and 
remarkable commitment to Beiersdorf."
"The displayed level of adaptability, creativity, and dedication 
was truly outstanding in the past year and instills great confidence in me regarding the future of this 
company."
"At the same time, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your trust in Beiersdorf and 
the critical and crucial support you provide."
"In the past year, we not only delivered on our promises but also made great progress toward our 
readiness for the future through significant investments, the right strategic adjustments, unwavering 
consumer focus, and smart innovations."
"All of this, paired with an overall sustainable mindset while 
delivering an exceptional financial performance, has proved, once more, that we are not only crisis-
resistant but also equipped with the right foundation for sustainable and profitable growth in the 
coming years."
"The year 2024 will also see a sharpened and focused corporate strategy to further 
accelerate our current positive development."
We are indeed ready for the future.
"Geopolitically, however, there was no respite, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict continuing 
unchanged and new serious conflicts flaring up in the Middle East."
"Despite this, the performance of the 
capital markets in 2023 was primarily driven by inflation and the interest rate policies of central banks."
"High inflation figures at the beginning of the year in Europe and the USA led central banks to respond 
with historic rate hikes."
"However, the situation on the capital markets at the end of the year proved 
more favorable than many had expected."
"This was primarily due to the easing of inflation as the year 
progressed and the expectation of falling rates looking ahead to 2024."
"Leading indexes, including in 
Germany and the USA, reflected this by reaching record levels toward year-end 2023."
"Subdued economic growth, well below the average for the past decades, is nevertheless still expected 
for 2024."
"The most important causes for this is to be found in the second largest economy – China – 
whose performance was significantly impaired in 2023 due to structural problems which are likely to 
continue in 2024."
"High price levels and interest rate hikes could also put the brakes on the US economy 
in the next year."
"The prospects for the eurozone are significantly better, and economic growth is 
expected to pick up slightly after the stagnation in 2023."
"Gas prices, which soared to new heights as a result of the Russian invasion in 2022, returned to normal 
levels in the course of 2023."
"The oil price remained within a narrow range in the first half of the year 
before rising sharply due to the supply shortage and developments in the Middle East conflict."
"Toward 
the end of the year, calm increasingly returned to the oil market."
"The value of the US dollar against the 
euro was also largely driven by inflation and central bank interest rate policy, moving in a narrow 
corridor throughout the year with little fluctuation."
"The euro benefited from the prospect of lower 
inflation and appreciated slightly toward the end of the year."
Beiersdorf’s shares continued their strong performance from the previous year.
"After a restrained first 
two months of 2023, Beiersdorf’s shares rose during the second quarter to an interim high of over €127."
This was on the back of strong market data and better-than-expected first-quarter results.
"As the year 
progressed, the capital market came to the view that the difficult market environment for our luxury 
brands was being more than outweighed by the outstanding performance at NIVEA and the Derma 
brands."
"The excellent figures and upgraded outlook for the year took the share price to a new all-time 
high as the year continued."
"At the end of 2023, Beiersdorf’s shares closed at €135.70."
"This was 26.6% 
up on their closing price for 2022 and put them among the front-runners compared with both the 
competition and the DAX."
The Annual General Meeting took place in a virtual format at the company’s headquarters in Hamburg.
"For the second time, not just shareholders but anyone interested were able to follow the event from 
their computer."
"Around 2000 viewers took advantage of this offer and attended this year’s Annual 
General Meeting online on April 13, 2023."
"A new feature this year was the opportunity for shareholders 
around the world to pose their questions live via a virtual request-to-speak counter and thereby 
interacting directly with the Executive Board, as was commonplace for decades at the in-person Annual 
General Meetings."
"In 2023, the focus in capital market communication was on the development of our brands."
"For NIVEA, 
it discussed both pricing and, in particular, the growth opportunities in emerging markets."
"For the 
Derma brands Eucerin and Aquaphor, communication centered on innovations around the active 
ingredient Thiamidol and potential new business areas."
"In the case of the premium and selective 
brands Chantecaille and La Prairie, developments in China and in travel retail were analyzed in depth."
"At roadshows and conferences, the Executive Board also explained how Beiersdorf can take advantage 
of new market opportunities through its investments as part of the C.A.R.E.+ strategy and the continued 
development of the operational business model."

Our term of office and the last fiscal year have been shaped by uncertainty.
That trend is set to continue.
The task for all of us is and will remain to ensure we do our best for customers – always and everywhere.
Beiersdorf proved again in 2023 that they can rely on us.
"All Beiersdorf employees worldwide deserve 
special thanks and recognition for another extraordinarily successful year in the difficult environment 
after 2019."

"Our business is divided into two separate, 
independently operating business segments."
"In both segments, we hold a leading position in the 
market."
"We are confident that we can further maintain and expand our advantage by bringing key 
innovations with genuine added value to the market."
"• In the Consumer Business Segment, our focus is on skin and body care."
"Our portfolio comprises 
brands such as NIVEA, Eucerin, La Prairie, and Hansaplast, which are trusted by people around the 
world."
"• In the tesa Business Segment, we concentrate on developing innovative adhesive tapes and self-
adhesive solutions for industry, craft businesses, and end consumers."
"Since 2001, tesa has been 
managed as an independent subgroup."
"Consumer
Our strategy
The Beiersdorf name has stood for innovative skin care since 1882."
"This is our core competency – and 
we want to deliver added value for our consumers in this area."
"Our goal: We want to ensure that people 
all around the world feel good in their skin."
"In 2019, we formulated our C.A.R.E.+ business strategy."
"This describes our strategic priorities and is the 
means by which we want to secure our competitive, sustainable growth."
"Below, we briefly introduce the most important progress."
"Fast forward digital transformation
Digitalization in our company and business plays a decisive role in tapping new growth potential."
"That 
is why we have long been systematically driving digitalization as part of our C.A.R.E.+ strategy."
"We are 
using digital technologies more extensively, for example, to engage in direct dialogue with our 
consumers and fulfill their individual wishes."
"In the reporting year, we once again made substantial 
investments in digital approaches, particularly in various social and media networks and precision 
marketing."
"This included influencer collaborations and partnerships with providers of digital

"Our e-commerce business has grown steadily in recent years and, with strong partner 
relationships, high-quality content and effective retail media, has become an increasing driver of our 
overall sales growth."
"In addition to these measures, we have been using forward-looking digital technologies including 
artificial intelligence (AI) for many years to drive faster and more efficient development of innovations – 
for example in developing and optimizing formulas."
"Another example of the use of AI-based 
technologies is the skin study SKINLY, which we continued in 2023 and is one of the world’s largest skin 
care studies involving consumers."
"Further details on this and other approaches are presented in the 
“Research and Development” chapter."
"In addition to marketing and research and development, we also invested last year in the digitalization 
of our production, in future-oriented workplaces, in new forms of work and changing approaches to the 
workplace (“New Work”), and in our employees’ digital skills."
"For us, our new production center in 
Leipzig sets standards in the automation and digitalization of all production steps as well as in terms of 
sustainability standards."
"The Beiersdorf Campus, the new Group headquarters in Hamburg we 
inaugurated in the reporting year, offers new opportunities for dialogue and working collaboratively 
and creatively thanks to state-of-the-art technology."
"With an area of 51,000 square meters, we have 
created the new global centerpiece of our organization here, which our employees have significantly 
shaped."
Further information on our employees can be found in the “People at Beiersdorf” chapter.
"Win with skin care
Our claim is to bring innovations to market that offer our consumers added value."
"A fine example of that 
is our first anti-aging care range with Q10: We launched it in 1998 and heralded in a new era in 
cosmetics for us using active ingredients already 25 years ago."
"Q10 remains one of the most important 
anti-aging ingredients to this day and we continue to develop it further."
"The NIVEA Q10 face care 
range, for example, is now available in over 60 countries and is the number 1 in the NIVEA face care 
segment."
The latest product in the range is the NIVEA Q10 TARGETED WRINKLE FILLER.
"The serum’s 
formula combines pure Q10 with BIOXIFILL® peptides – a skin-friendly and powerful combination that 
reduces wrinkles in sensitive areas of the face."
"We successfully expanded our familiar face care range LUMINOUS630® under the NIVEA brand in the 
reporting year."
"With the NIVEA Men Anti-Age Power Serum, which combines the patented anti-pigment 
ingredient LUMINOUS630® with hyaluron in a 2-in-1 formula, we have successfully entered the market 
for anti-aging care for men."
"The patented active ingredient Thiamidol from our dermocosmetic brand Eucerin also remains one of 
the company’s most successful innovations."
"Revision of our Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler + Elasticity product 
range with Thiamidol in the anti-age category reaped clearly perceptible successes in the fiscal year 
2023."
"The relaunch enabled us to benefit from the growing market trend toward anti-aging products 
and further increase our market share."
"Following its success in face care, we have expanded use of our 
patented active ingredient Thiamidol to the body care segment in recent years."
"In the reporting year, 
for example, we launched the new Eucerin Hyaluron-Filler + Elasticity Anti-Age Body Cream, which has 
been specifically developed to counteract advanced signs of skin aging on the body."
"In 2023, we further developed some of our skin care products and also made good progress in 
implementing our Climate Care strategy."
"Our goal is to achieve an absolute reduction in CO2e 
emissions along the entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) of 30% by 2025 (vs."
"Key product 
transformation measures in 2023 included changes to the NIVEA Sun, Labello, and Eucerin ranges: In 
the case of NIVEA Sun, the bottles, caps, and trigger pumps are now partly made of recycled plastic."
The revised formulas also have a lower environmental footprint.
"In the case of Labello, the formulas and 
packaging have also been developed further, thereby reducing CO2e emissions."
"Eucerin has

introduced a special innovation: The Hyaluron Filler Day and Night creams come in particularly 
sustainable refill packaging."
"This refill concept for the anti-age bestseller, in which only the inner jar is 
replaced and the outer packaging is reused, enables a reduction in the use of plastic."
"We also want to make a major contribution to protecting the climate and establishing a circular 
economy with our new aerosol cans."
"Since the last fiscal year, we started to produce our deodorant 
spray cans for the European market at least 50% from recycled aluminum."
"At the same time, they have 
also become lighter thanks to a reduction in material."
"In this way, we aim to cut CO2e emissions in the 
value chain."
"Unlock white spot potential
Another element of Beiersdorf’s C.A.R.E.+ strategy is tapping into new potential for growth."
"We are 
concentrating on tapping “white spots” – markets and business areas where we are not yet present or 
would like to further expand our presence."
"The most attractive regions for us are in Latin America 
(especially Brazil and Mexico), Asia (especially China, South Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia), and Africa 
(especially South Africa and Nigeria)."
"However, the market conditions in the individual countries differ 
greatly; therefore, we are focusing on different aspects as part of our market development strategies."
"The demand for our Derma products in Latin America is very dynamic, while we see significant growth 
potential for our NIVEA range in African countries."
"In China, premiumization is the key to success."
"As a 
global brand that aims to be successful in this strategically important market, securing our premium 
positioning is our top priority in order to create sustainable growth."
"Our strategic focus with NIVEA is on the Face Care category and strengthening our efforts in e-
commerce business."
"In the reporting year, we recorded successes in particular with the high-quality 
face care range NIVEA LUMINOUS630®, which we sell via cross-border e-commerce."
"Our global 
research and development network makes a key contribution to tapping into this growth potential."
"It 
enables us to address local cultural, aesthetic, and climatic conditions and develop products that 
correspond to individual local or regional needs and preferences."
"At the same time, it allows us to learn 
from each other, pursue different research focuses that reflect local expertise, participate in global 
innovation, and have access to local talent and partners who provide valuable ideas and insights for our 
research and development work."
Our skin research center in Hamburg is at the heart of this network.
"At this center, we carry out 
application-oriented research, in particular, in order to gain a better understanding of the skin’s 
metabolic processes."
"The Beiersdorf Study Center was modernized in 2023 and is part of the skin 
research center."
"As a complement to tests performed externally, it is mainly tasked with intensively 
testing and ensuring the quality, safety, and tolerability of newly developed products prior to their 
market launch."
The second largest research location is our innovation center in Shanghai.
"The main 
focus of research activities there is on the use of AI tools to optimize formulations, developing 
sustainable formulations, and gathering new insights into Chinese consumers in relation to anti-aging 
and sensitive or oily skin."
"In contrast, our innovation center in Florham Park, USA, focuses on clinical 
research and developing local product innovations for the dermocosmetic ranges of Eucerin and 
Aquaphor as well as for the sun protection brands Coppertone and Eucerin Sun."
"More information on 
this subject can be found in the “Research and Development” chapter."
"Fuel the growth through increased productivity
In order to grow faster, we are committed to efficiency, strict cost discipline, and a focused, lean 
organization."
"We continuously invest in increasing our productivity, for example through investments in 
new production technologies or in expanding our production capacities."

An event of special importance in the reporting year was the inauguration of our new facility in Leipzig."
"The facility 
has a modular and flexible design so that new innovations, trends, consumer wishes, or production 
processes can be implemented quickly."
"This new production center also helps us achieve the goals of our CARE BEYOND SKIN sustainability 
agenda: Thanks to the use of renewable energies and biogas to generate heat, the facility is virtually 
CO2e-neutral."
"Valuable resources such as heat, wastewater, and ethanol are recovered and treated on a 
large scale."
"Moving ahead, we plan to operate the facility as an “Energy+” location and produce more 
electricity than we consume by generating our own renewable energy."
"In addition, in 2023, we have once again globally invested in new production lines, state-of-the-art 
technology, and our IT infrastructure."
"In 2024, we will complete the expansion of our facility in Mexico, 
which is one of Beiersdorf’s three largest production sites."
"We are also expanding our production site in 
Poland extensively."
The investments will total almost €200 million.
"Our objective for all production sites 
is to further increase the efficiency, agility, and resilience of our supply chain, allowing us to respond 
even better to constantly changing circumstances."
We will again invest in growth and innovation in 2024.
"For the Consumer Business Segment, 
investments will be at a similar level to those in 2023."
"Notable projects for the expansion of production 
and storage capacities relate to the locations in Poland, Mexico, and Leipzig."
"Building on our strong foundations:
Culture – Core Values – Capabilities – Care Beyond Skin2
We believe that our special culture is the key to Beiersdorf’s DNA."
"Based on trust, collaboration, 
respect, openness, and mutual appreciation, it centers on our Core Values – Care, Simplicity, Courage, 
and Trust – and sense of togetherness."
"This culture of “we” rather than “I” makes us strong and agile and 
is key to our strong cohesion and sustainable success."
"The goal in all we do is to fulfill our consumers’ needs and wishes to the best of our ability and meet our 
responsibility toward society and the environment."
"Our purpose “Care Beyond Skin” is an expression of what Beiersdorf stands for and what defines us as a 
company – because our care and concern go far beyond our core competence, skin."
"We want to make a 
positive contribution to our society and our planet."
"In the past fiscal year, for example, we demonstrated 
that with Beiersdorf’s first global volunteer day."
"At the CARE BEYOND SKIN DAY, all Beiersdorf 
employees had the chance to spend an entire working day supporting non-profit organizations."
"The 
activities varied greatly: from collecting garbage to renovating playgrounds, sports facilities, and 
children’s homes to planting trees."
"The wide range of support not only helped strengthen an inclusive 
society and environmental protection, but also increased employees’ sense of togetherness and 
identification with Beiersdorf."
"We are committed to embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I)."
"Because we firmly believe that 
people are more motivated, more productive, and more satisfied when their different backgrounds, 
experience, and skills are valued and when they can truly be their unique selves."

"diversity in leadership positions, we have reached a significant milestone: By 2023, leadership positions 
below the executive board are intended to be equally filled by men and women worldwide – some 18 
months earlier than planned."
"Further information on our sustainability agenda and the topic of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion can be found in the “Non-financial Statement” and in the “People at Beiersdorf” 
chapter."
"With the Beiersdorf Campus, our new Group headquarters, we also laid the foundations for further 
growth and innovation in the past fiscal year."
"The investment of €250 million not only demonstrates our 
commitment to the Hamburg location."
"It is also the foundation for a highly attractive working 
environment with an extensive range of services."
"In designing the campus, we incorporated the needs 
and wishes of the employees at an early stage and translated their specific requirements into the new 
working environments."
"For instance, the floor plan and the concept for the various room modules were 
geared rigorously toward New Work and agile working methods."
"We also created numerous 
collaboration and communication spaces to promote dialogue between colleagues and use forward-
looking technologies."
"Beiersdorf is also aiming to gain LEED certification, an 
internationally recognized seal of quality for sustainability in building planning, for the new Group 
headquarters."
"tesa
tesa SE (referred to in the following as “tesa”) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of innovative 
adhesive tapes and self-adhesive product solutions for commercial customers and end consumers."
"tesa 
SE, a 100% owned subsidiary of Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, is managed as an independent 
subgroup that is the direct or indirect parent company of 60 tesa affiliates (previous year: 61), employs 
5,189 people and operates in more than 100 countries."
"In the fiscal year, tesa founded tesa Online GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany."

"In addition to the German locations, the affiliates in China, the United 
States, Italy, and Japan are among tesa’s largest and most strategically important single companies."
"The 
production sites are located in Europe (Germany and Italy), in the Americas (USA), and in Asia (China 
and Vietnam)."
"The site in Haiphong, Vietnam, was opened in October 2023."
"The company 
headquarters, which include the research and technology center, are located in Norderstedt, near 
Hamburg."
Significant investments will also be made in growth and innovation in 2024.
"Investments for tesa will be 
at a similar level to 2023."
"Notable projects for the expansion of production and warehouse capacities 
for tesa relate to the production site in Hamburg."
"Further investments in automation and digitalization 
are intended to increase the efficiency of the sites."
"The strategic focus is primarily on developing and expanding profitable business lines in 
technologically advanced fields of application."
"tesa’s product and system solutions are used to optimize 
and enhance the efficiency of production processes, as fastening solutions in construction-related 
applications – often offering features beyond just bonding – and as customized protection and 
packaging systems."
"Along with direct business, the technical retail trade is part of the Industry division."
"Through retail 
partners, tesa offers a wide range of products for diverse applications in various industrial sectors, 
including product ranges for assembly and repair, tapes to secure items during transportation, and

than 300 innovative products in DIY stores and superstores as well as in paper goods and stationery 
shops and online."
"tesa provides tailor-made ranges for professional craftspeople and designs its 
marketing concepts for the specific target groups."
"Management and Control
The Executive Board manages the company and is dedicated to sustainably increasing its value."
"In 
addition to the functional areas of responsibility within the Executive Board, there are regional areas of 
responsibility."
"The Executive Board is closely involved in the company’s operational business in 
particular through the allocation of responsibilities for the regions and markets."
"A breakdown of the 
Executive Board’s areas of responsibility can be found in the chapter “Beiersdorf AG Boards” of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"The tesa Business Segment is managed as an 
independent subgroup."
"The long-term key 
performance indicators – organic sales growth3 in conjunction with market share development, EBIT, 
and the EBIT margin before special factors (the ratio of EBIT to sales) – are derived from this goal."
"The 
aim is to generate internationally competitive returns through continuous investment in growth 
opportunities, systematic cost management, and the highly efficient use of resources."
"The development 
of the relevant key performance indicators can be found in the section “Results of Operations.” In the 
2023 fiscal year, there was no change in the key financial performance indicators compared to the 
previous year."
The company has created an efficient management system in order to meet these strategic goals.
"Corporate management derives business performance targets for the individual units in the Group for 
the coming year from the Group’s strategic business goals."
"This planning covers all segments and 
affiliates."
"Formal adoption by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the Group’s planning for 
the following year is generally toward the end of the year."
"In specific cases the planning is not finalized 
until the beginning of the fiscal year in view of current developments."
"Actual key performance indicators are compared with target values and with the current forecast for the 
year as a whole at regular intervals during the fiscal year."
"These comparisons are used to manage the 
business in line with the objectives."
"The tesa Business Segment forms a separate, independent unit within the Group."
"Research and Development
Research and development is central to an innovation-driven company like Beiersdorf."
"It is part of our 
corporate DNA and the key to our success."
Trend-setting technologies and sustainable concepts are important elements of our research efforts.
"We regularly evaluate our research and development activities and define clear focus areas for each 
business segment."
"Our two business segments concentrate on the following:
• In the Consumer Business Segment, Beiersdorf develops innovative, high-quality skin care 
products."
"These incorporate consumers’ wishes, regional characteristics, and sustainable 
approaches."
"• In the tesa Business Segment, we develop innovative adhesive tapes and self-adhesive solutions 
for industry, commercial customers, and end consumers."
"Here, sustainability and energy-saving 
production processes are at the forefront of our work – always with the aim of improving the 
workflows, products, and lives of our customers."
"As of December 31, 2023, 1,686 people were employed in research and development at Beiersdorf 
worldwide (previous year: 1,591)."
"Of this total, 1,026 (previous year: 1,007) worked in the Consumer 
Business Segment and 660 (previous year: 584) in the tesa Business Segment."
"As in past years, we increased our spending on research and development once again in the reporting 
year."
"At the end of the fiscal year, expenditure in this area amounted to €320 million, up 10.2% on the 
previous year (€291 million)."

Outstanding skin care research
Beiersdorf has always excelled through its expertise in skin research."
"For us, this research acts as a 
source and major driver of our innovative strength and makes us more competitive."
"Our laboratories 
aim to decode the skin’s complex processes, identify effective active ingredients, and find ways to use 
these in skin care."
"We use pioneering technologies in all our research fields to develop ever more new 
innovations and products that are intended to offer added value to our consumers all around the world."
"In all this work, we have a clear goal: we want to create impactful and sustainable skin care innovations 
that touch people’s lives."
"Our intensive, application-oriented research is continuously expanding our deep understanding of the 
human skin."
"Meanwhile, our highly dynamic development work in the field of skin biology is also 
opening up many opportunities, making it an important focus of our research work."
"The following 
research areas were among the most notable in the reporting year:
• The development and acceptance of modern, non-animal-based methods to assess safety have 
been an important part of our research work for around four decades."
"Our efforts here are aimed 
at proving the safety of our ingredients and products and paving the way for new industry 
standards."
"We achieved important successes with alternative testing methods in the reporting 
year."
"As a member from day one, we worked to help establish the new International Collaboration 
on Cosmetics Safety (ICCS) and further stepped up our involvement by taking on leadership 
positions."
"Through research, 
education, targeted training, and regulatory engagement, ICCS wants to improve global 
awareness and trust in alternative scientific methods to animal testing and thereby drive next-
generation risk assessment (NGRA)."
"In our view, Beiersdorf scientists are playing a key role in this 
ambition due to their expertise."
"In the reporting year, for example, Beiersdorf attended the World 
Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, chairing the topic of physiologically-
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and giving a presentation on an important new 
alternative approach."
"Organized with multiple partners from industry and government authorities, 
the presentation’s aim was to promote the acceptance of alternative risk assessment methods, for 
example for UV filters."
"Working with the Fraunhofer Institute, we also developed an in vitro 3D skin 
sensitization test for lipophilic substances and presented it at the EUROTOX Congress 2023."
"The 
project won AstraZeneca’s Early Career Award for Innovation 2023."
"We achieved another 
important milestone with an article on the use of alternative methods for identifying potential 
endocrine disruptors, which was published in the medical journal Archives of Toxicology."
"With 
new methods urgently required in this specific field, the findings are highly significant."
"• Our scientists also continued their in-depth research on the coenzyme Q10 during the reporting 
year."
"Twenty-five years after first bringing the innovative anti-aging ingredient to the market, our 
researchers discovered more new findings on this coenzyme, which occurs naturally in the body, 
and its important role in the skin aging process."
"An important focus of the research work is on 
mitochondria, in which the coenzyme is active in the respiratory chain."
"As part of a research 
collaboration with the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, we were able to further decipher 
the changes in the mitochondria during the skin aging process."
"This data was published in the 
journal Experimental Dermatology during the reporting year."
"The research team’s central finding: 
Aging is associated with a decline in markers of mitochondrial metabolism in the human 
epidermis."
"In addition to this, we launched a research program with the University of Ancona to 
harness the latest findings of mitochondrial medicine for cosmetic applications."
"The coenzyme 
Q10 remains one of the most important anti-aging ingredients to this day, and we continue to 
optimize it based on the latest research results."
"This success story of 25 years and counting shows 
the vast potential for innovation that still remains in Beiersdorf’s discovery."
"• Protecting the skin from sun-related damage has long been another central research focus at 
Beiersdorf."
"Our skin scientists research the sun’s impact on the skin and use the findings to 
develop safe and effective product solutions for sun-related skin indications."
"In this context, we 
continued our work with the ALT-SPF consortium in the reporting year."
"The consortium aims to 
develop less invasive, more reliable, and more precise sun protection tests."
"Along with other 
partners, we not only provided selected samples to develop new testing methods but were also 
involved in conducting the round-robin studies."
"The test results obtained from this collaboration in 
the reporting year are now in the international validation process (DIS – Draft of International 
Standard) under ISO/DIS 23698 and ISO/DIS 23675."
"If the underlying test procedure is approved, 
this will bring the first real change in determining the sun protection factor, as these test methods 
do not rely on inducing an erythema."
"Based on HDRS technology (hybrid diffuse reflectance 
spectroscopy), reflectance measurements on the skin combined with in vitro transmission 
measurements enable direct measurement of SPF, UVA PF, or critical wavelength."
"• We also continued research in the 2023 fiscal year on our patented active ingredient against 
hyperpigmentation, Thiamidol/W630."
"The ingredient has been well received by the scientific 
community, and an increasing number of dermatologists around the world are confirming the 
high effectiveness of products containing Thiamidol in numerous scientific publications."

Symposiums at internationally renowned scientific conferences are particularly important settings 
for demonstrating our research expertise in this context."
"Our brand teams share first-hand 
information on the active ingredients with the scientific community."
"• Since 2008, Beiersdorf has been researching epigenetics in relation to the skin."
"This area of 
biology looks at the extent to which environmental factors sporadically affect the activity of genes 
and the development of cells."
"We see the epigenetic mechanism as offering important 
approaches to more precisely deciphering the skin’s aging process."
"Research results show that 
even identical twins with identical genetic make-ups can age in very different ways."
"This difference 
is down to external factors such as lifestyle, diet, stress, or UV radiation, which have an influence on 
our epigenetic pattern and affect our biological age and skin’s appearance."
"Our epigenetic 
research is focused on reactivating biological processes in cells to support skin rejuvenation."
"Based on this ambition, we launched a communication campaign about epigenetics in the 
reporting year."
"The campaign sought to raise awareness and interest in this area as well as to 
inform consumers and opinion leaders, give them an insight into our research, and position us as 
one of the leading companies in the field of epigenetics."
"Many people are unaware that one of our 
research teams was the first to identify the extensive epigenetic changes during skin aging."
"The 
team published an article on the topic in the scientific journal Plos Genetics back in 2010."
"With our 
patented skin-specific age-clock technology, we also offer a very special unique feature."
"The 
algorithm behind it is a true milestone in anti-aging research."
"By reading the epigenetic pattern in 
the skin, it can determine the skin’s biological age with great precision."
"It also helps our 
researchers identify active ingredients that can positively modulate the skin’s epigenetic pattern."
"The aim of our research work in the field of epigenetics is not only to slow aging processes but to 
turn back the skin’s biological clock and thus improve the skin cells’ functioning."
"With this 
progress, we want to contribute to the “healthy aging” of our consumers."
"We use global patents to protect the results of our intensive applied research and our intellectual 
property."
"At the end of the 2023 fiscal year, our worldwide patent portfolio included some 1,500 active 
patents (previous year: approximately 1,500)."
"We filed around 60 new patent applications globally in 
the reporting year (previous year: around 50)."
"As of December 31, 2023, approximately 600 patents 
were in the ongoing grant procedure (previous year: approximately 600)."
"Sustainability as a source of innovation and growth
Sustainability is a central component of our research and development strategy."
"With the environmental 
and climate-friendliness of our products becoming immensely more important, we are optimizing our 
formulas and product packaging through intensive research work, including together with our strategic 
partners and suppliers."
The vision of a circular economy unites all our efforts.
"In 2021, we defined our R&D sustainability pledge, which is based on our overarching Sustainability 
Agenda CARE BEYOND SKIN."
"With CARE BEYOND SKIN, our aim is to minimize our environmental 
footprint and maximize our positive contribution to society."
"The agenda includes a “plastic pledge,” for 
example, under which our target is to raise the share of recycled plastic to 30% by 2025 and cut the 
consumption of new petroleum-based plastic by 50%."
"In addition, we want to make 100% of our 
packaging refillable, reusable, or recyclable."
"We see promoting a circular economy as a top priority and 
are working on it intensively – not only in terms of packaging but also where our raw materials are 
concerned."
"We are therefore continuously updating our raw materials strategy to ensure that our 
products are climate-friendly and recyclable."
"This is based on the latest innovations in technology, 
procurement, and processing."

As a sign of our commitment, we were the first cosmetics company in Europe to receive the “My Green 
Lab” certification, the global standard for laboratory sustainability."
"Four of our labs have received 
platinum and green certificates in the last two years (green is the highest certification)."
"By regularly 
achieving this certification, we are helping to reduce the environmental footprint of our scientific 
laboratories and bring about meaningful change."
"We know that the ingredients and materials we use to manufacture our skin care products are the most 
important lever in reducing our environmental footprint and offering our consumers more sustainable 
routines."
"We therefore very closely analyze the trends and needs of our consumers around sustainability 
and work hard to bring continuous improvements so as to make our products better for the 
environment and climate."
The newly introduced Labello / NIVEA lip care products are a good example of this.
"In 2019, we began 
to reformulate them away from mineral oil."
"In 2022 and in the reporting year, we increased the share of 
natural origin ingredients (to up to 100%) and developed more sustainable packaging."
"The whole 
range now comes in mono-material primary packaging designed to be fully recyclable."
"Since the 
relaunch, the primary packaging has been plastic-free and is made from FSC-certified and recycled 
cardboard."
"The example shows how our teams are gradually achieving a comprehensive sustainability 
transformation without compromising consumers’ product experience."
"Our aim is always to ensure at 
least the same high level of quality."
"We achieved further progress on implementing our sustainability ambition in the reporting year with 
our newly opened, climate-neutral production center in Leipzig."
"This meant using climate-friendlier 
packaging for the aerosol deodorant cans filled there."
"Moreover, introducing the first revised 
formulations with a higher share of natural materials has also enabled us to reduce the CO2e footprint."
"Thanks to state-of-the-art technology, we are also able to process exceptionally lightweight aerosol 
cans."
"These not only cut emissions through significant material savings but also address a second 
sustainability dimension by using at least 50% recycled aluminum."
"To utilize further potential for sustainable innovations and the circular economy, Beiersdorf continued 
its strategic partnership with the Emerald Technology Ventures and Revent venture capital funds."
"These 
partnerships connect us with founders and innovative start-ups that are developing environmentally 
friendly technologies and sustainable business models."
"The entrepreneurs can then sound out and test 
the potential to scale these up through Beiersdorf."
"We are convinced that these and many other measures, new products and innovations, collaborations, 
and partnerships will continue to make an important contribution toward achieving our ambitious 
sustainability goals."
"Collaboration strengthens innovation
For Beiersdorf, collaboration with external partners is an important part of research and development 
work."
"We are convinced that by combining our complementary expertise and our strengths, we can 
increase our joint capacity for innovation and also optimize and accelerate the development of 
tomorrow’s skin care."
"A large number of research institutes, universities, start-ups, independent 
scientists, and suppliers belonged to our global network of collaboration partners in the reporting year."
"In addition to these cooperation agreements, we advocate the principle of open innovation."
"We involve 
various external partners in many of our development projects and in raw material scouting."
"Since 2016, 
we have gathered our open innovation activities under the name “Pearlfinders – We Open Innovation.”

We entered into an important new strategic alliance with the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) 
on July 1, 2023."
This is Beiersdorf’s first institutionalized partnership with an academic research center.
"Running over a four-year period, the collaboration has a joint research budget of €4.8 million."
"With a 
new, external laboratory known as the Joint Innovation Lab, we want to boost our capacity for 
innovation in the important field of aging research."
The guiding aim is to rejuvenate skin.
"The research 
team are investigating the skin cells’ age clock with the goal of turning back time and reducing the 
skin’s biological age."
"We also began a new partnership in the reporting year with the Swiss start-up DePoly SA through an 
investment via our OSCAR&PAUL venture capital fund."
"Founded in 2020, the company has developed 
an energy-efficient and selective chemical recycling technology for plastic and polyester waste streams."
This technology has the potential to fundamentally change the life cycle of PET plastics.
"Through our 
partnership, we plan to jointly develop forward-looking, safe, and sustainable packaging materials for 
the cosmetics industry."
"With this approach, we aim to bridge a crucial gap in circular PET usage while 
maintaining the same quality standards."
"The reporting year also saw us continue our intensive dialogue with the research center Deutsches 
Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY (German Electron Synchrotron or DESY for short) in Hamburg."
"The 
modern imaging methods at DESY and our shared scientific expertise give us an additional 
comprehensive and detailed view of the skin."
"Scientific dialogue offers us new insights into the interplay 
between skin and ingredients and creates a framework to boost our innovative capacity and implement 
product innovations more quickly and effectively."
"In September 2023, staff from the R&D start-up scouting team held the second Joint Beiersdorf – Evonik 
Start-up Day on Sustainability together with our long-standing partner for raw materials technology 
development, the specialty chemicals company Evonik."
"The aim was to step up dialogue with interested 
start-ups and to find partners with innovative and sustainable raw material and packaging solutions."
"Twelve start-ups from different countries were chosen to present their technologies and business 
models at the event on the new Beiersdorf Campus and to evaluate the possibility of a partnership 
together with Beiersdorf and Evonik."
"As in the previous year, the chosen start-ups work mainly in 
sustainable raw materials, biotechnology, supply chain transparency and traceability, and digital 
solutions."
"Strong research network
We firmly believe that the global presence of our research and development is a major contributor to 
our business success."
"This strong research network allows us to pursue different research focuses in 
different places around the world and to learn through close dialogue with each other."
"The largest site in our global research and development network is our skin research center in 
Hamburg, Germany, where we employed a total of 757 (previous year: 738) people as of December 31, 
2023."
At this location we mainly conduct important application-oriented research.
"This helps us to 
better understand the (metabolic) processes of the skin and, based on the findings and using new 
technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), to develop new and innovative products targeted at 
consumers’ needs."
"The Early Innovation department we created in 2021 is pooling our innovative 
strength and aims to boost public recognition of Beiersdorf as a leading innovator in skin care."
"The 
about 23-member department (previous year: 19 employees) aims to drive a cross-brand, cross-
category innovation roadmap with strong innovation stories."
"The department acts as a catalyst between 
all the specialist disciplines that are involved in the innovation process."
"As a particular highlight in 2023, 
the team initiated an Innovation Fair for the second year in a row."
"The internal fair held at the new 
Beiersdorf Campus allowed all employees to experience the innovations of tomorrow."
"With this consumer-centric thinking, we go beyond just understanding the needs of 
our consumers."
"We also want to know what “jobs” our consumers want our products to do for them 
when it comes to their skin."
"We use this information to develop tailor-made solutions following the 
FEWER, BIGGER, BETTER approach."
"The Early Innovation team presented various JTBD topic areas, 
including skin rejuvenation, skin tone, and skin protection at the fair."
"The team considers not only 
functional needs, but social and emotional aspects, too."
"The Beiersdorf Study Center (formerly known as the Test Center) is a central part of our skin research 
center in Hamburg and began working in a new environment in mid-2023."
"It now has more than 30 
study rooms spread across 1,800m2 and two floors."
"The rooms offer optimal and standardized climatic 
conditions."
"State-of-the-art measurements and examinations can be performed on the skin in multi-
purpose rooms, which can be configured to each study, as well as in specialist rooms permanently 
containing certain high-tech equipment."
"The latter include our “black room” for detecting ultra-weak 
photon emissions."
"The unique air-conditioning technology was developed in collaboration with TU 
Berlin."
"It enables constant temperature and humidity to be precisely maintained even when using 
devices that emit large amounts of heat (e.g."
"The design of the new Study Center is 
the product of 18 years of experience at our Hamburg Test Center."
"In our view, the new rooms will help 
us to run our studies within Beiersdorf more efficiently and achieve even better results."
"Complementing 
tests performed externally, Beiersdorf’s own Study Center is playing a central role in intensively testing 
and ensuring the quality, safety, and tolerability of newly developed products prior to their market 
launch."
"In the reporting period, in Hamburg alone, we carried out some 300 studies with around 8,500 
participants (previous year: some 350 studies with around 8,000 participants)."
"Externally, in 2023, we 
conducted approximately another 700 studies with around 20,000 participants (previous year: 1,320 
studies with around 32,000 participants)."
"In addition to our large, globally important skin research center in Hamburg, our global research and 
development network includes two large innovation centers in China (Shanghai) and the USA (New 
Jersey) as well as development laboratories in Brazil, India, and Japan."
"These different locations enable 
us to better address local cultural, aesthetic, and climatic conditions and develop products that 
correspond to individual local needs and preferences."
"Through this network we can also participate in 
global innovation and have access to local talent, providing valuable ideas and insights for our research 
and development work."
"Our innovation center in Shanghai, China, covers an area of 7,500m2, making it our second largest, 
and was opened in July 2020."
"We achieved an important 
milestone in the reporting year with the opening of the first digitalized stability automation lab."
"This 
allows the pH value, viscosity, and consistency of our formulations to be checked automatically."
"What 
started as a pilot project in Shanghai may be introduced to other innovation centers in future."
"In March 
2023, our Chinese colleagues relaunched a local product innovation – the amino acid, pump-operated 
foaming facial cleansing range."
"The range stands for gentle cleansing products with plant essence and 
amino acids and comes in “Hydra,” “Pure Fresh,” and “Radiance” versions."
"The products were switched 
to a new, even more nourishing formula with pure amino acid, soap-free surfactants."
"The fresh, modern 
design comes with reduced plastic consumption: the new bottle is made from 50% recycled plastic and 
uses up to 16.7% less plastic than the predecessor model."
"This has enabled a 23% reduction in CO2e 
emissions."
"We achieved further progress on sustainability in the reporting year with the Chinese 
hairstyling brand Maestro, which launched the first sustainable formulation on the Chinese hairstyling 
market based on a biodegradable styling polymer."

Our innovation center in Florham Park, New Jersey, USA, which opened in 2022, continued its 
successful work in 2023."
"The focus was on clinical research and developing local product innovations 
for the dermocosmetic ranges of Eucerin and Aquaphor, as well as for the over-the-counter sun 
protection brands Coppertone and Eucerin Sun (OTC=non-prescription drugs according to US 
regulations)."
"The cross-functional teams in New Jersey also stepped up their close collaboration on sun 
and skin care innovations with our skin research center in Hamburg and development lab in Mumbai, 
India."
"To support our Medical Management Team, the researchers developed special training 
programs and scientific publications dealing with clinical and scientific topics so as to better present the 
strong science behind our dermatology and sun care range."
"Digitalization and artificial intelligence
Beiersdorf has been using digitalization and forward-looking technologies including artificial 
intelligence (AI) for many years aiming to drive faster and more efficient development of innovations."
"Increasing digitalization helps us to better manage the growing complexity confronting us in 
development labs."
Our “Future Testing” in the reporting year worked on replacing our current digital systems.
"In 2024, we 
want to achieve the milestone we set in our digital roadmap for R&D and replace our current 
Teamcenter software system – another important step in making us fit for the future."
"In addition, we 
continued our collaboration on robotics systems with the Technical University of Applied Sciences 
Wildau in fiscal year 2023."
"Together, we implemented a first robotics system for automated in vivo 
measurements – an important step toward future efficacy tests on test subjects."
"We aim to expand the 
use of these systems in fiscal year 2024 to achieve maximum efficiency."
"The full introduction of the AI-based development platform from our partner Uncountable was an 
important milestone in the reporting year."
"Under the “Future Lab” banner, artificial intelligence 
continues to find its way into the global formula development and optimization process."
"The platform 
allows faster processing of complex data volumes, resulting in greater efficiency and more rapid 
development of new formulas, which are optimized using fewer but more relevant tests in multiple 
dimensions (including various sustainability components)."
"IT integration took place following successful 
completion of the testing phase."
"The AI tool is now available to up to 300 formula developers 
worldwide."
"Another proven example for the use of modern technologies for us is our AI-based skin study SKINLY, 
which we continued in 2023."
"Launched at the end of 2019, this project is still one of the world’s largest 
skin care studies involving consumers."
"The special feature of this study is that consumers are actively 
involved through digital tools – a special measurement device (including a moisture sensor and three 
different light sources) and a complementary app – and send updates on more than 80 parameters up 
to twice a day."
"The results help us understand our consumers and their skin as well as the 
variables that influence them, and to draw lessons for our product development."
"The more high-quality 
data is available, the better our data scientists will be able to translate this into relevant, actionable new 
knowledge for our research, development, and marketing."
"With machine learning based on artificial 
intelligence, the ecosystem created for the study learns something new with every measurement."
"More 
than 17,000 participants aged between 18 and 80+ from over 50 countries have already taken part in 
the SKINLY study to date."
"Over 800 million data points and more than 100 million high-quality skin 
images have been measured and generated."
"To generate important insights particularly in our primary 
research areas, our study specially includes certain target groups, including people with a high level of 
UV and environmental exposure, enabling us to more closely examine how these factors affect skin 
aging."

Developing innovations is our core competency and a key building block for our business success."
"Our 
strong culture of innovation, which has always been a part of R&D at Beiersdorf, ensures that our 
innovation pipeline is well filled year after year – with innovations that respond to our consumers’ needs 
and wishes as closely as possible and offer them added value."
"This not only includes developing new 
cosmetic formulas; a significant part of our research and development work also involves developing 
innovative, sustainable product packaging."
"NIVEA CELLULAR LUMINOUS630® Anti-
Age & Spot Serum with natural soy extract, hyaluronic acid, and a collagen booster visibly reduces 
existing age spots in just two weeks."
It firms the skin and visibly reduces wrinkles.
"The new NIVEA 
CELLULAR LUMINOUS630® Post-Acne Marks Serum with hyaluronic acid, salicylic acid, and green 
tea extract was specially developed for the needs of oily and combination skin."
"It visibly lightens 
post-acne dark marks, smooths the skin to leave it feeling soft and refined, and helps to balance 
the skin’s oil production for a mattified and even skin tone."
"• Marking the 25th anniversary of NIVEA Q10, we successfully introduced the NIVEA Q10 Anti-
Wrinkle Specialist Targeted Wrinkle Filler in the reporting year."
"The fast-absorbing formula 
consists of a unique combination of light-diffusing pigments and skin-smoothing elastomers that 
have an immediately visible anti-wrinkle effect."
"It also contains skin-identical coenzyme Q10 in 
combination with Bioxifill® peptides for lasting, targeted wrinkle treatment."
"• With our new NIVEA Micellar Water, we introduced our first micellar water with amino acid 
complex to the market in 2023."
"This complex helps to effectively remove make-up without 
rubbing."
It is therefore gentler on the skin and suitable even for sensitive skin.
"The microplastic-
free formulas are suited to different skin types and, in addition to thorough cleansing, provide a 
soothing, refreshing, nourishing or energizing effect."
"• The successful launch of LUMINOUS630® in various face care categories was followed in 2023 by 
the first body care products based on the innovative ingredient and the benefits of the Even Skin 
Tone range."
Both products are aimed at the problem of stretch marks.
"The NIVEA 
LUMINOUS630® Anti Stretch Marks Body Oil-Serum significantly reduces the appearance of 
stretch marks, with the first visible results after two weeks."
"The NIVEA LUMINOUS630® Anti 
Stretch Marks & Spots Body Cream offers a 48-hour moisturizing formula, gives the skin a cared-
for feel, and reduces the visibility of stretch marks, sun spots, and dark spots within four weeks if 
applied regularly."
"The products do not completely remove stretch marks; instead, the molecule 
number 630 balances the skin tone, reducing the contrast between the stretch marks (or sun spots 
and dark spots) and the surrounding skin."
This makes them less visible.
"• The new deodorant range NIVEA Deo Derma Dry Control promises maximum effectiveness 
against sweat and odor."
"The innovative and sustainable formulas are silicon-free and contain a 
new range of aluminum salts."
"With the Derma Dry Technology, the range, which consists of 
aerosols and roll-ons, offers 96-hour protection against heavy sweating, moisture, and odor while 
ensuring pleasant skin feel."

for 24 hours after application, and protect against cold, wind, and dry air."
"With the new, fully 
recyclable packaging, Labello is taking a more sustainable approach and substantially reducing 
plastic consumption."
• Where hyaluron meets lip care – this is the idea behind Labello Hyaluron Lip Moisture Plus.
"The 
lip care stick is based on a technology with a higher water content to activate the hyaluronic acid."
"The result is an ultra-light, dewy texture and a formula that is absorbed deep into the lips, 
providing a moisturizing effect that lasts for up to 24 hours."
"Labello Hyaluron Lip Moisture Plus 
comes in two versions: one clear moisturizer with no color for everyday lip care and one with 
added menthol and soft color pigments to enhance the natural red color of the lips."
"Both products 
contain naturally derived ingredients with vegan, mineral oil-free formulas."
"• The eye cream Eucerin Anti-Pigment Dark Circle Illuminating Eye Care, launched on the 
market in the reporting year, combines powerful active ingredients that work in different ways to 
reduce hyperpigmentation around the eyes and promote the skin’s natural radiance."
"The formula 
contains the patented anti-pigment ingredient Thiamidol and light-reflecting pigments, which 
brighten the under-eye area for an instant fresh and awake look."
"The hyaluronic acid reduces 
puffiness and smooths fine lines, while oligopeptides stimulate the skin’s collagen network for a 
firmer skin structure."
"The eye cream can be applied easily and precisely to small areas of 
hyperpigmentation below the eyes with a cooling metal applicator."
"Optimal effects are achieved 
in just two weeks."

offers daily mineral sun protection for the face."
"Eucerin Advanced Hydration After Sun was the 
other new addition."
"This antioxidant-enriched formula helps to soothe and moisturize dry, sun-
stressed skin."
The ultra-light formula leaves skin feeling fresh and cool.
"It is suitable for use on the 
face and body."

Product and technology development1
Sustainable product and technology concepts
To manufacture repairable and recyclable products, customers need adhesive bonds that can be 
released if necessary, allowing the reuse of valuable individual components."
"Relevant EU standards on 
repairability and recyclability for electronic devices came into force in 2023."
"As part of this project, tesa 
has generated a set of working prototypes and supplied them to customers for testing."
"These are based 
on six new technological concepts with different release mechanisms."
"In the automotive sector, initial 
prototypes with high levels of aging and temperature stability have generated strong demand for 
further versions aimed at different requirements."
"The first product development project has successfully 
concluded, and further new projects have been initiated to develop removable adhesive tapes."
"As part 
of this, tesa has sent customers a host of new prototypes for diverse applications ranging from displays 
to electric vehicle batteries."

"In its own manufacturing, too, tesa achieved important milestones in the 2023 reporting year in its 
efforts to further improve the environmental footprint of technologies and products."
"These included 
reducing the carbon footprint of the popular tesa® 4965 double-sided tape by 40% without 
compromising on the properties of this versatile high-performance product."
"Achieving this involved the 
introduction and quantitative tracing of new bio-based raw materials using the biomass balance 
approach."
Films made from 90% recycled polyester (PCR-PET) also had to be qualified.
"In addition, new 
processes were implemented all along the development and manufacturing chain to enable calculation 
of key metrics such as carbon footprint at product level."
tesa continued its solvent reduction and recovery efforts in the reporting year.
"This meant both 
continuously expanding the availability of solvent-free production facilities and modifying existing 
ranges in technology and product development."
"tesa also further increased the proportion of newly 
developed solvent-free products."
"Structural tapes
In previous reporting years, tesa presented prototypes of high-strength adhesive bonds capable of 
replacing conventional welding or rivets."
"The resulting product development projects for applications 
in mobile devices progressed to market readiness in 2023 and were successfully implemented for the 
first customers."
"Another focus for adhesive tapes designed to cure at room temperature was on 
applications in the automotive industry."
"Multiple customers are currently testing these product samples, 
which can protect vehicle wiring harnesses or the cells of traction batteries for electric cars."
"Added value for customers with functional tapes
Compared with metallic joining processes, polymeric adhesives offer much greater flexibility in the 
choice of materials, allowing the integration of additional functions into the adhesive layers."
"In 2023, 
tesa further built on these technological possibilities to offer customers more innovative product 
designs incorporating functional adhesive solutions."
"Open innovation has systematically opened up 
new networks, ensuring tesa always has the necessary expertise, speed, and efficiency to develop 
complex new technologies and products."
"This is allowing tesa to work faster and access more new 
technologies and trends, generating a more sustainable and resilient innovative capacity."
"Digitalization
Global innovation leaders in all markets are increasingly digitalizing their development processes."
"This 
also requires the provision of digital data on the adhesive solutions used, including digital twins for use 
in failure modeling."
"Over the past year, the strong customer appeal of certain digital services on the 
market has been reflected for the first time in a sharp rise in requests for digital twins and digital 
consulting."
"tesa has accelerated this development and increased customer loyalty with a concerted 
expansion of the digital product portfolio."
"The various research partnerships currently underway offer a 
sound basis to continue building knowledge in artificial intelligence, simulation, and digitalization."
"Developments for the energy transition
The focus of product and technology development is on solutions for the energy transition, more of 
which were rolled out in the reporting period."
"Application areas here include the hydrogen sector, 
building energy management, and e-mobility."
"Last year’s report featured the first functional prototype 
of a window film that can be dimmed at the touch of a button."
"This serves as an energy-saving measure 
for glazing on new and existing buildings."
"In 2023, the technology was optimized to such an extent that 
it outperforms the alternative solutions available on the market."
"Samples have already been produced 
with various partners and are being piloted with a first potential customer."
"For the manufacture of modern fuel cells, we have continued to develop functional films that enable the 
fuel cells to be assembled particularly quickly and efficiently."
"The latest optimized prototypes have 
awakened customer interest and enabled new partnerships to be agreed with selected innovation 
leaders."

Large customers in the automotive industry were presented with numerous new prototypes for e-
mobility in the reporting period."
"A particular focus was on protection and adhesives for battery cells 
and their modules and housings."
"However, tesa also developed prototypes for completely new 
applications within the battery cell."
"For example, the formulas of the adhesive masses were precisely 
tailored to the complex and sensitive electrochemical processes during the many charging cycles."
"The 
aim of this was to guarantee a long battery life."
"Further information on product and technology development at tesa can be found at www.tesa.com/

"People at Beiersdorf1,2
We firmly believe that our employees are the key to the success of our company."
"Their commitment and 
expertise are a major reason why our brands and products are appreciated and purchased all over the 
world."
"As an employer, we offer our staff attractive working conditions, a multitude of opportunities for 
personal growth, and many different ways to help shape the company’s future."
"In doing so, we create 
an important basis for successfully competing for talent."
"As of December 31, 2023, Beiersdorf had a total of 21,958 employees worldwide, an increase of 2.6% 
compared with the previous year (21,401)."
"Of this total, 6,778 (previous year: 6,676) were employed in 
Germany, corresponding to a share of 31% (previous year: 31%)."
"A total of 16,769 people worked in the 
Consumer Business Segment (previous year: 16,419) and 5,189 at tesa (previous year: 4,982)."

Forward-looking human resources strategy
Our vision is to become the world’s best skin care company."
"With the People Strategy we formulated in 
2023, we set out to modernize the work and organizational structure of HR."
"Our mission is to empower 
Beiersdorf employees in every dimension to help them realize our shared vision."
2 This section of the Combined Management Report is not subject to audit requirements.
"We are a valuable business partner to the departments and regions, making our company agile and 
fit for the future through our expertise in organizational development, culture, and change 
management."
"We are working in four key areas that we call “game changers”:
• Future Fit & Agile Organization: We support and promote processes of organizational change 
with the aim of constantly developing Beiersdorf further and keeping it fit for the future in the long 
term."
"• World-Class Employee Experience: From initial contact to leaving the company, we support and 
accompany our employees in the moments that count."
"In this way, we strengthen commitment, a 
high level of employee engagement and productivity."
"• Talents for Tomorrow: We continuously develop our employees and ensure our succession 
planning."
Diversity and inclusion play a central role in our corporate culture.
"Our goal: to be the 
employer of choice for our current and future talent."
"• Role Model Leaders: We have a common understanding of leadership skills and standards and 
support our managers in their areas for development."
"To work efficiently and effectively as an Human Resources (HR) organization, we have defined roles, 
responsibilities, and work processes at global, regional, and local level in our own HR operating 
model."
"We see ourselves as ONE global HR team and inspire and appreciate each other in the way 
we work together."
We are modernizing and harmonizing our global digital infrastructure in HR.
"This will allow us to 
provide our organization with better-quality data, our employees with a better user experience, and 
our own HR departments with greater efficiency through the automation of standard processes."
"We have defined actions and KPIs for each of these objectives and successfully implemented the first 
measures in the reporting year."
"We celebrated a major success in the reporting 
year with the early achievement of our “Gender Parity Ambition”."
"This saw us achieve an equal 
proportion of women and men in all leadership positions (“Talents for Tomorrow”) some 18 months 
ahead of schedule."
More information on this milestone is provided below.
"With a view to our second 
strategic priority, we spent the reporting year preparing the roll-out of our first global employer 
branding campaign under the banner CARE CHANGES EVERYTHING and worked on our improved 
candidate recruitment experience."
Both projects will be rolled out in 2024.
"More information on the 
employer branding campaign is provided below."
There is also a section on leadership.
"Corporate culture and values
We believe that our special culture is Beiersdorf’s DNA."
"Based on trust, collaboration, respect, 
openness, and mutual appreciation, it centers on our Core Values – Care, Simplicity, Courage, and 
Trust – and sense of togetherness."
"This culture of “we” rather than “I” makes us strong and agile and is 
key to our strong cohesion and sustainable success."
"Particularly in challenging times, we are showing 
that we can rely on each other as a team and pursue an objective together: our aim of becoming the 
world’s best skin care company."
"To achieve this, we want to create a work environment where everyone 
can give their best."
"Our annual teampulse employee survey (more on page 70) has confirmed that our 
employees strongly identify with our Core Values."
"This is reflected in our purpose 
“Care Beyond Skin”, which is also the name of our sustainability strategy, and in the many services 
offered at our new campus in Hamburg."
"This ethos of care, which goes well beyond skin care, is 
appreciated by our employees, too."
"It strengthens our corporate culture and sense of cohesion, makes 
us more attractive to new talent, and sets us apart from the competition."
"Our caring approach, as well, has long been reflected by our wide range of working time models, which 
allow people to improve their work-life balance."
"Among our local affiliates, 84% offer flex time (previous 
year: 75%), 94% remote work or the ability to work from home (previous year: 95%), 55% part-time work 
(previous year: 48%), and 39% sabbaticals (previous year: 35%)."
"We will also continue to roll out the job-
sharing model, which we look at in more detail in the “Diversity, equity, and inclusion” section, around 
the world in the coming months."
"That section also sets out further examples of the ways we are 
supporting our employees and meeting their individual needs."
"In addition to the many flexible working arrangements on offer, we provide extensive childcare for our 
employees in Hamburg through our company kindergarten “TroploKids”."
"With its 108 childcare spots 
and 26 teachers (as of December 31, 2023), this is one of the largest such kindergartens in Germany."
We reached a very special milestone as part of our Care agenda in February of the reporting year.
"To 
mark World Cancer Day 2023, we became the first German company to sign the #workingwithcancer 
pledge initiated by Publicis Groupe."
"In line with our Core Value of “Care”, we committed to support our 
employees who are diagnosed with cancer or another life-threatening condition and to reduce the 
stigmatization of cancer and other serious illnesses in the workplace."
"A cross-functional project team 
worked hard during 2023 to put this into practice and create the basis for a supportive work 
environment that promotes recuperation."
"On World Cancer Day 2024, we communicated internally and 
externally the introduction of a global policy to support our employees diagnosed with a life-
threatening illness."
"With this policy, we guarantee global minimum standards for all employees 
worldwide and close gaps in the social security systems of the various countries."
"The Global Critical 
Illness Policy includes, for example, one-year job security and 100% salary compensation for employees 
with life-threatening illnesses."
"In addition to this special initiative, our health management system once again did its part to help 
employees stay healthy and productive, to promote their health in a systematic way, and to actively help 
them get better in the event of illness."
"The common umbrella GOOD FOR ME combines three teams     
– Medical, Wellbeing, and Social – that provide a wide range of health-related services to employees all 
year round."
"These include, for example, ergonomics consultations, psychological counseling sessions, 
exercise programs, presentations about health, and regular medical checkups."
"During the reporting 
year, we began preparations for our cancer prevention week in Hamburg to mark World Cancer Day 
2024."
"The idea behind: As well as attending presentations by experts in this field, our employees will be 
able to take advantage of free cancer screening or learn specific techniques to check themselves for 
potential signs of cancer."
"The team once again put a focus on mental health in the reporting year with 
specific offerings geared toward mental wellbeing."
"These are designed to raise awareness of this 
important issue and strengthen the culture of health within the company."
"The company’s medical team offered free COVID-19 and flu vaccinations in Hamburg again in the 
reporting year."
"A total of 1,554 employees (previous year: 1,784) took advantage of the flu vaccination 
offer and 209 (previous year: 2,620) of the COVID vaccine offer."
"We cannot achieve this just by encouraging new hybrid ways of working; we 
also need a culture of trust, empowerment, and community and to live up to our purpose Care Beyond 
Skin."
The wellbeing of our employees is immensely important to us.
"That is why we believe in the principle of 
participation in decision-making and company success and give so much attention to the employee 
experience and to employee engagement – our employees’ emotional connection with our company."
"We want to get a real feel for the mood at Beiersdorf and to find out how engaged our employees truly 
are."
We therefore regularly conduct global employee surveys.
"By “taking the pulse,” we aim to promote 
dialogue between our managers and their teams and set about making targeted improvements."
"In the fourth quarter of the reporting year, we once again conducted our well-known “teampulse” 
engagement survey worldwide."
"To ensure the results could be compared with the previous years, we 
used the same core questions but made some new additions to address current topics such as decision 
making and communication."
"As in previous years, our employees were keen to share their feedback."
The participation rate was 92% (previous year: 89%).
"The survey revealed three major strengths of our 
company: Our employees appreciate our diverse and inclusive working environment, feel a close 
connection to us even in uncertain times, and have a sense that they are actively contributing to our 
company’s success."
"Alongside the standardized responses from the questionnaire, we also received 
additional feedback in the form of over 23,000 comments (previous year: over 22,000)."
"The teams have 
already used the survey results and detailed feedback as an opportunity for dialogue and discussing 
ideas and suggestions."
"In the coming months, we will work together on measures to sustain the high 
level of employee engagement at Beiersdorf."
"These include global and local town hall meetings, works assemblies, and events and 
fairs arranged by different departments."
"We use e-mails from our Executive Committee and our intranet 
– at global and local level – to keep all employees worldwide informed and involved."
"This dialogue is 
designed to strengthen our “we culture” and also reflects our Core Value of Care."
"=
Another important element of our corporate culture is the close involvement of employee 
representatives."
"Working with them in a constructive atmosphere of trust enables us to make and 
implement important and sometimes difficult decisions together."
"Participation also played a particularly big role in campus planning for our new company headquarters 
in Hamburg, which we officially opened in September 2023."
"Employees were involved from the very 
beginning of the project and were already shaping the new campus before its completion."
Employees also suggested the names of the individual buildings.
"The new campus also meets the 
explicit wish of many employees for an environment that encourages creative dialogue and provides 
more space for people to collaborate, inspire each other, and think outside the box."
"Many of our activities related to diversity, equity, and inclusion are also about participation."
"There is 
more information about these in the “Diversity, equity, and inclusion” section at the end of this chapter."

Future of work and hybrid working
Our working world has changed fundamentally in recent years."
"Shaped by digitalization and new 
technologies, hybrid working has become ever more established."
"Future of Work has become 
synonymous with the new forms of work and changing approaches to the workplace."
">At Beiersdorf, flexible working has been in place for several years."
"For example, a collective 
agreement currently allows our staff at Beiersdorf AG, Beiersdorf Customer Supply GmbH, and 
Beiersdorf Shared Services GmbH to work from a flexible location for up to 40% of their individual 
planned working hours, provided that their job is suited to remote working."
"We also offer hybrid 
working for employees all around the world."
"=
For us, modern workspaces are part and parcel of Future of Work."
"We use these to encourage new 
forms of collaboration and create a pleasant working atmosphere."
"Starting from this basic idea, our 
offices in Seoul, Bucharest, and Amsterdam underwent a transformative modernization in the reporting 
year."
"However, the particular highlight of 2023 was the opening of our new Beiersdorf Campus right in 
the heart of Hamburg – where our success story began 142 years ago."
"This new Group headquarters, 
which combines renovated existing buildings and brand-new structures into a campus spanning 
51,000m², is our opportunity for further cultural transformation."
"This is where we want to bring Future of 
Work to life, become even more efficient, and break down departmental silos."
"For us at Beiersdorf, 
Future of Work means maximizing our employees’ freedom to make decisions."
"Instead of imposing a 
model workspace on our approximately 3,000 people in Hamburg, the campus instead offers them 
different options."
"Depending on their working style and the tasks and projects on their agenda, they 
can choose each day to use a workspace that best suits them personally."
"Together with their team, in a 
small room, inside, outside in the park, in the working café, on our 4,000m² collaboration floor with 
modular workshop spaces – the choice for each employee every day is vast."
"Fitness, osteopathy, bikes, 
washing, and mail are just some of the on-campus services, and we also have our own kindergarten."
"Since the campus officially opened in September 2023, we have seen how excited our employees are 
to come to the office, meet each other, and work collaboratively and creatively."
"This was exactly the aim 
of our €250 million investment: a modern campus that inspires all employees and regularly brings them 
together – as the basis for our business success, new innovations, and bringing to life our “we culture” 
and idea of togetherness."
"Competing for talent
Competition for talent has been escalating for years."
"What was once an employer’s market has turned 
into an employee’s market, as companies increasingly compete internationally to attract the best 
people."
Employees’ needs and expectations have also shifted.
"The desire for more flexible working has 
come to the forefront."
We as a company are adjusting to this.
"With our vision of Future of Work, a highly innovative approach, 
and the use of the latest technologies, we are seeking to find the right answer to these trends so as to 
win and retain top talent."
"Our talent search in the reporting year combined face-to-face events with 
digital offerings."
"This included our Open House Day, which this year took place in person on our new 
Beiersdorf Campus and where our colleagues from tesa and Tchibo offered 80 international 
participants an insight into our three companies."
"Since the reporting year, we have also been offering 
live-streamed events with selected Beiersdorfers – including Executive Board members."
"These cover 
various key topics and give students and young professionals the opportunity to better get to know 
Beiersdorf and ask questions."
"Our Early Career Team have also been visiting our partner universities 
and attending various university fairs, including the CEMS Career Forum 2023 in Barcelona."
"The careers 
pages of the Beiersdorf website also provide information on open positions and entry options for 
young and talented people."
"The accompanying 
campaign shows what defines us as an employer and centers on our Core Value of Care."
"We care,” the campaign features current employees and invites people to find out 
more about Beiersdorf with target group-specific messages and an appealing look and feel."
"To reach 
the target group as well as possible, the campaign will run globally and simultaneously on various 
channels starting from the first quarter of 2024."
"This will include various social media touchpoints, job 
portals, and events."
The careers website will also undergo a relaunch for the start of the new campaign.
">Training and further education
Our mission also includes creating employment prospects for young people."
"Our training and 
education in Germany are geared to the skills needed, and we regularly review our portfolio of 
vocational occupations and degree-integrated vocational training."
"Beiersdorf offered vocational 
training in nine occupations at its Hamburg headquarters in the reporting year."
"At the end of 2023, we 
had 96 vocational trainees here (previous year: 99), 32 of whom started their training in the reporting 
year, while 27 trainees (previous year: 34) were recruited into a temporary or permanent position 
having successfully completed their vocational training."
"Eight of the new trainees started their training 
under the degree-integrated vocational training model."
"Here, the trainees complete a three-year 
vocational course as an industrial business administrator along with a four-year bachelor’s degree in 
business administration with a focus on industry."
"We also offer our global graduate trainee program BEYOND BORDERS for young professionals and a 
large number of internships for students all around the world."
"A total of 18 young employees were 
enrolled in the global BEYOND BORDERS trainee program at the end of the reporting year (previous 
year: 16)."
"Of this total, ten trainees started in 2023 (previous year: 11)."
"During the 18-month program, 
the trainees complete personalized assignments in Germany and other countries."
"They can choose from 
six focus topics in advance: corporate strategy, brand management & digital marketing, sales & e-
commerce, finance & controlling, supply chain management, and human resources."
"Leadership
An open and modern leadership culture forms the basis for an attractive and appreciative working 
environment in which all employees can give their best."
"In order to establish it, we formulated our 
understanding of a good leadership culture in “Leadership the Beiersdorf Way” back in 2017."
"This 
leadership culture is based on our Core Values of Care, Simplicity, Courage, and Trust."
"It aims to 
develop leaders who are authentic and inspiring and empower their team to outstanding achievements."
"The idea behind this is that by giving employees more decision-making power, their sense of 
engagement and accountability will increase."
"This will lead to better team performances and higher 
intrinsic motivation."
We continued to work on developing a new leadership culture in the reporting year.
"The global roll-out 
is planned for 2024."
"We used the reporting year to step up the dialogue between our first level of 
management and the Executive Board (including through cross-functional collaboration on strategic 
projects) and 360° feedback for all managers who report directly to the Executive Board."
"We also 
continued our “Behavior Activation Journey”, which aims to integrate behaviors into our day-to-day 
workplace culture that are important to our success."
"Along with prioritization, these chiefly include a 
culture of communicating openly."
"With this, we want to promote a culture in which employees find a 
psychologically safe environment in which they are allowed to have and defend their own opinion and 
question things."
"In this way, we aim to better leverage the potential of different perspectives among our 
workforce."

Since 2021, we have been using the “Development & Potential Process” in order to identify and 
promote new management talent."
"To identify an employee’s potential, we build on the “learning agility model,” which consists of four 
dimensions: mental agility, people agility, change agility, and results agility."
"On this basis, we aim to 
identify potential leaders who have the ability to adapt to new circumstances, learn quickly, including 
from experience, and continue their personal growth."
"As such, potential should not be equated with 
performance, but rather the ability to deal with future challenges in the best possible way."
"In the past fiscal year, we worked on refining our processes and improving the quality of development 
plans for successor candidates."
"In the coming year, we will focus on further improving the quality of 
development plans at all levels of management."
"To support these individuals, we offer the Base Camp training program, 
which is aimed at all employees who are taking on a management position for the first time."
"Knowledge and learning
We are convinced that the skills and expertise of our employees play a crucial role in our sustainable 
success and long-term growth."
"For this reason, we continuously invest in training our workforce and 
pursue the idea of a learning organization through our global learning strategy, which encourages self-
directed, lifelong learning by all."
"This included various e-learning programs on the 
topics of sustainability, behavioral change, and digital training."
"With LEVEL-UP, we developed the first 
global training platform for digital upskilling (with a focus on Office 365)."
"This was created in 
collaboration with different departments, including local training staff."
"With our range of learning 
materials, we aim to ensure that our employees in all parts of the company find offerings specially 
tailored to them."
"As a major new component of our learning infrastructure, we introduced our new learning experience 
platform SKILLCARE in the reporting year, starting with a limited number of functions and countries."
"As 
a new Beiersdorf learning center, SKILLCARE combines all the internal and external learning 
opportunities available to the workforce."
"A project team consisting of global training staff and the Sales 
Academy has developed new learning plans based on the Sales Competency Model."
"This new content 
specifically for sales employees is available on SKILLCARE."
"Bespoke new learning programs were also 
developed for HR in the reporting year based on the HR upskilling priorities for 2023."
"These can be 
found on SKILLCARE along with the Operational Excellence (OPEX) learning path, which was published 
in November 2023 as the first cross-functional learning program."
The use of SKILLCARE is to be extended to further functions and regions in 2024.
"With this step, we 
want to build a global, comprehensive learning ecosystem that facilitates targeted, self-determined 
learning as part of people’s day-to-day work."
"Diversity, equity, and inclusion 
As a global company, we see diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) as a real competitive advantage."
"We 
firmly believe that people are happier, more effective, and more motivated when their different 
backgrounds, experience, and skills are valued and when they can truly be their unique selves."
"We see this 
diversity as a unique source of creativity, strength, consumer centricity, and innovation."
"We also believe 
that our commitment to DE&I gives us advantages in the competition for global talent and supports our 
vision of becoming the world’s best employer in the skin care sector."
"To showcase our DE&I ambition and as a sign of our commitment in this area, we signed the Charta der 
Vielfalt (Diversity Charter) back in 2012."
"The initiative aims to advance the recognition, appreciation, 
and inclusion of various aspects of diversity in the world of work."
"In order to enhance diversity, equity, 
and inclusion across Beiersdorf as a whole, we have also had a Global Director Diversity & Inclusion 
(D&I) since 2020, who reports directly to the Executive Board."
"Together with a small team, this position 
leads and coordinates Group-wide DE&I initiatives."
"To reinforce this topic at global, regional, and local 
level, too, we have a global network of more than 100 DE&I champions in our international affiliates."
They regularly discuss Group-wide and local DE&I initiatives.
"In addition, the Diversity Committee of the 
Supervisory Board regularly reviews and supports various initiatives."
"To further boost the visibility of our 
DE&I activities and approaches among new talent, we merged our Strategic Recruiting & Talent 
Acquisition department, including our “early career” activities at universities and careers fairs, with the 
DE&I organization effective December 1, 2023."
"With this change, the former Global Director DE&I has 
now become HR Vice President CoE DEI & TA."
"We track the progress of our DE&I activities using various key performance indicators (KPIs), on which 
we report regularly to the Executive Board and selected internal stakeholders."
"Our DE&I KPI Dashboard 
and our DE&I KPI Reports are designed to provide transparency."
"This enables regions and functions to 
analyze the progress and potential of DE&I work based on our global DE&I strategy."
"The aim is to help 
enshrine DE&I ambitions and strengthen DE&I governance on the basis of this data and in close 
collaboration with global, regional, and local stakeholders."
"In addition to this, the Executive Committee 
is also evaluated on the basis of changes to the KPIs."
"With this new global “DE&I Roadmap,” which incorporates multiple dimensions of 
diversity, we aim to make Beiersdorf fit for the future and set out our clear ambition: We want to 
become a top employer for global talent by establishing a truly inclusive corporate culture."
"On top of 
this comes our vision of building a management team and workforce who reflect the diversity of our 
consumers and an equal gender balance."
"We briefly describe the 
successes below:
Embedding a truly inclusive we culture
To build a sustainable bedrock of DE&I knowledge within our organization and promote an inclusive 
culture of respect and collaboration, we introduced our Global DEI Knowledge Framework in 2021."
"As 
well as various inspiration sessions and events, this also now includes the new, holistic DE&I Learning 
Curriculum introduced in the reporting year, which brings together different training programs for 
employees and managers."
"The curriculum also includes e-learning units on unconscious bias and a DE&I-
inclusive language training course entitled “Choosing Our Words With Care”, which we introduced as a 
pilot in 2022."
"Its goal is to raise awareness among employees worldwide regarding the need to use 
language in a sensitive, nuanced way in order to avoid subtle discrimination and to respect and honor 
the perspectives and feelings of others."
"To be ready for the global roll-out of this training, we trained 
over 40% of our approximately 500 global HR employees in 2023."
"In the next two years, we plan to offer 
the content in the form of e-learning courses worldwide and to continue providing it on a regular basis 
during our DE&I events."
"At our Hamburg location, we worked with a local project called INNOKLUSIO 
in fall 2023 to establish a new upskilling format."
"This will improve our employees’ inclusion awareness in 
relation to people with a disability."
"These four-hour training sessions were preceded by the Global D&I 
Week, where we put a spotlight on disability as part of an internal event."
The DE&I team is in regular dialogue with the various communities.
All the networks initiated diverse events and training offerings in the reporting year.
"It was a particular honor to meet Germany’s diversity drivers and 
present the awards to the 14 best projects and individuals."
">Driving diversity in leadership positions (focus: gender parity)
We announced our Beiersdorf Gender Parity Ambition on International Women‘s Day 2021."
"The aim 
was to promote gender diversity in leadership positions."
"We wanted to achieve a 50/50 gender-
balanced leadership across all management positions worldwide below the Executive Board 
(management groups 1– 4) by 2025."
"We achieved this target in the reporting year – 18 months earlier 
than planned."
"As of September 1, 2023, the representation of women in management positions 
worldwide increased to over 50%."
But our work is not yet done.
"We want to continue our efforts and 
ensure that a gender balance remains the norm in the future, too."
"We want to ensure equal 
opportunities, because while talent is spread evenly, opportunities are not."
"In addition to our global Gender Parity Ambition, in Germany we are bound by the provisions of the 
German Law on the equal participation of men and women in leadership positions."
"Under § 76 (4) of 
the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG), Beiersdorf AG must set binding targets for 
increasing the proportion of women at the two management levels below the Executive Board, to be 
achieved by 2026."
"A minimum proportion of at least 30% women and 30% men on the Supervisory 
Board and at least one woman on the Executive Board are also required by law; in addition, the 
Supervisory Board has set a voluntary target of 30% women on the Executive Board."

"On International Women‘s Day on March 8, we offered our employees a 
global online event under the banner “#EmbraceEquity.” with numerous sessions designed to put the 
put the spotlight on gender equity and raise awareness of unconscious bias."
"In advance of International 
Women‘s Day, the DE&I team encouraged all employees to show their commitment to more equality 
and post a photo of themselves in the #EmbraceEquity pose on the intranet so as to highlight the 
importance of equal opportunity for all genders."
"There was also plenty of space for dialogue at the 7th Wo*Men in Leadership Convention, which took 
place on November 21, 2023, and was aimed at all employees worldwide."
"Under the motto “Change – 
Own – Lead – Grow – Inspire the narrative,” the program comprised various keynotes, “change-making” 
sessions, and interactive master classes."
"A speed-dating format also enabled attendees to talk directly 
to our Executive Committee and various managers from the most senior level."
"For the first time, there 
were also local sessions in various regions (e.g., Dubai, Eastern Europe, Brazil, and North America), 
giving the convention an international focus."
"The overarching message of the event: “Get involved, 
because change begins with engagement."
"We can only change the narrative together.” Some 350 
people attended in person, with over 1,100 employees following via the livestream."
"The employee community #SisterhoodisPower held their first global summit concurrently with this 
year’s Wo*Men in Leadership Convention."
"Here, 19 employees from nine different countries laid the 
foundations for the community’s global roll-out."
"The community’s aim is to combine the voices of all 
female employees around the world and for women to support each other in the workplace."
"With the Female Talent 
Program, we continued our development program for women in the reporting year in collaboration 
with the London-based company Shape Talent."
"Having launched the Female Leadership in Finance 
program in 2022, which continued in 2023, we added a new program in the reporting year for the 
supply chain organization."
This is titled StrongHER.
"All these measures seek to promote gender equality

and tear down any barriers."
"They inspire women to realize their full potential and (better) contribute 
their talent."
"However, we recognize that driving this transformation also requires men to get involved 
and actively change their behavior."
"As in the previous year, we also offered two “parental leavers” programs in collaboration with the start-
up MyCollective."
"One is aimed specifically at managers entering parental leave, while the other is open 
to all employees currently on leave with young children."
"Both programs are based on an online 
platform that enables employees on parental leave to remain in contact with Beiersdorf throughout this 
period if they wish, to expand their network, and to take advantage of various further training 
opportunities."
"The focus here is on providing the right tools to support their return to work in the best 
possible way."
"The job sharing model has been standard practice at our company 
for several years and also applies at the top management level (known as “top sharing”) or, via the “joint 
leadership” model, up to the middle management level."
"We also support the “senior meets junior” 
model, where employees from two generations share a job and learn from each other."
"This provides 
them the option for part-time study or a transition to partial retirement."
"As “senior meets junior” shows, 
job sharing these days is not only for mothers returning to the workplace."
"We see it as an important tool 
for strategic HR work and employee development ."
"At the end of the reporting year, there were 38 job 
sharing tandems at Beiersdorf (previous year: 42)."
"21 tandems (previous year: 22) involve people 
responsibility – either part-time or full-time."
"Two tandems also work cross-border – one colleague is 
based in Hamburg and the other in Vienna (Austria)."
"In the other tandem, one colleague works in 
Hamburg and the tandem partner works from Birmingham (England)."
"In addition to the above, we also actively promote gender equity through various partnerships."
"Since 
2022, we have therefore been a close partner of the LEAD Network (Leading Executives Advancing 
Diversity), whose goal is to attract, retain and advance women in the consumer goods and retail sector 
in Europe."
"Like Beiersdorf, the LEAD Network is committed to creating a diverse workforce in which 
people of all genders can work to their full potential and where people with equal talents are given 
equal opportunities."
"The LEAD community within Beiersdorf’s workforce currently boasts around 200 
employees (previous year: around 240), including CEO Vincent Warnery and our Executive Committee, 
as well as many managers and employees of all genders."
"Our DE&I management also works on many other 
dimensions of diversity."
"These particularly include:
• cultural diversity and internationality,
• different gender identities and sexual orientations (LGBTIQ+),
• different generations,
• and the integration of people with a disability."
"We have been actively promoting the cultural diversity and internationality of our workforce for 
many years."
"Our aim is for our workforce to better represent and understand our diverse consumers all 
around the world."
"Employees from 112 countries worked at Beiersdorf as of the end of the reporting 
year (previous year: 102)."
"At the Group headquarters in Hamburg, the proportion of international 
employees increased to 23.4% (previous year: 21.7%)."
"Of our managers in the top three levels of 
management, 40% had lived and worked outside of their home countries for at least three years 
(previous year: 42%)."
"To send a clear message against discrimination in relation to different skin types and colors, our NIVEA 
brand implemented its “Skin Out Loud“ campaign in the reporting year."
"The campaign consisted of five 
episodes on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Spotify that celebrated (skin) diversity and emphasized 
that every skin has the potential to be healthy and beautiful – irrespective of ethnicity, age, identity, or 
gender."
"It goes without saying that we welcome people of every gender identity and sexual orientation in our 
workforce."
They enrich our global team.
"Together with our LGBTIQ+ community “Be You @Beiersdorf,” 
we proactively fly the flag for tolerance and acceptance all year round."
"In the reporting year, for 
example this included Pride Month, Christopher Street Day (CSD) in Hamburg, and Coming Out Day."
We once again took part in CSD with our colorful Beiersdorf truck.
"Together with over 200 
Beiersdorfers on and alongside the truck, we took a deliberate stand against transphobia and publicly 
showed that everyone in all their individual uniqueness is welcome in our team."
"We also continued our 
partnership with the Hamburg-based non-profit initiative WELCOMING OUT."
"The initiative aims to 
alleviate fears of coming out among members of the LGBTIQ+ community and calls upon heterosexual 
cisgender people to show allyship and solidarity."
"In October of the reporting year, we took on the 
hosting and sponsorship of the [WEL-]COMING OUT DAY Event 2023."
"Our partners invited people to 
take part and celebrate Coming Out Day."
"The NIVEA and Labello brands also once again showed their 
support for the Pride movement in the reporting year."
"To clearly show their allyship with the LGBTIQ+ 
community, they launched the Labello Pride Kiss Edition and a NIVEA tin in a new rainbow design."
Strong teamwork between different generations is also hugely important to us.
"This involves the 
generations learning from each other and combining their different strengths."
"We are mindful of the 
abilities and needs of every employee and especially those of older members of staff."
"In the Consumer 
Business Segment in Germany, the proportion of employees aged over 50 was 30% at the end of the 
reporting period (previous year: 32%)."
"In contrast, a total of 15% of employees are younger than 30 
(previous year: 15%)."
"The average age of employees in Germany as of December 31, 2023, was 42 
(previous year: 42)."
"To support our employees over 50, there are internal training courses tailored to 
the needs of this group."
"For example, these include a learning initiative focused specifically on digital 
topics, which is offered through the support of Beiersdorf’s affiliate Beiersdorf Shared Services GmbH."
"In addition, the New Generation 50+ employee network actively furthers the interests of employees 
aged 50+."
"On top of this, Beiersdorf sponsored again an online event run by our meta network 
“ChangeMaker50+“ at the end of October 2023."
"The event was all about “acting as a network” and 
included inspiring speeches and presentations as well as interactive workshops on generational 
diversity at work and beyond, some of which were devised by dedicated Beiersdorf staff."
"Since 
2021, we have been supporting the nationwide INNOKLUSIO initiative, which aims to promote inclusion 
awareness at various levels in order to integrate more people with disabilities into the labor market."
"The 
aim is to break down the preconceptions that can lead to exclusion of people with disabilities and to 
bring about a profound cultural change."
"As part of this collaboration, our Global DE&I Week 2023 in 
May was focused on people with disabilities."
"During the week, employees in Hamburg could find out 
more about various key topics and experience an exhibition initiated by INNOKLUSIO."
"This “Blackbox” 
exhibition allowed participants to see things from a different perspective and raised awareness of how 
to improve the participation of people with a disability."
"We also offered a range of online activities for 
our employees worldwide."
"To build further knowledge in this area, we established a new upskilling 
format at our Hamburg location in fall 2023, which was aimed at improving inclusion awareness in 
relation to people with a disability."
"These sessions, too, were offered in partnership with INNOKLUSIO 
and sought to break down anxieties, reservations, and uncertainties around disability."
"tesa
As an international manufacturer of innovative adhesive tapes and self-adhesive product solutions, tesa 
positions itself as an attractive and sustainable employer."
"It is vital for the company to recruit and 
develop highly qualified staff and retain them long-term as a prerequisite for maintaining tesa’s positive 
performance."
"Employee development
In 2023, tesa once again invested in training its staff and creating further attractive development 
opportunities for them."
"Further online and in-person learning offerings were added to the development opportunities for 
employees and managers in the reporting year."
"tesa established development centers and other 
activities specially for its high potentials, and supported these individuals with tailor-made development 
measures."
"Leadership culture
Managers’ ability to offer employees a motivating work environment, among other things, and 
encourage them to express their talents is key to tesa’s business success and its attractiveness as an 
employer."
"In the first quarter of 2023, tesa began the introduction of a new Management Excellence 
Program in collaboration with the European School of Management and Technology Berlin (ESMT 
Berlin)."
"The program aims to convey to managers important leadership skills in fields such as strategy 
development, sustainability, innovation, and transformation."
"In the reporting period, two cohorts 
consisting of 25 managers each already completed the program, which lasts approximately six months 
and includes various remote modules as well as two in-person modules."

A further focal aspect of HR work is to encourage tesa’s talents."
"In the Competencies Review, talented 
people are given the opportunity to take part in exercises related to their occupation in a format similar 
to an assessment center."
"The participants then receive informed feedback on their strengths and areas 
for development based on the tesa Values."
"Major components include continuous peer feedback, a 
presentation by participants, and a learning path covering the ten months beyond the Competencies 
Review."
"During this time, participants receive a high level of support from their line managers and from 
HR."
"Knowledge transfer
Training and professional development of managers and employees were carried out once again as in-
person events as well as remotely during the reporting period."
"In addition to in-person formats and e-learning, tesa further customized the use of the external digital 
platform LinkedIn Learning to tesa’s specific requirements and developed company-specific learning 
paths tailored to needs."
"The topics of compliance, occupational safety, sustainability, product and technology development, 
sales, and the Supply Network are already included in the e-learning formats."
"Employees can access 
tesa’s professional development offerings at any time via a digital tesa Learning Hub."
"In 2023, a new leadership training series was further adapted to hybrid forms of working."
"It is divided 
into a “basics” and an “advanced” training program."
"Participants in international groups are taught 
fundamental management skills and how to handle management tasks in the “basics” part."
"In the 
“advanced” part, experienced managers are trained and developed in the areas of team development, 
change management, and coaching."
"The content of the management training series is focused on the 
challenges of the current tesa strategy."
"The global employee review – tesa Performance Appraisal – takes place throughout the tesa 
organization."
"The purpose of this meeting between employee and manager is to discuss feedback on 
work results and work behavior in a spirit of dialogue and to receive guidance from the manager for the 
coming year."
"Not only managers, but also all employees are urged to prepare for the appraisal using 
the questionnaire."
"Backed by this new process, tesa is strengthening individuals’ personal responsibility 
and initiative, as well as awareness of their performance and accomplishments."
"A further aim is to 
enable employees and managers to benefit from a stronger culture of feedback and dialogue at tesa."
"Attractive working environment
In the reporting year, tesa pursued further initiatives aimed at fostering an attractive working 
environment, because an appealing environment can contribute to employee well-being."
"Occupational health management
tesa’s workplaces are equipped with ergonomic and contemporary furniture and equipment, such as 
height-adjustable desks and modern lighting and ventilation concepts."
"In addition, employees at the 
company headquarters in Norderstedt have access to a comprehensive health management program 
under the umbrella brand “It’s for you!” This program includes ergonomic counseling, colorectal cancer 
screenings, a health club, and massages."
"Company medical care as well as internal and external 
psychosocial counseling and support are also part of the health management program."
"tesa Young Connection
As part of tesa Young Connection, new employees at tesa come together to form a community."
"In the 
reporting period, there were in-person as well as remote events on various professional and team-
building topics."
"The focus of this community is on networking, with the aim of strengthening cohesion 
and retaining young talents."

New Work
tesa has further invested in IT and communications technology for hybrid working and integrated 
creative and social spaces into working practices."
"These are inviting settings for meetings and creative 
collaboration."
"tesa also implemented its first desk-sharing concepts in selected departments to enable 
even greater individual freedom in the choice of working location and to better reflect working in matrix 
structures."
"Additional benefits
In addition, employees at the headquarters in Norderstedt can, among other offerings, take advantage 
of a cleaning service, visit regular market stalls to purchase regional fruit and vegetables, and utilize 
various mobility concepts."
"For example, they have the ability to charge electric vehicles and e-bikes at a 
company charging point and park rental bikes from Hamburg’s “Stadtrad” initiative at a station on-site."
Employees also have the option of leasing bicycles through a subsidized program.
"Sustainability1
Sustainability is firmly anchored in our business strategy and is a central element of our decision-making 
and business processes."
"For us, acting sustainably means conserving resources, constantly reducing 
our carbon footprint, respecting and strengthening human rights throughout the entire value chain, and 
making a positive contribution to an inclusive society."
"In 2023, we continued to make solid progress 
and drive forward the transformation of our company, which we detail in our Non-financial Statement 
(NFE)."

Combined Non-financial Statement of the Beiersdorf Group and 
Beiersdorf AG
In accordance with Germany’s CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG), Beiersdorf reports on 
material non-financial aspects of its business activities in its Annual Report."
"These include aspects 
regarding the environment, employees, society, human rights, and anti-corruption."
"The following 
sections of the Annual Report constitute the Combined Non-financial Statement (NFS) for the Beiersdorf 
Group (Consumer and tesa Business Segments) and Beiersdorf AG, as defined under sections 315b 
and 289b of the Handelsgesetzbuch (German Commercial Code, HGB)."
"Alongside the NFS, the tesa Business Segment publishes a separate sustainability report with more 
detailed information on sustainability activities and projects during the reporting year."
"The Consumer Business Segment, however, follows the GRI Standards and 
publishes a separate GRI index."
"In 2023, the UNGC introduced a new digital platform on 
which to submit the COP, though technical problems led to the platform being taken offline 
temporarily."
"As a result, submission of the COP was voluntary in the reporting year, and Beiersdorf will 
resume its reporting in 2024."
"Material non-financial topics for the business segments
Both business segments conduct materiality analyses to strategically identify and review sustainability 
topics."
"In the Consumer Business Segment, such an analysis was last carried out in 2021."
"The tesa Business Segment last updated its materiality matrix with members of relevant specialist 
departments in 2020."
"The material non-financial topics identified are climate and energy, product 
sustainability, resource efficiency, water, employee development, diversity and equal opportunities, 
occupational health and safety, human rights, prevention of anticompetitive behavior, and product 
safety."
"For an overview of all material non-financial topics relating to the Consumer and tesa Business 
Segments, together with section and page references, please refer to our index to the Non-financial 
Statement."
"No changes were made to the materiality analyses of the Consumer and tesa business segments in the 
reporting year, meaning that the aforementioned topics remain material."
"Statement scope
Disclosures on the material NFS topics are mainly provided separately for the tesa and Consumer 
Business Segments."
"In principle, all information is reported jointly for the Beiersdorf Group and 
Beiersdorf AG."
"Likewise, the majority shareholding S-Biomedic, 
which was acquired in 2022, is not included in the key figures for reasons of materiality.1 Due to the 
limited data availability with regard to non-financial topics, our NIVEA-KAO business in Japan is also not 
included in this statement."

Strategy
Sustainability is a core component of Beiersdorf corporate culture and of fundamental importance in 
our decision-making and business processes."
"We strive to reconcile environmental protection, social 
responsibility, and our economic success and are constantly refining and enhancing our commitment 
and engagement in these areas."
"Our Group-wide Corporate Sustainability function is responsible for setting the strategic direction of 
our sustainability activities and regularly reports to the Executive Board on progress and the need for 
action."
"This function reports directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board of Beiersdorf AG, who is 
responsible for sustainability."
"We have two cross-functional steering committees in place to oversee the management of key 
sustainability issues such as climate action: the Sustainability Council for the Consumer Business 
Segment and the Global Executive Committee for tesa."
"The directors of all relevant business units 
headed by the members of the Executive Board are represented on the Sustainability Council."
"This 
committee meets at least once every quarter."
"The Global Executive Committee at tesa is composed of 
the members of the Executive Board and other executives."
"The committee meets every two weeks and 
also discusses sustainability-related topics in the course of its meetings."
"In addition, the Chief 
Sustainability Officer reports directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board of tesa."
We also maintain a regular dialogue with our external stakeholders.
"This exchange ensures that we 
continuously review our sustainability activities and include current social and environmental 
developments in our planning."
Our CARE BEYOND SKIN Sustainability Agenda has been an integral part of C.A.R.E.+ since 2020.
"We have set ourselves ambitious targets in all 
areas, which we aim to achieve by 2025 and 2030, respectively."
"Our efforts are based on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"Through the implementation of our sustainability agenda, we 
are contributing to 13 of the 17 SDGs."
"We raised our ambitions during the reporting year, particularly with regard to climate protection."
"Our 
aim is to cut all our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 90% by 2045 
(versus the base year 2018) and thus achieve net zero emissions by the target year in accordance with 
the Net Zero Standard of the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi)."
"In early 2024, the SBTi confirmed 
that it considers this goal to be in line with the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement."
We also held our first global volunteer day at Beiersdorf in 2023.
"All employees worldwide were given 
the chance to spend an entire working day volunteering for various projects run by local non-profit 
organizations."
"More than 10,000 employees in 68 countries participated in this “CARE BEYOND SKIN 
Day,” supporting social and environmental causes aligned with our Sustainability Agenda and thereby 
heightening their awareness of sustainability issues."

tesa
At tesa, sustainability is firmly enshrined in the business strategy."
"Our ambition is to use all our 
technological know-how and passion to develop more sustainable adhesive solutions and products."
"Five strategic action areas, for which tesa has set long-term targets for 2030, form the framework for 
this."
"These fields extend across the business segment’s entire value chain and are: Reduction of 
Emissions, Responsible Sourcing, Use of Recycled and Bio-based Materials, Circularity and Reduction of 
Waste, and Supporting our Customers in their Sustainability goals."
"The sustainability agenda, which is based on the Ten Principles of the UNGC and the SDGs of the 
United Nations, continues to be a cornerstone of the strategy."
"It now reflects our aspiration to view 
sustainability holistically and thus also includes topics that go beyond the strategic action areas – like 
occupational safety, for example."
"Description of the business model
Beiersdorf is one of the world’s leading companies in the consumer goods industry."
"Since its founding 
in 1882, the company has become well-established thanks to its strong brands and it now has over 
20,000 employees."
"The Beiersdorf business is divided into two segments: The Consumer Business 
Segment, which focuses on skin care, and the tesa Business Segment, which concentrates on 
developing high quality self-adhesive systems and product solutions."
"A detailed description of the 
business model is provided in the “Business and Strategy” section in the Group Management Report."
"Material risks
As a company that operates on a global scale, we are aware of our position as a role model and our 
obligation to conduct our activities in a responsible manner when interacting with the environment, 
individuals, and society as a whole."
"If we fail to fulfill our due diligence, it can lead to non-financial risks."
"This may include risks arising from our own business activities (inside-out risks), such as negative 
impacts on people or the environment, as well as events and developments that have a negative impact 
on our business performance (outside-in risks)."
"As part of our Group-wide integrated management system, we therefore regularly evaluate which non-
financial risks are relevant to Beiersdorf and where we need to actively manage these."
"Risks are 
considered material if they have a high probability of occurrence based on predefined thresholds and if 
they are expected to have a severe negative impact on material non-financial topics."
"During the year 
under review, Beiersdorf introduced a new Group-wide risk management tool that enables non-
financial risks to be assessed more thoroughly than before."
"In this way, we intend to emphasize 
internally how important the issues identified as material are to our company and at the same time meet 
the increasingly demanding requirements for managing and reporting sustainability risks."
"In 2023, the 
risk of incorrectly disposed plastic packaging was again assessed as material within the meaning of 
Germany’s CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)."
"Use of plastic packaging can lead to 
environmental pollution if it is not disposed of properly or if the disposal infrastructure in the country of 
sale is inadequate."
"We counter this risk through our circular economy strategy, which involves reducing 
the use of fossil-based plastics (see “Circular economy” section)."

As a consumer goods manufacturer, we are highly aware of the impact of our business activities on the 
environment."
"We therefore work continuously to minimize the environmental consequences of our 
processes and products."
"In this context, we focus our efforts primarily on the areas of climate 
protection, circular economy, sustainable land use, and water."
"Climate protection
We view climate change as one of the greatest challenges of our time."
"Risks and opportunities arising 
from climate change therefore influence our business strategy and our company’s activities."
"We document and manage the risks associated with climate change – for example, effects on raw 
material prices and material availability or the introduction of new fiscal instruments – as well as the 
corresponding risk mitigation measures via our integrated risk management system."
"In 2023, the topic 
“impact of climate change on the supply chain” was included as a strategic risk in the Group-wide risk 
management system for the first time."
"This risk was confirmed by the Risk Board and appropriate 
countermeasures were defined."
"Furthermore, the Consumer Business Segment updated its analysis of climate-related physical and 
transitory risks and opportunities during the reporting year."
"The update was based on the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in line with the 
“Net Zero Emissions by 2050” (NZE) scenario of the International Energy Agency (IEA)."
"We have thus 
expanded the scope of the analysis, for example by looking at the potential risks of additional locations."
A summary of TCFD-related information is available in a separate document on our website.
"A detailed 
description of our risk management structure can be found in the “Risk Report” section of the 
Combined Management Report."
"Climate action is a key area of activity in the sustainability strategies of the Consumer and tesa Business 
Segments."
"The carbon emissions reduction targets are firmly enshrined in the Executive Board’s own 
objectives."
"The activities required to achieve our climate goals are also factored into our financial and 
investment planning."
"Both the Sustainability Council in the Consumer Business Segment and the 
General Executive Committee at tesa are responsible for monitoring climate-related decisions."
"The 
main focus of their work is on further developing the strategies, reviewing the progress made toward 
achieving our climate targets, and driving forward the implementation of climate protection measures."
"The Executive Committee at Beiersdorf also regularly discusses the plans and progress of the climate 
strategy."
"For the Consumer Business Segment, the Sustainability Council adopted targets in 2022 that focus on 
individual product categories, and in the reporting year it introduced further measures to ensure that 
the business segment achieves these targets."
"We also aim to 
reduce indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along our value chain (Scope 3 emissions) by 10% by 
2025."
"Scope 2 emissions are caused by the generation of energy that we purchase externally, for 
example electricity."
the 1.5-degree scenario of the Paris Climate Agreement.
"The Consumer Business Segment has set 
additional targets to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 30% in absolute terms by 2025 versus a 2018 
baseline and achieve climate neutrality in all its production centers by 2030."
tesa too plans to achieve climate-neutral production by 2030.
"In addition, it aims to reduce its Scope 3 
emissions by 20% in absolute terms by 2030 versus the 2018 baseline."
"We once again made progress with regard to our climate targets: We reduced absolute Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions in the Consumer Business Segment by 40% and at tesa by 38% compared with the 
2018 baseline."
This led to an overall reduction of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 39%.
"This 
means we achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 emissions target at Group level early.The Consumer 
Business Segment reduced its absolute Scope 3 emissions2 by 18% over the same period."
"In 2023, we have set the target of achieving net zero emissions by 2045."
"As we have already met our 
Scope 1 & 2 target for 2025, we have also updated our short-term climate target in this context."
"The 
Beiersdorf Group is thus committed to the following targets, which were validated by the SBTi at the 
beginning of 2024: 
• By 2032, we aim to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% and absolute Scope 3 
GHG3 emissions by 40%, from a 2018 baseline."
"• By 2045, we want to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 90% from a 2018 baseline."
"In 2020, we achieved our goal of sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable energy sources."
"This 
continues to be the case for all tesa and Consumer office and production facilities worldwide for which 
data is collected.4
Climate metrics: Energy, Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions
We capture, consolidate, and analyze our energy consumption data to determine our global GHG 
emissions."
"Progressively gathering this data continuously helps us to verify the effectiveness of the 
measures we carry out and identify further potential for energy and emission savings."
"We calculate our GHG emissions according to the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG 
Protocol)."
"The GHG Protocol specifies different consolidation approaches for calculating Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 data."
"When calculating our emissions, we have adopted the operational control consolidation 
approach."
"These calculations are mainly based on emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC), along with emission factors from our energy suppliers and the IEA."
"Further emissions, 
such as steam from district heating, are calculated using the emission factors provided by the GaBi 
database and the British Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra)."
"If biogas is used at our own sites, the biogenic emissions outside of Scope 1 are reported separately 
and not recorded under Scope 1."
"The biogas certificates acquired in this context are internationally 
recognized and are intended to prevent double counting of greenhouse gas reductions along the 
entire value chain."
"They are based on a mass balance approach in which the biogas is not physically 
purchased but certificates are purchased to ensure that the gas is fed into the European gas grid."
"3 In the categories purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel and end of life treatment 
of sold products."
"4 Beiersdorf purchases green electricity directly from energy suppliers or acquires “International Renewable Energy 
Certificates” (IRECs), European Guarantees of Origin, or country-specific certificates when purchasing electricity."
"We closely monitor relevant biogas accounting standards and are committed to 
adapting our reporting in this area as existing standards evolve and new standards are published."
"The Consumer Business Segment collects energy consumption data at all of its production sites, at the 
warehouses we operate, and at our offices with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees."
"tesa collects 
energy consumption data for all ISO 14001-certified sites."
"This includes six production sites and the 
main headquarters."
"Since 2022, we have also included the emissions data of our NIVEA-KAO business in Japan in the 
calculation for Scopes 1 to 3."
"For Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we use primary data provided by NIVEA-
KAO; this data has been included in the key figures since 2022."
2 Retroactive adjustment of data due to the inclusion of the newly acquired La Prairie production facility in Berneck.
"Identifying Scope 3 emissions
Emissions are also generated along our value chain, for example through the procurement of goods 
and services or transportation activities."
These are referred to as Scope 3 emissions.
"Based on an input-
output model, the Consumer Business Segment began by identifying the most relevant categories of 
Scope 3 emissions.1 The input-output model evaluates resource consumption and environmental 
impact throughout the supply chain on the basis of international statistics and databases."
"The analysis 
identified the following material areas for the Consumer Business Segment: packaging materials, raw 
materials for product formulations, finished goods manufacturers, externally purchased transportation 
services, warehousing, and business travel."
"This selection covers more than two-thirds of our total 
Scope 3 emissions, which meets the requirements of SBTi."
"The corresponding key figures relating to 
Scope 3 emissions can be found in the “Consumer” subsection."
"In addition to the Non-financial Statement, we disclose our management approaches and data on 
climate topics as part of an annual survey conducted by the CDP organization."
"assesses, among other aspects, our climate-related strategy and its effectiveness on a scale from A to 
D–."
"In the CDP assessment within the Climate Change Program, the Consumer business segment 
received an ""A"" rating and the tesa business segment an “A–” rating in 2023."
"Consumer
Improved Scope 3 calculations
For all defined categories included in our target boundary, we have developed methods of calculation 
that rely on precise data as far as possible."
"This enables us to better monitor the progress of our 
reduction measures."
"The majority of our Scope 3 emissions are generated by the manufacturing 
processes of the packaging2 and raw materials we need for our products."
"The calculations of these 
GHG emissions are based on primary data for material consumption and secondary emission factors 
derived from life cycle databases."
"We work together with service providers to consistently improve data 
on emissions factors for life cycle analyses (LCAs)."
"Over the course of the reporting year, we further advanced our digitalization in the area of 
sustainability."
"For example, we integrated additional analysis tools and further improved both the 
framework and level of detail of our reporting."
"We are thus able to analyze key figures such as CO2e 
emissions or figures relating to plastic packaging and raw materials throughout the year and – if 
necessary – identify measures at an early stage that will help us achieve our emissions reduction targets."
"In order to calculate the emissions from our outsourced production and warehousing operations, we 
conduct surveys of supplier companies in the finished goods and warehousing sectors.3 These surveys 
collect data on energy consumption as well as emission factors for purchased electricity."
"This data is 
allocated based on the quantities of goods produced for us or on goods turnover."
"The calculation 
methodology is congruent with the Scope 1 and Scope 2 calculations for our own sites."
"In 2023, the 
data we gathered in these surveys covered 86% of our outsourced finished goods production and 85% 
of our warehousing activities."
"The values in the following table are extrapolated emission values to 
cover all our finished goods suppliers and warehousing."
"To calculate global upstream and downstream GHG emissions from transportation activities, we mostly 
use the EcoTransIT tool in accordance with the European EN 16258 standard."
"Data on distances, loads, 
and the various modes of transportation are obtained from our internal logistics network."
"A total of 86% of the emissions resulting from the transport of our products by sea freight are of 
biogenic origin."
"We ensure this is the case by purchasing fuel certificates based on the mass balance 
approach."
The aim to increase the amount of biofuel used in the global maritime freight industry.
"However, it is not possible to reliably track whether the ships transporting our products are actually 
powered by biofuel."
"Overall, Beiersdorf aims to drive the transformation toward a lower-emission 
logistics network."
"To quantify our emissions from business travel, information on distance and modes of transportation is 
either exported from our travel management system or reported directly by our affiliates."
"In the case of directly reported business travel data, we calculate emissions based on IEA data."
"Compared to our 2018 baseline, our business travel emissions declined by 25%."

2 We include consumer packaging and secondary packaging in our calculation."
"Packaging materials that are added as part of 
packaging processes or during preparation for transport are not included."
"3 The data collection period for outsourced production and warehousing (December 2022 to November 2023) differs from the 
reporting period."
"We calculate the included Scope 3 emissions from our investment NIVEA-KAO based on the results of 
life cycle assessments (LCAs) conducted in 2022 and 2023 for certain reference products."
"We estimated 
the emissions generated in previous years on the basis of the quantity of reference products sold."
"NIVEA-KAO’s raw material and packaging emissions are calculated using the reference products’ bill of 
materials and the LCA emission factors."
"To calculate the upstream transport emissions, we consider the 
product weight, the average distance transported, and the emission factors of the different modes of 
transportation."
The calculated emissions are included in the respective Scope 3 categories.

"2 The emissions data for packaging and raw materials for 2018, 2021 and 2022 have been adjusted due to updated master data and 
the inclusion of the latest emissions data from the 6th IPCC Assessment Report."
"In addition, La Prairie was added to the data for 
packaging for 2018, 2021 and 2022."
Coppertone is not included in these figures.
"Data for finished goods manufacturers was 
extrapolated based on spend, and data for 2021 was adjusted due to a data correction."

"Warehousing 
data is extrapolated based on stored pallets."
"4 Business travel was adjusted retrospectively for 2018, 2021 and 2022 as La Prairie was included."
"Transition toward climate neutralization
We have created a climate neutralization plan that will drive forward our transition to net zero emissions."
"Our “Climate Neutralization Framework” describes the entire neutralization process for selected 
products and was developed based on the principles and requirements of the internationally 
recognized standard PAS 2060."
"TÜV Rheinland has reviewed the methodology and verified that 
Beiersdorf follows international standards and a science-based approach."
Our climate neutralization process consists of three steps.
"The first step is “Measure.” All GHG emissions 
are quantified in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
"The second step is “Reduce.” This is reflected in 
our ambitious climate targets, which are based on scientific findings to limit global warming to 1.5 
degrees Celsius."
"We are focusing our activities and our resources primarily on achieving these 
reduction targets."
"The third step is “Neutralize.” In order to leverage additional CO2 storage potential 
while we are still transitioning toward our net zero target, we are investing in certified climate projects 
to neutralize the remaining GHG emissions."
"For us to achieve a net-zero state globally, we must 
neutralize unavoidable emissions by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere."
"As our GHG emissions and the accounting methods have been detailed in the previous sections, we will 
focus on the second and third steps below."

Reducing operating emissions
At our production sites especially, energy-related emissions can be reduced to increase their energy 
efficiency."
Our goal is to ensure all of our production facilities are climate neutral by 2030.
"To achieve 
this, we are relying on various measures:
In order to operate the sites in a climate-neutral manner, we want to reduce the use of fossil fuels by 
2030."
"Particularly in light of the geopolitical situation in 2022 and the associated energy crisis, we have 
set ourselves the goal of operating independently of natural gas in Europe."
"To achieve this, we are 
drawing on a number of different alternatives."
"Some temporary alternative solutions – such as diesel-
powered steam generators that we have installed at our production facilities – are used to ensure 
sufficient capacity is available when there are legally mandated restrictions on natural gas consumption."
"These systems require other fossil fuels, however, and are therefore not compatible with our efforts to 
achieve climate-neutral sites in the long term."
"The heat pump 
solution will make the Argentona site our first carbon-neutral production facility in Spain in 2024, and at 
the same time Beiersdorf’s first factory that is independent of any direct fuels and only requires 
electricity."
"To reduce emissions, we are not only modernizing our technical systems."
"Energy-saving measures are 
also helping to reduce fuel and electricity consumption – such as by heating buildings less and dimming 
the lights."
"In addition to purchasing 100% green electricity, we have installed photovoltaic systems at 14 of our 
production sites and office locations that cover part of our own electricity needs."
"In the reporting year, 
these systems generated 7,100 MWh worldwide."
"In addition, our Sustainability in Manufacturing 
initiative, launched in 2020, is helping us achieve our climate, waste, and water targets by 2025."
"The 
initiative encompasses all 15 production sites worldwide."
"The team responsible for the project breaks 
down the company’s targets by production site, analyzes energy consumption, and derives the 
necessary measures from this data."
"Locally gained knowledge is exchanged in the form of best practice 
examples within our international network and, where it makes sense, also applied to other locations."
"Modern, energy-efficient buildings and production facilities are helping us achieve our climate targets."
"When we construct a new building or redesign an existing one, we examine its full life cycle and 
implement sustainable energy concepts."
"In our new construction and expansion projects, we strive to 
achieve certification to the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard."
"That 
includes our new Group headquarters in Hamburg’s Eimsbüttel district."
"In addition to the LEED 
standard, we also aim to achieve certification according to the ""WELL Building Standard"" in 2024 for the 
more than 100,000 square meter building."
"We are working on obtaining LEED sustainability certification for our new production site in Leipzig, 
Germany as well."
"Besides implementing energy-efficient processes, we will be greening the building’s 
facades and roofs and installing solar panels."
"We are also increasingly replacing fossil fuels in our existing facilities: In 2022, our site in Berlin, 
Germany, for example, became the first Beiersdorf facility to purchase only biomethane instead of 
natural gas, thus cutting GHG emissions by 99%."
"The manufacture of our products at this site is 
therefore climate neutral."
"The biogas is produced in Denmark from organic waste and fed into the 
European gas grid."
"Our new facility in Leipzig likewise uses biomethane instead of natural gas and has 
been climate neutral in Scopes 1 and 2 since the start of production in 2023."

Our factories in Berlin and Leipzig use biogas certificates to procure gas from renewable sources for 
our production."
"These biogas certificates are intended to ensure that the gas contributes to the 
reduction of greenhouse gases."
"They are based on a mass balance approach whereby the biogas 
supplied in Denmark corresponds to our consumption in Germany."
"Reducing emissions along the value chain
Cutting our Scope 3 emissions is a great challenge, as their origin lies beyond our direct operational 
control."
"For this reason, we work cross-functionally, as well as with our suppliers, to identify innovative 
measures to reduce our carbon footprint."
"In the reporting year, we also developed an action plan to 
reduce emissions within our most important Scope 3 categories, which are listed below:
Packaging
Most of the emissions from packaging are caused by plastics and aluminum."
"We are therefore working 
on innovative solutions to prevent, reduce, reuse, and recycle our product packaging by 2025."
"We are 
striving to use more recycled material in aluminum packaging and to source aluminum with a lower 
carbon footprint."
"However, the prevailing global crises resulted in supply bottlenecks, particularly for recycled aluminum, 
in previous years."
"During the reporting year, we began to close this gap with low-carbon aluminum, 
which is produced using renewable energy in the main production steps."
"Product formulations
We also plan to make our product formulations more environmentally friendly."
"To 
this end, we are entering into various partnerships, including with the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO) (see the “Sustainable land use” section)."
"Finished goods manufacturing and third-party warehousing
A key driving force for the reduction of GHG emissions of our products and packaging is the switch to 
renewable electricity at our suppliers too."
"To achieve this goal, we are leading intensive discussions 
with suppliers and third-party manufacturers to find mutual solutions for switching to renewable energy."
"In 2023, all third-party manufacturers and third-party warehouse operators included in our data query 
purchased electricity from renewable energies or their electricity purchases were covered by 
corresponding energy certificates."
"Transportation
Along with our packaging and formulation emissions, we are exploring ways to reduce and prevent 
transportation emissions."
"Wherever possible, we plan to shift the transportation of our goods to rail."
"This applies in Europe and North America especially, where our largest markets are located."
"For our 
global ocean freight shipments since 2021, we have been purchasing mass-balanced biofuels from 
waste streams via certificates."
"In addition, our truck transportation service providers used biofuels in the 
reporting year to transport our products from the “Hub Nordics” to the Scandinavian countries, as well 
as to France and Italy."
"On top of this, we are investigating ways of using alternative forms of energy, 
such as electricity and gas, to power trucks."
"We are working closely with our logistics providers to 
achieve this goal."
"In our drive to understand and implement new transportation technologies, we are in

close talks with external consultants and scientific experts."
"One example is our cooperation with 
EcoTransIT to calculate our transportation emissions."
"We pass this knowledge on to our logistics service 
providers around the world as well."
"In dialog with suppliers
We engage in dialog with our suppliers through various measures to create a more sustainable, shared 
future."
"For example, we call on our suppliers to also participate in the climate data surveys conducted 
by the CDP organization."
"The data they disclose will also enable Beiersdorf to improve the quality of its 
own data analyses."
"During the reporting year, 77 suppliers participated in the CDP survey."
"We also 
work with our suppliers on new concepts and strategies."
"For example, we invested in the Swiss start-up 
company DePoly in the reporting year."
"DePoly’s chemical recycling technology enables new recycling 
solutions for plastic and polyester waste streams that are currently not recyclable."
"The aim of this 
collaboration is to accelerate the development of more sustainable technologies that improve circular 
packaging usage in the cosmetics industry."
"Neutralizing remaining emissions
In addition to its efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the value chain, Beiersdorf also systematically 
invests in climate change mitigation projects and acquires voluntary emissions certificates."
"Through 
these projects, we aim to build up natural carbon sinks over the long term and curb the accumulation of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
"In this context, we select projects that comply with the Paris 
Agreement and are independently certified by internationally recognized organizations such as Verra or 
the Gold Standard."
"We also focus on projects that sequester carbon from the atmosphere – through 
reforestation and soil management, for example – while simultaneously providing additional benefits for 
biodiversity or local communities."
"With CO2 certificates from these projects, we offset the remaining 
GHG emissions of selected products as well as the flight emissions of our business trips."
"tesa
Company management systems for environmental protection
The tesa Business Segment uses ISO 14001 certified environmental management systems at seven sites 
for the continuous management and planning of our corporate environmental protection."
"The ISO 
14001 standard is an internationally recognized approach to managing the direct and long-term 
environmental impacts of products, services, and processes within a company."
"As part of the matrix 
certification of ISO 14001 sites, external environmental audits are also carried out annually."
"In addition, 
the environmental management systems at selected ISO 14001 sites are reviewed during internal audits 
by specialists at the headquarters."
"Besides the environmental management system, we use energy management systems certified to 
internationally recognized standards."
"Three production sites and the Group headquarters are certified 
in accordance with ISO 50001."
"These sites emit 84% of the GHG emissions of all sites holding ISO 
14001 certification."
"The ISO-certified energy management systems lay the foundation for more energy-
efficient operations at the respective sites and thus for further reducing GHG emissions."
"Through our internal planning and reporting activities, we identify, assess, and monitor risks and 
measures that target a reduction in GHG emissions."
"We review the effectiveness of our activities by 
tracking the monthly energy consumption at each site."
"We succeeded in reducing our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions by 38% in absolute terms from 2018 to 2023; compared with the previous year, 
emissions thus fell by 15 percentage points."
"We achieved a reduction in specific emissions of 23% per 
metric ton of end product compared to 2018."

Identifying energy-saving opportunities and increasing efficiency
Energy consumption is an important management driver for reducing our environmental impact."
"As 
part of a continuous improvement process and on the basis of the environmental program and 
environmental audits, we identify further energy-saving opportunities, optimize energy-intensive 
processes, and reduce our carbon emissions and the associated costs."
"tesa corporate management 
conducts a management review every year as part of this process."
"The environmental and energy 
experts at each site bear operational responsibility."
"In the reporting period, we continued to work on expanding electricity production through the use of 
solar power, with new systems going into operation in China and Italy."
"Our solar power systems 
generated 1,761 MWh of electricity worldwide in the reporting year."
"That corresponds to 2% of our 
total electricity needs."
"We will also equip the Group headquarters and the new facility in Vietnam with 
solar power in 2024."
"What’s more, the tesa Business Segment’s largest solar power installation to date, 
at 5.5 MWp, has been approved for construction in Offenburg, Germany."
"It is expected to generate 
electricity and contribute to the site’s decarbonization as early as 2024."
"Further investments in solar 
power are in preparation."
"At several production sites, we utilize combined cooling, heat, and power or combined heat and power 
(CCHP or CHP) systems."
"We not only use the electricity generated but also harness the heat produced 
by these systems for our production processes and heating."
"Since 2021, we have covered the energy 
consumption of the CHP system at the Group’s headquarters entirely through biogas certificates."
"In the 
reporting year, the sites in Hamburg and Offenburg also used biogas certificates to cover the 
proportionate share of their CHP plant operations."
"The biogas is produced in Denmark and fed into the 
European gas grid.1 This means we continue to benefit from the high generation efficiencies of the CHP 
plant."
"By using biomethane instead of natural gas, we can also rely on renewable, more climate-friendly 
sources of energy."
"Overall, in 2023 we were able to produce over 47% of our electricity needs ourselves 
via energy-efficient CHP systems."
"Circular economy
Consumer
Our products are synonymous with high quality and effective skin care all over the world."
"Our aim is to 
meet our own high quality standards and the increased sustainability requirements while maintaining 
consumer trust in our products."
"For us, this trust also entails counteracting negative environmental 
impacts."
"We therefore feel it is our responsibility to optimize the environmental compatibility of our 
products and to use resources sparingly."
"The Executive Board is responsible for integrating product sustainability into our C.A.R.E.+ corporate 
strategy and at brand level."
The Corporate Sustainability Team reports directly to it.
"Our Sustainability 
Council maintains regular communication with senior management from Marketing, Research & 
Development and Supply Chain."
"The committee reports on ongoing projects and monitors the status of 
target achievement."
"We use the expertise of various departments and involve external stakeholders 
such as customers, suppliers, sustainability consultancies and NGOs to implement cross-functional and 
cross value-chain projects."
"Holistic view of our products
It is important to us that we evaluate our products holistically according to their environmental and 
social impact."
"Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are used to list and summarize all of the environmental 
impacts for specific products, from raw material procurement to disposal."
"Based on this analysis, we

1 tesa acquires biogas certificates."
"The certificates prove that a corresponding amount of biogas has been produced and fed into the 
natural gas grid."
"create a life cycle assessment that shows what impact the product has on the environment and where 
there is still room for improvement."
"Beyond the use phase, the environmental impact of our products 
depends to a large extent on the raw materials and the resource efficiency of our packaging."
"This is why 
we focus our sustainability efforts on these areas."
"Sustainable packaging
The consumption of natural resources has increased continuously worldwide over the past decades."
"Negative environmental impacts as well as waste production are steadily increasing and causing lasting 
damage to the environment."
"To counteract this, Beiersdorf is committed to strengthening the circular 
economy."
"For example, the ability to recycle our packaging and ingredients is extremely important to 
us."
"Our packaging is largely made of plastics due to its light weight, high stability, and simultaneous 
flexibility."
"This means that we use materials that are mostly based on finite fossil resources and are often 
not recycled."
"As a result, we are going to great lengths to optimize our plastic packaging in line with the 
sustainability principles of “avoid, reduce, reuse, and recycle,” thereby making our contribution to the 
circular economy."
"In 2023, we made the following progress toward our goals:
• 16% reduction in fossil-based virgin plastics in our packaging (2022: 15%)."
• 12% recycled material in our plastic packaging (2022: 10%).
"When calculating the target achievement for 2022 and 2023, the volumes for the base year 2019 were 
updated due to corrections in the master data."
"While the integration of recycled material into our plastic packaging is progressing according to plan, 
we are expecting a delayed achievement of our reduction target on fossil-based virgin plastic in 2026 
instead of 2025."
"This development is due to longer lead times for molds and equipment as well as 
above expectation volume growth."
"In the reporting year, we decided to extend our target for plastic packaging design."
"By 2032, we aim to 
fully cease the use of fossil-based, virgin plastic in our packaging."
"In addition to the use of recycled and 
bio-based plastic qualities, this will also require the exploration of new, alternative materials."
"Starting 
with the reporting year 2024, we will report against this new mid-term target."
"Our third goal, recyclability, relates to the end of the packaging life cycle."
"This means that all packaging that is already globally recyclable today also meets the 
Design for Recycling criteria."
"Both targets – Design for Recycling and global recyclability – have been applied to all types of 
packaging and materials we use (plastic, metal, glass, and paper) since 2022."
"We assess global recyclability and Design for Recycling digitally based on the methodology of an 
independent certification body; the analysis relates to the share of recyclable materials in the total 
packaging weight."
"We then use these individual analyses to determine the recyclability of the overall 
portfolio."
"In the reporting year,
• 80% of our packaging weight came from packaging that was “designed for recycling” (2022: 80%)."
"In addition, the following share meets the requirements for global recyclability:
• 67% of the weight of all packaging was considered globally recyclable (2022: 67%)."
"Environmentally friendly product formulations
In order to optimize the recyclability of our product formulations, we have set ourselves goals both for 
eliminating the use of microplastics as defined by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)2 
and for the use of biodegradable polymers."
"One of these goals had already been reached by the end of the reporting year: We discontinued the 
production of Eucerin brand cosmetic products that contain microplastics – either by completely 
removing them from our portfolio or by revising their formulation."
"We have not used microplastics in 
NIVEA brand products since 2021."
"Furthermore, we intend to use only biodegradable polymers in our European product formulations by 
the end of 2025 and thus make a contribution to preventing environmental pollution."
Polymers are molecules that consist of many recurring subunits.
"They are commonly used in cosmetics 
and provide various product properties, such as increased water resistance in sunscreen products."
"Many polymers containing organic carbon are biodegradable – that is, they can be fully broken down 
into water and carbon dioxide by microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi."
"However, this is not the 
case with other polymers, which leave chemical substances in the environment."
"We are gradually 
phasing out the use of such non-biodegradable polymers in order to reduce potential environmental 
impacts."
"To this end, we evaluate all raw materials in terms of their biodegradability."
"The evaluation is based on 
Annex XIII of the European REACH Regulation and the corresponding Guidance on Information 
Requirements (Chapter R.11)."
"The criteria for the persistence of substances contained in these 
documents define the timescale for a molecule to be considered biodegradable."
"On this basis, we 
identify polymers that are not sufficiently biodegradable and that should be eliminated from our 
European product formulations by the end of 2025."
"To achieve this goal, we are not only directly 
replacing ingredients, but also developing completely new polymer technologies."
"We report separately 
on the raw material group of silicones, which comprises dimethicone and cyclomethicone, among 
others."
"While silicones do degrade in nature over time, they are not biodegradable by definition due to 
their chemical composition – as they do not contain any organic carbon in the polymer chain."
"We 
therefore consider them separately from other polymers and are working to reduce their use as well."
"In comparison with 2018, we already used 67% fewer non-biodegradable polymers in our European 
product formulations in the reporting year."
"This means that we reduced their share by a further 4 
percentage points compared with the previous year."
"We were able to reduce the use of silicones by 
36% compared to the 2018 baseline."
"Moreover, we aim to increase the use of raw materials from non-fossil, renewable resources and at the 
same time make our procurement more sustainable."
"By doing so, we want to prevent negative 
environmental impacts caused by increased demand for certain raw materials (see “Sustainable land 
use” section)."
"Partnerships in the field of product sustainability
On our journey toward a circular economy, we at Beiersdorf are working closely with partners who 
share our goals."
"We are active participants in associations and international committees and use these 
platforms to engage in intensive dialogue with other stakeholders."
"The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) is a leading organization devoted to accelerating the 
transformation to a global circular economy and building a regenerative and restorative economy."
"In 
this process, it collaborates with companies, academia, politics, and institutions."
"Within the foundation’s 
network, we discuss and exchange ideas with other members and develop new ones together."
Beiersdorf supports the foundation and reports on the key figures of the Global Commitment.
"We have 
also been a network member of the EMF since 2021, and our area of focus during the reporting year 
was refill solutions."
"To tackle the global problem of plastic pollution, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the WWF 
founded the “Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty” in 2022."
"Beiersdorf has joined the coalition 
as a supporter."
"The common goal is to see an ambitious, effective, and legally binding UN treaty signed 
that will end plastic pollution."
"During the reporting year, employees from Research and Development, Corporate 
Sustainability, and Beiersdorf Shared Services contributed to the work of this consortium."
"Beyond making an impact through its direct business activities, Beiersdorf also wants to support new 
ideas in the area of the circular economy."
"That is why the company has invested in the Swiss start-up 
firm DePoly via its OSCAR&PAUL Venture Capital Fund."
"DePoly develops selective, energy-efficient 
chemical recycling technologies for plastic and polyester waste streams that are currently not 
recyclable."
"This investment enables Beiersdorf to support the development of new recycling solutions 
for packaging in the cosmetics industry."
"In June 2023, we presented our Sustainability Agenda, the progress we have made to date, and our 
upcoming opportunities and challenges to politicians, businesses, and interested private individuals at 
the Greentech Festival in Berlin."

same time make an active contribution to greater sustainability."
"This is why we are increasingly using

recycled and renewable raw materials for our products and packaging."
"Our goal is for 70% of the 
materials for our products and packaging to be made from recycled or bio-based materials by 2030."
"Moreover, we want to further reduce the use of solvents in our production, with the aim of either 
eliminating solvents altogether or fully recovering them by 2030."
"Our understanding of product 
sustainability extends beyond product development and also covers the use phase for our customers."
"Through our Project Sustainability Assessment, we already established a tool back in 2020 that we use 
to evaluate projects in the field of product and technology development at an early stage in terms of 
their contribution to sustainability."
All new development projects must undergo this assessment.
"We 
use the results to further manage our development portfolio."
"Under the tesa ecoLogo sub-brand established in 2010, we offer adhesive rollers, adhesive films, 
packing tapes, glue sticks, and correction rollers, which are made primarily from recycled or bio-based 
materials; the packaging used for these products is predominantly recycled as well."
"This product line is 
also manufactured without the use of any solvents."
"We are constantly adding new products to the tesa 
ecoLogo range."
"One example from the reporting year is our new tesafilm® Eco & Crystal, the first 
product to use a carrier film consisting of 90% post-consumer-recycled (PCR) PET material."
"This material 
content is certified in accordance with the UL 2809 Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP)."
"The entire life cycle in focus
The core ideas of the circular economy include reduced material use, increased reuse, and, ultimately, 
recycling."
"If the product or individual components can be recycled or reused, resources can be saved 
elsewhere."
"To achieve this, we consider the end of the product life cycle at an early development stage 
and are investing in further research on this topic."
"One area of focus here is releasable adhesive bonds, 
which allow bonded parts to be repaired or reused."
"In addition, we continue to carefully analyze the CO2e footprint of our products."
"To this end, we steadily 
expanded our databases in the reporting period, where all of our key raw materials and packaging are 
linked to primary or secondary emission factors."
"Another aspect we are working on is the further 
standardization and validation of our methodology."
"Here we are cooperating with AFERA, the European 
adhesive tape industry network, that is helping to harmonize the calculation of CO2e footprints across 
the industry."
"We also regularly discuss this topic with our suppliers to improve the accuracy of our calculations 
through primary data."
"We use the collected data not only for internal management and accounting 
purposes, but also to provide information to our customers."
"In the reporting year, we carried out life 
cycle assessments for various products and had them validated by external partners."
"For example, we 
were able to obtain confirmation of the CO2e savings achieved with our double-sided adhesive tape 
tesa® 4965, which has been improved in terms of raw materials certification and 40% CO2e reductions 
(cradle-to-gate incl."
absorption of biogenic carbon).
"We also use the results of our assessments to identify relevant sources of emissions along the value 
chain and to reduce our emissions through targeted measures."
"Our understanding of product sustainability goes further, however."
"Whether in the industrial, 
electronics, or wind and solar energy sector, some of our products can help our customers operate 
more efficiently and drive forward sustainable technologies."
"Our adhesive solutions, for example, can 
allow products to be repaired or recycled, allowing customers to reduce their waste volumes and cut 
greenhouse gas emissions."
"tesa SE has been FSC®-certified since 2019, as have 
our production sites in Suzhou, China, Concagno, Italy, Offenburg and Hamburg, Germany."
"In addition, 
the first eight European sales organizations were certified in the reporting year."
"We also consistently 
launch new products with FSC® certification on the market – increasing the number of FSC®-certified 
products to 51 in the reporting year."
"First step toward using mass-balanced raw materials
We have had our facility in Hamburg certified in accordance with the ISCC (International Sustainability 
and Carbon Certification) PLUS standard – it is our first site to receive this certification."
"This means that, 
in addition to using recycled or directly bio-based raw materials, we also apply a (bio) mass balancing 
approach there."
"In accordance with the ISCC PLUS standard, we are introducing certain amounts of bio-
based raw materials, e.g., from agricultural waste, into our previously fossil-based production process 
while maintaining a certified and transparent chain of custody at our Hamburg site."
"We are thus 
retaining the same processes and product properties."
"The balancing is intended to ensure that the 
quantities of non-fossil raw materials used are recorded correctly across supply chains."
"The mass 
balancing approach enables us to progressively replace fossil-based raw materials with bio-based ones, 
reduce our CO2e emissions, and transform our production sustainably."
"For example, we have now 
switched the adhesive for our tesa® 4965 product to ISCC-certified, mass-balanced raw materials."
"Combined with the use of a recycled carrier film, this has enabled us to achieve CO2e savings of 40% 
compared to the predecessor product – a fact that has been externally confirmed and verified."
"Further 
details are presented in a customer report."
"Optimized packaging
In our efforts to make our packaging more sustainable, we intend to go beyond the usual level of 
optimization."
We currently believe paper and plastics offer the greatest potential in this regard.
"Where 
fiber-based packaging materials such as paper and cardboard are concerned, our goal is to achieve 
80% FSC® certification by 2025."
"In addition, we aim to use 50% less virgin fossil-based plastic in our 
packaging by 2025 (compared to 2018)."
"We made further progress toward both of these goals during 
the reporting year."
"For example, the polyethylene (PE) shrink film used at the site in Offenburg, 
Germany has been converted to 50% PCR material."
"In addition, the sites in Hamburg and Offenburg, 
Germany have converted their PE roll packaging bags to 80% PCR material and their film sleeves to 
40% PCR material."
"And at our site in Suzhou, China, we have established a closed loop for the plastic 
end caps used for roll transportation, with the end caps being collected and returned by our customers 
and then reused at the site."
"Sustainable land use
Consumer
Sustainable cultivation of raw materials
Natural resources are fundamental to the development of our product formulations."
"It is important to us 
that neither the procurement nor the use of these raw materials causes pollution or damage to the 
environment."
"We therefore aim to procure our main renewable raw materials – such as palm (kernel) oil 
derivatives, soybean oil, and primary packaging materials – from more sustainable sources by 2025."
Another aim for 2025 is to procure these key raw materials without causing deforestation.
"To support 
this objective, “Sustainable Land Use” is firmly anchored in our Sustainability Agenda as a focus field."
"We have been running sustainability programs for palm oil-based raw materials since 2010 and for

paper-based packaging since 2018."
"Similar programs are currently being set up for soybean oil for 
certification, transparency in the supply chain, and deforestation-free procurement."
"In June 2023, the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) came into force, banning the introduction and 
sale of products in the EU if any areas of land were deforested for their raw materials after December 
31, 2020."
"We have set up a task force to bring our internal processes into line with the requirements of 
this regulation."
"It consists of employees from the Purchasing, Sustainability, Compliance, Legal, and 
Research and Development (R&D) functions and is responsible for carrying out comprehensive due 
diligence activities."
"The Sustainability Council is 
regularly updated on progress and involved in strategy workshops."
"This input is important so that we 
can continuously develop our programs and monitor the achievement of our goals."
"Palm (kernel) oil derivatives
Palm (kernel) oil derivatives are an important raw material for our cosmetics and body care products; 
they are processed substances based on palm (kernel) oil."
"Essential ingredients such as emulsifiers and 
surfactants are produced from this and other vegetable or mineral oils and corresponding derivatives."
"Beiersdorf does not source palm oil directly for production, but uses its derivatives."
"Our total demand 
for palm (kernel) oil derivatives was roughly 38,000 tons in 2023."
Our aim is to prevent this deforestation worldwide.
"Through certification, transparency, and long-term change, we aim to identify and minimize 
environmental and social risks along the supply chain of palm (kernel) oil-based raw materials."
"Our 
“Palm Sustainability Roadmap” and our “Sustainable Palm Policy” guide us in our worldwide activities 
for more sustainable raw material sourcing."
"For instance, we strive to improve the working conditions of 
the local farmers."
"In this context, companies must ensure that the processed quantity of RSPO-certified palm oil 
corresponds to the purchased quantity of certified palm oil."
"This option is particularly relevant to the 
use of palm (kernel) oil-based derivatives, as the derivative supply chains are multi-level and therefore 
highly complex."
"Therefore, there is no infrastructure for an RSPO-segregated supply chain, i.e., a supply 
chain in which RSPO-certified and non-certified derivatives are traded separately."
"Based on the results for 2022 published by the program in the summer of 2023, 
we were able to verify that around 63% of the palm-based raw material volume in our palm (kernel) oil 
mills in Indonesia and Malaysia was of deforestation- and conversion-free origin."
"Supply chain transparency
The derivatives supply chain involves a large number of different parties."
"We do not purchase palm 
(kernel) oil directly, but rather its derivatives from supplier companies and therefore have only limited 
influence on the upstream supply chain."
"Nevertheless, we want to be able to trace the origin of our raw materials back to the level of refineries, 
mills, and plantations, which is why we are a founding member of the cross-industry Action for 
Sustainable Derivatives (ASD) initiative, which has been in place since 2019."
"The ASD’s aim is to 
increase the transparency and sustainability of derivatives supply chains."
"To achieve this, the initiative 
contacts our direct suppliers and requests information on their upstream supply chain and palm oil 
quantities, among other things."
"In this way, the ASD works steadily upwards through the entire palm oil 
supply chain."
"The aim of this annual tracking of our raw materials is to increase transparency in our palm 
(kernel) oil supply chain, identify “hot spots,” and provide targeted support for local projects."
"Sustainable transformation in cultivation regions
We conduct activities directly in the regions where palm oil is cultivated in order to improve the local 
working and living conditions of farmers with small and medium-sized oil palm plantations over the 
long term and to protect the environment."
"Our aim is to work with farmers on transitioning to more 
sustainable farming without further deforestation."
"For example, since mid-2018 we have been collaborating with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) 
on a project in West Kalimantan, Indonesia."
"We are supporting a total of three villages with a population 
of around 4,500 inhabitants."
"Its aim is to train smallholder farmers in more sustainable cultivation 
practices and help them obtain legal recognition for their cultivation areas."
"We helped establish an 
overarching association, allowing them to share knowledge more efficiently and to represent their 
interests jointly."
"The first phase was completed in 2022, and the project was extended for a further four 
years."
"In the second project phase (mid-2022 to 2026), the aim is to recruit at least 300 members for the 
farmers’ association and certify at least 200 members of the association according to the RSPO 
standard."
"Moreover, the smallholder farmers are to be given direct market access to a palm oil mill."
"The 
second project phase is also being supported by one of our suppliers, the specialty chemicals company 
Evonik."
"Since 2020, Beiersdorf and Evonik have been supporting the WWF in a second project to realize a 
landscape project in Sabah, Malaysia."
"We are working with small and medium-sized farmers on an area 
of 15,000 hectares to bring their palm oil cultivation in line with the RSPO standard by 2026."
"Another 
aim is to create a forest corridor to restore a continuous habitat for the migration of wild animals such as 
orangutans."
"By working with communities and plantation owners, we seek to reduce conflicts between 
humans and animals along the migration routes."
"In addition to the aforementioned projects, we are also supporting a project carried out by the Forum 
for Sustainable Palm Oil (FONAP) in Sumatra, Indonesia, as part of a consortium with 26 partners."
"The 
project location is known as one of the last refuges for endangered species such as the Sumatran 
orangutan, the Sumatran tiger, and the Sumatran elephant."
"It is our aim to help preserve the buffer zone 
around the national park."
"To achieve this, we are establishing sustainable landscape management, 
setting up a water management system to protect the river and riverbanks, and promoting sustainable 
oil palm cultivation through regenerative agriculture."

Shea
Shea butter is another important ingredient in many of our products, which is why Beiersdorf has been 
a member of the “Global Shea Alliance” (GSA) since 2019."
"We work with the GSA (based in Accra, 
Ghana) and our shea supply companies in the sometimes very poor rural regions of what is known as 
the “shea belt” – the main cultivation region in Africa."
"In close cooperation with the GSA and our shea 
supplier AAK, we are aiming to support a total of 10,000 female shea collectors in Ghana and Burkina 
Faso over a period of five years."
"It is traditionally women who are responsible for harvesting and 
producing shea butter."
"Through their production work, the shea collectors secure their livelihood and 
strengthen their position in society."
"By organizing themselves in associations and women’s groups, they 
moreover improve their negotiating power for trade on the world market."
"To promote the 
independence and autonomy of these women in the long term, we work with the GSA to offer training 
on topics such as health, occupational safety, and, above all, production sustainability."
"More than 
11,000 women have taken advantage of this offer to date."
"During the part of the training that focuses on 
production sustainability, the shea collectors learn, for example, how to build more energy-efficient 
cookstoves using local materials such as termite sand to pretreat the shea kernels."
"Their optimized 
design requires less wood and produces less smoke than the three-stone stoves that are otherwise 
often used."
"The cookstoves, which are twice as efficient, can also be used privately by the women."
"A 
switch can have a positive impact on the women’s health, both in a commercial and private setting, 
while also reducing CO2e emissions."
"In addition, we intend to plant 10,000 shea trees locally by 2024 in order to help fight climate change, 
because the trees bind carbon dioxide and can counteract the loss of usable land due to desertification."
"In 2023, we managed to exceed this target, having planted a total of more than 17,500 shea nut tree 
seedlings in Ghana and Burkina Faso."
"Mica
Mica is a mineral that is mostly used for a decorative effect."
"We use it sparingly in our NIVEA and 
Eucerin skincare products: At 0.003%, it makes up a very small proportion of our total raw material 
volume."
"Due to its natural origin and lower potential environmental impact, it is preferable to 
alternatives of non-natural origin."
"However, mica is sometimes mined under problematic conditions."
"We are therefore particularly selective when choosing our suppliers and only work with those who are 
members of the “Responsible Mica Initiative” (RMI)."
"The RMI is an alliance for the development of a fair, 
responsible, and sustainable mica supply chain in India."
"Beiersdorf too joined the RMI in 2023, thereby 
supporting compliance with ethical standards along the mica supply chain."
"With our membership, we 
also promote various community projects in the areas of (child) protection and education, nutrition and 
health, as well as government services in important countries of origin such as India."
"We also use a 
blockchain-based tool called “Tilkal” to ensure that our mica raw materials are documented in a 
transparent, traceable, and verifiable manner right down to the level of the first processing units."
"Paper
Much of our product packaging is made from paper or cardboard."
"We also want to procure this natural 
resource from sustainable sources."
"In 2018, we established a “Sustainable Paper and Cardboard 
Policy,” in which we set ourselves the goal that 100% of our primary packaging worldwide should be 
either recycled or certified as sustainable in accordance with the FSC® standard by the end of 2020."
"We 
met this goal for the first time at the end of 2020."
"Since then, we have sourced 100% of our folding 
cartons (e.g., the outer packaging for facial creams), all blister cards we use (such as the cardboard 
packaging parts for lip balm sticks), and all enclosed information leaflets from FSC®-certified material."
"As of summer 2023, we have been working closely with external partners and our suppliers to be able 
to trace our paper and cardboard products more accurately."
"We want to make sure, also with a view to 
the EUDR, that none of the materials that we use in Europe and that are made from virgin paper or 
wood are linked to deforestation or forest conversion."

Resource efficiency 
tesa
Using resources efficiently is a top priority at tesa."
"We are committed to promoting the circular 
economy and to using materials that can be recycled or otherwise reused at the end of their useful life."
"At the present time, we have yet to succeed in completely avoiding waste during the production of our 
products."
"We are, however, committed to reducing it effectively in order to preserve precious natural 
resources."
"We are therefore working to raise all stakeholders’ awareness of the need to avoid 
unnecessary waste and to recycle properly."
"Measures to increase resource efficiency are an integral part of our corporate environmental protection 
efforts."
"Moreover, we continue to improve our environmental management systems and exchange 
information with external experts for this purpose."
"Avoidance and recycling
When it comes to managing our waste and raw materials, we base our approach on the “waste 
pyramid,” in which top priority is given to waste avoidance and reduction, followed by various recycling 
options."
Waste is only disposed of where this is unavoidable.
"Our sites are pursuing the objective of 
“zero waste to landfill” by 2025, i.e., eliminating the disposal of waste via landfill sites."
"We have already 
achieved this status for six out of seven of our facilities."
"In order to use materials efficiently and recycle wherever possible, our production plants are committed 
to minimizing production-related losses of the raw materials we use."
"This applies equally to adhesives 
production as well as to coating tapes and cutting rolls."
"Among other objectives, we want to technically 
upgrade equipment in which solvents are used by 2030."
"The aim is to completely recover the solvents 
at the end of the process – and thus keep them in the cycle."
"Production waste is collected separately on a site-specific basis according to 
various waste categories and then the materials are recycled to the greatest extent possible."
"Waste is 
divided into categories based on whether it is nonhazardous or hazardous and whether it is disposed of 
or recycled, and the relevant figures are published in our annual sustainability report."
"tesa recycles 
almost all nonhazardous waste as well as hazardous waste containing solvents."
"Active involvement of employees
At tesa, we leverage our employees’ expertise in developing additional waste-reduction measures."
"This 
is why in 2023, we once again continued the successful “Great Ideas – Not Waste” campaign at our site 
in Offenburg."
"Driving this campaign is a long-term project through which we intend to continuously 
reduce energy and resource consumption, with the participation of employees from Production, 
Process Development, and Technology."
"As part of these activities, regular project meetings are held to 
coordinate the concrete utilization of improvement potential and to share best practices."
"Moreover, the 
project includes communication measures designed to raise awareness of the issue among employees."
A total of 20 resource efficiency projects were implemented at the tesa site in Offenburg in 2023.
"The 
six largest projects avoided over 200,000 m² of waste."
"We also saved around €265,000 through the 
projects implemented during the reporting period."

Water
Water is the foundation of all life."
"However, our planet’s water resources are unequally distributed and 
threatened by a range of factors such as climate change, population increase, pollution, and overuse."
Some regions are affected particularly severely by water shortages.
"At the same time, the global supply 
of clean drinking water is becoming increasingly scarce."
"In light of this situation, we consider it vital to 
use water responsibly."
"Our aim is to keep water consumption and wastewater generation as low as 
possible across all areas of the company and processes, as well as along our supply chains."
"Managing water risks
The Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, a reporting tool made available by the World Resources Institute (WRI), 
is used by the tesa Business Segment to conduct an annual risk analysis for its production sites and 
main headquarters."
"This analysis takes a number of different aspects into account, such as water 
resources, water quality, and wastewater management."
"In addition, we identify locations with an 
elevated risk of water scarcity or water stress."
"The Consumer Business Segment works with WWF’s Water Risk Filter to analyze, evaluate, and respond 
to water risks prevalent in its operations."
"For even more detailed analyses, we remain in an ongoing 
dialogue with the WWF."
"Furthermore, we consider it vitally important to use water responsibly not only 
in our direct areas of activity, but throughout the entire value chain."
"For example, Beiersdorf conducted 
a commodity risk analysis for palm oil, soy, and coconut to understand the role of water risks in sourcing 
key ingredients."
"Our Consumer and tesa Business Segments submit water management data annually as part of the CDP 
Water Security program."
"In the reporting year, Consumer achieved an A rating (on a scale from A to D) 
for the information provided in the CDP Water Security questionnaire, and tesa was rated B-."
"For the 
coming year, we plan to continue our efforts to maintain and improve these ratings."
"Consumer
In the Consumer Business Segment, we use water to manufacture our products, and it is a core 
ingredient in our product formulations."
"Also, water is used by our consumers when they apply our 
products."
"This is why we are fully committed to using this precious resource responsibly, while 
systematically and consistently promoting the sustainable use of water."
"Most of the water we use is consumed in our production sites for our formulations and in the production 
process."
"Beiersdorf is committed to continuously minimizing water consumption in its production 
processes: By 2025, we aim to reduce consumption per manufactured product by 25% (compared to 
the 2018 baseline)."
"Technical and sustainability experts at each site implement specific water 
conservation and efficiency measures in line with this target."
"In a bottom-up approach, our Sustainability 
in Manufacturing (SIM) initiative and our “Global Water & Cleaning Community” are driving these topics 
and are responsible for coordinating our efforts at the level of individual factories."
"Progress is 
monitored and reported to the Sustainability Council and the Supply Chain leadership team on a 
quarterly basis to ensure we are on the right track."
"In 2023, water consumption per manufactured product was reduced by7% in comparison to 2018 (base 
year)."
"Despite our efforts and the strides we have made, we acknowledge that external factors and 
unforeseen obstacles may cause delays to our planned projects and may impact our ability to fully meet 
our 2025 water targets as hoped."
"Nevertheless, we remain committed to the measures and projects we 
have in place to meet our water reduction target."

As we continue to work toward achieving our 2025 targets, we are also collaborating with the WWF on 
the development of a holistic water strategy for 2025 onwards."
"Over the course of a three-year strategic 
partnership, we are exploring options for regenerative water use."
"This forward-looking approach will be 
based on location-specific risk analyses and tailored specifically to the circumstances of the regions in 
which we operate."
"The goal is to ensure that our efforts are relevant to the different needs of local 
communities and ecosystems and effectively address them."
"All these measures are intended to be part 
of our holistic approach to improve water stewardship within the company and throughout our value 
chain."
"Sustainable water management through state-of-the-art production processes
Sustainable water management is a key priority when expanding production sites."
"Our global SIM 
initiative leads our efforts to integrate innovative water management solutions into our production 
processes."
"We focus on developing effective solutions to reduce water loss, track water consumption at 
relevant production sites, and implement new solutions to treating wastewater for it to be reused in 
production processes."
"We rely on modern equipment and advanced technologies, especially for high-consumption cleaning 
processes."
"Any wastewater is treated using efficient technical processes (usually in the company’s own 
treatment plants); it is then used for cooling, irrigation, or sanitation."
"These measures are implemented 
at our production sites as part of their LEED certification (see “Climate action” section)."
"Even seemingly 
small improvements such as modernizing sanitary facilities contribute to sustainable water 
management."
"In order to continuously improve our water management, we are also in dialogue with 
water suppliers, local authorities, and neighboring companies."
"These discussions are aimed at fostering 
a collaborative community focused on finding innovative and sustainable water solutions."
"Through 
these interactions, we exchange ideas and share best practices, ensuring a more effective and efficient 
use of water."
"We also regularly conduct reviews at our production sites to identify potential ways to 
optimize water consumption and wastewater treatment."
"New water roadmap
In 2023, the Consumer Business Segment further refined and made changes to its roadmap for water 
management initially developed in 2022."
"The SIM initiative is responsible for reaching corresponding 
global targets by implementing measures at the level of our individual production centers."
"The water 
roadmap is based on three pillars under which we have launched the following measures in 2022 and 
continued them in 2023: 
1."
"Process optimization and continuous improvement
Through the Beiersdorf “Global Water & Cleaning Community,” water experts at the production 
sites share best practices and can learn from each other."
"They also have the opportunity to discuss 
progress with the SIM team."
"We look for and test new (digital) approaches to reducing water 
consumption in treatment processes, supported by specialist institutes."
"With the help of internal and 
external experts, we regularly review whether our facilities meet the latest standards and how we 
can optimize processes."
"In this context, we focus on wastewater treatment plants, water treatment 
plants, and purification processes."
"In addition, we draw on external expertise for training and to 
optimize operations."
"New water treatment technologies
In addition, we are introducing new water treatment technologies, for example via efficient reverse 
osmosis."
"In 2023, we installed the first filtration technology unit in our Indian factory."
"As the initial 
estimates have shown, the factory's overall water consumption intensity could be reduced as much 
as 30% as a result of this measure implemented in the 3rd quarter 2023."
"Based on these promising

results, we will further test this and additional water recovery and process efficiency technologies in 
ten other factories."
"Exploring circular water management
We are currently conducting studies to transform the water systems at our facilities in line with the 
closed-loop principle."
The aim is to maximize water recovery and reuse in our production centers.
"Initial projections show that the savings potential can be as high as 70%, depending on the location 
and the measured variables."
"Our factory in Bangkok, Thailand has launched an engineering study of 
the system."
A pre-study from the Bangkok site shows a reduction of 50–60% in water withdrawal.
"Combined with additional efficiency projects on site, this is likely to result in a cumulative 75% 
reduction in water withdrawal compared to the year 2020."
"Further projects will be implemented in 
Silao, Mexico and Tres Cantos, Spain in the future."
"Our water roadmap is an example of how we look to our factories for opportunities to innovate and 
implement advanced technologies that can reduce the overarching impact on our environment."
"tesa
Guidelines and preventive measures
We are committed to efficient water use, water resource conservation, and appropriate wastewater 
treatment."
"We collect water-related data at our production sites annually, such as on water consumption 
and wastewater volumes."
"We mainly withdraw water from public drinking-water supply and 
groundwater."
Water in our cooling cycles is reused multiple times.
"Most of the water used is discharged 
as wastewater into the sewage system or as surface water."
We aim to reduce risks to water sources as much as possible.
"This is why we take preventive measures 
against potential accident scenarios."
"For example, liquids that pose a threat to water are emptied, 
refilled, and stored only in areas that are equipped with appropriate retention tanks."
"We use equipment 
to measure turbidity and solvent concentration to ensure that contaminated surface water is not 
discharged into the sewer system."
"Emergency plans are in place for the exact course of action in the 
event of leakages of substances hazardous to water."
"All these measures are regularly reviewed in our 
external ISO 14001 audits and are a precondition for a successful audit result."
"Employees
Our employees make a major contribution to the success of our company."
"Their commitment and 
expertise ensure our competitiveness and power to innovate."
"As an employer, we want to offer our 
employees good working conditions and a wide range of opportunities to grow personally and help 
shape the future of the company."
"Consumer
Training and further education
Our working world has changed fundamentally over the last few years."
"Agile and dynamic working 
methods are becoming increasingly important, as are a high degree of flexibility and willingness to 
learn."
"That is why we continuously invest in the training and development of our workforce, in line with 
the idea of a “learning organization.” We are also committed to creating employment prospects for 
young people, for example by offering apprenticeships or trainee programs."
"We can achieve this not only by embracing new, hybrid ways of working but 
also by living a culture of trust, empowerment, and community and taking our purpose “Care Beyond 
Skin” seriously."
"We bank on the principle of participation, as well as on the employee experience and employee 
engagement, i.e., the emotional bond between our employees and our company."
"It is important for us 
to get a real feel for the atmosphere at Beiersdorf and to find out how engaged our employees truly 
are."
This is why we regularly conduct global employee surveys.
"Further information on the results of our engagement survey and other HR topics is provided in the 
“People at Beiersdorf” section of the Combined Management Report."
"Diversity and inclusion
As a company with operations all over the world, we believe that embracing diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DE&I) is a real competitive advantage."
"We are convinced that people are more motivated, 
more productive, and more satisfied when their different backgrounds, experiences, and skills are 
valued and they can express their personality and individuality in the workplace."
"At the beginning of the 2023 financial year, we realigned our Diversity & Inclusion Agenda, which we 
originally formulated in 2021."
"With this new global DE&I roadmap, which covers several dimensions of 
diversity, we want to make Beiersdorf fit for the future and set our clear ambition: We want to become a 
top employer for global talent by establishing a truly inclusive corporate culture."
"To this end, we are 
focusing on three strategic priorities, which are presented in detail in the “People at Beiersdorf” section 
of the Combined Management Report."
"You will also find relevant key figures in this section, such as the 
share of women in management positions."
"tesa
Training and further education
Competition for employees with scientific and technical backgrounds is constantly on the rise within our 
industry."
"Moreover, work requirements and working methods are changing as a result of advancing 
digitalization and internationalization."
"Our response to these challenges is to offer comprehensive 
training and development programs, because having highly qualified, committed, and performance-
oriented employees is a decisive competitive advantage for us."
"In addition, a wide range of training and 
development opportunities help to ensure that high potentials enjoy working for us long term."
"Alongside conventional recruitment methods, tesa focuses on promoting young talent by offering 
targeted training to bind promising junior staff to the company at an early stage."
tesa offers its own training programs at the production sites in Hamburg-Hausbruch and Offenburg.
"The focus here is on technical professions, with training courses available for chemicals technicians, 
electronics technicians for industrial engineering, industrial mechanics, machine and plant operators, 
and mechatronics technicians."
"In addition, a training program was launched at tesa SE’s headquarters in Norderstedt in 2023."
"Twelve 
students started their dual degree programs there on September 1, 2023: five Master’s students and 
seven Bachelor’s students studying industrial engineering and management, data science, business 
administration, green technology, and electrical engineering."
"There are also four new trainees who 
have started their training as chemical laboratory technicians."
"tesa SE plans to launch another training 
program of this kind in 2024."
Our goal is to hire our trainees upon completion of their training for the long term.
"This is also reflected 
in our retention rates: In Hamburg, 54% of the trainees who completed their training in 2023 were 
retained, while in Offenburg the retention rate stood at 100%."
"We offer our employees a wide range of professional and personal development opportunities to help 
them recognize and realize their potential."
"Our programs are designed with specific target groups and 
areas of expertise in mind and include, for example, basic training for new employees."
"All employees 
can take advantage of in-person and online training courses, for example on compliance, occupational 
safety, sales, as well as management and leadership."
"In addition, courses from the digital learning 
platform LinkedIn Learning complement our own programs."
"Diversity and equal opportunities
Different perspectives help us to better understand the needs of our customers and at the same time 
increase tesa’s innovative spirit."
"That is why we are committed to greater diversity and equal 
opportunities."
"When filling new positions, we make a point of hiring employees with different cultural backgrounds."
"The share of non-German nationals in the workforce increased by 5.3 percentage points to 10.8% 
between December 2020 and December 2023."
"We want to consolidate this trend and, for example, 
advertise all vacancies for certain higher-level positions exclusively in English."
"In the coming years, we are going to step up our efforts to promote gender equality within the 
workforce and in leadership roles."
"We have set ourselves the target of having women account for 30% 
of the first level below the Executive Board and 35% of the second level at tesa SE by mid-2027."
"Attractive working environment
An appealing environment can contribute to employee well-being."
"That’s why our workplaces are 
equipped with ergonomic and contemporary furniture and equipment, such as height-adjustable desks 
and modern lighting and ventilation concepts."
"In addition, we offer employees a health management 
program at our corporate headquarters in Norderstedt."
"This program includes ergonomic counseling, 
colorectal cancer screenings, a health club, and massages."
"Company medical care as well as internal 
and external psychosocial counseling and support are also available."
"In addition, our employees at our headquarters in Norderstedt can, among other offerings, take 
advantage of a cleaning service, visit regular market stalls to purchase regional fruit and vegetables, 
and utilize various mobility concepts."
"For example, they have the ability to charge electric vehicles and 
e-bikes at a company charging point and park rental bikes from Hamburg’s “Stadtrad” initiative at a 
station on-site."
Employees also have the option of leasing bicycles through a subsidized program.

Occupational health and safety
Beiersdorf bears a great responsibility for workplace safety and the health of our employees."
"That is 
why we view both as a comprehensive, holistic, and preventive management task."
"Our strategic 
objective is therefore to reduce the number of accidents at work and work-related illness to zero as well 
as undue physical and psychological stress factors."
"To achieve this goal, we work with our internal 
management system and conduct regular audits to determine how we can make our workplaces even 
safer and healthier."
"Our accident frequency rate (AFR) documents all accidents at work that result in at least one day’s 
absence from work."
"In the Consumer Business Segment, our 2023 AFR decreased to 0.4 accidents 
per million hours worked."
"This represents a 28% reduction in AFR compared to the previous year.1 We 
are particularly pleased that in 76% of our production centers there were no accidents resulting in more 
than one day's absence in 2023."
"At tesa, the AFR of documented accidents resulting in at least one day 
of absence at ISO 14001 certified sites stood at 2.7 per million working hours worldwide in the 
reporting year (2022: 3.6)."
"Consumer
Driven by our Care Beyond Skin business purpose and guided by our core values, we are committed to 
reducing potential safety risks and incidents."
"Our Global and Local safety departments are, together 
with our leadership teams, responsible for our overall workplace safety management, but we also count 
on the cooperation and contribution of all employees at our sites."
Our occupational health and safety policy and strategy applies worldwide.
"It encompasses our most 
important measures and programs and serves as a basis for our sites to develop their own local 
implementation plans and measures."
"We monitor the progress of these measures using indicators at a 
global level."
"As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we have focused on reducing the main risks associated 
with slips, trips, falls, forklift operation, and machine operation."
"In 2023 we started to expand this focus 
to process safety."
"Management systems
Supported by external experts, we reviewed our global safety management system and strategy in 
2023."
"We launched a process safety pilot at our manufacturing site in Itatiba, Brazil and initiated Hazard 
and Operability (HAZOP) studies at our sites located in Malang, Indonesia and Hamburg, Germany."
"HAZOP studies help us to identify the risks related to our production process and define the measures 
to either eliminate, reduce or control those risks."
"Furthermore, Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) have 
been implemented at our site in Tres Cantos, Spain and are ongoing at our plant in Leipzig, Germany; 
similar studies are ongoing at multiple other sites helping us to reduce the risks related with material 
handling equipment."
"To ensure that we have a robust health and safety management system that enables continuous 
improvement, we conduct external audits at each site every three years."
"These are based on our 
internal Environmental and Safety Management Audit System (ESMAS) (see “Respect for human rights” 
section)."
"ESMAS is based on the two internationally recognized standards ISO 14001 (environmental 
management systems) and ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety management systems)."
"In line 
with our overall auditing system and frequency, in 2023 the external audit took place at our production 
sites in Poznan, Poland, Tres Cantos, Spain and Nairobi, Kenya."
"We are pursuing the implementation of our strategy and continue to expand the programs that 
strengthen our health and safety management system."
"In 2024 we will continue to focus on reducing 
the number of accidents related to the main risks in our operations."
"Simultaneously we will gather the 
learnings from our pilot project in Itatiba, Brazil to further improve and develop the global standards for 
process safety."
"We will also conduct internal audits that are being redesigned to focus on a functional 
compliance to our internal and external standards."
"tesa
Occupational health and safety management are firmly enshrined in the tesa organization."
"In addition 
to statutory regulations, our internal management system in the field of occupational safety is based on 
our group-wide occupational safety and health policy (“tesa Policy on Occupational Safety and Health”), 
which was adopted in 2022."
"This policy encompasses six key areas: crisis and emergency management, 
health care, risk assessment and evaluation, accident prevention, fire and explosion prevention, and 
facility safety."
"The occupational safety and health policy is complemented by company regulations and 
specific directives at each site."
"They stipulate, for example, that employees must be informed about and 
made aware of safety risks and potential hazards at regular intervals through instruction and training."
"The objective is to enable employees to prevent accidents and avoid health hazards through correct, 
responsible behavior."
The occupational safety and health policy also apply to subcontractors carrying out work at our sites.
"In 
the respective occupational health and safety committees and annual Management Review, the 
Executive Board evaluates incidents each year together with the Occupational Safety Department."
"On 
this basis, management initiates new measures to improve employee safety and reduce work-related 
health risks."
"Systematic approach to occupational safety
Our occupational safety management focuses on our ISO 14001-certified production sites, as these 
represent a greater risk for accidents and increased health impairments compared to our administrative 
offices."
"In our Sustainability Agenda, we have laid out an ambitious roadmap: By 2025, all tesa sites that 
already have an environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 should also achieve 
ISO 45001 certification in occupational health and safety."
"Five out of seven sites already held 
certification under both systems as of year-end 2023."
"In the course of 2023, the tesa SE headquarters and the tesa Manufacturing Hamburg facility obtained 
the certificate in accordance with the ISO 45001 occupational health and safety standard."
"This marks 
another milestone for occupational health and safety at tesa."
"The certification proves that occupational 
health and safety is systematically integrated into the management responsibility of the relevant site."
"We have also established a new management function, the Global Operations Safety Manager."
"One of 
the tasks of this function is to promote an international exchange between safety experts at the various 
locations."
"The safety experts discuss the main occupational health and safety risks during annual 
meetings of the Global Operational Safety team."
"In addition, they initiate joint projects, set standards, 
and share their experiences."
"This approach contributes to the continuous improvement of accident 
prevention at tesa."
Ad-hoc risk assessments are also carried out at tesa.
"These form the basis for 
selecting or designing work equipment, materials, processes, workplaces and workflows in such a way 
that technical and organizational deficiencies can be avoided and employees can perform their duties 
in a safe and healthy manner."
"But changes to machinery, equipment or workspaces, as well as new 
acquisitions and process adaptations, can also have an impact on our employees’ safety and health."
"Safety inspections are already carried out when equipment is procured and brought into service, and 
hazards are systematically identified and risks assessed in consultation with expert employees."

If we identify a security risk in this context, we take appropriate preventive or corrective action."
"On 
occupational safety committees, safety experts, employee representatives, as well as members of 
management discuss the material results of risk assessments and define satisfactory measures."
"Furthermore, regular inspections and evaluations take place, and we carefully incorporate the insights 
gained from these."
"Further preventive measures are rapidly implemented as required, while our 
relevant health and safety documentation is regularly updated."
We also have detailed regulations in place governing how we handle hazardous substances.
"Together 
with the Corporate Regulatory Affairs Department as well as Research & Development and production 
managers, the Occupational Safety Department designs tesa-specific processes for the handling, 
labeling, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials."
"Employees who work with certain 
hazardous substances undergo routine health examinations."
"In addition, equipment and tasks are 
audited at regular intervals for their safety and emissions."
"Our emergency management procedures 
define the actions to be taken in the event of an accident with hazardous materials."
"Preventive measures
In 2023, we continued to focus on fire safety."
"For example, we held evacuation and fire extinguishing 
training sessions for fire safety assistants at our production sites."
"In addition, a fire extinguishing 
exercise was held at tesa headquarters."
"During this exercise, employees had the opportunity to learn 
about fire safety in the workplace and what to do in the event of a fire under the guidance of an expert."
"We also held an occupational health and safety day at our tesa Manufacturing Hamburg GmbH site in 
2023."
"At this event, all employees were given the opportunity to learn about personal protective 
equipment, noise exposure, and how to recognize and secure pinch points."
"Employees were also able 
to take advantage of colorectal cancer screenings and participate in vein screenings and immunization 
counseling."
"In line with our roadmap for the occupational health and safety management system, we will work on 
obtaining ISO 45001 certification at the tesa site in Offenburg, the tesa site in Hamburg, and the tesa 
site in Sparta in 2024 and 2025."
"Society
Consumer
Community engagement
As a global company, we consider it our duty to take responsibility for our environment and to have a 
lasting positive impact on our fellow human beings."
"Through our corporate purpose Care Beyond Skin, 
we express our passion and ambitions to reach beyond our core business and contribute to greater 
social cohesion."
"To this end, our global Social Commitments team works together with colleagues from the individual 
local affiliates who implement the global strategic framework in alignment with local conditions."
"Since 2013, we have evaluated the projects we support worldwide on an annual basis."
"The project managers at our local affiliates collect all relevant data, which we consolidate to analyze our 
activities globally."
"Not only do the results of this analysis serve as an important source of information for 
internal management, they also form an integral part of our efforts to transparently disclose 
sustainability data."
"As we pursue the vision of an inclusive society, we focus our activities primarily on people who are 
affected by social inequality, marginalization, and isolation."
"We support local initiatives that aim to 
strengthen and support physical and mental health, a sense of social belonging, and the voluntary 
social participation of all members of society."
"This is how we would like to contribute towards 
promoting social cohesion."
"Our commitment in the Consumer Business Segment takes place both at the corporate level and at 
individual brand level, and goes beyond our own value chain."
"Globally, the focus of our corporate 
commitment is on empowering girls and on disaster relief."
"In addition, each brand provides targeted 
support in areas aligned with its brand identity and area of expertise, considering the social needs and 
concerns of local communities."
We also involve our consumers in our brand engagement.
"For example, we continuously and 
transparently provide them with information on our social initiatives via the corporate and brand 
websites in an effort to raise public awareness of key social issues."
"Engagement at corporate level
Empowering girls – during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond
In 2023, we continued the COVID-19 aid program for which Beiersdorf Consumer had already initiated 
global partnerships in 2020."
"Through the program, we aimed to support people in the epicenters of the 
pandemic, especially in regions and countries with weak public health systems and infrastructures."
"Beyond emergency aid, Beiersdorf has built long-term partnerships to mitigate medium- to long-term 
socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic – for girls and young women in particular."
"During 
the pandemic, girls and young women were more likely to have worked in fields that put them at a 
higher risk of contracting COVID-19, for example, in (home) care and healthcare sectors."
"During times 
of crisis, girls and young women also tend to be at an increased risk of experiencing sexual violence, 
being married off against their will, and having to leave school permanently."
"This is why empowering 
girls has been a particular focus of our COVID-19 aid program."
"To provide the most effective assistance possible, we draw on our long-term partnership with the 
international non-profit organizations Plan International and CARE."
"They have the expertise needed to 
implement projects and can rely on established and stable networks on the ground."
"Also, they have 
many years of experience in impact measurement, ensuring an evidence-based approach in our social 
initiatives."
"As the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, our joint projects with Plan International in Brazil, 
Colombia, Ghana, and Nigeria and with CARE in Ethiopia and Kenya have been prolonged."
"Further 
projects have been set up in the Philippines and Vietnam with Plan International."
"The projects focus on 
mitigating the long-term effects of the pandemic for girls and young women with a focus on education, 
protection, health services, and economic resilience."
"In 2021, Beiersdorf set the goal of directly reaching more than 300,000 people through its empowering 
girls projects by 2023."
"We exceeded this goal with 405,043 direct beneficiaries."
"In this context, direct 
beneficiaries are defined as individuals who are directly reached by one or more project activities."
"Only by involving 
different members of a community is it possible to have a lasting impact on individuals – in this case, 
girls and young women."
"In partnership with Plan International, Beiersdorf has been working towards strengthening girls’ rights 
to access education and preventing gender-based violence."
"For example, as part of the first project 
phase1 in Colombia, more than 4,000 girls and young women were provided with hygiene kits 
accompanied by information and workshops on menstrual health, hygiene, and COVID-19 prevention."
"The first phase of these projects ran for a total of two years each, starting in October 2020 (Latin 
America) and February 2021 (Africa)."
"The projects with Plan International reached a total of 87,102 people.1 
In partnership with CARE, Beiersdorf has been working to ensure that girls and young women receive 
information about COVID-19 and access to appropriate healthcare."
"In addition, the objective of our 
joint projects is to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences for these particularly vulnerable groups 
and strengthen their livelihoods."
"The geographical focus of the first phase was on Ethiopia, Kenya, 
Somalia, and Sudan."
"In Kenya, for example, 3,472 girls and women (including 145 participants under 
the age of 18) took part in the financial literacy training during the project period where they learned 
about different types of investments and risk management."
"In the project’s final evaluation interview, 
95% of participants attributed their improved savings behavior to the training received."
"The first phase 
of these projects ran for a total of two years each, starting in January 2021."
"In total, the projects with CARE reached 317,941 people.2
In addition, Beiersdorf works closely with Ashoka, the world’s largest network of social entrepreneurs."
"October 2021 marked the launch of a one-year social innovation initiative which was extended for 
another year in December 2022."
"In 2023, together with Ashoka, Beiersdorf awarded additional grants 
to seven leading female social entrepreneurs from Portugal, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, 
Italy, and Switzerland, whose projects are dedicated to the empowerment of girls and women."
"Four of 
the social entrepreneurs were already supported in 2022, while three others received support from 
Beiersdorf for the first time in the reporting year."
"Beiersdorf has also started promoting social enterprises in the field of plastic recycling as part of the 
COVID-19 support program under the name ""Women in Circularity""."
"Digital psychological support for people affected by skin conditions – Research 
In 2021, Beiersdorf partnered with the University of Cardiff to launch a three-year psychological study."
"The university is evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar crises on the well-being 
of people affected by skin conditions."
"The study aims to assess, among other things, how the negative 
impacts can be mitigated using digital support tools."
"Building on previous project findings, the project 
entered its final phase in the reporting year, i.e."
"2 Note: In Kenya, the number of ultimate beneficiaries of a measure was determined with the help of extrapolation in order to avoid 
possible double counting."
"The app will combine psychological support with educational and peer support 
elements."
"Disaster Relief – Donations
In 2023, devastating natural disasters struck Syria, Turkey, and Morocco."
"The brand will announce its new social 
commitments in 2024 alongside a new ambitious goal."
"The goals announced in 2021 will therefore no 
longer be pursued."
"Originally, the brand’s “Human Touch” projects were intended to have a positive 
impact on the personal health and well-being of more than 150,000 people by 2025, underpinned by a 
total financial commitment of €20 million."
Eucerin and the Health Care brands continued to pursue their own global social missions in 2023.
"Eucerin is committed to promoting the social inclusion of people affected by dermatological 
conditions."
"Its projects focus on reducing social exclusion and stigmatization, as well as on improving 
participation in society."
"Stigmatization of people with skin conditions was investigated in the reporting 
year by a study on pimple marks4 conducted by Eucerin together with dermatologists."
"The study 
published in the British Journal of Dermatology shows that people with pimple marks were more 
frequently described as less self-confident, successful and happy compared to people without skin 
problems."
"In Canada, the brand collaborates with the organization Camp Liberté which offers summer camps for 
children with skin diseases."
"Activities are tailored to the children’s special needs, allowing them to 
develop new skills and build self-esteem in a safe environment among peers."
"By the end of 2023, 
Eucerin achieved its target of implementing local social projects in 15 countries."
"Two countries are still 
in the first implementation step, i.e."
preparing the measures with the patients.
"Ongoing projects will 
continue in 2024, and Eucerin plans to implement further projects promoting the social inclusion of 
people with skin diseases in additional countries."
"The Health Care brands Hansaplast, Elastoplast, and CURITAS continue working toward their global 
social mission initiated in 2022: They target to educate 200,000 children in first aid and wound care by 
2025."
"In 2023, 69,479 children5 received training in first aid and infection prevention, taking the total 
number of children reached since 2022 to 148,087."
"A total of seven affiliates continued to implement 
the mission locally in 2023."
"In Germany, Hansaplast has been partnering with the Jugendrotkreuz (JRK) since 2014 to support first 
aid training for primary school children."
"The brand also sponsors the digital platform “DRK Parental 
Campus” which offers parents a low-threshold opportunity to take online courses, for example on first 
aid for children."

3 €500,000 were dedicated to emergency support in Syria and Turkey; €500,000 to emergency support in Morocco."
"5 Note: The number of children is based on information provided by the partner organizations; in some cases extrapolations were 
used."
"Respect for Human Rights
Beiersdorf actively promotes compliance with laws, codes of conduct, and human rights."
"This 
responsibility is deeply anchored in how we see ourselves, as well as in our core values."
"We do not 
tolerate any form of corruption, forced labor, child labor, or discrimination – that applies to our own 
sites and employees worldwide as well as to all workers along the value chain."
"Furthermore, we support 
the health and safety of employees in the workplace, employees’ right to freedom of association, 
including collective bargaining, and environmental protection."
"We are also committed to equal rights 
and treatment as well as diversity."
"Upholding human rights throughout the value chain
We primarily see risks relating to compliance with human rights in purchasing and procurement, for 
example of raw materials or services – and thus in our supply chains."
"Our goal is to eliminate or 
minimize all threats to human rights to the greatest extent possible."
"Due to our responsibility as a multinational company that operates across the globe and the legal 
requirements with respect to human rights due diligence, we reevaluate the risk of human rights 
violations involving our employees and our supply chain every year."
"If minimum social standards are not 
met, it may affect the safety, health, and well-being of employees."
"As a result of Germany’s 
Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG) coming into force, human 
rights violations can now result not only in considerable damage to our reputation, but also in 
substantial fines for companies."
"In addition, we implement numerous preventive measures when 
it comes to human rights to reduce negative impacts as far as possible."
"As mentioned in our “Declaration of Principles on Respect for Human Rights,” we are not only a 
signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) but also steer our own business activities and 
our collaboration with business partners based on fundamental human rights principles and guidelines."
"These include the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) Conventions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
"In addition, we fully comply 
with all regulations and official requirements applicable in specific countries."
"We rely on long-term relationships with business partners who subscribe to our principles of 
sustainable and responsible corporate governance and demonstrably act accordingly."
"The internal and 
external codes of conduct for our employees and our suppliers contain binding requirements on 
upholding human rights."
"We require our business partners to meet our standards and communicate them to their upstream 
supply chains."
"This applies both in terms of required product quality as well as transparent, fair, and 
responsible business practices."
"If we identify violations of our standards, we proceed as follows: Our 
first step is to define mandatory corrective measures for the business partner in question."
"Should we 
then be unable to identify any improvements, we reserve the right to terminate the business 
relationship either temporarily or permanently."
"In this way, we want to ensure that our business partners 
live up to their social, environmental, and economic responsibilities."
"In 2023, we procured more than 90% of our goods and services through partners who have explicitly 
committed to our CoC; we aim to increase this share in the future."
"Furthermore, we revised the CoC in 
the reporting year in order to meet the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, 
which came into force on January 1, 2023."
"Risk screenings and audits
In addition, environmental protection and occupational safety audits have been carried out at all 
Beiersdorf Consumer facilities since 2013, with the exception of the new facility in Leipzig."
"The audits 
take place every three years and are carried out in accordance with our internal Environmental 
Protection and Safety Management Audit Scheme (ESMAS)."
"This scheme is based on internationally 
recognized standards such as ISO 14001 (environmental management systems) and DIN ISO 45001 
(occupational health and safety management systems)."
"ESMAS audits verify whether appropriate measures are implemented to guarantee compliance with our 
globally applicable environmental as well as occupational health and safety standards at our sites."
"During the reporting year, Beiersdorf’s production sites in Tres Cantos, Spain, Poznań, Poland, and 
Nairobi, Kenya were audited in accordance with the ESMAS scheme."
"In addition to the ESMAS audits, our facilities in Poznań, Poland, Nairobi, Kenya, and Silao, Mexico were 
audited by external auditors from Intertek in the reporting year in accordance with the standardized 4-
pillar audit protocol of the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA)."
"These audits have taken place 
at all production facilities over the last three years, with the exception of the new facility in Leipzig, 
Germany."
They are valid for three years and are repeated at regular intervals.
"The Vice Presidents of the functions Sustainability and Procurement are responsible for sustainability in 
our overall sourcing operations and throughout the supply chain."
"A risk classification assessment is 
performed on all of our more than 21,000 direct suppliers."
We last revised this assessment in 2023.
"The 
risk classification, which has been carried out by the external platform EcoVadis IQ since 2023, 
examines whether more in-depth screening and thus further measures beyond signing the CoC are 
required."
"The following risks play a role here: country- and industry-specific risks supplied by EcoVadis 
IQ, the purchasing volume, and an internal prioritization of all procured product groups."
"Direct 
suppliers with a medium risk rating must submit a comprehensive self-disclosure via the Sedex or 
EcoVadis platforms."
"On this basis, we conduct a more detailed risk assessment, which the Responsible 
Sourcing team then uses to decide whether a subsequent audit is required."
"Direct supplier facilities with 
a high risk rating are required to undergo an on-site audit."
"To ensure objectivity, the audits are carried 
out by independent certified auditors according to the standardized SMETA 4-pillar audit protocol."
"The 
results of the audits highlight concrete challenges and fields for action and serve as a basis for the joint 
development of action plans with our suppliers."
"In extreme cases, audit results may lead to the 
termination of business relationships."
"To be able to fulfill all of these tasks, we expanded our 
Procurement team in the reporting year."
"In addition to using Sedex and EcoVadis, we participate in international collaboration initiatives such as 
AIM-Progress to continually drive forward our commitment to sustainability along the supply chain 
together with other companies in our industry."
"Our aim is to help shape the transformation of the sector 
in addition to making internal improvements."
"tesa
Designing procurement processes in a responsible manner
We require direct suppliers to the tesa Business Segment to sign our Code of Conduct for Suppliers 
(CoCS)."
"The CoCS forms the foundation for designing our global procurement processes in a 
responsible manner and outlines fundamental rules and commitments in the areas of human rights, 
labor standards, environmental protection, and the prevention of corruption."
"It is based on the ten 
principles of the UN Global Compact, the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), 
and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises."
"We expect our suppliers to comply with our 
standards and to remedy any shortcomings."
"In light of Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, we 
have also expanded the CoCS and thus made the issue of human rights even more relevant."
"The new 
CoCS has been valid since April 2023."
"Our supply chains are global and complex, as we source raw materials, products, and services from all 
over the world."
"By working together closely, we aim to establish long-term, trusting partnerships with 
regular suppliers."
"Our goal is to ensure that product quality, supply reliability, and our shared 
commitment to sustainable growth remains on a high level."
"The rules for our global procurement processes are defined and described in the Procurement 
Compliance Guideline (PCG), which also forms part of our Group-wide Compliance Manual."
"This policy 
contains binding rules of conduct for tesa as a purchasing company and is currently reviewed and 
revised by the Global Procurement Excellence function."
"From March 2024, it will be communicated and 
trained as Global Procurement Policy (GPP)."
"The GPP will also apply to all tesa sites worldwide and its 
mandatory applicability will come into force in the course of the year."
"More transparent supply chains
We not only require our major suppliers to comply with the tesa CoCS, our goal is also to gradually 
increase transparency and sustainability across our entire supply chain."
"In the reporting year, we therefore introduced a systematic, two-stage process for screening suppliers 
and evaluating them using an EcoVadis scorecard already in the reporting year 2022."
"8,734 suppliers 
have already been screened until the end of 2023."
"As a first step, our Procurement and Sustainability 
departments examine whether a more in-depth risk analysis of the suppliers is necessary."
"This screening 
process takes place once a year."
"In addition to risks specific to individual countries and industries, the 
quantity of goods purchased also plays a role in classification, which extends across the risk categories 
very low, low, medium low, medium high, high, and very high."
"The second step – already in place since 2020 – is to invite our direct suppliers to carry out a self-
assessment via EcoVadis."
"Suppliers with a rating can thus demonstrate the extent to which they uphold 
human rights, maintain fair working conditions, and take environmental aspects into account, as well as 
responsibly produce and procure their products, raw materials, and services."
"At the end of 2023, 
suppliers that are responsible for 70% (2022: 54%) of our purchasing volume of direct materials had

submitted EcoVadis self-disclosures."
"In the coming years, our aim is to gradually increase this figure, 
with a goal of having self-disclosures completed for a total of 80% of our purchasing volume of direct 
materials by 2025."
"If suppliers exhibit risks according to our two-stage process, we initiate appropriate improvement 
measures."
"Potential for improvement can occur in the areas of environment, labor and human rights, 
ethics and sustainable procurement and are prioritized by EcoVadis employees as ""low"", ""medium"" and 
""high""."
"Improvement measures are therefore very individual and range from uploading evidence of 
submitted responses to defining new company guidelines in areas of occupational health and safety."
"Audits in accordance with the SMETA 4-pillar protocol are planned from 2024 for suppliers with a 
particularly high risk."
"Our goal is that by 2030, 80% of our purchasing volume will be sourced 
exclusively from suppliers who meet our responsible supply chain standards; this means that, among 
other things, they have an EcoVadis assessment of at least 45 points."
"Compliance
The following Compliance section applies to both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments."
"Both 
business segments have established their own independent compliance management systems (CMS), 
which follow uniform standards and are implemented in close alignment between the two respective 
Corporate Compliance Management teams."
"Differences in the precise design of the CMS of the two 
business segments are described below, insofar as they exist."
"Our Core Values for responsible conduct
For us, compliance means observing legal and commercial provisions and rules – and doing so without 
compromise."
"Both the Consumer and tesa Business Segments have established a respective Code of 
Conduct (CoC) to ensure compliance with these standards and to fulfill our social responsibility as a 
company in the best possible way."
"As an overarching value framework, the CoC is intended to guide 
everyone at the company when carrying out our business activities."
"Furthermore, it supports all our 
employees, managers, and corporate bodies in complying with and living by the core principles and 
values of the business segments."
"As a directive for our actions, the CoC contributes to affirming our 
company’s status now and in the future as a trusted partner to our customers, business partners, 
shareholders, and further stakeholders."
"Group-wide compliance management
Our Group-wide CMS is based on established standards such as the IDW AsS 980."
"We follow these 
guiding principles:
• Prevent: Preventive measures are anchored in our management system to avoid wrongdoing."
• Detect: We use risk analyses to detect and manage material compliance risks Group-wide.
Additional control instruments help reveal noncompliant behavior.
"• React and improve: We penalize any violations of statutory or internal regulations as appropriate 
in each individual case."
"In addition, we continuously develop improvement measures for the entire 
CMS."
"We see our compliance management system as an important contribution to acting in a 
sustainable and forward-looking manner and thus living up to our tradition as a reliable and 
trustworthy company."

Prevent
Antitrust law continues to be an important aspect of compliance for both parts of the Group."
"The 
reasons for this are our business models, legal complexity, the continually increasing prosecution 
activity worldwide, as well as the potential for sanctions by antitrust authorities."
"In addition to antitrust 
law, preventing corruption and acting in accordance with privacy laws are two other focal points of our 
compliance programs."
"These programs serve to specifically raise the awareness of our relevant 
employee groups to these topics and to provide them with both the confidence to act and make 
decisions."
"Our Corporate Compliance Management departments are responsible for defining, developing, and 
monitoring the minimum standards for these programs and an appropriate CMS for the business 
segments."
"We have appointed compliance officers with local responsibility in our regions and affiliates who are 
tasked with communicating all elements of the compliance programs to our employees and ensuring 
that they are applied at the local level."
"In this way, we aim to embed all elements of our CMS in the 
regions and affiliates and to monitor and improve them on an ongoing basis."
"Our local companies have 
access to a network of specialized external lawyers, particularly for matters relating to antitrust law."
"• The anti-corruption guidelines provide guidance on how to handle gifts, product samples, and 
invitations from and to representatives and employees of other companies or public officials."
"They 
also contain information on how to deal with conflicts of interest."
"• The data protection guidelines describe in particular how to implement the principles of the 
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure that our EU companies process 
data in accordance with the law."
"These guidelines direct and instruct our employees on how to 
handle data in a legally compliant manner."
"In addition, the data protection teams have established 
internal partnerships with key data protection functions such as Cyber Security and Procurement."
"We have implemented a comprehensive, target group-specific training concept."
"Each year, an average 
of several thousand employees worldwide receive risk-oriented training on how to prevent corruption 
and behave in compliance with antitrust law and data protection regulations."
"The training is provided 
either face-to-face or through e-learning courses and is designed to raise awareness among our 
employees and show them where they can seek further support."
"In addition, members of the Executive 
Board and Supervisory Board are regularly informed about relevant compliance issues."
"In fiscal year 
2023, the Consumer Business Segment achieved a total training participation rate of 98% and tesa of 
98% (January to October)."
"The total participation rate applies to the target and risk group defined in 
advance for the respective compliance fields of antitrust law, anti-corruption, and data protection."
"That 
includes all employees and managers who may come into contact with the topics and requirements in 
question."
"Our employees can find further guidance and information via the relevant compliance pages on the 
intranet."
"Moreover, we use various communication channels such as the intranet and emails to keep 
employees regularly informed about relevant compliance issues and new developments."
"We are also in 
regular contact with our local affiliates, for example to discuss general updates, any issues that arise, 
and best practice approaches."

These regular communication and training measures allow us to embed the principles of compliance 
within our company."
"Detect
Our CMS and compliance programs are based on a compliance risk analysis."
"To this end, we regularly 
identify existing and future areas of compliance risk associated with our business models and our 
geographical positioning in the course of a comprehensive compliance risk assessment."
"Both 
Corporate Compliance Management departments also support their respective management teams in 
detecting risks that go beyond their own organizational responsibility."
"In a second step, these risks are assessed and prioritized."
"Matters of high priority are analyzed for their 
specific risks so that appropriate countermeasures can be taken."
"This is carried out both centrally and at 
the affiliates."
"The results are communicated to the Executive Board and used to continuously adjust and 
improve our global and local compliance programs."
"If we want our compliance practices to be sustainable and maintain and further promote an open, 
trusting compliance and communication culture, we need all our employees to be on board and fully 
committed."
"This also includes reporting possible compliance violations and other complaints – even 
anonymously, if they so desire."
"To this end, we have established and communicated various reporting 
systems."
"For example, the Consumer Business Segment launched the “Speak up."
"We care.” whistleblowing 
platform that can be accessed from anywhere in the world around the clock."
"The tesa Business Segment 
uses the same platform in parallel."
"In addition to our own employees, the whistleblower platforms are also open to customers, consumers, 
suppliers, and other external stakeholders who wish to report possible misconduct."
"There are also 
various internal reporting channels, such as central compliance email addresses."
"We have processes in place to help us follow up on all reports of misconduct, shed light on the facts of 
the matter, and take appropriate action following careful consideration."
"Relevant specialist functions 
and the Corporate Auditing department are usually involved in the investigation."
Corporate Auditing is another independent monitoring function within Beiersdorf AG.
"The department 
conducts regular audits in both business segments, with compliance-related topics forming an integral 
part of these audits."
"In addition, the relevant Corporate Compliance department regularly verifies 
compliance with centrally defined minimum standards, for example through on-site visits or surveys on 
the implementation of measures."
"React and improve
We gain an impression of the effectiveness of our compliance management system by means of regular 
Group-wide compliance reports."
"The results are reported to the Executive Board and Supervisory 
Board."
"These reports document compliance incidents as well as the status of our compliance programs 
centrally and at affiliates worldwide."
"We derive further courses of action based on this information and 
implement appropriate measures."
"Even outside of the reporting cycles, affiliates must of course inform 
the central Compliance department immediately of any material compliance incidents so that we can 
take prompt action."
"Another key component of our activities is the continuous and consistent further development of our 
CMS."
"This is how we take internal adaptation requirements into account, as well as the dynamic 
changes in legal frameworks and economic conditions."
"During the year under review, we revised our 
Code of Conduct for the Consumer Business Segment and introduced it at all affiliates."
"We also

updated1 our compliance training guidelines and, in particular, incorporated a newly developed 
training cockpit."
"This software provides a real-time overview of the status of compliance training and 
allows us to improve our training management."
"Moreover, we have aligned the compliance risk 
assessment process and system more closely with existing financial risk management formats."
"The aim 
here is to create a standardized, integrated approach for both business segments using the same 
platform."
"At tesa, we revised both the content and the design of our e-learning courses on corruption prevention 
and conduct in compliance with antitrust law and data protection regulations during the reporting year."
"Within the scope of our compliance risk assessment, we identified “Environmental, Social, 
Governance” (ESG) as a new, relevant compliance risk area and integrated it into the tesa CMS."
"We also 
reviewed the local compliance implementation status at certain affiliates."
"Other Issues
Product safety
Our highest priority is to provide safe products that are fully compatible with our consumers’ health and 
the environment."
"All our products therefore need to comply with numerous statutory requirements 
before they can receive official market approval."
"Both business segments apply high standards in this 
regard."
"Consumer
In this respect, our understanding of quality goes beyond the evaluation and approval of our products."
"We understand quality as a dynamic process that contributes to continuous improvement and express 
this understanding in the Beiersdorf Quality Policy."
"It guides our Executive Board, our management, 
and all our employees in their daily activities."
"It also serves to maintain and build on our consumers’ 
satisfaction and high level of trust, and to ensure that we remain competitive in the future."
"Safety evaluation of all raw materials and cosmetic product formulas
To ensure that we meet our own strict requirements regarding the quality of our products, we employ a 
team of experienced, highly qualified safety assessors."
"First, this team must perform the legally required 
evaluation and approval of the raw materials, formulas, packaging materials, and product claims, 
thereby verifying their safety and compatibility for consumers."
"Only then do the safety assessors 
approve the finished products for distribution."
"In the interests of consumer protection, the safety assessors work closely with related departments such 
as Research & Development and Product and Packaging Development."
"In addition to experience and expertise, evaluating the safety of cosmetic products requires, above all, 
scientific exchange and knowledge of new findings regarding the compatibility and safety of raw 
materials, formulas, and packaging materials."
"Accordingly, our safety assessors attend international 
conferences, participate in working groups and expert teams, and also take part in specialist 
international training courses."
"The goal of this professional exchange and training is to ensure that we 
continue to operate appropriately and responsibly in the future."
"It is also important to us that we hold

1 Valid since Jan."
"our external service providers and suppliers, such as perfume and raw material manufacturers, 
accountable."
"We require them to certify their compliance with statutory requirements as well as those 
that go beyond the legally required scope."
"Beiersdorf’s global mandatory safety requirements
We have established our detailed safety requirements in the Beiersdorf Product Safety Policy."
"This 
policy is globally binding, as we do not differentiate between regions or locations when assessing the 
safety of raw materials, formulas, and products, but set the same standards everywhere."
"The 
requirements of the EU Cosmetics Regulation 1223/2009 play a particularly important role for us."
"For our medical devices and medicinal products, the applicable regulatory requirements provide the 
necessary criteria to ensure product safety."
"The legal requirements governing the safety of products – viewed on a global level – are constantly 
changing."
"We want to preemptively mitigate the risk of violating current regulations, which is why our 
central Regulatory Affairs team collaborates with an international network of local regulatory affairs 
officers."
"They follow all the regulatory requirements and the latest changes to them in the countries in 
which our products are sold."
"This way, we ensure that our products meet all the currently applicable 
requirements for their respective markets as early as the product development stage."
"Animal testing
We are resolutely committed to rendering animal testing obsolete worldwide."
"We are convinced that 
animal testing is not necessary to prove the skin tolerability and effectiveness of our cosmetic products."
"For this reason, we do not conduct animal tests for any of our cosmetic products or their ingredients, 
and do not have animal testing done on our behalf – unless we are required to do so by the authorities."
"For medical devices and pharmaceuticals, any animal testing is limited to the absolute minimum 
necessary and is only carried out by qualified third parties in accordance with the strict requirements for 
regulatory market approval."
"In the EU, animal testing has been completely banned for cosmetic products since 2004, and for all the 
ingredients used in these products since 2013."
"Beiersdorf abides by these legal requirements and, 
even before the European ban, refrained from animal testing worldwide whenever local laws permitted."
"It is our stated goal to advance research to the point when animal testing can be completely 
abandoned worldwide."
Consumer safety is our top priority.
"As one of the leading research-based companies, we have been 
involved in the development and acceptance of alternative testing methods for almost 40 years."
"In this 
context, we have been and continue to be instrumental in the development and validation of key 
methodologies that are internationally recognized by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) and major regulatory bodies."
"Even though great progress has already been made, at the present time there still aren’t alternative 
testing methods available that have been recognized and established by lawmakers for all safety-
related issues."
"In collaboration with numerous partners and interest groups, we therefore work to 
ensure that innovative alternative methods are developed and that existing ones are accepted."
"We are 
involved in various working groups in the European umbrella organization of the cosmetics industry 
(Cosmetics Europe), cooperate with the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods 
(EURL ECVAM), and support the OECD by providing scientific findings."
"In addition, Beiersdorf has established 
partnerships in the field of cutting-edge research, for example in the study of “organ chips,” which 
simulate the interaction of several organs."
"In 2023, Beiersdorf co-founded the new International 
Collaboration on Cosmetics Safety (ICCS) and played a key role in shaping it."
"The aim of this 
collaboration is to promote the introduction of methods that do not involve animal testing and to 
investigate the effects of cosmetics and their ingredients on human health and the environment."
"tesa
The quality and safety of our products are crucial to the satisfaction of our customers and thus to our 
economic success."
"tesa aims to ensure that our products are high-quality and safe through systematic 
quality management."
"If products display safety defects, this can have a negative impact – both on us as 
a company and on the people who use them."
"Our aim is to manufacture and distribute products that 
meet the highest standards of quality and safety."
"A systematic approach to quality and safety
tesa wants to design its products and processes to ensure that they fulfill the diverse expectations of our 
customers and other stakeholders and that no one is harmed during their production or use."
"As such, 
all tesa production sites apply certified management systems in accordance with globally recognized 
quality norms, standards, and regulations."
"The compliance of our products, systems, and processes is 
periodically reviewed and confirmed through both internal and external audits at the relevant locations."
We comply with applicable laws and guidelines.
"Our internal Product Safety Guidelines complement 
these strict statutory provisions and lay out mandatory measures that enable us to further increase the 
safety of our products."
"In addition, they specify the role and responsibilities of the Product Safety & 
Conformity Representatives (PSCR)."
"The guidelines apply worldwide and our employees have access to 
the document via our intranet."
"Product safety officers
Every production facility worldwide has a local PSCR who reports to the Corporate PSCR, the central 
product safety officer."
"All our PSCRs must complete an external training course that is recognized 
officially."
They usually also act as the sites’ quality officers.
"Product safety management is an integral part of quality management at tesa and is co-steered by the 
Executive Board."
"The Corporate Regulatory Affairs Department is responsible for evaluating materials 
and substances."
"The employees working there draw on various chemical databases, evaluate scientific 
findings, and review data on safety-relevant substance properties and the safe handling of substances 
and mixtures."
"Each product always has an information sheet (e.g., safety data sheet) containing safety-
relevant information, for example on ingredients, correct storage or handling, and recommendations 
for disposal."
"Risk analyses ensure quality
Preventing product defects plays an important role for us, which is why Product Development and 
Production perform risk assessments or failure mode and effects analyses (FMEA) for every new project."
"This helps them to identify potential defects in design, production, or even usage directions, such as 
inaccurate instruction manuals, during the development process."
"Once products are on the market, our 
business units continue to monitor them."
"If the units determine that a new risk analysis and evaluations 
are necessary, or that further or new measures are required, they take the necessary steps to safeguard 
the health and safety of our customers and employees."

Internal audits
tesa owes its safe product solutions not only to its strict quality requirements, but also to the systematic 
development of expertise within the company."
The Quality Management department and PSCRs are responsible for our internal audits.
"Audits of 
Product Development and Production are carried out both on an ad hoc and annual basis – and, if 
necessary, in other departments, such as Marketing."
"The tesa Group’s production sites were again 
successfully audited in accordance with globally recognized quality norms and standards during the 
reporting year."
"The IATF 16949 certification process pays special attention to the conformity of all 
products, processes, parts, and services, as well as product safety."
"EU Taxonomy Reporting
Since the EU Taxonomy Regulation came into force, Beiersdorf has been required to provide 
information on sales, capital expenditures (CapEx), and operating expenses (OpEx) associated with 
environmentally sustainable economic activities."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation contains criteria for 
determining whether an economic activity qualifies as sustainable with respect to various environmental 
objectives."
"The overarching goal is to create a more sustainable financial sector and channel 
investments into green and sustainable projects, thereby contributing to the European Green Deal."
"With the adoption of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of June 27, 2023, the 
disclosure obligation for the 2023 reporting year for the first time included four additional 
environmental objectives: “Water and marine resources,” “Circular economy,” “Pollution,” and 
“Biodiversity”."
"Further economic activities in connection with the “Climate change mitigation” and 
“Climate change adaptation” environmental objectives were also added in this context (Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2023/2485)."
"The reporting forms depicted in Annex 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of 
March 9, 2022 are not taken into account for the reporting year 2023."
"This is due to the economic 
activities related to gas and nuclear listed in the annexes do not fall within the business activities of 
Beiersdorf."
"Taxonomy Impact Analysis procedure1
Beiersdorf uses a top-down approach to determine the Taxonomy eligibility of certain business 
activities with the help of the relevant specialist units."
"Taxonomy-eligible activities relevant to Beiersdorf are identified based on the activity descriptions, the 
referenced NACE codes, and the supplementary publications of the EU Commission and the EU 
Platform on Sustainable Finance."
"For the 2023 reporting year, the process for determining and 
identifying Taxonomy-eligible activities relevant to Beiersdorf was extended to include the four 
additional environmental objectives listed above."
"As a result, we may make changes to our Taxonomy Impact Analysis in the future."
"Identified Taxonomy-eligible economic activities
Beiersdorf’s business model was comprehensively analyzed in connection with the implementation of 
the EU Taxonomy requirements."
"The core business activities of Beiersdorf are not covered by the 
activities listed in the latest version of the Delegated Acts."
"Only one activity in the tesa Business 
Segment, which relates to the manufacture of subcomponents for batteries (Activity 3.4), was identified 
as Taxonomy-eligible."
"However, this activity is of minor importance compared to Beiersdorf’s core 
business activities and only makes up a small proportion of the Group’s sales."
"In terms of classifying investments and operating expenses, the EU Taxonomy Regulation distinguishes 
between the following three categories:
• Category A: investments or operating expenses related to assets or processes that are associated 
with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"• Category B: investments or operating expenses that are part of a (CapEx) plan to expand 
Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to 
become Taxonomy-aligned."
"• Category C: investments or operating expenses related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-
aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-
carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions."
"Due to Beiersdorf’s business model, no investments or operating expenses other than those related to 
economic activity 3.4 are allocated to category A."
"Similarly, as we are not drawing up any investment 
plans to convert our activities into Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, none of our investments or 
operating expenses are allocated to category B."
"Beiersdorf therefore only has to take into account 
investments or operating expenses relating to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities and individual measures (category C)."
"The economic activities reported relate exclusively to the environmental objective of “Climate change 
mitigation.” Furthermore, in the course of the data collection and reporting process, we make sure that 
each economic activity is clearly allocated to an EU taxonomy activity."
"We can thus rule out the 
possibility of economic activities being allocated twice."
"The acquisition of third-party computing power (cloud computing services) is also 
taken into account in this context."
"• Similarly, Activity 8.2 “Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions” is relevant because 
Beiersdorf uses the GaBi and SoFi emissions management software as well as other energy 
management systems."
"• Based on the recommendation of the EU Commission (FAQ 2022), reporting related to Activity 
7.7, ""Acquisition and Ownership of Buildings,"" will be conducted for the first time for the fiscal 
year 2023."
"This activity covers investment activities in connection with the construction or 
expansion of our production and administrative buildings."
"The construction of these buildings are 
carried out by external construction companies."
"Capitalization of right-of-use assets from leases 
(IFRS 16) for rented office buildings is also reported under Activity 7.7."
"In the previous year, these 
activities were reported as not Taxonomy-eligible."
"Energy
• In this area, Activity 4.25 “Production of heat/cool using waste heat” and Activity 4.30 “High-
efficiency co-generation of heat/cool and power from fossil gaseous fuels” were identified as 
Taxonomy-eligible."
This is because Beiersdorf uses waste heat for internal heating processes.
"Other activities from this area, e.g., with respect to the production of renewable energy, have 
been recorded under “Construction and Real Estate” in accordance with the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"Transport
• Our transportation activities are generally outsourced to service providers, meaning we do not 
conduct any Taxonomy-eligible activities in this area."
"Our own fleet of company cars falls under 
Activity 6.5 “Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.” 
Manufacturing Industry/Goods Manufacturing
• The manufacture and sale of products from the Consumer Business Segment do not fall within the 
scope of the EU Taxonomy."
"With the manufacture of subcomponents for batteries (Activity 3.4, 
“Manufacture of batteries”), only a small proportion of the tesa Business Segment’s economic 
activity qualifies as Taxonomy-eligible."
Its other activities do not generate Taxonomy-eligible sales.
"For example, tesa does not manufacture plastics in primary form, but sources them from suppliers."
"Taxonomy-eligible sales 
The denominator for the purposes of the EU Taxonomy is determined in line with the definition of sales 
in the consolidated financial statements (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income 
Statement, Note 01)."
"For the 2023 reporting year, sales relating to the manufacture of subcomponents for batteries are 
reported under Activity 3.4 “Manufacture of batteries”."
"The sales generated in this area are attributable 
entirely to the tesa Business Segment."
"These transactions amount to €16 million (prior year: €16 million) 
and therefore represent 0.2% (prior year: 0.2%) of our Group sales of €9,447 million."
"Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) 
The reference figure (denominator) of our Taxonomy-eligible activities is determined in accordance 
with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"For the 2023 reporting year, the reference 
figure is €634 million."
"For the 2023 reporting year, capital expenditure amounting to €182 million 
– a share of 28.6% – is attributable to Activity 7.7 “Acquisition and ownership of buildings.” 
In total, our Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure amounts to €209 million (prior year: €17 million)."
"This corresponds to a share of 33% (prior year: 2.7%) of the total capital expenditure (denominator) of 
€634 million for the 2023 reporting year."
"The change compared to the previous year is primarily 
attributed to capital expenditures, which are reported for the first time in connection with activity 7.7 for 
the fiscal year 2023."
"Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses (OpEx) 
The data basis for calculating the reference figure (denominator) for Taxonomy-eligible operating 
expenses for the 2023 reporting year is derived from Beiersdorf’s financial controlling systems."
"Interviews, analyses, and detailed queries addressed to the respective Controlling functions round off 
the data collection process and ensure the quality of the data."
"In cases where it was not possible to directly allocate 
percentage shares, these shares were broken down and, if necessary, allocated using appropriate keys 
(e.g., capital expenditure for Taxonomy-eligible activities)."
Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses amounted to €26 million (prior year: €18 million).
"Compared 
with the investment expenditure reference figure of €481 million, this is equivalent to a share of 5.4% 
(prior year: 4.2%)."
"The change compared to the previous year is primarily attributed to operating 
expenditures, which are reported for the first time in connection with activity 7.7 for the fiscal year 2023."
"Approach and results of the alignment analysis
To assess whether the Taxonomy-eligible activities relevant to Beiersdorf are Taxonomy-aligned, we 
conducted a comprehensive analysis of the relevant technical screening criteria as set out in the 
annexes to the Delegated Acts on the EU Taxonomy."
"DNSH compliance regarding Appendix A (“Climate change adaptation”) is verified 
centrally for the relevant Taxonomy-eligible activities with the help of climate risk and vulnerability 
analyses for each site."
"Beiersdorf actively promotes compliance with laws, codes of conduct, and human 
rights."
"Our annual risk management process includes an assessment of human rights violations by our 
employees and in our supply chain."
"Beiersdorf stands up for fair competition and actively prevents 
corruption through a number of compliance programs."
"Through appropriate monitoring measures, 
Beiersdorf ensures that the minimum protection requirements of the EU Taxonomy are met."
"In the event that no energy 
performance certificate was available, we used alternative external confirmations that provide 
appropriate evidence of compliance with the limits specified in the technical screening criteria (e.g., 
energy class A)."
"The majority of Beiersdorf's Taxonomy-eligible activities involve products and services obtained from 
suppliers and service providers."
"In some cases, there were no third-party evidence and confirmations 
available for these economic activities to conclusively assess their potential Taxonomy-alignment."
"For 
other economic activities, the technical screening criteria could not be fully met, resulting in no 
Taxonomy-aligned disclosure for this portion."
"This particularly applies to portions of investment and 
operating expenses for activities 6.5 and 7.7."
"The 2023 reporting year again posed considerable challenges for both Beiersdorf and its suppliers in 
terms of proving the Taxonomy-alignment of the identified Taxonomy-eligible activities."
"In some cases, 
the technical screening criteria for the Taxonomy-alignment of individual activities had not yet been 
published or sufficiently clarified at the time the investment projects were planned."

The global economy lost momentum.
"Despite a robust start to 2023, growth slowed noticeably over 
the summer."
"This was mainly due to weak industrial production and a significant rise in interest rates in 
most regions of the world, which inhibited investment in residential construction in particular."
"Another 
dampening factor was China's subdued economic development, which was largely based on debt in 
the country's real estate sector."
Inflation fell only slowly from a very high level.
"Real income growth 
resulting from wage adjustments only made a gradual contribution to stimulating consumption."
"Supply 
chain difficulties have largely been replaced by new challenges."
"Although supply chains disrupted by 
the pandemic have largely been restored, the global manufacturing sector has shown weaknesses in 
the face of weak productivity growth, the expiry of COVID-19 support measures and difficult financial 
conditions."
"In addition, the shift in demand toward the service sector and increased uncertainty about 
the future geo-economic situation have led to a reluctance to invest."
"The sentiment indicators for the corporate sector and private households in Europe often showed 
opposing trends over the course of 2023."
"The significant rise in interest rates and the associated 
decrease in the inflation rate caused consumers to breathe a sigh of relief."
"The consumer climate has 
gradually stabilized since the low point in autumn 2022, when the inflation rate in the eurozone reached 
double digits at times."
"By contrast, the situation in industry is considered to be particularly critical."
"This 
sector suffered from weak global demand and a deterioration in price competitiveness, triggered by 
the appreciation of the euro."
"In the second half of the year, there were signs of a decline in new orders 
in industry."
"However, this decline has not yet been fully reflected in production, as companies were still 
processing many orders that had been left unfilled due to the supply bottlenecks that had occurred in 
the meantime."
The situation in the construction industry was also poor.
"The significant deterioration in 
financing conditions and the drastic rise in construction costs had a noticeable dampening effect on 
demand for construction services."

The German economy remained in a difficult situation in 2023."
"Private consumption in particular 
proved to be susceptible to economic weaknesses, and exports also recorded a decline."
"The tensions 
between China and the West led to below-average growth in foreign trade."
"Although the burden of 
energy prices on companies and private households eased, this was not enough to compensate for 
other negative factors, as the massive interest rate hikes by most central banks put the brakes on the 
economy."
They significantly reduced demand for industrial goods and residential construction.
"The 
fluctuations in incoming orders in industry were very pronounced."
"This was due to the fact that the 
volume of large orders varied from month to month."
"Despite these challenges, companies were able to 
keep production largely stable and thus reduce the order backlogs built up in recent years."
"The US economy recorded fairly strong growth, mainly due to an unusually expansive fiscal policy."
"The 
inflation rate, which fell significantly in the first half of the year, was unable to continue the trend in the 
second half of the year, particularly due to a significant rise in gas prices in the meantime."
"Nevertheless, 
both private consumption and fixed asset investments recorded noticeable growth."
"The latter can 
probably be attributed to the subsidies introduced for the semiconductor industry and transformation 
technologies."
"The downturn in residential construction investment has, continued but slowed 
somewhat."
"At the end of the year, the slowing factors became increasingly noticeable."
"The savings rate 
recently reached unusually low levels."
"In Japan, macroeconomic production increased sharply in the first half of 2023, mainly due to rising 
exports as a result of a significant devaluation of the yen."
"This also led to a very significant rise in 
inflation by Japanese standards."
Developments in the emerging markets painted a mixed picture.
"China surprised on the downside in 
the final months of the year."
"The end of the zero COVID policy in December 2022 only gave the 
economy a brief boost."
"The problems on the real estate market had a significant impact on the 
economy."
"In combination with uncertainties on the labor market, these developments weighed on 
consumer spending."
"In addition, industrial production, corporate investment and exports recorded a 
decline, which is attributable to both weakening foreign demand and geopolitical uncertainties."
"In 
Russia, overall economic production in the second quarter of 2023 returned to its level before the 
invasion of Ukraine."
"Investments increased in connection with the rise in military spending, but private 
consumption also increased thanks to higher real wages and social benefits."
"Nevertheless, there are 
bottlenecks in the labor market, as many workers have been drafted into the army or left the country to 
avoid military service since the beginning of the war."
"Nevertheless, overall economic development 
proved to be robust."
"The increase in growth reflected a significant fiscal stimulus, strong investment and 
stable consumption against the backdrop of a tight labor market."
"Growth was largely driven by the 
production of military goods, which do not benefit the population."
"The Brazilian economy benefited 
from a record harvest."
"High revenues from the export of crude oil and iron ore and the recovery of the 
service sector also boosted gross domestic product growth."
"The reduction in oil production led to weak 
development in the Middle East."
"However, the decline in activity in the oil sector was offset by other 
sectors of the economy, supported by sustained private consumption, strategic fixed investment and a 
supportive fiscal policy stance."
"The Indian economy remains a reliable growth driver for the global 
economy."
"In 2023, the high pace of the previous year was maintained."
"For the third year in a row, the 
Indian economy was characterized by a strong increase in private investment."
"At the same time, the 
previous year's record-high level of exports was maintained."
"The Southeast Asian emerging markets 
are on the upswing."
"Their fundamentals are stabilizing, growth is returning and corporate balance 
sheets look solid."

Sales market trends
The global market environment was in a volatile 
position again in 2023."
"Materials shortages, which 
resulted from continuing supply chain pressures 
combined with very buoyant markets, 
represented a major challenge."
"Meanwhile, 
geopolitical tensions and continued high inflation 
stoked fears of recession."
"While global 
commodity prices eased slightly, energy costs 
remained at a very high level."
"The volume and 
value of the global cosmetics market grew 
despite the challenging circumstances."
"The only 
exception was China, where the cosmetics market 
bounced back less than expected after the lifting 
of COVID-19 restrictions."
"Globally, there was year-

and lip care categories."
"Consumer Spending1

Uncertainty continued to leave its mark on the tesa Business Segment’s activities in 2023.
"The global 
recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is slow and uneven."
"The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues 
to affect the economic situation, and economic activity remains below pre-pandemic levels."
"The conflict 
in the Middle East has also further unsettled markets."
"Inflation remained at a high level in 2023, albeit 
below the previous year’s peaks."
"In this environment, performance in industrial sales markets was 
mixed."
The automotive industry was resilient and recorded an upturn globally.
"However, other 
industrial sales markets along with the distribution business saw high levels of consumer uncertainty, 
inventory reduction measures, and an overall downward trend."
"This was particularly the case in Europe 
and to a certain extent in North America, while growth momentum from Asia was positive."
"Procurement market trends
Offshoots of the 2021 and 2022 supply chain crisis continued to shape developments in 2023."
"Further 
supply shortages occurred particularly in the first half of the year, combined with significant inflation in 
many raw materials, packaging, and logistics markets."
"This was partly due to high levels of 
macroeconomic uncertainty, driven by factors such as the Russia-Ukraine war, the China-Taiwan conflict, 
and the sluggish recovery of Chinese manufacturing output."
Energy costs also remained at a high level.
"Combined with inflation for other input factors, this prompted production costs to rise further."
"A first 
correction in important markets for materials and services was observed in the second half of the year, 
chiefly due to capacity expansion."
"This, together with our cross-departmental management of supply 
shortages and preferential position with key suppliers, enabled us to further limit the negative impact of 
supply difficulties on our production sites and distribution partners."
"Overall assessment of the economic environment
The global cosmetics market performed positively in 2023."
"In the mass market, where NIVEA competes, 
growth was still largely driven by price rises, although volume growth was also positive."
"The 
components of growth were more balanced in the dermocosmetic skin care market."
"Overall, both Skin 
Care and Personal Care (deo, soaps, shower gels) produced strong growth."
"The focus in the Consumer 
Business Segment remained on Skin Care, which accounts for the largest share of our marketing 
budget."
All Skin Care subcategories posted growth again in the reporting year.
"Significant impacts of the continued high inflation and significant price rises for raw materials, logistics, 
and energy made themselves felt in the tesa Business Segment again in 2023."

"This resulted in an overall positive effect on gross 
profit."
"With an increase of 8.4% to €3,250 million (previous year: €2,998 million), marketing and selling 
expenses developed at a higher rate than the strong sales growth."
"This development is mainly due to 
higher investments in digital media and an increased focus on Skin Care as part of the C.A.R.E.+

reassessment of the contractually defined valuation parameters is driven by both the delayed entry into 
the Chinese market and the general market development in China and South Korea."

"Amid a sharply contracting market environment, particularly in the first half of the year, tesa performed 
well and closed fiscal year 2023 with strong growth."

down on the previous year’s figure."

Risk Report
Risks and opportunities
In the course of its business activities, the Beiersdorf Group is exposed to a multitude of risks and 
opportunities."
"These risks and opportunities result, among other things, from its activities that seek to 
develop and make use of opportunities to improve the company’s competitiveness."
"Risks and 
opportunities encompass specific events and developments with a certain probability of occurrence 
that may have material negative or positive financial and/or non-financial effects on the achievement of 
the Beiersdorf Group’s objectives."
"Beiersdorf uses an integrated risk and opportunity management 
system to identify and evaluate material risks at an early stage and to consistently limit them using 
counteractive measures."
This system is coordinated at Group headquarters.
"Risk and opportunity 
management is complemented by the accounting-related internal control systems, the various internal 
and external monitoring bodies – supported by Internal Audit – and external auditors."
"Regularly performing analyses of customers and the competition, for example, enables a swift 
response to dynamic market developments."
"Specific market opportunities and risks are derived from 
the information obtained."
"In cases where the full avoidance of risks is not possible or reasonable, risks are mitigated 
using appropriate measures, or are transferred to third parties such as insurance companies."
"Within the risk management process, periodic inventories are carried out to identify, evaluate, 
document, and subsequently communicate the material risks in a structured way along with the 
measures to manage these risks."
"The corresponding principles, reporting and feedback processes, and 
responsibilities are laid out in a directive that applies across the Group."
This is updated regularly.
"Beiersdorf Risk Presentation
Beiersdorf distinguishes between strategic, functional, and operational risks."
"Strategic risks encompass 
fundamental frameworks, developments, and events that could have a substantial impact on the 
Group’s business model or its business segments."
"Functional risks are challenges inherent to the 
business model."
"The various specialist functions generally work at the global or regional level to 
counter these risks, with sustainable actions relating to the design of operational and organizational 
structures as well as with specific individual measures."
"The opportunities and risks associated with 
climate change are also particularly integrated into strategic and functional risk management."
"Operational risks and opportunities are those that may influence short-term sales and profits of our 
corporate affiliates."
Appropriate observation periods are assigned to these risk categories.
A period of five years generally applies for strategic risks.
"For functional risks, the period is two years as 
a rule, and for short-term operational risks one year."
"In the Group’s internal risk reporting, individual risks are uniformly presented by positioning them on 
the Beiersdorf Risk Radar."
"The various fields of the radar reflect, in summarized form, the relevant areas 
for the company both inside and outside the Group that may give rise to risks."
"The graph on the 
previous page (Beiersdorf Risk Radar) shows the structure of the risk radar for strategic risks."
"By 
combining financial, sustainability-related, and legal compliance topics in a single system, the radar has 
been expanded from 8 to 16 topics."
"For each category, the risks are also classified based on their probability and the potential financial and 
non-financial impact of their occurrence."
"The Executive Board and supervisory bodies are regularly updated on the risk situation at Consumer 
and tesa Business Segment levels and at Group level."
"Besides this, direct lines of communication ensure 
that suddenly occurring material risks are also reported immediately to management."
"Continuous 
information sharing with the Corporate Development function additionally encourages the 
consideration of risk aspects in the support provided to management."
"Central risk management is also 
in constant communication with topic-specific task forces, which are created by the Executive Board as 
necessary."
"The Corporate Risk Board (CRiB), which was newly established in 2022, continued its work in the 
reporting year and is a key body advising the Executive Board on risk management matters."
"The CRiB 
continues to consist of the heads of important, mostly globally responsible corporate departments 
comprising multiple areas of responsibility (Marketing, Quality Management, Internal Audit, 
Communication, Sustainability, Group Accounting, IT Security, Legal)."
"The task of this body is to collate 
the various risks – both those already known and those newly identified by the Corporate Risk Board – 
using a broad-based approach and to analyze them in depth and present them in summarized form."
"By 
bringing together many different perspectives, it provides Beiersdorf with important collective 
intelligence, further improving and complementing the existing analysis of material risks."
"As in the previous year, in analyzing the material risks and opportunities, the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board looked at the comparison of the qualitatively and quantitatively aggregated risk 
portfolio with the updated financial total risk-bearing capacity."
"The aim was again to determine whether 
there was any need for a change in the overall assessment of the risk situation (see below) on this basis."
"To ensure maximum transparency and accountability, Beiersdorf’s financial risk-bearing capacity is 
calculated based on average net liquidity."
"The available free cash flow to be used for the development 
of net liquidity in the multi-period perspective is adjusted solely for the previously deducted 
investments in securities and effects from past M&A transactions."
"The calculation of risk-bearing 
capacity is therefore based on a very conservative approach, as it deliberately does not take into 
account potentially significant short-term increases in our liquidity, which could be used in actual crisis 
situations."
"Lastly, for net liquidity and cash flow, we have used only the 
average for the last five years, rather than the higher recent figures for 2023."
"Description of the material risks and opportunities
Strategic risks and opportunities
All strategic risks that already existed in 2022 or newly emerged in the 2023 reporting year were again 
subjected to a comprehensive review."
"Where necessary, we adjusted the precise definitions of these 
risks and our assessment of their probability and/or impact."
"This analysis showed no material year-on-
year change in the overall risk situation."
"In addition, in line with our cautious approach, we have currently completely removed 
opportunities beyond our medium-term planning from the quantitative net calculation of the risk 
portfolio."
This approach was also taken in the previous year.
"We have also removed some risk aspects, 
that, we regard as part of the day-to-day challenges we continuously face as part of our business model, 
from the definition of strategic risks, since these are generally already captured by our financial 
planning."
"These include, for example, recurring disputes with retailers over pricing, diverse attacks on 
our brands and products by competitors, and, in particular, the defense of our trademarks and product 
claims."
"Reputational risks to brands and the company
Maintaining and increasing the value of our major consumer brands with their broad appeal remains 
of decisive importance to Beiersdorf’s business development."
"The trust of our customers and, in 
particular, of the consumers of our products, is essential to this and cannot be taken for granted."
"We 
have designed our risk management system to fully justify this trust and to provide enduring, 
successful protection to the value of our brands."
"We continuously review our internal processes in all 
areas of the company in order that we can respond appropriately, correctly, and effectively to any 
events that could harm or threaten our reputation."
"Combined with the activities described below in 
relation to the quality of our products and overall market image, we expect this to help prevent any 
potential reputational problems from escalating into critical issues."
"This applies equally to our 
brands and to our company as a whole."
"Our extensive operational and communication measures in 
relation to sustainability, diversity, and other aspects of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also 
help to limit the risks."
"In the short term, however, we see a slight increase in net risk as a result of the 
new Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG), despite 
all the measures already implemented."
"We categorize the risks to the reputation of our brands and 
our company as medium and possible overall."
"Critical ingredients
For a clearer distinction and risk assessment, we have presented the risk arising from the use of 
critical ingredients separately from general procurement risks in this report."
"Our research and 
development department, with its broad expertise and geographical coverage, ensures that we 
always comply with all local legal requirements."
"It is supported in this by a specialized regulatory 
affairs function."
"We are also in permanent dialogue with the relevant authorities so that we can react 
in good time when changes to product formulation requirements begin to emerge."
"As a member of 
the relevant associations, particularly at the European level, we as a company receive early notice of 
emerging changes."
This also includes our regular dialogue with the key suppliers.
"In the reporting 
year, we made further improvements to our internal process for dealing with critical ingredients."
"However, we note that challenges are growing with the further spread of digital applications and 
channels critical of the ingredients used in the cosmetics industry."
"We continue to categorize the risk 
as medium and possible."
"Accelerating digitalization
The penetration of digital technology in consumer interaction all along the marketing and sales 
process is still constantly increasing."
"Beiersdorf therefore continues to work hard at planning and 
implementing these interactions in a way that makes them as specific to the target group as 
possible."
"We made considerable efforts in precision marketing in 2023, enabling us to invest 
significantly more effectively."
"At the same time, we put in place organizational measures for even 
more integrated working, across all brands, between the functions and IT in close collaboration with 
the business."
"Specifically in e-commerce, we further increased our resourcing to reflect the growing 
importance of this channel."
Recruiting and retaining suitable talent remains a big challenge.
"Another 
aspect is ensuring the full protection of private data."
"Our data protection management system, 
globally steered and locally implemented, helps us ensure that sensitive data of our company, 
business partners, and consumers is handled securely at all times."
"This includes, for example, the 
development and use of our social media presence and the development of new software solutions."
"These efforts are complemented by clear internal rules of conduct, transparent management 
structures, extensive training and monitoring activities, and, in the case of data protection, further 
work on global roll-out."
"In this reporting period, as a result of our various measures, we regard the 
risk as medium and possible."
"Growing political and economic uncertainty
The global political situation remained very fraught in the reporting period."
"Alongside the war in 
Ukraine, the new military conflict in the Middle East is causing uncertainty, as it is unclear whether it 
will spread to the wider region."
"Any such spread could then also have somewhat larger direct 
impacts on our business in this region."
"While the US-China relationship has not deteriorated further 
in recent months, it continues to represent significant uncertainty."
"The outlook for the world economy is difficult to assess overall, since the effects of the very sharp 
interest rate hikes of the last 18 months may take some time to be fully reflected in the economic 
figures."
"Highly indebted countries in particular are at high risk if materially higher borrowing costs 
weigh on current budgets."
"The same applies to highly indebted individual companies with which 
Beiersdorf has a direct or indirect business relationship."
"The real estate crisis in China is potentially a 
not-to-be-underestimated factor in this regard."
"At the same time, Beiersdorf remains geographically 
relatively well balanced across all its divisions, without extreme dependency on a particular market."
"Potential market entries in new countries are comprehensively evaluated in their economic and 
political context."
"In the case of Russia, care is taken to strictly comply with all sanctions."
"Nevertheless, 
we categorize the risk from the impact of an escalating military conflict or economic crisis in a market 
relevant to Beiersdorf as major and possible overall."
"Shortage of raw materials, natural resources, and energy
The general procurement situation has improved in recent months with the easing of COVID-19-
related restrictions in the global supply chain."
"This is also evident in falling prices for some important 
raw materials and packaging materials, even though many categories have not reached the price 
level seen before the pandemic."
"The same applies to the energy supply, which is regarded as 
largely secure at the current time."
"To allow us to respond swiftly and appropriately to potential 
future supply crises, we are continuously monitoring our markets and suppliers and use appropriate 
contract management."
"Procurement also carefully manages the scope, timing, and frequency of our 
individual purchases."
"Strategic partnerships remain an important element of actively managing our 
supplier portfolio, as do internal programs designed to ensure the agility of the supply chain as a 
whole and its resilience to disruption."
"In addition, we are intensively seeking potential cost 
reductions throughout the value chain as part of the continuation of our broad-based value 
engineering project."
"While we see overall positive trends, this area remains one of significant 
uncertainty."
"Therefore, we regard the strategic and functional risks in relation to availability and 
price trends on the procurement side as medium and possible given the volatile environment."
"Cybersecurity
As part of the review of our strategic risks, we have now returned to reporting the risk from threats to 
our IT system and the IT systems of our direct business partners as a specific individual risk."
"This 
reflects the special and further increasing significance of this risk."
"With regard to cybersecurity, we 
successfully defended ourselves again in 2023 against direct and indirect attacks on our own IT 
systems."
"We achieved further improvements in IT infrastructure, particularly in cloud services."
"We 
used technical and training-based measures to reduce the particular risk arising from increased 
working from home."
"We also repeated our ISO 27001 certification as an important independent 
confirmation of our efforts."
"In addition, we began to even better protect our operational systems 
along the value chain."
"In light of the growing overall number of threats, we categorize the risk as 
medium and possible, despite all the progress achieved."
"Growing ESG requirements
Regulatory requirements in this area are constantly increasing."
"This is due particularly to the 
European Green Deal, which is implemented through national law, and to the 
Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, LkSG)."
"Irrespective of 
legal requirements, Beiersdorf has been setting very high goals."
"This is evident from our own 
specific sustainability targets in relation to packaging reduction and avoidance, as well as climate 
protection."
"We are continuing to follow through on implementing our new plastics cycle strategy, 
first announced in 2021, along with our efforts to develop and use sustainable packaging and 
applications."
"We have continuously increased our ability to transparently measure progress against 
interim targets."
"In 2023, we again held various events in different formats that were designed to help 
improve the awareness and understanding of our employees and managers around the topics of 
the environment and sustainability."
"We also organized a global diversity and inclusion week in 2023 
to share our progress and announce ambitious new targets, for example in relation to people with 
disabilities."
"To meet the requirements of the new LkSG, we held training programs primarily on 
aspects related to human rights, both internally and for our suppliers."
"At the same time, we began 
assessing and auditing suppliers in relation to this legislation."
"Given their large number, it will take 
an extended period of time for this process to cover all our business partners."
"We anticipate that 
expectations on the part of the public, NGOs, and our customers will continue to grow in relation to 
both our environmental protection efforts and our actions as a responsible corporate citizen."
"We 
therefore still categorize this risk as major and possible."
"Climate change-related effects along the value chain
In this new risk category, we include all the possible impacts of climate change on our entire value 
chain – from procuring crucial raw materials and packaging to transporting products to end 
customers."
"In 2023, we arranged for an extensive external study on risk trends at our own locations 
between now and 2040."
"The resulting insights are now being translated into appropriate packages 
of measures."
"We have also begun to set up continuous monitoring of these risks, including for 
critical ingredients."
Particular attention is being paid to the water supply at our production sites.
"We 
are also constantly updating our emergency plans for critical infrastructure and supplies so that we 
can swiftly and fully respond to such situations."
"At the current time, we categorize this risk as 
medium and possible."
"This risk affects both our 
German locations and our national companies, particularly in relation to all activities with a strong 
digital component."
"Beiersdorf is competing here not only with other players in our industry but also 
especially also with technology firms both large and small."
"As our most important measure, we 
therefore worked urgently in the reporting year on a new employer branding program, which we 
will shortly roll out worldwide."
"Partnerships and contacts with universities also 
serve to build links with qualified potential new employees so that we can prepare them for a career 
at Beiersdorf through special trainee programs."
"As in previous years, we reviewed our employees’ 
satisfaction using an external, standardized, and anonymous survey, comparing the results both to 
our own track record and the wider market."
"The results showed a further slight improvement on the 
previous year’s very high satisfaction level."
"The even greater focus internally on regular, high-quality 
personal development meetings and measures should have contributed to this."
"We have launched 
training programs to tailor employees’ skills to the constantly growing requirements, particularly in 
relation to digital technology."
"These cover general and function-specific skills for which our various 
academies are responsible."
"Given our current competitive strength, we currently assess this risk to 
be low and possible."
"Generative artificial intelligence
We have listed this risk, which also represents an incredible opportunity, separately from the risk of 
general digital acceleration in order to reflect the very rapid pace of developments in this area."
"As a 
brand owner, Beiersdorf is also exposed to particular challenges here."
"We distinguish between two 
types of risks: firstly, risks arising from the feeding of data to external models, and secondly, risks 
arising from the use of these models’ output."
"In response to the rapid growth of Chat GPT and 
similar tools, we quickly published binding legal guidance that all Beiersdorf employees must follow 
when using these applications."
"This is designed in particular to avoid errors in the handling of 
copyrights and data protection."
"We have also put our own Beiersdorf GPT environment in place, 
where the models can be trained securely on our own data."
"The insights from the first large-scale 
application cases are being communicated in such a way that they can be applied to other trials."
"Alongside research and development, we have begun particularly in marketing to intensively 
explore the risks and opportunities as part of a task force."
"This work is looking at both creative 
opportunities and productivity-boosting aspects of the new technology."
"We will continue to work on 
shaping the framework for the safe use of these tools."
"At the current time, and partly because the 
application cases are still limited, we categorize the risk as low and unlikely."
"Functional risks and opportunities
We once again had all functional risks and opportunities evaluated by the global functions during the 
reporting period."
"Given the strong overlap with the strategic risks and opportunities in some cases, 
separate quantification is not useful for the most part."
"This particularly applies to the topics of 
reputation, climate change, sustainability, and procurement."
"For all these topics, however, we take 
additional compensatory measures from a purely functional perspective, which in the case of strategic 
risks are limited to the main activities."
"One example is the use of procurement contracts with protective 
clauses to reduce the volatility affecting important raw materials and packing materials in uncertain 
markets."
"We have classed non-conformity in relation to European capital markets law as only a functional 
risk, for example, specifically as it concerns the risk of insider trading or non-compliance in terms of 
required adhoc reporting."
"Here we have been providing regular, target-specific training since many 
years."
We also ensure continuous internal information sharing on potentially relevant ad hoc facts.
"An 
ad hoc committee evaluates and documents the information."
"We assess the risk to be medium and 
possible."
Another purely functional risk concerns market risk from investments.
"Potential default risks relating 
to the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are limited by only making investments with defined 
reliable counterparties."
"Counterparty risk is monitored daily based on ratings and the counterparties’ 
liable capital as well as continuously updated risk indicators."
"We have invested most of our 
liquidity in low-risk investments (such as government/corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe)."
"The investment 
strategy, which is documented in writing, is regularly agreed with our internal supervisory body and 
with the Supervisory Board."
"Our risk management process includes looking at the conditional value at 
risk so that even extreme market situations can be simulated, understood, and factored into investment 
decisions."
"Our financial risk management is characterized by the clear allocation of responsibilities, 
central rules for limiting financial risks as a matter of principle, and the conscious alignment of the 
instruments deployed with the requirements of our business activities."
"We therefore categorize this risk as medium but 
unlikely."
"Lastly, there is a risk from tax and customs audits in a challenging economic environment, particularly in 
the context of some important changes in our global transfer pricing model."
"Here, we see the specific 
risk that local affiliates may not be able to provide the relevant documentation, leading to non-
acceptance of our transfer pricing and thus higher taxes."
"We have therefore stepped up our efforts in 
tax training and our general communication on tax-related topics."
"At the same time, we are working to 
develop digital applications for more transparency and common global standards, for example in 
relation to tax calculation and documentation."
"We have also increased the support from third-party 
experts on certain issues."
"Overall, we consider the risk to be major and possible."
"Short-term operational risks and opportunities
Alongside the possible long-term impacts of the many geopolitical and economic uncertainties 
highlighted in the strategic risks, we also see ramifications of this volatility for operational risks."
"Price 
negotiations with our customers and the reaction of our consumers to changing prices will play an 
important role."
"Over the past two years, we have gathered valuable experience that we have used in 
our analytical tools for simulation purposes."
"With just a few exceptions, the key assumptions on prices 
and volumes have therefore already been fully incorporated into the basic plan."
"We regard the risk of 
effects exceeding this as improbable and low."
"The general risk of a pandemic has been included in our functional risks for the last years along with the 
corresponding measures."
"Our short-term assessment changed in the reporting period to the extent that 
the end of pandemic restrictions in many countries enabled positive catch-up effects, especially in 
categories such as sun protection and lip care."
"We have generally included these opportunities in the 
basic forecast and do not see any further significant effects in the medium term."
"The key net operational risks currently remaining arise exclusively from legal and tax proceedings and 
from tax audits, as in the previous period."
"These risks are prudently quantified by both internal and 
external experts to the extent possible."
"Assessing the course and outcome of legal disputes is 
associated with considerable uncertainty."
"Based on the information currently available, no material 
charges are expected for the Group that would be considered probable."
"Along with adherence to our risk policy principles, this naturally 
feeds into every business decision taken at the various levels of our company."
"In addition to the above monitoring, operational risks and opportunities are continuously monitored as 
part of the financial planning, forecasting, and reporting process at the local, regional, and central 
levels."
"This ensures that all sales and earnings effects regarded as relatively likely are directly and 
appropriately incorporated into our financial reporting, taking into account the measures implemented 
and planned (e.g., recognition of provisions)."
"This is supplemented by a monthly review of key financial 
figures for the Group companies, led by the Group Controlling function together with Risk 
Management, Internal Audit, and other relevant controlling functions."
"The review is designed to enable 
potentially critical developments to be addressed swiftly and precisely with those involved and 
corrective action to be initiated where appropriate."
"The latest information on risk development is thus also fed into the management and planning systems 
of the corporate units regularly throughout the year and becomes part of the decision-making and 
control processes."
"By directly integrating the risk inventory and planning process, the risk management 
system is continuously developed further, and risk awareness is embedded throughout the company."
"In some cases (digital acceleration, 
shortages of materials and energy), we have reduced our estimate of the potential financial impact 
should the existing strategic risks occur."
"However, we have added new strategic risks at the same time."
We therefore see no overall need for qualitative repositioning specifically for strategic risks.
"Even considering the updated estimations, there is currently no fundamental change to our assessment 
of the overall risk situation."
"As in the previous year, this assessment was substantiated by comparing the 
current quantitatively and qualitatively aggregated total risk portfolio with the very conservatively 
calculated risk-bearing capacity of the Beiersdorf Group."
"Risk-bearing capacity has slightly increased, 
partly due to the Group’s further improved liquidity position."
"This analysis has confirmed Beiersdorf’s 
view that, at the current time, neither the Beiersdorf Group nor individual segments of the business are 
exposed to any risks that could endanger their continued existence."
"The scope and orientation of the internal control system have been shaped by the Executive Board 
based on the Group-specific requirements."
"The accounting-related internal control system consists of 
the following components: control environment, risk assessment process, control activities, information, 
communication, and monitoring."
"An analysis was used to identify the items and positions containing the material risks for the financial 
statements."
The underlying processes were then assigned to these.
"Preventive, monitoring, and 
detective measures designed to ensure security and control in accounting, information processing, and 
the operational functions have been defined Group-wide for these processes."
"Among other things, the 
measures include the separation of functions, manual and IT-based approval processes using the dual 
control principle, IT checks, access restrictions and authorization concepts for the IT system, and 
systems-based processes for handling Group accounting data."
These measures are updated regularly.
"Internal and external shared service centers provide uniform handling of the core accounting processes 
at Beiersdorf AG and most of its affiliates."
"In some cases, they achieve this with the help of fully 
automated processes."
"Standardized IT systems are used to support financial reporting for the affiliates 
included in the consolidated financial statements and consolidation."
"Procedural instructions, 
standardized reporting formats, and IT-based reporting and consolidation processes support financial 
reporting."
The consolidated financial statements are based on accounting directives specified by Beiersdorf AG.
"These guidelines are updated on an ongoing basis through continuous analysis of the relevance and 
impact of changes in the regulatory environment."
"The accounting process and compliance with the control requirements and accounting directives by the 
companies included in the consolidated financial statements are also regularly reviewed and adjusted if 
necessary."
"It remains the case that even putting in place appropriate, effective systems does not guarantee the 
correct, complete, and timely recording of information in the accounts with absolute certainty."
"It is 
impossible to entirely rule out personal judgments, erroneous controls, criminal acts, or other 
circumstances."
"Should these occur, they could limit the effectiveness and reliability of the internal 
control system."
"The rules and regulations are 
regularly communicated and updated as appropriate."
"Compliance with them is monitored and training

1 This section of the Combined Management Report is not subject to audit requirements."
"We have developed data collection and control mechanisms for sustainability 
aspects, too."
Internal Audit regularly checks that these are being adhered to.
"We also implemented an 
integrated IT system for Risk Management in 2023, bringing together risks in the areas of finance, 
compliance, and sustainability."
"The Executive Board deals with the monitoring and control of these 
systems on an ongoing basis, also in close consultation with Internal Auditing."
"The Executive Board is 
regularly advised and monitored by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on issues relating to 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and 
the internal auditing system."
"This has not recently resulted in any significant need for adjustment or 
improvement with regard to these systems."
"Beiersdorf therefore has no reason to believe that there are 
inadequate or ineffective internal control and risk management systems in the relevant business areas 
or in relation to the relevant topics."
"Independent monitoring
The supervisory bodies and the Internal Audit department are integrated into the Beiersdorf Group’s 
internal control system with audit activities that are independent of the Group’s operations."
"Internal 
Audit systematically evaluates the integrity of financial accounting, the effectiveness of the accounting-
related internal control system and of the risk and opportunity management system, and compliance."
"As a process-independent organizational unit, it uses a risk-based approach to reviewing the business 
processes, the systems and controls that have been put in place, and the financial accounting of 
transactions."
"The audit findings are used for ongoing enhancement of the company’s management and 
of preventive and detective controls."
"A standardized monitoring system was introduced in 2022, 
enabling implementation of the controls to be globally monitored, initially in the order-to-cash and 
purchase-to-pay core business processes."
Use of the system was further refined and expanded in 2023.
"In accordance with § 317 (4) HGB and § 91 (2) AktG, the Group auditor also evaluates the effectiveness 
of the risk early warning and monitoring system."
"Internal Audit and the Group auditor regularly report 
the audit results to the supervisory bodies."
"The Audit Committee of Beiersdorf AG monitors, in particular, the accounting process and the 
effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system, and the internal audit system."
"Alongside standard reports, in-depth analyses on fundamental and/or currently relevant issues are 
regularly used for information purposes."

Report on Expected Developments
Expected macroeconomic developments
The escalation in the Middle East has created an additional uncertainty factor for the global economy."
"Provided the conflict does not escalate and the oil price does not rise significantly, the impact on 
inflation and growth is expected to remain limited."
"However, the long-term effects of monetary and 
fiscal policy will continue to shape the economy and the capital markets in 2024."
"Although most of the 
major central banks have probably already completed their interest rate hikes, the first interest rate cuts 
are not likely to take place until the second half of 2024."
"The high level of interest rates is helping to 
reduce the very high inflation in almost all regions of the world in the medium term."
"The loss of 
purchasing power caused by inflation will increasingly be offset by wage increases and should help to 
stimulate consumption."
"Overall, growth in the industrialized countries is expected to remain largely 
weak, while growth in the emerging markets will present a mixed picture and must therefore be viewed 
in a differentiated manner."
The European economy is characterized by many years of zero and negative interest rates.
"Adapting to 
the new interest rate regime takes much longer than normal interest rate hikes."
"Economic weakness is 
therefore likely to persist for an unusually long time and will characterize both 2024 and 2025."
"The 
economy could emerge from recession in the spring, but the usual upturn that normally follows a 
recession is unlikely."
"Due to declining but still high inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) is unlikely 
to consider lowering its key interest rates until the end of 2024."
"In addition, not only the ECB but also all 
other Western central banks have raised interest rates significantly, which means that monetary policy 
will continue to slow down the economy in 2024."
"The slowdown in the Chinese economy is further 
dampening the prospects for growth in the eurozone through exports."
"Against this backdrop, overall 
economic production is likely to grow at a below-average rate over the course of the year."
"The level of 
capacity utilization in the economy is therefore likely to decline, which points to a moderate rise in 
unemployment figures."
"In addition, the sharp rise in wages may represent a further burden for 
companies."
There are no signs of a far-reaching recovery for the German economy in 2024 either.
"The economy 
first has to get used to the new interest rate environment, and this process is likely to take longer."
"The 
first interest rate cut is not expected until fall 2024."
"Most economists therefore expect only a slight 
increase in economic output in 2024."
The inflation rate is likely to fall further in the first few months.
"This 
is due to the fact that companies have now largely passed on their significantly increased costs for 
primary products, energy, and other raw materials to their customers."
"However, the next cost push has 
already begun with the sharp rise in wages, which could lead to inflation being significantly higher in 
the foreseeable future than the European Central Bank (ECB) is actually aiming for."
"The United States has recorded robust economic growth until recently, mainly due to an unusually 
expansive fiscal policy."
"However, the dampening effect of the previous massive key interest rate hikes is 
likely to become noticeable in 2024."
"The higher interest rates are weighing on construction projects, 
investments and the debt-financed part of consumption."
"Coronavirus savings are likely to be largely 
exhausted."
"Consumer spending will therefore rise more slowly than incomes, which could lead to a mild 
recession in the summer half of 2024."
"Despite the likely decline in economic output in the medium 
term, the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates any time soon."
"After all, it is unlikely to jeopardize the hard-
won successes in the fight against inflation lightly."
"The first interest rate cut is expected at the beginning 
of the third quarter of 2024."
Slight US growth is expected for the year as a whole.

The depreciation of the yen is having a negative impact on the purchasing power of the Japanese 
population, which is likely to slow economic growth in 2024."
"The yen is not expected to appreciate 
again until the central banks in the USA and the eurozone cut interest rates again or the Japanese 
central bank raises them."
"According to market experts, the latter is not expected until the first quarter of 
2024 at the earliest, if at all."
"Even in this case, the Japanese central bank's room for maneuver will be 
limited by the high level of government debt."
"The emerging markets, too, continue to be hit by the ailing global economy."
"At the same time, there 
are opportunities to position themselves well for the future and realign the economy."
"In 2024, the 
Chinese economy is likely to suffer from the long-term consequences of policies that have led to a 
significant crisis in the real estate sector, among other things."
"This could have negative effects on the 
Chinese economy for several years."
"Another factor behind the low growth is the loss of confidence in 
government economic policy due to the coronavirus policy and in particular the crackdown on the 
technology sector."
"The political tensions between China and the USA, which are limiting the supply of 
high-tech products, are further exacerbating the situation."
"Although short-term growth in China could 
benefit from further political impetus, the multi-year economic slowdown in China is likely to continue."
The Russian government is using various methods to burden the economy with taxes and duties.
"However, there is a risk that these measures to increase revenue will also slow down economic growth."
The difficult situation on the labor market is also curbing growth potential.
"The budget for 2024, which 
earmarks a large part for ""national defense”, is a further indication that Russia is continuing its war of 
aggression against Ukraine."
"After a surprisingly positive 2023, the Brazilian economy is optimistic 
about 2024."
"Falling interest rates should boost investment, but there are risks due to high government 
spending."
The interest rate cuts are expected to stimulate investment and consumption.
"Especially 
against the backdrop of the ongoing restructuring of the Chinese economic model, the Southeast 
Asian emerging markets now have the opportunity to position themselves as a new production base 
for the world."
The Indian economy is expected to grow at a similar rate in 2024 as in the previous year.
"The pace of growth, which is outstanding by international standards, will be driven by domestic 
demand."
"The Middle East is expected to be spared the effects of the global economic slowdown in 
2024."
"Cuts in oil production quotas by OPEC+, comparatively robust growth in Asia's most important 
markets, and strategies to diversify trade and investment should support regional growth."
"However, 
geopolitical risks in the region are increasing and the ongoing conflict shows no signs of easing."
"Procurement market trends
In 2024, we expect a further correction on important raw materials and packaging markets, driven by 
increased capacity."
"However, inflationary pressure on production costs is set to remain high, influenced 
by energy, labor, and higher borrowing costs."
"A key uncertainty factor is the ongoing critical 
macroeconomic situation, which, not least due to the conflict in the Middle East, has effects on the 
important commodity markets."
"Sales market trends
After a year of strong market growth, we expect a continued positive trend in the Consumer Business 
Segment in 2024, albeit at a significantly lower level than in the previous year."
"The environment will 
remain uncertain given the economic situation and major political volatility."
"With continued high 
commodity prices, the declining but still high inflation rates, and stretched consumer budgets, the 
market faces constant challenges."
"The expectation of an inflationary environment with the growing risk 
of a global recession remains."
"Price rises to offset increased product costs are not anticipated on the 
same scale as in 2023."
"We therefore expect more moderate growth for 2024, driven chiefly by 
continued strong demand in the skin care categories and in the emerging markets along with North 
America."

For tesa, we expect business to remain volatile in 2024."
"In Europe and North America, we are planning 
cautiously but expect less positive momentum for our business in 2024 than we saw in the previous 
year."
"We expect moderate growth in Asia, with Southeast Asia in particular becoming ever more 
important as a growth market."
China will remain a centrally important market.
"Consumer sentiment, the 
declining but still high inflation in Europe, the performance of the global automotive market, and our 
rather modest expectations for the electronics industry will heavily influence developments."
"Our market opportunities
Despite a still fraught global geopolitical situation, there are signs that inflationary pressure will weaken 
in 2024 after the very high levels seen in 2023."
"Lower commodity and logistics prices are set to be the 
main drivers of this easing, while wage costs will continue to rise."
"Overall, a recovery in the world 
economy is expected in 2024."
"We see ourselves as well positioned in the Consumer Business Segment 
and expect our growth to outperform the market with our large proportion of products for everyday 
use."
"A focus on skin care products, strong innovations, and implementing our sustainability and digital 
strategy will continue to drive growth."
"We will build on our sound financial structure and strong earnings position together with our dedicated 
employees to continue exploiting future opportunities with our internationally successful brand 
portfolio."
"Extensive research and development activities resulting in successful, consumer-driven 
innovations will be flanked by targeted marketing measures, creating enduring confidence among our 
consumers."
"For tesa, expected growth for the coming year is slightly above the global market trend."
"This applies to 
business with both end consumers and industrial customers."
"The close collaboration with the 
electronics industry in Asia remains positive; however, its project-based nature continues to entail a 
high risk of volatility."
"tesa expects to bolster its market position with ongoing investment in product and 
technology development and the expansion of its innovative product portfolio."
"Business development
The described challenges in large areas of the world result in a high degree of uncertainty with regard 
to the outlook for sales markets and our business development."
"Independently from the development of the skin care market, we will continue to achieve above-market 
sales growth."
We expect further improvement of the global skin care market in 2024.
"Based on this, we 
expect organic sales growth in the mid-single-digit range in the Consumer Business Segment."
"The EBIT 
margin from ongoing operations (excluding special factors) in the Consumer Business Segment will be 
50 basis points above the previous year level."
"Subject to the same uncertainty regarding market development in 2024, we also expect sales growth 
above the market in the tesa Business Segment."
"Based on this, we expect organic sales growth in the 
low-to-mid-single-digit range."
"The EBIT margin from ongoing operations (excluding special factors) will 
be on the level of previous year."
"Based on the forecasts of the two business segments, Group organic sales growth is expected to be in 
the mid-single-digit range."
"We expect the consolidated EBIT margin from ongoing operations 
(excluding special factors) to be slightly above the previous year’s level."

accessible to the public on the company’s website at www.beiersdorf.com/declaration_of_compliance."
"Granted long-term variable remuneration components shall be accessible to Executive 
Board members only after a period of four years."
"At the same time, the remuneration system generates incentive for the 
Executive Board to pursue and achieve the goals defined in the company’s business strategy."
"In addition, the long-term variable remuneration components are in principle accessible to Executive 
Board members only after a period of four years."
"Under the remuneration system that applied until 
2021, long-term variable remuneration was linked to the period of appointment of Executive Board

the end of 2024."
"Beiersdorf is also aware of its social and environmental responsibility 
and ensures that its business strategy, sustainability agenda, and operational decisions take this into 
account."
"The German Corporate Governance Code (the Code) ensures transparency with respect to the legal 
framework for corporate management and supervision and contains accepted standards for good,

continuous control, monitoring, and development of the compliance management system and

and environmental impacts are avoided."
"Beiersdorf was early to recognize the importance of 
responsible action and has continuously worked to improve its sustainability."
"Today, sustainability is a core component of Beiersdorf’s C.A.R.E.+ business strategy."
"As part of the 
strategy, the Consumer Business Segment has been pursuing the CARE BEYOND SKIN sustainability 
agenda since 2020."
"This is oriented on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 
comprises seven focus fields that illustrate our key areas of impact along the entire value chain."
"We 
have set ambitious targets in all these areas for 2025 and 2030."
"At tesa, too, sustainability is firmly enshrined in the business strategy."
"The framework for this is formed 
by five strategic action areas for which tesa has defined long-term targets for the period through 2030."
"These fields extend across the business segment’s entire value chain and are as follows: Reduction of 
Emissions, Responsible Sourcing, Use of Recycled and Bio-based Materials, Circularity and Reduction of 
Waste, and Enable Sustainability at our Customers."
The tesa and Consumer Business Segments committed to a joint climate target in 2020.
"This is in line 
with science-based reduction targets designed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and has 
been validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative."
"This information can be found in this 
Annual Report in the combined Non-financial Statement of the Beiersdorf Group (Consumer and tesa 
Business Segments) and Beiersdorf AG in accordance with §§ 289b (3) HGB in conjunction with 315b 
(1) and (3) HGB (CSR report)."
"Human Resources policies
Beiersdorf’s success hinges to a large extent on the hard work, skills, and commitment of its employees."
"More than 20,000 people all around the world contribute to this success every day by putting their 
specialist expertise, commitment, and ideas into practice in their field."
"In doing so, they act as an important stimulus for improvements and innovations."
"All of Beiersdorf’s human resources decisions are guided by the Core Values, which are 
shared by all employees across hierarchies, functions, and countries."
"In this context, Beiersdorf aims to promote a working environment where employees can be deployed 
and continually developed to make the best possible use of their skills and potential."
"Beiersdorf expects 
managers to motivate their employees to achieve top performances."
"Instilling excellent leadership skills 
in the management team is key to this."
"This encourages employee commitment and helps Beiersdorf 
establish itself as one of the most attractive employers in the consumer goods industry."
"tesa is an expert for adhesive technology, offering its customers innovative solutions and outstanding 
service."
"The company’s success is materially attributable to the skills of its employees and their 
willingness to continuously develop them further."
"Qualified employees who contribute actively to 
helping us extend our position as one of the leading companies in adhesive technology are the key to 
the successful implementation of our business strategy."
"This is why our human resources strategy is 
oriented toward winning and retaining well-trained, committed employees for our company and 
continually increasing our great attractiveness as an employer through appropriate measures."

Risk management at Beiersdorf AG and the Beiersdorf Group is an integral part of central and local 
planning, management, and control processes, and conforms to consistent standards across the Group."
"Our open communications policy, the risk inventory carried out at regular intervals, and the planning 
and management system ensure that our risk situation is presented transparently."
"Further information can be found in the “Risk Report” section of this Annual Report and in the Annual 
Report of tesa SE."
"Corporate boards
Beiersdorf AG is governed by German stock corporation, capital market, and codetermination law, 
among other things, as well as by its Articles of Association."
"The company has a dual management and 
supervisory structure consisting of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as is customary in 
Germany."
"The Annual General Meeting of the shareholders is responsible for taking fundamental 
decisions for the company."
"These three bodies are all dedicated in equal measure to the good of the 
company and the interests of all shareholders."
"Supervisory Board: Composition and working practices
Beiersdorf AG’s Supervisory Board consists of 12 members."
"The most recent regular 
election took place in fiscal year 2019."
"The regular term of office of all current Supervisory Board 
members will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting resolving on the approval of their 
activities for fiscal year 2023."
"Starting from the new election of the shareholder representatives to the 
Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting in 2024, their regular term of office will be reduced 
to four years; as in the past, the Annual General Meeting will elect the members on an individual basis."
No former Executive Board members of Beiersdorf AG currently serve as Supervisory Board members.
"The Supervisory Board and Executive Board work closely together for the 
good of the company and to achieve sustainable added value."
"In accordance with the bylaws for the 
Executive Board, certain decisions of fundamental importance are subject to Supervisory Board 
approval."
"The bylaws for the Supervisory Board are available on the company’s website at 
www.beiersdorf.com/bylaws_supervisory_board."
The Supervisory Board regularly makes decisions at its meetings on the basis of detailed documents.
"The Supervisory Board members may also participate in the meetings via conference calls or video 
conferencing."
"The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Executive Board to discuss 
Executive Board and Supervisory Board matters along with strategy, planning, and business 
performance."
"In principle, the auditor’s presentations on the audit of the financial statements are also 
held without the Executive Board."
"Meetings are regularly discussed in advance, partially by the 
employee and shareholder representatives separately."
"The Supervisory Board is informed in a regular, 
timely, and comprehensive manner about all relevant matters."
"In addition, the Chairman of the 
Executive Board informs the Chairman of the Supervisory Board regularly and in a timely manner 
(including between meetings) about important transactions and liaises with him on important decisions."
The bylaws provide rules to ensure the supply of high-quality information from the Executive Board.
"The 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work of the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings, 
and represents the interests of the Supervisory Board externally."
"Within reason, he discusses 
Supervisory Board-related topics with investors."
"The Supervisory Board regularly evaluates, including with the help of an external consultant, how 
effectively the Board and its committees are performing their tasks and decides on measures to 
improve this performance (efficiency audit and self-assessment)."
"The Supervisory Board again 
conducted a self-assessment in 2023 with the support of an external consultant."
"This began by using 
questionnaires and interviews to analyze the work of the full Board and committees and the 
cooperation between Supervisory Board and Executive Board."
"The analysis included a comparison with 
other companies."
"The results of these analyses and other considerations formed the topic of further 
interim discussions and Supervisory Board meetings."
Various key topics were discussed in depth.
"The members of the Supervisory Board ensure that they have sufficient time at their disposal to fulfill 
their duties and are personally responsible for ensuring they receive the necessary training and further 
education."
Reasonable costs for this purpose are reimbursed by the company.
"The company provides 
them with support, such as in the form of internal training events on topics relevant to Supervisory 
Board work and information on changes in legislation and other developments."
"Training events were 
held in fiscal year 2023 on the topics of sustainability as well as diversity and inclusion."
"New members of 
the Supervisory Board benefit from thorough onboarding meetings and information materials."
The latter are also explained to the members after every new election of the Supervisory Board.
"According to its profile of skills 
and expertise the Supervisory Board members must collectively possess the knowledge, skills, and 
professional experience required to properly perform the Board’s duties."
"The objectives and profile of 
skills and expertise form part of the diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory Board."
"They 
apply until the end of 2024 and will be taken into account in future proposals for election as they have 
been in the past."
"The Supervisory Board to be newly elected in 2024 will again engage with the 
objectives, profile of skills and expertise, and diversity policy."
"International focus
All members of the Supervisory Board must be open to the company’s international orientation."
"At least 
four members should embody this in concrete terms and should therefore have particular international 
experience due to their activities abroad or their background, for example."
"At least three members on 
the shareholder side should have international experience."
"Gender diversity
The Supervisory Board’s goal is to further strengthen the number and position of women on the 
Supervisory Board and to maintain a target of at least four female members."
"At least two women should 
be shareholder representatives."
"As a listed company subject to codetermination on a basis of parity, the 
Supervisory Board needs to be comprised of at least 30% women and 30% men under § 96 (2) AktG."
"Regular limits on age and length of membership
According to the Supervisory Board bylaws, members should normally retire at the Annual General 
Meeting following their 72nd birthday, and at the latest after a term of office of 20 years."
"The goal for 
the Supervisory Board’s composition is that different age groups are adequately represented."
"The term 
of office of each Supervisory Board member is disclosed on the company’s website at 
www.beiersdorf.com/boards."
"Independent focus
The Supervisory Board should include what it considers to be an appropriate number of independent 
members on the shareholder side; it should take into account the ownership structure."
"It further considers 
whether they have a material business relationship with the company or a dependent company – either 
directly, or as a shareholder, or in a position of responsibility at a non-Group company – or has had such 
a relationship in the year preceding the member’s appointment."
"It also takes into account whether the 
member has a close relative on the Executive Board or has been a Supervisory Board member for more 
than 12 years."
"Considering the fact that Beiersdorf AG is a dependent company within the meaning of § 17 (1) AktG, 
the Supervisory Board considers it to be adequate if at least three of its members on the shareholder 
side are independent."
"Members of the Supervisory Board must resign their office if faced with material and not 
merely temporary conflicts of interest."
"Where involvement of the Supervisory Board is not already 
required by statutory law, material transactions between the Group and members of the Supervisory 
Board and their related parties require the approval of the Supervisory Board and must comply with the 
standards customary in the sector."
"Profile of skills and expertise
The Supervisory Board ensures that its members collectively have the knowledge, skills, and 
professional experience needed to properly perform their duties."
"In addition to the concrete objectives 
for its composition, the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of skills and expertise setting out the 
particular personal and professional skills and expertise required."
"Diversity officers
Two Supervisory Board members have been appointed as diversity officers in order to develop the 
targets further and promote diversity on the Supervisory Board: Frédéric Pflanz and Prof. Manuela 
Rousseau."
"They also support the Company’s HR work on diversity issues, which includes 
working with the Personnel Committee."
"There are currently five female Supervisory Board members in total: Prof. Manuela 
Rousseau and Kirstin Weiland as employee representatives, and Hong Chow, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, and 
Dr. Dr. Christine Martel as shareholder representatives."
"The statutory gender quota for the Supervisory 
Board’s composition has therefore been fulfilled."
"Currently, 42% of Supervisory Board members are 
women and 58% are men."
"On the employee side, 33% of members are women and 67% are men, while 
on the shareholder side women and men each make up 50% of the members."
"In addition to their 
particular professional skills, all the shareholder representatives embody the idea of international 
orientation by virtue of their background or extensive international experience."
"Currently, at least three 
of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are independent."
"The Supervisory Board 
assumes, as a precautionary measure, that a Supervisory Board member belonging to the controlling 
shareholder should not be regarded as independent."
"Among the shareholder representatives, at least the following active members are independent from 
the controlling shareholder: Hong Chow, Uta Kemmerich-Keil, and the Chairwoman of the Audit 
Committee, Dr. Dr. Christine Martel."
"Recommendation C.9 sentence 1 of the Code, under which a 
Supervisory Board consisting of more than six members should have at least two shareholder 
representatives who are independent of the controlling shareholder, is therefore complied with."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board believes that all shareholder representatives are independent of the 
company and Executive Board."
"This also applies to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and 
Presiding Committee, Prof. Dr. Reinhard Pöllath, despite the fact that he has served on the Supervisory 
Board for more than 12 years."
"Moreover, given his 
length of service, there are no circumstances in his specific case that might cause a material and not 
merely temporary conflict of interests."
"Dr. Dr. Christine Martel, who has been a Supervisory Board 
member since April 2012, will not be standing for election at the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"Going 
beyond the Code’s requirements, the Supervisory Board believes that all employee representatives are 
independent within the meaning of the Code."
"This applies to Prof. Manuela Rousseau, despite her 
length of service on the Supervisory Board of more than 12 years."
"She will not be standing for election 
in 2024."
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Wolfgang Herz have currently already exceeded the 
regular age limit of 72."
"In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and another Supervisory 
Board member, Prof. Manuela Rousseau, have exceeded the regular term of office."
"Given their 
knowledge and experience, the Supervisory Board has decided to make reasonable exceptions for 
these members from the regular limits on age and length of membership."
"The regular limits on age and 
length of membership and the rules governing potential conflicts of interest were otherwise complied 
with."
"All members of the Supervisory Board also fulfill the necessary personal competence 
requirements for their tasks."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board members are collectively familiar with the 
sector in which the company operates."
"The current implementation of the profile of skills and expertise 
is set out in the qualification matrix below; this shows that each area of the profile of skills and expertise 
is covered by at least one member."

"Executive Board: composition and working practices
The Executive Board manages the company on its own responsibility and conducts the company’s 
business."
"It is obliged to act in the company’s best interests and is committed to increasing its 
sustainable enterprise value."
"It performs its management duties as a collegiate body with collective 
responsibility."
The members of the Executive Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board.
"As a rule, Executive 
Board members are initially appointed for a maximum of three years."
"The duties of the Executive Board 
are broken down by functions and regions."
"The schedule of responsibilities constitutes part of the 
bylaws for the Executive Board."
"The Executive Board develops the corporate goals and the Group’s strategy, agrees them with the 
Supervisory Board, ensures their implementation, and regularly discusses their implementation status 
with the Supervisory Board."
"It is responsible for managing and monitoring the Group, for corporate 
planning including annual and multi-year planning, and for preparing the quarterly statements, the half-
year reports, and the annual and consolidated financial statements."
"It is also responsible for Group 
financing."
"In addition, the Executive Board is responsible for ensuring internal control and risk 
management that is commensurate with the business activities and risk situation and that also covers 
the sustainability-related goals relevant to the company."
"This also includes a compliance management 
system tailored to the risk situation, through which the Executive Board particularly ensures that 
statutory provisions and internal corporate guidelines are observed and works toward ensuring that 
Group companies abide by them (compliance)."
"A description of the principles of this system and a 
statement on its adequacy and effectiveness can be found in the “Risk Report” section and in the “Non-
financial Statement” in this Annual Report."
"The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with 
regular, timely, and comprehensive reports on all questions that are of relevance for the company, 
particularly also regarding sustainability, and explains discrepancies between the actual course of 
business and the planning and targets."
"Certain Executive Board measures and transactions that are of 
particular significance for the company require the approval of the Supervisory Board or its committees."
"The Executive Board passes resolutions in regular meetings that are chaired by the Chairman of the 
Executive Board."
"The members of the Executive Board work together in a collegial manner and inform 
one another on an ongoing basis about important measures and events in their areas of responsibility."
"Executive Board members disclose potential conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay 
and inform the other members of the Executive Board."
"Where involvement of the Supervisory Board is 
not already required by statutory law, material transactions between the Group and members of the 
Executive Board and their related parties require the approval of the Supervisory Board and must 
comply with the standards customary in the sector."
"Sideline activities also require the approval of the 
Supervisory Board."
"The company has taken out a D&O insurance policy for the members of the Executive Board that 
provides for a deductible in the amount of 10% of any damage incurred, up to one-and-a-half times the 
fixed annual remuneration of the Executive Board member concerned."
"Diversity policy and succession planning, targets for the proportion of women on the Executive Board 
and at senior management levels
The Supervisory Board has discussed the diversity of the Executive Board in detail in recent years, both 
in a general sense and in specific cases."
"With Astrid Hermann, Nicola D."
"Lafrentz, and Grita Loebsack, 
the proportion of women on the Executive Board currently stands at 43%."

The Supervisory Board continues to seek appropriate representation of women on the Executive Board 
in the course of any membership changes."
"It is planned to support this aim using various measures, and 
especially through clearly communicating a commitment to promoting women in leadership positions, 
providing systematic personal development measures for women in management (e.g."
"training 
courses, coaching, mentoring), changing recruitment and appointment processes, and establishing and 
promoting networking opportunities for women."
"Additionally, two Supervisory Board members have 
been appointed as diversity officers in order to advance and promote diversity on the Executive Board 
(currently Frédéric Pflanz and Prof. Manuela Rousseau)."
"Before the appointment of an Executive Board 
member, the diversity officers give their view together with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board after 
consulting the remaining Supervisory Board members."
"Among other things, the Personnel Committee 
works on the diversity policy for the Executive Board, including the manner of its implementation."
"Another aspect of the diversity policy is that the Executive Board members should collectively have 
extensive relevant international experience from their years of working abroad or their special expertise 
in Beiersdorf’s key international markets."
"The bylaws for the Executive Board stipulate that the members 
of the Executive Board should not normally be aged more than 63 years."
"All incumbent members of the 
Executive Board met these criteria in the reporting year."
"The full Supervisory Board and/or the 
Personnel Committee will consider further diversity-related criteria for the composition of the Executive 
Board if it regards them as appropriate and expedient."
The Supervisory and Executive Boards together ensure long-term succession planning.
"The Personnel 
Committee in particular discusses succession planning (including the remuneration structure) on a 
regular basis, taking into account the company’s management planning."
"In 2023, the Personnel 
Committee worked with the Executive Board particularly on the topics of talent management, 
succession planning (including recruitment and development), the diversity strategy (including KPIs), 
HR planning, and the organization of the HR department."
"In practice, succession planning works on the 
basis of a group of potential successors chosen from the two most senior management levels below the 
Executive Board by the Executive Board member for Human Resources in consultation with global 
management teams."
"Succession 
planning is also incorporated into target-setting for the Executive Board’s variable remuneration."
"The Executive Board also takes diversity aspects into consideration when appointing senior executives 
in the company, particularly with regard to ensuring an appropriate degree of female representation."
"With the Beiersdorf Gender Parity Ambition announced back in March 2021, Beiersdorf is committed to 
achieving gender parity across all management levels below the Executive Board (management levels 
1–4) in the Consumer Business Segment by 2025 at the latest."
"This gender parity was achieved earlier 
than planned: As of September 2023, 50.3% of management positions worldwide were held by women."
"With the global goal of a gender balance at management level, the Executive Board’s strategy for 
promoting women at Beiersdorf aims to have a growing number of female candidates for senior 
management positions and the Executive Board."
"Beiersdorf continues to offer special programs for 
female talents to bring more women into leadership positions."
"These programs focus on a combination 
of personal and organizational modules."
"Beiersdorf works with external partners to integrate relevant 
expertise and to help create the right climate for sustainable change on this issue."
"To ensure equal 
opportunities, Beiersdorf also focuses on removing obstacles that could prevent equal career 
advancement."
"At 
year-end 2023, the proportion of women was 39.3% at the first management level and 41,9% at the 
second management level."

"Beiersdorf AG is included in the consolidated financial statements of maxingvest GmbH & 
Co KGaA, the (ultimate) parent company of the Group."
"The activities of Beiersdorf AG and its affiliates (“Beiersdorf Group”) consist primarily of the manufacture 
and distribution of branded consumer goods in the area of skin and body care, and of the manufacture 
and distribution of technical adhesive tapes."
"The consolidated financial statements of Beiersdorf AG for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 
31, 2023, were prepared by the Executive Board on February 7, 2024, and subsequently submitted to 
the Supervisory Board for examination and approval."
"All 
IFRSs and IFRICs endorsed by the European Commission and required to be applied as of December 
31, 2023, were applied."
The consolidated financial statements were prepared using the historical cost convention.
"Exceptions to 
this rule relate to financial instruments assigned to the categories “at fair value through other 
comprehensive income” (FVOCI) and “at fair value through profit or loss” (FVPL), and derivative financial 
instruments, which are all measured at fair value."
The consolidated income statement was prepared using the cost of sales method.
"Estimates and assumptions
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions to a limited extent that affect the amount and presentation of recognized assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses, and contingent liabilities."
"Such estimates and assumptions reflect all 
currently available information."
"Furthermore, estimates and assumptions are made in particular when determining 
the useful lives of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, and when measuring 
inventories."
"Other non-financial aspects, such as climate risks, do not currently have a significant impact on the 
planned cash flows used in the impairment tests."
Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.
"Changes to estimates are recognized in profit or loss 
when more recent knowledge becomes available."
"Consolidation principles
Acquisition accounting uses the purchase method, under which the cost of the business combination is 
allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and identifiable liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed, measured at their fair values at the acquisition date."
"The cost of an acquisition is the sum of 
the consideration transferred, measured at fair value at the acquisition date, and the non-controlling 
interests in the acquiree."
"For each business combination, the non-controlling interests in the acquiree 
are measured either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets."
"Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer’s interest in the net fair values of 
identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities is recognized as goodwill."
"Costs incurred in the 
course of the business combination are recognized as an expense."
"Profit and equity of subsidiaries attributable to non-controlling interests are presented separately in the 
consolidated income statement and as a component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet."
"Losses at a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in a negative 
balance."
"In the case of successive purchases of the shares of subsidiaries, the difference between the 
cost of the new shares and the non-controlling interests previously recognized in the Group for these 
shares is recognized in other comprehensive income."
"In a business combination achieved in stages, the 
effects from acquisition-date fair value remeasurement of previously held equity interests in the 
acquiree are recognized either directly in equity (FVOCI) or in the income statement (FVPL), depending 
on their classification."
"Subsequent adjustments of contingent consideration are recognized in the 
income statement."
"All intercompany balances, transactions, income, and expenses, and gains and losses on intragroup 
transactions that are contained in the carrying amounts of assets are eliminated in full."
"The consolidated financial statements include Beiersdorf AG and the subsidiaries over which it has 
control within the meaning of IFRS 10."
"Control over an investee exists if Beiersdorf AG has direct or 
indirect power over the investee, is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, 
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee."
"Currency translation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros."
"The euro is Beiersdorf AG’s 
functional and presentation currency."
"Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are rounded to millions of 
euros (€ million)."
Each company in the Group defines its own functional currency.
"As the foreign 
subsidiaries operate as financially, economically, and organizationally independent entities, their 
functional currency is always the local currency."
"The items contained in the financial statements of the 
company concerned are measured using this functional currency."
"Foreign currency transactions are 
initially translated at the spot rate at the transaction date."
"Non-monetary items that are measured at cost 
in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the transaction date."
"Exchange differences 
arising from the translation of monetary items are recognized in profit or loss."
"Monetary assets and 
liabilities in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the closing rate."
"ANNUAL REPORT 2023

At the balance sheet date, the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is 
not the euro are translated into euros at the closing rate."
"Income and expenses are generally translated 
at average exchange rates for the fiscal year."
"Exchange differences arising from this are recognized as a 
separate component of equity."
"Changes in accounting policies
There were no material effects from the first-time application of new standards or interpretations in 
fiscal year 2023."
"OECD Pillar Two model regulations
The Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model regulations."
"The Ultimate Parent Entity 
(UPE) is maxingvest GmbH & Co."
"The Pillar Two legislation was adopted in 
Germany and will enter into force on January 1, 2024."
"As the Pillar Two legislation was not yet in force at 
the reporting date, the Group is currently not subject to any tax burden in this respect."
"The Group 
makes use of the exemption from the recognition of deferred taxes in connection with Pillar Two 
income taxes, which was the subject of the amendment to IAS 12 published in May 2023."
"According to the Pillar Two legislation, the Group must pay an additional tax per country in the amount 
of the difference between the GloBE effective tax rate and the minimum tax rate of 15%."
"Based on an 
average effective tax rate calculated in accordance with IAS 12.86 for all constituent entities of the 
maxingvest Group, the effective tax rates for the following countries are below 15%: Costa Rica, Croatia, 
Philippines, Switzerland and Taiwan."
"Considering the allocation of a possible supplementary tax, the Beiersdorf Group has a notional burden 
in a range between €1 million and €2 million."
"Due to the complexity regarding the application of the legislation and the calculation of GloBE income, 
the quantitative effects cannot yet be reliably estimated."
"Although the average effective tax rate in 2023 
in the above-mentioned jurisdictions is below 15%, the Group may not have to pay Pillar Two income 
taxes."
"On the one hand, this may be due to safe harbor regulations."
"On the other hand, Pillar Two

legislation provides for specific adjustments that result in deviations from the effective tax rates 
calculated in accordance with IAS 12.86."
"Even for companies with an effective tax rate of over 15%, 
Pillar Two could therefore trigger tax implications."
"The IASB has also revised or issued further accounting standards and interpretations that must be 
applied in future."
"However, these will have no material effects on the consolidated financial statements."
"Material accounting policies
Sales are recognized when goods and products are delivered, and control has transferred to the 
customer."
"Discounts, customer bonuses, and rebates are deducted from sales, as is consideration 
payable to trading partners in those cases in which the consideration is not matched by a distinct 
product or service supplied whose fair value can be estimated reliably."
"The probability of returns is 
reflected in the recognition and measurement of sales."
"Cost of goods sold comprises the cost of internally produced goods sold and the purchase price of 
merchandise sold."
"The cost of internally produced goods includes directly attributable costs such as the 
cost of direct materials, direct labor, and energy, as well as production overheads, including 
depreciation of production facilities."
"The cost of goods sold also includes write-downs of inventories 
and operating expenses for distribution centers and freight shipments to customers."
"Marketing and selling expenses comprise the costs of sales and marketing departments, expenditure 
on advertising, retail (point of sale) marketing, and similar items."
"This item also includes write-downs of 
trade receivables."
Research costs are recognized in profit or loss for the period.
"Development costs for new products are 
capitalized if the recognition criteria laid down in IAS 38 are met."
"This is normally not the case, as the 
expected future economic benefits cannot be measured reliably as long as the products are not market 
ready."
"Other development costs (e.g., for information systems) are capitalized as intangible assets if 
the recognition criteria laid down in IAS 38 are met."
"Once capitalized, they are amortized using the 
straight-line method over their expected useful lives."
"Purchased intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and software are measured at cost."
"The 
carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets are reduced by straight-line amortization over their 
expected useful lives."
"The useful lives, residual values, and amortization methods are reviewed 
regularly."
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.
"Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least once a year; such 
impairment tests are only conducted for finite-lived intangible assets and property, plant, and 
equipment if there are indications of impairment."
"An impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss if 
the recoverable amount of the asset is lower than its carrying amount."
"Recoverable amount is identified 
separately for each asset."
"If an asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent from 
other assets, recoverable amount is identified on the basis of a group of assets designated as the cash-
generating unit."
Recoverable amount is the higher of net realizable value and value in use.
"Net 
realizable value is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm’s length transaction, less 
the costs of disposal."
"Value in use is calculated on the basis of estimated future cash flows expected to 
arise from the continuing use of an asset and its disposal at the end of its useful life, using the 
discounted cash flow method."
"Cash flows are derived from the business plans and reflect current 
developments."
"They are discounted to the date of the impairment test using capitalization rates for 
equivalent risks."

If the reasons for an impairment loss recognized in previous years no longer apply, the impairment loss 
(except for goodwill) is reversed up to a maximum of amortized cost."
"With the exception of lease right-of-use assets, property, plant, and equipment is carried at cost and 
reduced by straight-line depreciation over the assets’ expected useful lives."
"The useful lives, residual 
values, and depreciation methods are reviewed annually."
"Interest 
on borrowings is recognized as a current expense unless it relates to the production of qualifying 
assets."
"Repair and maintenance costs for property, plant, and equipment are also expensed as incurred."
"Substantial renewals or enhancements that materially increase production capacity or significantly 
extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized."
"Components that were previously capitalized in this 
way and replaced by new measures to be capitalized are recognized accordingly as disposals."
Government grants reduce the cost of acquisition or production.
"Right-of-use assets from leases are reported within property, plant, and equipment."
"A lease exists if a 
contract entitles the Group to use an identifiable asset for an agreed period of time in return for 
payment."
"At Beiersdorf, leases relate primarily to office space and vehicles."
Lease liabilities are reported within financial liabilities.
"They are recognized at the inception of the 
lease at the present value of the lease payments not yet made."
"Discounting is generally determined 
using term- and currency-specific incremental borrowing rates."
Lease right-of-use assets are recognized at cost at the commencement of the lease term.
"The cost of the 
right-of-use asset comprises the present value of the total expected lease payments less lease 
incentives received, initial direct costs, and restoration obligations."
"Subsequent measurement is at 
amortized cost."
Depreciation is on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
"The term of the lease commences on the date that the asset is made available for use and includes any 
rent-free periods."
"The exercise or non-exercise of these options is only factored into the lease term if it is 
reasonably certain to occur."
"The leasing standard is not applied to rights held by a lessee under license agreements within the 
scope of IAS 38."
"In addition, Beiersdorf has exercised the option not to recognize low-value and short-
term leases on the balance sheet and is instead continuing to treat these as operating expenses over 
the term of the lease."
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
"Net realizable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale."
"The cost of inventories is measured using the average cost 
method."
"In addition to direct costs, production costs include a proportionate share of material and

production overheads as well as production-related depreciation."
"It also includes the proportionate 
costs of company pension arrangements and voluntary social benefits, as well as production-related 
administrative expenses."
"Cash comprises bank balances, cash-on-hand, and checks."
"Cash equivalents are short-term liquid 
investments that can be converted into a specified amount of cash at any time and are exposed to no 
more than insignificant fluctuations in value."
"In accordance with IFRS 9, cash and cash equivalents are 
designated as AC."
"Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is to be 
recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use."
"Non-current assets 
and disposal groups held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell (level 3) if the value is 
lower than the carrying amount."
"The fair value less cost to sell is generally determined on the basis of 
(ongoing) purchase price negotiations with potential buyers."
"The prerequisite for the classification as held for sale is that the assets and disposal groups can be sold 
in their current condition and that their sale is highly probable."
"The sale must be considered within one 
year from the date of classification."
"Before any assets are reclassified to assets and disposal groups held 
for sale, the relevant measurement rules for the balance sheet item are applied for the last time."
"After 
classification, depreciation is no longer recognized for the assets."
"Any expense resulting from the 
application of the above valuation principles in connection with the write-down to fair value less costs to 
sell is recognized under other operating expenses."
"Financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial 
liability of another entity."
"Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on initial 
recognition after deduction of transaction costs if not assigned to the FVPL category."
"Trade receivables 
are stated at the transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15."
"Categories of financial assets under IFRS 9
The “at amortized cost” (AC) category comprises financial assets whose cash flows consist of interest 
and principal payments and that are held as part of a business model that aims to collect contractual 
cash flows."
"Following initial recognition, they are valued at amortized cost less any impairment losses 
using the effective interest method."
"The “at fair value through other comprehensive income” (FVOCI) category comprises financial 
assets whose cash flows consist of interest and principal payments and that are held as part of a 
business model that generally aims to hold the assets but also allows them to be sold if required."
"These 
assets are measured at fair value."
"The resulting changes in value are recognized in a separate reserve in 
other comprehensive income."
"Upon disposal or impairment of these financial assets, the cumulative 
gains and losses recognized in equity are recognized in profit or loss."
"This category also includes equity 
instruments for which the one-time option to recognize changes in fair value directly in equity has been 
irrevocably exercised."
"Subsequent changes in value remain in equity upon disposal or impairment and 
are not reclassified to the income statement."
"The “at fair value through profit or loss” (FVPL) category comprises financial assets that do not fall 
under the other categories."
These assets are measured at fair value.
"The resulting changes in value are 
recognized in the income statement."
Financial assets are tested for impairment as of each reporting date.
"Under IFRS 9, a risk provision is 
recognized based on the expected credit losses over the next 12 months (expected loss model)."
"The 
estimate is based on ratings and continuously updated risk indicators."
"Current CDS spreads and the 
issuers’ bond spreads are also used in the calculation."
"Impairment of financial assets is immediately 
recognized in profit or loss."
"A simplified process for determining impairment is 
used for assets that do not contain a significant financing component (e.g., trade receivables)."
"In this 
approach, expected credit losses over the entire lifetime of the financial instruments are determined."
"The estimated impairment on receivables is based primarily on the results of previous payment 
behavior and reflects the age structure, any substantial deterioration in creditworthiness, or a high 
probability of debtor insolvency, as well as changes in the political and macroeconomic environment."
"Given the very short terms (e.g., due on demand) and the creditworthiness of our contractual partners, 
no impairment is identified based on expected credit losses for financial assets such as cash and cash 
equivalents."
"Financial liabilities are carried at amortized cost (AC) using the effective interest method after their 
initial recognition."
"Gains and losses resulting from amortization using the effective interest method and 
from derecognition of liabilities are recognized in profit or loss."
"Liabilities with remaining contractual 
maturities of more than one year are classified as non-current."
"In accordance with IFRS 9, derivative financial instruments used for hedges are not assigned to a 
separate category; within the Beiersdorf Group, they are subsumed under “derivative financial 
instruments” (DFI)."
"Financial assets and financial liabilities are derecognized when control of the contractual rights is 
lost, when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled, or when it has expired."
"Liabilities in connection with reverse factoring agreements are not subject to any substantial 
modification of the contractual terms and therefore continue to be accounted for as trade accounts 
payable."
"The payments made are subsequently shown in the statement of cash flows as cash flows from 
operating activities."
"The Beiersdorf Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage current and future currency 
risks."
The instruments concerned are mainly currency forwards.
"Derivative financial instruments are 
recognized at fair value."
"They are reported in the balance sheet in other financial assets or other 
financial liabilities."
"The recognition of changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments depends on whether 
these instruments are used as hedging instruments and meet the criteria for hedge accounting under 
IFRS 9."
"If the criteria are not met despite the existence of an economic hedge, changes in the fair values 
of derivative financial instruments are recognized immediately in profit or loss."
"The effectiveness of the 
hedge relationship is assessed using the critical terms method."
Derivatives classified as fair value hedges are measured at their fair value.
"Any resulting changes in fair 
value are recognized in profit or loss."
"The carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted for 
the changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk."
"Gains or losses resulting from changes in fair 
value are recognized in profit or loss for the period."
"For derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments that qualify for hedging 
accounting as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value is recognized in 
other comprehensive income, net of the related tax effect."
"The ineffective portion is recognized in profit 
or loss."
"When the hedged item (underlying) is settled, the effective portion is also recognized in profit 
or loss."
"The fair value of financial instruments is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."
The price is measured using the assumptions that market participants would base pricing on.
"Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits comprise the provisions for defined 
benefit plans within the Group."
Obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method.
"The 
expected benefits are spread over the entire length of service of the employees."
"The actuarial 
computation of the pension provisions is based on market rates of interest as well as projected wage/
salary and pension increases, and staff turnover trends."
"Measurement is performed using the relevant 
local inputs."
"In Germany, the mortality rate was based on Heubeck’s 2018 G mortality tables, while 
international rates were based on locally recognized mortality tables."
"The various discount rates used 
are based on the yields of high-quality corporate bonds with appropriate maturities and currencies and 
a minimum of an AA rating."
Actuarial reports are prepared annually.
"All assumptions are reviewed for 
appropriateness at each reporting date."
"The amount recognized as a provision comprises the total present value of the defined benefit 
obligation less the fair value of plan assets available for immediate settlement of obligations."
"If the fair 
value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation, net assets are only 
recognized up to the amount of the asset ceiling."
"Past service cost is recognized as a component of EBIT in line with the principle of functional allocation, 
while net interest income is recognized in the financial result."
"Actuarial gains and losses resulting from 
changes in actuarial assumptions and deviations between earlier actuarial assumptions and actual 
developments, as well as from changes in the return on plan assets, are recognized immediately and in 
full under retained earnings in consolidated equity."
"They are not recognized in profit or loss later on, 
but rather remain in consolidated equity."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, contributions are made on a statutory, contractual, or 
voluntary basis to public or private pension insurance plans."
"The Group does not have any other 
payment obligations above and beyond the contributions."
"The contributions are recognized in profit or 
loss as a component of EBIT."
"Other provisions take account of all identifiable future payment obligations, risks, and uncertain 
obligations of the Group resulting from current legal or constructive obligations arising from past 
events where the amount of the obligation can be measured reliably."
"Such other provisions are mainly 
due within one year."
"Non-current provisions expected to be settled after more than one year are 
discounted insofar as the interest effect is material."
"Current income tax assets and liabilities for current and prior periods are recognized at the expected 
amount."
"The tax rates and tax legislation enacted at the reporting date are used to calculate the 
amount."
"Deferred taxes are 
measured using the balance sheet liability method on the basis of the tax rates expected to be enacted 
in the individual countries when the temporary differences reverse."
"These rates are based on the 
legislation in force at the balance sheet date."
"No deferred taxes are recognized for differences arising 
on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities that are not the result of business combinations, affect 
neither accounting or taxable profit and do not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences."
"Deferred tax assets in respect of temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards, and tax credits are 
recognized where it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in future periods against 
which they can be utilized."
Recognized deferred taxes are tested for recoverability every year.
"Income 
taxes relating to items recognized in other comprehensive income are not recognized in the income 
statement but in other comprehensive income."
"Net cash flow from operating activities is determined using the indirect method, while net cash flows 
from investing and financing activities are determined using the direct method."
"Cash funds are composed of cash and cash equivalents that can be converted into cash at any time and 
that are exposed to no more than insignificant fluctuations in value."
"Notes to the Segment Reporting
Segment reporting in the Beiersdorf Group is based on the management of business operations."
"The 
breakdown of the Group into the Consumer and tesa Business Segments reflects the internal 
organizational structure and the reporting to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"The Beiersdorf Group measures the success of its segments on the basis of organic sales growth and 
operating result (EBIT), adjusted for non-recurring, non-operating transactions (EBIT, excluding special 
factors) in conjunction with the corresponding EBIT margin."
"In order to show the global breakdown of business activities in the Beiersdorf Group, information on the 
geographic regions is presented in addition to the operating segments."
"The external sales shown for 
the regions are based on the domiciles of the respective companies."
"Group companies domiciled in Germany generated sales of €1,450 million in 2023 (previous year: 
€1,419 million) and reported non-current assets (not including financial instruments, deferred taxes, 
and plan assets) of €1,577 million (previous year: €1,492 million)."
"Organic sales growth is the nominal sales growth adjusted for exchange rate effects and structural 
effects from acquisitions and divestments."
"EBIT excluding special factors represents the operating result (EBIT), adjusted for non-operating one-
off business transactions."
"EBITDA represents the operating result (EBIT) before depreciation, amortization, and impairment 
losses."
"The EBIT margin on net operating capital is the ratio of the operating result (EBIT) to net operating 
capital."
"Gross cash flow is the excess of operating income over operating expenses before any further 
appropriation of funds."
"Net operating capital of €3,757 million (previous year: €3,444 million) consists of gross operating 
capital less operating liabilities."
"In the year under review, three new companies were included in the consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, three companies were wound up and one company was sold."
"Beiersdorf AG’s shareholdings

and/or voting rights."
"Significant acquisitions
The purchase price allocation of S-Biomedic was finalized in fiscal year 2023."
"This did not result in any 
significant changes."
"The cash-generating unit for S-Biomedic was defined as a group of companies 
through which marketing takes place in the individual markets and thus the cash flows are generated."
No acquisitions were made in the course of the fiscal year 2023.
"Significant divestments
With effect from June 30, 2023, Beiersdorf CEE Holding GmbH sold its shares in the subsidiary 
Beiersdorf Daily Chemical (Wuhan) Co., Ltd."
"for a consideration of €27 million The subsidiary most 
recently held leasehold land (including buildings), the sale of which was the reason for the sale of the 
shares."
"The assets sold as part of the sale of the shares were most recently classified as non-current 
assets held for sale and recognized accordingly."
"The result from the sale of the company totalling 
€11 million is fully allocated to special factors."
There were no other significant divestments in the Group in the reporting year.
"A breakdown of 
sales and their development can be found in the management report, the segment reporting, and 
regional reporting."

in the amount of €11 million.
"Income from 
the reversal of provisions resulted, among other things, from provisions for personnel, litigation risk and 
other provisions that were not required."
"These mainly include €15 million for the reversal of provisions 
for performance-related purchase price components in connection with the acquisition of Chantecaille 
in fiscal year 2022."
"Other income includes income from the reversal of deferred liabilities 
that are not required as well as valuation allowances on receivables and other non-periodic income."
"Furthermore they include income of €24 million from insurance benefits relating to the technical

Goodwill and intangible assets
The carrying amounts of goodwill decreased by €181 million compared with the previous year to 
€585 million (previous year: €766 million)."
"The year-on-year change is mainly attributable to impairment losses recognized at the Chantecaille 
cash-generating unit."
"Goodwill after impairment amounted to €300 million (previous year: €473 million) 
for the Chantecaille cash-generating unit."
"The change in goodwill of Chantecaille compared to the 
previous year is due to the impairment of €157 million and currency effects."
"Goodwill in the Consumer 
Business Segment also includes goodwill of €162 million (previous year: €168 million) in the North 
America cash-generating unit and goodwill of €63 million (previous year: €59 million) attributable to 
Beiersdorf AG (Switzerland)."
The change versus the previous year was attributable to currency effects.
"Indefinite-lived intangible assets mainly include acquired trademarks from the acquisition of the 
Coppertone business amounting to €188 million (previous year: €188 million)."
"The trademarks of 
€188 million (previous year: €188 million) are established in their markets and will continue to be 
advertised in the future."
They therefore represent indefinite-lived intangible assets.
"Trademarks and customer relationships identified as part of the acquisition of Chantecaille were 
classified in their entirety as finite-lived intangible assets and will be amortized over their useful lives."
"As 
of the reporting date, the carrying amount was €59 million (previous year: €70 million)."
"Impairment tests were performed as of December 31, 2023, on the goodwill as well as indefinite-lived 
intangible assets recognized for all relevant cash-generating units."
"The indefinite-lived intangible assets 
relate to the Maestro trademark in China."
"Forecast cash flows were used to calculate value in use in 
order to determine the recoverable amount."
"The main estimates on which the impairment tests were based included market shares and rates of 
sales growth, price trends for commodities, gross profit margins, and corresponding discount rates."
The detailed planning anticipates moderate sales growth and a typical EBIT margin for the Group.
"Estimated future cash flows 
were based on financial planning with a five-year horizon."
"Cash flows beyond the planning period were 
extrapolated using an individual growth rate taking into account external macroeconomic and business-
specific factors."
"Beyond the planning horizon, this growth rate (terminal growth rate) was assumed to be 
1.0% (previous year: 1.0%) for North America and Switzerland and 2.5% (previous year: 2.5%) for 
Chantecaille."
This is due to growth in the selective cosmetics market.
"The weighted pre-tax discount 
rate used to discount the estimated cash flows was 7.8% for North America (previous year: 6.9%), 5.1% 
for Switzerland (previous year: 5.0%), and 9.2% for Chantecaille (previous year: 8.3%)."
"In fiscal year 2023, an impairment loss on goodwill of €157 million (€160 million including currency 
translation effects) arising from the Chantecaille cash-generating unit was recognized; this amount is 
attributable to the Consumer Business Segment."
"The carrying amount of the Chantecaille cash-

generating unit amounted to €608 million at that time."
"The need to recognize an impairment loss arises 
primarily from the unfavorable trend in the capital charge and a change in assumptions in the financial 
planning of the Chantecaille cash-generating unit."
"The change in assumptions in the financial planning 
of the Chantecaille cash-generating unit is derived from the overall market trend in China and the 
performance of the travel retail business in South Korea, as well as the delayed entry into the Chinese 
market."
The impairment losses were recognized in other operating expenses.
"Brand rights and 
customer relationships were subject to regular amortization of €8 million (previous year: €8 million)."
"In the nie wieder bohren GmbH cash-generating unit, the declining, but still positive, market trend and 
the resulting subdued cash flow expectations meant that the impairment test gave rise to an 
impairment loss of €4 million on goodwill."
"The impairment loss arising from the impairment test was 
recognized in other operating expenses and is attributable to the tesa Business Segment."
"Due to the persistently increased competitive pressure as well as rising procurement prices and the 
associated poorer expected cash flows in the tesa Twinlock B.V."
"cash-generating unit, the impairment 
test showed an impairment of goodwill amounting to €5 million on the assets remaining after the cash 
price allocation and allocated to the cash-generating unit; the associated goodwill had been written 
down in full in fiscal year 2022."
"The impairment loss required to be recognized was allocated to the 
assets on the basis of their relative fair values."
"The impairment is attributable to the tesa Business Unit 
and recognized under other operating expenses."
"The impairment tests for the other cash-generating units did not reveal any need for impairment of 
goodwill or trademarks in the reporting year."
"The 2023 fiscal year was affected by high inflation, especially in the first half of the year, and this eroded 
the purchasing power of private households and caused the central banks to raise key interest rates 
sharply."
"A slight recovery was, however, noticeable in the course of the year."
"The supply-side 
bottlenecks increasingly lost significance, but persistently high energy prices, as well as the conflicts in 
Ukraine and the Middle East had an adverse effect on the global economy."
"With regard to the global 
economy, we are affected in particular by the subdued economic performance in China, which had an 
unfavorable impact, especially on the travel retail business."
"For fiscal year 2024, we are still anticipating 
a decline in the global economy, with a slow recovery toward the middle of the year, which will have a 
positive influence on interest rates and therefore also on consumer spending."
"The effects described 
above and the associated uncertainties were examined for the impairment tests as part of a sensitivity 
analysis."
"For the impairment tests, sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of the above 
developments."
"If we increased the weighted cost of capital by 1% in isolation, the impairment loss 
required to be recognized on the Chantecaille cash-generating unit would rise by €62 million."
"If only 
the long-term growth rate was reduced by 1%, the impairment loss required to be recognized would be 
€49 million higher."
"If only the 1% reduction in the long-term EBIT return was considered, the 
impairment loss required to be recognized would increase by €15 million."
"A 1% decline in the medium-
term growth rate would lead to a €16 million increase in the impairment loss required to be recognized."
"For all other cash-generating units, the Group assumes that the recoverable amount will exceed the 
carrying amount of the goodwill, even in the event of reasonably possible changes in the key 
assumptions used in impairment testing."

plans."

included in the costs of the respective functions."

transfer of pension benefits in the year under review."

connection with a one-time benefit introduced by the sponsoring companies of the TROMA foundation 
for the existing pensioners and future retirees."

Switzerland, and the United States."

Provisions for Pensions and Other Post-employment Benefits
(in € million)
Dec."
"These are primarily obligations in relation to retirement pensions, disability pensions, and 
surviving dependents’ pensions granted as a supplement to the statutory pension insurance."
"Pension 
commitments in Germany largely consist of direct and indirect commitments by Beiersdorf AG and 
direct commitments by tesa SE."
"The benefits depend on the employees’ length of service and their 
average salary over the three years immediately preceding the date on which the pension becomes 
payable."
"The pension payments to the beneficiaries are adjusted for inflation by at least 1% per annum; 
this is performed annually in some cases or at the latest every three years."
Defined benefit obligations are funded exclusively by employer payments.
"Although there is no 
minimum funding requirement in Germany, both Beiersdorf AG and tesa SE have transferred plan 
assets to a separate entity."
"Beiersdorf AG has transferred plan assets to an entity with the legal form of a foundation (TROMA 
Alters- und Hinterbliebenenstiftung, Hamburg)."
"The board of trustees of the foundation is composed of 
representatives of the company and of the Group Works Council."
"The board of trustees is responsible 
for setting and implementing the investment strategy."

as necessary in light of the latest developments."

agreement (CTA)."

Works Council sets the investment strategy."
"Portfolio performance and the current situation are 
analyzed at regular intervals and, where necessary, the investment strategy is amended to reflect 
changed conditions."
"To mitigate the risk of changes in capital market conditions and demographic developments, the old 
pension plans were closed to tesa employees in 2005 and to Beiersdorf employees in 2008."
"Employees 
joining the companies after this date can join employee-financed benefit plans."
"Under these plans, they 
can save part of their pensionable pay and also receive an employer contribution."

invested and managed by independent trustees via a CTA."

on contributions of 3.25% per annum until retirement."

"The provisions for marketing and selling expenses 
relate in particular to cooperative advertising allowances and other marketing- or customer-related 
obligations."
"The 
miscellaneous provisions relate to a wide variety of matters and companies and also include provisions 
for restructuring."
"The performance-related purchase price components resulting from the Chantecaille 
acquisition are also reported under other provisions."

Current Liabilities
(in € million)
Dec."
"At €156 million (previous year: €111 million), other current 
liabilities are largely unchanged in amount and composition."
"As the current liabilities have remaining 
contractual maturities of less than 12 months as of the reporting date, their carrying amounts at the 
balance sheet date correspond approximately to their fair value."
"As part of its strategic supplier 
management, Beiersdorf offers selected suppliers around the world the opportunity to participate in a 
supply chain financing program."
"Once participating suppliers invoice Beiersdorf, Beiersdorf posts the 
invoices on a bank platform so that the participating suppliers have the opportunity to sell these 
invoices to the organizing bank and thus generate a faster cash inflow."
"Beiersdorf does not know to 
what extent this option to sell the receivables be used, and Beiersdorf does not incur any costs as a 
result."
"Beiersdorf considers this liability as part of its working capital management and, since Beiersdorf 
has no knowledge of whether the respective supplier has sold this receivable to the organizing bank, 
Beiersdorf continues to classify this liability as a trade payable."
"Liabilities to participating suppliers 
totaled €127 million (previous year: €149 million) at the reporting date."
"The average payment term for 
these liabilities was 102 days."

"These are allocated to 
the “at fair value through other comprehensive income” (FVOCI) category."

During 2023, Beiersdorf sold bonds with a book value of €330 million from the “at amortized cost” (AC) 
category."
"This resulted in a loss of €3 million, which is recognized within “Other financial result.”
Financial instruments that are not measured at fair value predominantly have remaining contractual 
maturities of less than 12 months as of the reporting date."
"Therefore, their carrying amounts at the 
balance sheet date correspond approximately to their fair value."
"Securities belonging to the “at 
amortized cost” (AC) category are an exception."
"The fair values for this item have been assigned to fair 
value hierarchy Level 1."
"Risk management principles
As a result of its operations, the Beiersdorf Group is exposed to various risks such as currency risk, 
interest rate risk, and default risk."
"These risks are countered by active treasury management based on a 
global directive."
They are managed and hedged centrally to a very large extent.
"Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge the operational business and material financial 
transactions."
The transactions are conducted exclusively with marketable instruments.
"IFRS 7 requires 
sensitivity analyses, which show the effects of hypothetical changes in relevant risk variables on profit or 
loss and equity, to be used in presenting market risk."
"For the Beiersdorf Group, this mainly relates to 
currency risk."
"The effects are ascertained by applying the hypothetical changes in risk variables to the 
portfolio of financial instruments as of the balance sheet date."
"It is assumed that the portfolio at the 
reporting date is representative for the full year."
"Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk of fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument as a 
result of changes in exchange rates."
"Currency risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 arises through monetary financial instruments that are 
reported in a currency other than the functional currency."
"Exchange rate differences arising from the 
translation of financial statements of affiliates into the Group currency are not included."
"Relevant risk 
variables are therefore basically all non-functional currencies in which financial instruments are held by 
the Beiersdorf Group."
"As a result of the Beiersdorf Group’s international orientation with an emphasis 
on the eurozone, the euro serves as the key currency."
"Consequently, the Beiersdorf Group is exposed 
to risks through financing measures and operational activities when other currencies fluctuate against 
the euro."
"As a matter of principle, currency risks relating to cross-border intragroup financing are hedged 
centrally in full and at matching maturities using currency forwards (fair value hedges)."
"Owing to these 
hedging activities, the Beiersdorf Group is not exposed to any significant currency risks in its financing 
activities as of the balance sheet date."
"Gains and losses on these currency forwards are offset in full by 
gains and losses on the hedged items."
"With regard to operations, a majority of cash flows in non-functional currencies in the Beiersdorf Group 
are generally hedged for the next 12 months using standard currency forwards."
"These transactions are 
recorded, measured, and managed centrally in the treasury management system."
"As a result, the 
Beiersdorf Group is not exposed to any significant currency risks in its operations as of the balance 
sheet date."
"Since material non-derivative financial instruments are either denominated directly in the functional 
currency or transformed into the functional currency through the use of derivatives, changes in the 
exchange rate do not have any material effects on profit or loss or equity."
"Changes in market prices largely affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair values of 
the hedging transactions."
"The fair value of the currency forwards at the balance sheet date was €13 million (previous year: 
€33 million), and their notional value was €2,167 million (previous year: €1,712 million)."
"Currency 
forwards with a market value of €2 million have a remaining maturity of more than one year; the 
remaining forward contracts have a remaining maturity of up to one year."
"In the previous year all 
contracts had a remaining maturity of under one year."
"The notional values represent the aggregate of 
all purchase and selling amounts for derivatives."
The notional values shown are not netted.
"If the euro had appreciated by 10% against all currencies as of December 31, 2023, the fair values of 
the currency forwards recognized directly within the hedging reserves in equity would have increased 
by €62 million (previous year: €42 million)."
"If the euro had depreciated by 10%, the fair values of the 
currency forwards recognized directly within the hedging reserves in equity would have decreased by 
€73 million (previous year: €49 million)."
"An appreciation of the euro by 10% would have decreased the 
value of currency forwards not included in a hedging relationship by €4 million within financial result."
"A 
corresponding decrease in the value of the euro by 10% would have increased the financial result by 
€7 million."
"Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument may fluctuate 
as a result of changes in market interest rates."
"Beiersdorf has only a small volume of non-current financial instruments that are not measured at 
amortized cost and does not have any interest rate derivatives."
"Changes in fair values are therefore of 
no more than minor significance for the Beiersdorf Group."
"These are subject to interest rate risk within 
the meaning of IFRS 7 for the entire fiscal year."
"If the interest rates at the quarter-ends of the fiscal year had been 100 basis points higher (lower) in 
each case than the yield curve, the financial result would have been €10 million (previous year: 
€5 million) higher (lower)."
"This would have had no impact on accumulated other comprehensive 
income within equity."
"Default risk
The Beiersdorf Group is exposed to default risk within the Scope of its financing activities and in its 
operations."
"The maximum default risk can be seen from the carrying amount of each financial asset 
recognized in the balance sheet."
"The total carrying amount of the financial assets was €6,829 million as 
of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €6,724 million)."
The simplified process is used for determining impairments on trade receivables under IFRS 9.
"In this 
approach, expected credit losses over the entire lifetime of the financial instruments are determined."
"Expected losses are estimated based on analyses of historical defaults and the age structure of the 
receivables as well as current economic developments and an assessment of the credit quality of 
individual customers."
"Given that historical and expected default rates are low, the impairments did not have a material impact 
on assets or equity."
"We counter the risk of bad debts through detailed monitoring of our customer 
relationships, active receivables management, and the selective use of trade credit insurance."
"Potential default risks relating to the investment of the Group’s liquid funds are limited by only making 
investments with counterparties deemed reliable."
"Counterparty risk is monitored on the basis of ratings 
and the counterparties’ liable capital, as well as continuously updated risk indicators."
"We have invested the majority of our liquidity in low-risk investments (such as government and 
corporate bonds)."
"Impairments based on expected credit losses over the next 12 months are recognized on securities 
measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"The estimate is 
based on ratings and continuously updated risk indicators."
"Current CDS spreads and the issuers’ bond 
spreads are also used in the calculation."
These belong to the “at amortized cost” category.
"Given the very short terms (e.g., due on 
demand) and the creditworthiness of our contractual partners, no impairment was identified based on 
expected credit losses."
"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated 
with its financial liabilities."
"As a result of the large amount of cash and cash equivalents as well as 
securities held as of the balance sheet date, the Beiersdorf Group is not currently exposed to any 
liquidity risk."
"Additionally, in order to ensure the liquidity and financial flexibility of the Beiersdorf Group 
at all times, liquidity reserves are maintained in the form of credit lines."

year to €182 million (previous year: €140 million)."
"Lease expenses in 2023 include expenses for short-term leases of €27 million (previous year:

expenses from variable lease payments of €10 million (previous year: €6 million)."
"Total cash outflow for 
leases in 2022 was €108 million (previous year: €102 million)."
"The future cash outflows from extension options, whose future exercise was not taken into account in 
the measurement of the lease liabilities due to the lack of reasonable certainty amount to around 
€98 million (previous year: €104 million)."
"Legal risks
The claim for damages from the liquidator of Schlecker e."
"following closed antitrust proceeding by 
the Bundeskartellamt, which has been pending since 2016, was rejected by the courts of first and 
second instance."
"Upon a complaint against denial of leave to appeal by the plaintiff, the appeal was 
granted without reasoning by the Federal Court of Justice (BGH)."
"The BGH overturned the appeal 
judgment and referred the case back to the second instance for a new decision."
"The proceedings are 
also directed against six other companies."
"The claim for compensation, which involves joint and several 
liability of all defendants, amounts to approximately €200 million plus interest."
"Decisions on other 
claims for damages made in and out of court in connection with this concluded antitrust proceeding are 
pending."
"In one of these proceedings, the Schleswig-Holstein Higher Regional Court issued an 
indicative court order in which it provided indications on the concretization of a possible damage."
Beiersdorf contests these claims.
"The state of São Paulo is demanding retroactive tax payments of €86 million (previous year: €77 million) 
from our Consumer Business Segment’s Brazilian affiliates for the years 2005 to 2009."
"This amount has 
increased from the previous year owing mostly to interest and changes in the exchange rate."
"State tax 
authorities allege that VAT on imports should have been paid in São Paulo state instead of the Brazilian 
state of landing."
All cases are in financial court proceedings.
"The Brazilian tax authorities also issued additional, in our view unjustified, 
VAT demands on at least a similar scale in relation to various matters."
"Our affiliates are appealing these 
claims through official processes."
"The Brazilian courts are not expected to reach a definitive decision in 
any of these cases for several years."
"The Group has provisions of €30 million (previous year: €27 million) 
for these cases."
Some of our affiliates are currently undergoing tax audits.
"In accordance with IFRIC 23, disputed tax 
items have been recognized with their most probable cash outflow."
"In one case, a liquidation loss that 
had been recognized was not accepted for tax purposes by the tax authorities in Austria."
"We filed 
appeals against the tax notices for the affected years."
"We are convinced that our view will prevail in 
legal proceedings."
"However, a final decision cannot be expected for several years."
"A final non-
recognition of the tax-deductible loss would reduce Group profit by approximately €57 million 
(previous year: €47 million)."
"In addition, some of our affiliates are currently undergoing customs audits."
"The Group has recognized 
provisions of €10 million (previous year: €12 million) for the risks resulting from these audits."
"Assessments of the course and results of legal disputes as well as tax and customs audits are associated 
with considerable difficulty and uncertainty."
"Results that differ from our expectations may have an effect 
on the amount of the recognized costs and provisions or liabilities."
"As of the balance sheet date, we 
assume, based on the currently available information, that no further significant charges for the Group 
are to be expected."

"In accordance with the German legal 
requirements we have not audited the components of the group management report stated in the 
annex."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,
• the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant 
to Sec."
"In all material respects, this Group Management Report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and suitably presents the 
opportunities and risks associated with the company’s future performance."
"We have not issued an 
audit opinion on the components of the Group Management Report referred to in the Annex."
"322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations 
relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report."
"Basis for the audit opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report 
in accordance with Sec."
"317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014, referred to subsequently 
as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial 
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in 
Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in 
the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the Group entities in 
accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and 
we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"We believe that 
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on 
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"Considerations payable to 
trading partners are also deducted from revenue in those cases in which the consideration is not 
matched by a distinct product or service supplied and its fair value can be estimated reliably."
"Auditing of the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods and 
products was therefore one of the key audit matters."
"Auditor’s response
As part of our audit, we examined the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial 
statements of Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft for the recognition of revenue from the sale of goods and 
products using the criteria defined in IFRS 15."
"In addition, 
we analyzed the calculation of still expected returns of goods and products and their deduction from 
sales revenue by comparing the plan and actual figures for the assumptions made in previous years, 
taking into account the contractual agreements made with customers."
"To prove the existence of sales 
revenue, we performed, among other things, an examination with the aid of data analyses to establish 
whether it led to the recognition of trade receivables and whether these receivables were in turn settled 
by payments received."
"We examined postings in December 2023 which involved large amounts 
compared with the average for the year in order to determine whether there were irregularities in 
respect of the accruals principle."
"Our audit procedures did not give rise to any reservations in respect of the recognition of revenue from 
the sale of goods and products."
"Auditor’s response
As part of the audit, we obtained an understanding of the Beiersdorf Group’s processes for assessing 
tax and customs law risks."
"As part of these processes, the executive directors of Beiersdorf 
Aktiengesellschaft regularly engage external tax experts to provide professional statements on 
individual matters."
"We also examined the 
correspondence with the competent tax and customs authorities and the latest status of ongoing 
appeal proceedings and court cases."
"We also evaluated the information in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements of Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft on current and deferred income taxes and risks from import 
sales taxes and customs duties."
"Our audit procedures did not give rise to any reservations in respect of the recognition of current and 
deferred income taxes or the accounting treatment of risks from import sales taxes and customs duties."
"3) Legal disputes in connection with concluded antitrust proceedings
Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter
In October 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft by the insolvency 
administrator of Anton Schlecker e."
"i.I., Ehingen (Donau), seeking damages in connection with 
German antitrust proceedings concluded in 2013."
"In addition to Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, the 
lawsuit was also filed against six other companies."
"The total value of the claim filed jointly and severally 
by the insolvency administrator of Anton Schlecker e."
"i.I., Ehingen (Donau), against all defendants 
amounts to approximately 200 million euros plus interest."
"This lawsuit was dismissed by the court of first 
instance in fiscal 2018 and by the court of second instance in fiscal 2020, without the possibility to 
appeal to Germany’s Federal Court of Justice (BGH), the country’s supreme court."
"The insolvency 
administrator of Anton Schlecker e."
"i.I., Ehingen (Donau), has filed appeal against this denial of leave 
to appeal with BGH against the judgment rendered by the court of second instance."
"In response to the 
plaintiff’s appeal against the denial of leave to appeal, the BGH granted leave to appeal without stating 
any reasons in January 2022."
"The BGH granted the appeal against the denial of leave to appeal, 
reversed the decision by the court of second instance, and referred the case back for a new hearing."
"In 
connection with the aforementioned concluded antitrust proceedings, further domestic and foreign 
customers of the Beiersdorf Group filed claims for damages against companies of the Beiersdorf Group 
in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively, or asserted claims for damages out of court."
"The “pass-on rate” corresponds to the percentage 
extent to which price increases by suppliers were passed on to customers."
"Auditor’s response
We obtained an understanding of the Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft’s processes for assessing legal 
risks."
We obtained confirmations from the external lawyers commissioned by Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft.
"We critically examined and evaluated these confirmations, supplementary internal documentation of 
Beiersdorf Aktiengesellschaft, and the indicative court order to ascertain whether there were possible 
changes from the original risk assessment and in the calculation of possible damages."
"We also evaluated the professional 
qualifications, skills and objectivity of the external expert."
"In addition, our audit procedures involved 
assessing the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Beiersdorf 
Aktiengesellschaft on the legal risks arising from the damages claims filed."
"Our audit procedures did not give rise to any reservations in respect of the accounting treatment of the 
legal risks arising from legal disputes in connection with antitrust proceedings already concluded."
"The 
assumptions about the long-term development of the underlying contributions to earnings, in 
particular, are subject to discretion and have a material influence on the outcome of the impairment test 
on the goodwill of the Chantecaille Group (cash-generating unit)."
"Given the lack of observable inputs, 
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is always determined on the basis of value in use 
using the discounted cash flow model."
"In 2023, general economic performance in China, Chantecaille’s delayed entry into the Chinese 
domestic market, and the trend in the travel retail business in South Korea in particular had a negative 
impact on the planned cash inflows of the Chantecaille Group in the relevant evaluation period."
"Furthermore, the capital market interest rates relevant for determining the discount rate, and therefore 
the weighted cost of capital, increased overall."
"These developments resulted in the need to recognize a 
material impairment loss in the fiscal year."
"Audit procedure
As part of our audit, we evaluated the methodology applied to conducting the impairment test against 
the background of the appropriate rules in IAS 36 with the involvement of internal valuation experts."
"A random comparison of historical planning data with 
actual results was carried out to assess planning accuracy."
"Furthermore, we reconciled the budget plans 
approved by the Executive Board with the assessments presented to us."
"In addition, we obtained an 
understanding of the mathematical accuracy of the valuation model used."
"With respect to the recoverability of the goodwill of the Chantecaille Group, we assessed the 
composition of the carrying amounts of the cash-generating unit for completeness, in particular using 
the criteria defined in IAS 36."
"Furthermore, we performed an audit of the calculation of the carrying 
amounts of the cash-generating unit and its inclusion in the consolidated financial statements."
"We also 
audited the comparison of the recoverable amount to the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit."
"Further, we examined the disclosures in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding 
the goodwill impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 with respect to the requirements resulting from 
the IFRS rules."
"Our audit procedures did not give rise to any reservations regarding the recoverability of the goodwill 
of the Chantecaille Group."
"Other information
The Supervisory Board is responsible for its own report."
"The executive directors and the Supervisory 
Board are responsible for the declaration on the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance 
with Sec."
"161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which is part of the Group’s Corporate 
Governance Statement, and for the remuneration report in accordance with Sec."
"The 
executive directors are responsible for the remaining other information."
"Other information comprises 
the components of the group management report stated in the annual report."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not 
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of 
assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, on the basis of the activities that we have performed, we conclude that there has been a material 
misstatement of this other information, we are obliged to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in 
this respect."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting 
based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or 
to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements and the Group Management Report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the 
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 
respective opinions."

our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be 
able to continue as a going concern."

statements, its conformity with the law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in 
the group management report."
"We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on 
the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will 
differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned 
scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in 
internal control that we identify during our audit."
"We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the 
relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters 
that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and where applicable, related 
safeguards."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and 
are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or

Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of 
Historical Financial Information” issued by the IAASB."

"The auditor has examined whether the 
remuneration report contains the information required in accordance with § 162 (1) and (2) AktG."
The auditor’s report is included in this remuneration report.
"On April 13, 2023, the Annual General Meeting approved the remuneration report for fiscal year 2022, 
which was prepared and audited in accordance with § 162 AktG, with a majority of approximately 76% of 
the votes cast."
"Following the 2023 Annual General Meeting, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board 
have again given very careful consideration to the comments made to the company by investors with 
regard to the remuneration system and the 2022 Remuneration Report."
"Wherever the Supervisory Board 
and Executive Board deemed it reasonable and appropriate, they have been taken into account in the 
preparation of this remuneration report."
"In addition, the remuneration system is to be aligned with the 
further development of the business strategy."
"Therefore, it was decided to make changes to the Executive 
Board remuneration system starting from the 2025 fiscal year and to submit the new system to the 2025 
Annual General Meeting for approval."
The revision of the remuneration system has already begun.
"Remuneration of the Executive Board
The Supervisory Board is responsible for setting the remuneration of the members of the Executive Board."
"It addressed the structure and appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration, as well as individual 
remuneration questions, at its meetings on February 3, 2023, February 21, 2023, April 13, 2023, May 26, 
2023, and December 1, 2023."
"On February 5, 2024, the Supervisory Board determined the remuneration 
of the Executive Board for fiscal year 2023."
"All decisions by the Supervisory Board in relation to Executive 
Board remuneration were prepared by the Presiding Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Remuneration system and process
The remuneration system for the Executive Board was revised in line with the AktG, as amended 
by ARUG II, as of January 1, 2021, and approved by the Annual General Meeting on April 1, 2021, 
with a majority of 87% of the votes cast."
"The remuneration system is published on the website at 
www.beiersdorf.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/remuneration-of-executive-board-
and-supervisory-board."
"The main elements of the remuneration system are also summarized in this 
remuneration report."
The remuneration system applies to all members of the Executive Board appointed from 2021 on.
"In accordance with the underlying legal framework, the service agreements currently in force with 
the members of the Executive Board appointed prior to 2021, in particular the long-term variable 
compensation components, are in principle unaffected."
"Nevertheless, the Supervisory Board has 
agreed in principle with serving Executive Board members that the remuneration system shall apply 
to them effective January 1, 2021."
"An enhanced remuneration system will be presented again for approval at the 2025 Annual General 
Meeting."
"The business strategy is rooted in the clear ambition to grow competitively and sustainably through 
strategic priorities and the will to create added value for people and society in the long term."
"In this 
way, Beiersdorf wants to expand its position in the skin care market and ensure sustained profitability."
"In 2023, both the short- and long-term variable remuneration therefore included 
specific performance criteria geared toward the five priorities of the C.A.R.E.+ strategy."
"Duties and performance 
of the Executive Board
The remuneration system takes into account the duties and performance of the Executive 
Board as a whole as well as of the individual members."
"Appropriateness
The structure and amount of the Executive Board remuneration reflects customary 
market practice and is competitive."
"This is ensured by means of regular benchmarking 
against the relevant peer groups."
"In addition, the remuneration for the Executive Board 
is appropriately balanced in relation to the remuneration for the company’s senior 
management and employees."
"Consistency
The remuneration system for the Executive Board and senior management create 
comparable incentives and have predominantly uniform objectives (consistency 
of the remuneration system)."
"In addition, the corporate targets for employees’ 
variable remuneration are defined on the basis of the corporate goals defined for the 
remuneration of the Executive Board."
"This ensures consistent incentives and, hence, a 
uniform control effect."
"Regulatory conformity
The remuneration system for the Executive Board is consistent with the German Stock 
Corporation Act and takes account of the recommendations and suggestions of the 
German Corporate Governance Code."
"The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the remuneration system, particularly with regard to its 
appropriateness, including in relation to comparable companies (horizontal comparison) and within 
the company in relation to senior management and the workforce as a whole (vertical comparison)."
"The review of the remuneration system is prepared by the Presiding Committee, which recommends 
any necessary adjustments to the remuneration system to the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory 
Board submits the remuneration system for approval by the Annual General Meeting in accordance 
with § 120a AktG in the event of any material change to the remuneration system and at least every 
four years."
"The Supervisory Board defines the performance criteria for all variable compensation components 
for the fiscal year ahead at the recommendation of its Presiding Committee within the framework 
of the remuneration system."
"When defining the performance criteria, the Supervisory Board also 
determines the weighting of the individual performance criteria within the specific remuneration 
component."
"For the short-term variable remuneration applicable 
in 2023, the Supervisory Board set the performance criteria in December 2022 following submission 
of the multi-year planning prepared by the Executive Board."
"After the end of the fiscal year (or, in the case of long-term variable remuneration, after the end of 
the last fiscal year of the assessment period), the Supervisory Board determines the specific target 
achievement at the recommendation of its Presiding Committee."
"For this purpose, achievement of 
the financial targets is determined in connection with the preparation and approval of the annual 
and consolidated financial statements."
"Achievement of the non-financial targets is determined 
after detailed consultation derived from a comparison of the target/actual achievement of 
individual performance criteria."
"The Supervisory Board sets the variable remuneration and the 
total remuneration for the previous fiscal year on the basis of the target achievement."
"For the 2023 
variable bonus, the Supervisory Board determined the specific target achievement at its meeting 
on February 5, 2024 (see also e) in the “Remuneration structure and elements” section below)."
"The Supervisory Board also ensures that the remuneration of the Executive Board appropriately 
reflects the company’s net assets, financial position, results of operations, and prospects for the future 
and does not exceed the customary remuneration without reason."
"In assessing appropriateness and market conformity, the Supervisory Board particularly considers 
the specific competitive situation (horizontal comparison)."
"For this purpose, the Supervisory Board 
considers relevant peer groups, which are selected on the basis of Beiersdorf’s market position 
(particularly country, sector, and size)."
"The peer groups, whose composition is disclosed in the 
remuneration system, comprise companies listed in the German DAX and MDAX equity indexes, on 
the one hand, and an international sector peer group, on the other."
"The horizontal comparison is also 
intended to ensure that the Executive Board receives competitive remuneration that conforms to 
standard market practice."
"To ensure appropriate Executive Board remuneration in conformance with standard market practice, 
the Supervisory Board also considers its relationship to the company’s internal remuneration 
structure (vertical comparison)."
"To this end, it compares the amount of the average annual target 
remuneration paid to senior management, comprising the first and second management group of 
the Consumer Business Segment in Germany below the Executive Board, with the Executive Board 
remuneration."
"Moreover, the Executive Board remuneration is compared with the amount of the 
average annual remuneration across all employees in the Consumer Business Segment in Germany 
(including senior management)."
The ratio thus determined is also reviewed over time.
"The Supervisory Board recently reviewed and confirmed the appropriateness and market conformity 
of the Executive Board remuneration in setting the specific target remuneration for 2024."
"As 
part of the current further development of the remuneration system that will apply from 2025, its 
appropriateness and market conformity will again be reviewed with the support of an external 
remuneration expert."
"Remuneration structure and elements
a) Overview
The total remuneration payable to the members of the Executive Board is composed of fixed and 
variable elements."
"The fixed remuneration, which is not tied to performance, comprises the base 
remuneration plus ancillary benefits."
"The variable remuneration is composed of a short-term variable 
bonus with annual targets (Variable Bonus) and a long-term variable bonus (LTP)."
"It may also contain a 
multi-annual bonus (MAB) that is tied primarily to the targets defined for the area of responsibility of 
that member of the Executive Board."
"In addition, the members of the Executive Board may be offered 
a reappointment bonus (may also be tied to performance)."
The LTP can be converted into a defined contribution benefit commitment (see g) below).
"Other than 
this, there are no pension commitments for the serving members of the Executive Board."
"In addition, secondment related beneﬁts may be 
granted."
"Fixed annual amount paid in 12 equal instalments at the end of the calendar 
month."
"If a member of the Executive Board is granted 
a reappointment bonus, this is generally up to 50% of the annual target total remuneration at the 
beginning of the appointment period."
"The secondment-related benefits may equal an amount of 
up to 100% of the base remuneration depending on the location (see c) below for a breakdown of 
ancillary benefits)."
"The relative shares accounted for by the other remuneration components are 
modified correspondingly in these cases."
The variable remuneration is predominantly measured over a multi-year period.
"In addition, the 
share of variable remuneration from long-term targets exceeds the share from short-term targets."
"The remuneration of the individual members of the Executive Board in 2023, including the relative 
shares of the remuneration components granted and owed (within the meaning of § 162 (1) 
sentence 2 no."
"1 AktG) is reported in the “Remuneration of the individual Executive Board members 
in 2023” section."
"b) Base remuneration
The base remuneration is a fixed annual amount paid in 12 equal installments at the end of each 
calendar month."
"If the service agreement begins or ends part way through a fiscal year, the base 
remuneration for that fiscal year is paid pro rata."
"Together with the other remuneration components, the base remuneration forms the basis for 
recruiting and retaining the highly qualified members required by the Executive Board to develop 
and implement the business strategy."
"The remuneration should reflect both the duties and 
performance of the individual Executive Board members and their skills and experience."
"c) Ancillary benefits
Each Executive Board member receives customary non-cash remuneration components and other 
ancillary benefits."
"The regular benefits may include:
•	 Provision of a company car, which may also be used for private purposes."
"In accordance with 
the Group’s “Green Car Policy,” the emissions produced by the company car must not exceed 
a certain carbon threshold."
"In lieu of a company car, a monthly “cash for car” allowance may 
also be granted."
"As a rule, this reappointment bonus is due upon the reappointment taking effect 
(“reappointment bonus”)."
"The Supervisory Board may at its own due discretion determine the structure of the reappointment 
bonus, in particular as a performance-related bonus, to which the performance criteria defined for 
the Variable Bonus (see e) below) or the MAB (see f)) apply."
"e) Variable Bonus
The members of the Executive Board receive for each fiscal year a Variable Bonus tied to the 
performance of the Consumer Business Segment, which is paid out after the Annual General Meeting 
of the year following the fiscal year in question."
"The Variable Bonus is composed of joint and individual performance criteria that are tied to 
the company’s financial and non-financial performance as well as its strategic and operational 
development."
"The joint targets are given a weighting of 70–90% and the individual targets a 
weighting of 10–30%."
"Variable Bonus
The Supervisory Board determines the selection and weighting of the individual performance criteria 
at the recommendation of the Presiding Committee for the new fiscal year."
"With respect to the total 
Variable Bonus, the individual performance criteria for the joint targets generally have a weighting of 
10–40% and the individual targets a weighting of 5–20%."
"In particular, sales is to be increased by opening up new growth markets and areas of 
business, while profitability is to be improved by means of simultaneous investments in innovations."
"Market shares are to be widened and market positions strengthened by reinforcing the global brands 
and improving consumer proximity as well as through new digital channels and technologies."
"The 
performance criteria defined in the sustainability agenda and those related to diversity also reflect – 
in line with the Core Values underlying the strategy – the responsibility that the Executive Board has 
for creating long-term value for people, the environment, and society."
"As a general rule, the targets defined for the performance criteria are based on the applicable annual 
planning."
"Similarly, measurable criteria are defined for the non-financial targets as far as possible."
"Depending on the individual case, these may be derived from the annual planning, strategic projects, 
or other activities."
"The achievement of non-financial targets is determined by comparing actual with 
target achievement."
"Individual targets
Joint non-ﬁnancial targets
Joint ﬁnancial targets
Market shares and 
position
Increase in market shares and position in the relevant categories, particularly

On this basis, the Supervisory Board defines percentage target-achievement levels for the 
components of the Variable Bonus after the end of the fiscal year."
"The following target-achievement 
levels apply:
•	 The applicable components are omitted 
if target achievement is less than 70%."
"•	 50% of the target amount defined for the 
component in question is granted for target 
achievement of 70%."
"•	 80% of the target amount defined for the 
component in question is granted for target 
achievement of 80%."
"•	 200% of the target amount defined for the 
component in question is granted for target 
achievement of 200%."
"A cap is applied to 
target achievement of above 200%."
"•	 The intermediate values are interpolated 
on a linear basis."
"Subsequently, the total target achievement for and the amount of the Variable Bonus are calculated on 
the basis of the target achievement for the individual components."
"To allow for extraordinary developments, the Supervisory Board may at its own due discretion raise or 
lower the Variable Bonus by up to 20%."
"Additionally, the members of the Executive Board are able to 
transfer bonus entitlements to the long-term variable remuneration LTP; no use was made of this option 
in 2023."
"For the 2023 Variable Bonus, the Supervisory Board set the joint and individual performance targets 
shown in the table below and, on February 5, 2024, determined the level of target achievement (also 
shown below) and resulting payment amount."
"In view of the end of the measurement period on 
December 31, 2023, the 2023 Variable Bonus was “granted” to the Executive Board members in fiscal 
year 2023, even though it is not paid out until after the 2024 Annual General Meeting."

f) Multi-annual bonus (MAB)
Under the currently still applicable remuneration system, the long-term variable remuneration for 
the members of the Executive Board may additionally include a multi-annual bonus (“MAB”)."
"The 
MAB particularly has the strategic purpose of strengthening Beiersdorf in regional growth markets 
or specific business areas."
"The performance criteria for the MAB are derived from the targets defined for the areas of 
responsibility assigned to the members of the Executive Board."
"Multi-annual bonus
Percentage target achievement is also measured in accordance with the arrangements for the 
Variable Bonus (see description for target achievement levels for Variable Bonus in e) above)."
"To 
allow for any extraordinary developments, the Supervisory Board may at its own due discretion raise 
or lower the MAB by up to 20%."
"Of the serving Executive Board members, only Ramon A."
"Mirt was offered an MAB in 2023 
(target amount: €500 thousand p.a.) for his activities in Group companies."
"This MAB relates to a 
measurement period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2024, and is calculated based among 
other things on the average annual growth rate in accordance with corporate planning in the regions 
for which Ramon A."
"Mirt is responsible and on the increase in market shares throughout his term of 
office as a member of the Executive Board."
After the end of the term of this MAB for Ramon A.
"Mirt, 
no further MAB will be granted to any member of the Executive Board."
"For Executive Board members appointed during the current LTP 2021–2024 bonus 
period, a prorated bonus period up to the end of 2024 applies."
"The LTP 2021–2024 is due for payment 
to the serving members of the Executive Board after the 2025 Annual General Meeting; the LTP 
2021–2024 for serving members of the Executive Board is therefore not “granted and owed” in 2023 
within the meaning of § 162 (1) AktG."
"Joint targets for all members of the Executive Board apply to the LTP 2021–2024 and are tied to the 
company’s strategic development."
They can be weighted individually depending on the duties involved.
"For this purpose, the Supervisory Board defines measurable non-financial or financial criteria, which 
are primarily derived from the implementation of the C.A.R.E.+ strategy and the multi-annual planning 
required to be submitted to the Supervisory Board for approval."
"of the annual business plan +/- 10%)
50%
After the expiry of the bonus period, the Supervisory Board defines the percentage target 
achievement levels between 0 and 200% for the strategic targets of the LTP 2021–2024."
"At or above 
an overall target achievement of 90%, target achievement for the aforementioned strategic targets 
is weighted with the target achievement for the performance metrics (if target achievement ≥ 100%) 
from the multi-year planning adopted in 2021."
"Nominal sales growth exceeding the market (with 
an EBIT gatekeeper of +/-10% deviation from plan) accounts for half of these performance criteria."
"Outperformance of the relevant skin care market (based on market shares and measured as net value 
added, excluding market growth and portfolio mix effects) in the Consumer categories accounts 
for the other half."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board may at its own due discretion raise or lower 
the target achievement for the LTP and the resultant bonus by up to 20% for objective reasons, 
for example in response to extraordinary developments."
"The members of the Executive Board also have the option, effective expiry of the bonus period 
in 2024, of converting all or part of the LTP into a pension commitment in the form of a defined 
contribution commitment for which a reinsurance policy can be concluded."
"The Supervisory Board has agreed on rules in this respect to prevent 
inappropriately high remuneration as a result of the LTP Enterprise Value Component and the LTP 
2021–2024."
"Under the LTP Enterprise Value Component, Executive Board members are allocated a notional 
share of the enterprise value (Base Virtual Units, BVU) at the start of their period of appointment or 
reappointment."
"For the 
Executive Board members appointed before 2017, the enterprise value is calculated as a multiple 
of sales and EBIT as reported in the consolidated financial statements."
"The increase in value is the 
increase in enterprise value from the beginning to the end of the bonus period."
"In each case, this 
is calculated as an average over three years."
"For Executive Board members appointed from 2017 
onward, the increase in enterprise value is calculated from the increase in sales from the beginning 
to the end of the bonus period, unless EBIT deviates by more than 10% from plan."
"As with the Variable Bonus, sales are adjusted for special factors."
"If applicable, EBIT is adjusted 
for, among other things, any deviations from the plan for marketing expenses as well as expenses 
for research and development compared with the start of the bonus period."
"In individual cases, 
the Supervisory Board is also entitled to make adjustments following due assessment of the 
circumstances, for instance by adjusting for special factors and inflation or by increasing or 
decreasing the LTP Enterprise Value Component for objective reasons by up to 20%."
"With the LTP Enterprise Value Component, the Executive Board members can also share in the 
enterprise’s performance by making a personal investment and acquiring Covered Virtual Units 
(CVU)."
"These are acquired by retaining bonus payments due under the Variable Bonus, by the 
Executive Board member providing collateral (e.g., by pledging a suitable asset), or by way of annual 
allotment (Bonus CVUs)."
"The Covered Virtual Units generally participate in positive and negative 
percentage changes in the value of the Enterprise Value Component; however, the Bonus CVUs only 
participate in positive changes."
"They vest immediately and are paid out in full or in part, or not paid 
out, after being adjusted on the basis of the enterprise value performance."
"For Covered Virtual Units, 
the Executive Board member may receive a further Enterprise Value Component in the same amount 
(Matching Virtual Units, MVU), corresponding to the Base Virtual Units."
"As a rule, the LTP Enterprise Value Component is limited to a maximum amount for each member of 
the Executive Board (200% cap, corresponding to around 10% p.a.)."
"This does not apply to Covered 
Virtual Units acquired through personal investment, since the Executive Board member is also 
exposed to a risk of loss in this case."
"If an Executive Board member is active for a period shorter than 
the respective member’s period of appointment, the LTP Enterprise Value Component is reduced pro 
rata."
"The LTP Enterprise Value Component is forfeited in the event that an Executive Board member’s 
contract is terminated prematurely at the request of the Executive Board member or by the company 
for good cause."
"For the serving Executive Board members in 2023, the bonus period for the offered LTP Enterprise 
Value Component is still ongoing only for Ramon A."
"Capping of the variable remuneration and maximum remuneration
The amount of all variable remuneration elements (Variable Bonus, LTP, and MAB, if granted) is 
capped at 200% of the applicable individual target amount."
"The amount of the maximum total 
remuneration is determined on the basis of this relative cap taking into account all fixed and other 
remuneration components that may be granted to a member of the Executive Board depending on 
the individual case."
"The maximum remuneration is €9 million per year for the Chairman of the Executive Board and 
€6 million per year for each ordinary member of the Executive Board."
"This maximum remuneration 
contains the amounts of the long-term variable remuneration (MAB and LTP) with an annual maximum 
value (200%) on a prorated basis, notwithstanding the fact that they are not due for payment until the 
end of the period."
"In principle, it is not possible to report on adherence to maximum remuneration 
within the meaning of § 162 (1) sentence 2 no."
"7 AktG until after the long-term variable remuneration

has been paid out."
"Retention and claw-back arrangements
The Supervisory Board has the possibility of reducing or retaining at its own due discretion the 
variable remuneration by up to 20% to appropriately take account of exceptional circumstances."
"However, this possibility is barred no later than three years after payment."
"This does not 
prejudice any other remedies that the company may have to recover damages from the member of 
the Executive Board, particularly under § 93 (2) AktG."
"The Supervisory Board did not make use of 
this possibility in 2023."
"If the member of the Executive Board resigns at his or her own instigation or for good 
cause for reasons within the respective member’s control, all claims under the long-term variable 
remuneration will lapse."
"Claims under the short-term Variable Bonus for the year of resignation will 
also lapse unless higher target achievement can be clearly demonstrated."
"There are no commitments covering the premature termination of the contract of a member of the 
Executive Board due to a change of control."
"For the duration of the post-contractual noncompete agreement of regularly 24 months, the relevant 
members of the Executive Board are entitled to claim compensation equaling half the most recently 
agreed annual base remuneration and half their short-term Variable Bonus."
"The company may 
waive enforcement of the post-contractual noncompete agreement at any time, however no later 
than six months before the termination of the contract and, in the event of the contract’s premature 
termination, also waive this six-month period."
"In this respect, no compensation may be claimed."
"The 2022 Remuneration Report reported on the specific arrangements in connection with the 
termination of the Executive Board membership of Thomas Ingelfinger and Zhengrong Liu in fiscal 
year 2022."
No members stepped down from the Executive Board in 2023.

Remuneration of the individual Executive Board members in 2023
The tables below show the individual remuneration of the serving members of the Executive Board 
in 2023."
"They show the targets along with the achievable minimum and maximum figures, which corresponds 
to “benefits granted” (“gewährte Zuwendungen”) within the meaning of the German Corporate 
Governance Code in the version dated February 7, 2017 (“2017 Code”)."
"They also show the prorated 
target remuneration (p.a.) for the annual allotments of long-term variable remuneration (MAB and LTP) 
even if the relevant bonus period/measurement period has not yet ended and they have not yet been 
paid out."
"The tables also show the remuneration granted and owed in the fiscal year within the meaning of 
§ 162 (1) sentence 1 AktG."
"Remuneration “owed” (“geschuldet”) is remuneration that is 
due but has not (yet) been received."
"Disclosing remuneration earned in the respective fiscal year 
ensures clearer, more transparent reporting and comparability of performance and remuneration 
during the reporting period."
"In particular, the Variable Bonus earned in a fiscal year can be compared 
against the results of operations for that fiscal year."
"In contrast, the LTP 2021–2024 is not shown, as its measurement period has 
not yet ended."
"The MAB and LTP Enterprise Value Component are only included if their measurement 
period ended in fiscal year 2023 or an advance was paid."
"This corresponds to “benefits received” 
(“Zufluss”) within the meaning of the 2017 Code."
The table below also shows the relative shares of fixed and variable remuneration.
"These shares also 
relate to the remuneration granted and owed in the relevant fiscal year within the meaning of § 162 (1) 
sentence 1 AktG."

"We planned and conducted our audit in such a way that, by comparing the disclosures made in the 
Remuneration Report to the disclosures required under § 162 (1) and (2) AktG, we can determine 
whether the Remuneration Report is formally complete."
"In accordance with § 162 (3) AktG, we did not 
audit the completeness of the substance of the individual disclosures or the appropriate presentation 
of the Remuneration Report."
"If, on the basis of the activities that we have performed, we conclude that there has been any such 
misrepresentation, we are obliged to report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this respect.
