Brenntag SE
Annual Report 2023
Company 
Profile
Brenntag is the global market leader in chemicals 
and ingredients distribution."
"The company holds a 
central role in connecting customers and suppliers 
of the chemical industry."
"Brenntag operates a global network of about 
600 locations in 72 countries."
"With its global work-
force of more than 17,700 employees Brenntag 
generated sales of about EUR 16.8 billion in 2023."
"On this anniversary, we can 
look back, both full of respect and with pride, on an impressive his-
tory of growth."
"Pioneering spirit, vision and a focus on our strengths 
are among the skills that have taken us from humble beginnings as 
an egg wholesaler in Berlin in 1874 to what we are today, the global 
market leader in chemical and ingredients distribution."
"Our desire 
to continually evolve and shape the future of our industry is what 
drives us and remains our inspiration."
"Our strong customer focus and close alliance with our suppliers 
were and still are essential ingredients in this success story."
"We 
never cease strengthening these foundations further."
"Whether by 
optimizing our processes and services or through a stronger focus 
on digitalization and the value inherent in our transaction data."
"On 
average worldwide, Brenntag currently receives an order every ten 
seconds."
"Every day, more than 17,700 employees put into practice 
our aspiration to be the best, the most reliable and the most flexible 
partner in the market."
"The very high level of satisfaction among our 
customers, as shown by a clear improvement in our customer net 
promoter score since 2020, is visible and reassuring proof."
"In light of the multiple geopolitical, social and macroeconomic 
challenges, Brenntag’s success is not something that could be 
taken for granted."
"Geopolitical crises, such as the wars in Ukraine 
and the Middle East, have had an adverse effect on international 
supply chains and global economic growth, while inflationary 
trends continue to place a considerable strain on costs."
"Against the 
background of the tensions that can be seen worldwide and social 
polarization, we take all the more care to ensure that our corporate 
values are put into practice."
"Brenntag stands for diversity, equity, 
tolerance and respect."
"We speak out against any form of discrimi-
nation, exclusion and hatred within our own company and beyond."
"In view of this challenging environment, Brenntag delivered a solid 
performance overall in 2023 and once again demonstrated its resil-
ience."
"We are satisfied with our financial results, even though, as 
expected, they were down on 2022, a record year."
"Brenntag gener-
ated sales of EUR 16.82 billion and operating gross profit of 
EUR 4.04 billion in financial year 2023."
"Our operating EBITA came to 
EUR 1.27 billion."
"The challenging external influences are also 
reflected in the figures of our two divisions."
"Operating gross profit 
at Brenntag Essentials came to EUR 2.53 billion."
"Operating EBITA 
stood at EUR 848.9 million in financial year 2023."
"Brenntag Special-
ties posted operating gross profit of EUR 1.48 billion."
"Operating 
EBITA came to EUR 550.8 million."
"To counter the challenging mac-
roeconomic conditions, we took measures to reduce costs, among 
other things, which had the intended effect during the second half 
of the year."
"Dear ladies and gentlemen, 
dear shareholders,

Brenntag SE
Annual Report 2023
CEO LETTER
Above all last year, Brenntag continued the transformation it initi-
ated in autumn 2020."
"We worked consistently to execute our growth 
strategy “Strategy to Win”, through which we are gradually aligning 
our two divisions more closely with global market conditions and 
customer and supplier needs."
"An important part of this strategy is 
to modernize and consistently expand our IT infrastructure and our 
digital and data basis."
"The aim is to make Brenntag a more data- 
and technology-driven company that stands out for efficiency, 
growth and excellence in all areas of the organization."
"As announced in summer 2023, we are also making further adjust-
ments to the governance and organizational structures in confor-
mity with our “Strategy to Win”, both for the Group and for the two 
Brenntag divisions."
"This will enable our divisions to have more dif-
ferentiated and market-aligned steering in accordance with their 
growth strategies and in line with customer and supplier needs."
"At the same time, we are driving 
forward the two divisions’ operational and legal disentanglement."
"Thus, we will gradually create independent, autonomous and market-­
leading businesses."
"As global market leader with an extremely resilient business model, 
a compelling growth strategy and a very robust financial profile, 
Brenntag is best positioned to consolidate the still highly-­
fragmented chemical distribution market and thus drive our growth."
"In the past year, we signed or closed eight acquisitions in focus 
industries and growth markets of strategic importance to us."
"A total 
spend of EUR 570 million on mergers and acquisitions puts us 
slightly above our planned average annual M&A corridor of EUR 400 
to 500 million which we set for 2023 and subsequent years."

Brenntag SE
Annual Report 2023
CEO LETTER
Brenntag believes that being the global leader in one’s industry also 
means playing a pioneering role in ESG (environment, social and 
governance)."
"Our top priority is to act responsibly in all three dimen-
sions of ESG."
"In the reporting period, various initiatives and new ser-
vices enabled us to increase the sustainability of our product port-
folio and give our customers more transparency over the carbon 
footprint of the products sourced from us, for example."
"Our perfor-
mance and our offering in this area have been recognized and qual-
ified by way of well-known ratings and certifications."
"In addition to 
responsibility for the environment, responsibility toward our employ-
ees is also firmly embedded in our DNA."
"We put everyone’s health 
and safety first in everything we do."
"I am therefore delighted that 
we moved another step closer to our goal of achieving a TRIR of less 
than 2.0 and preventing serious accidents completely by 2030."
"The 
TRIR continued to fall and stood at 2.5 in financial year 2023."
"This 
performance is thanks to the diverse initiatives to promote safety 
and raise employee awareness that we are always implementing 
at Brenntag."
"We were particularly pleased that we once again 
achieved third place among the DAX companies in Germany in the 
DVFA corporate governance quality ranking."
"Dear shareholders, we can look back on a long track record of suc-
cess at our company, during which we have paved the way for a 
successful future, especially in recent years."
"Here, our sincere thanks 
go to Doreen Nowotne, who stepped down from the Supervisory 
Board as scheduled at the 2023 Annual General Meeting after serv-
ing more than thirteen years on the Board, three of them as Chair."
"The continuing development of our – your – company is aimed not 
least of all at creating attractive value for you."
"Through our share 
buyback program initiated in March 2023 and now almost com-
pleted, we have acquired and withdrawn treasury shares at a total 
purchase price of EUR 750 million in two tranches."
"Since going pub-
lic in 2010, we have also reliably increased our dividend."
"This year 
too, for the thirteenth time in succession, we will propose to the 
Annual General Meeting that it be increased and a dividend of 
EUR 2.10 be distributed per share."
We will continue our track record of success.
"By continuing to con-
sistently drive our transformation and implementing and developing 
our strategy in a targeted manner."
"In addition to measures that 
ensure our two divisions’ organic growth, this also includes value-­
enhancing acquisitions."
"In the process, we will always adapt our 
decisions in line with macroeconomic and geopolitical develop-
ments."
"Time and time again during our 150-year history, we have 
proven that we turn challenges into opportunities for Brenntag and 
thus continue to grow."
"Currently, the slight, sequential signs of recov-
ery in our volumes in the second half of 2023 make us cautiously 
optimistic of a medium-term improvement in market conditions."
"We 
expect this trend to continue in 2024, but at the same time also 
anticipate that the general economic uncertainty will persist."
"Against 
this background, we expect the Brenntag Group’s operating EBITA 
for 2024 to be between EUR 1,230 million and EUR 1,430 million."
"Dear shareholders, I would like to thank you for your loyalty and your 
support."
"In this anniversary year, I again look forward to actively 
shaping Brenntag’s further success together with our employees, 
the full Board of Management, our global management team and 
the Supervisory Board."
"Brenntag on the Stock Market
Brenntag SE continued to operate in a challenging market 
environment in 2023."
"Global conditions were shaped by on­
going geopolitical uncertainties, such as the war in Ukraine 
and the Middle East conflict, slowly narrowing inflation and 
rising interest rates."
"These conditions were a cause of uncertainty in business 
activities across industries."
"The European Economic Area in 
particular saw a general reluctance to invest and a slowdown 
in economic growth."
"The global economy was more resilient 
than expected, however, and ended the calendar year 2023 
by posting slight growth of around 3.0%."
"This performance was also reflected in international capital 
markets."
"Contrary to expectations, global equity markets, 
including Germany’s leading index the DAX, have shown a sig-
nificantly better performance."
"In light of falling inflation rates 
and lower inflation expectations for 2024, the US Federal 
Reserve and the European Central Bank have recently 
refrained from raising key interest rates any further."
"These 
decisions and the hope of future falls in interest rates boosted 
capital markets and led to a rally at the end of the year."
"Thus, 
Germany’s leading index reached an all-time high of 17,003 
points in mid-December and ended the calendar year 2023 
with a plus of just over 20%."
"1.01 Brenntag share price performance in financial year 2023

1)	 Total return incl."
"Brenntag shares also delivered an 
encouraging performance versus the sector index, the STOXX 
Europe 600 Chemicals, and our listed competitors in financial 
year 2023."
"Following an exceptionally strong set of annual results for 
2022, the Brenntag Group faced a very challenging operating 
environment in 2023."
"In its forecast at the beginning of the 
year, the Board of Management of Brenntag SE had already 
indicated that the Brenntag Group’s operating earnings per-
formance in calendar year 2023 would be in line with or below 
the previous year."
"Despite this expected decline in earnings, 
the capital market rewarded the Brenntag Group’s operating 
performance, which showed an extremely high level of resil-
ience in the Brenntag Essentials division in particular."
"Although the business performance of many companies fell 
or stagnated in 2023 due to sustained inflation and subdued 
customer demand, capital markets moved in the opposite 
direction."
This was also the case at Brenntag.
"The announcement of the further steps in the company’s 
strategy, which were presented to investors and analysts at 
the Capital Markets Day 2023 in London in December, likewise 
had a positive effect."
"Among others, these include the further 
development of the operating model and the increasing inde-
pendence and autonomy of the Brenntag Essentials and 
Brenntag Specialties divisions under the Brenntag SE 
umbrella."
"In this context, Brenntag SE has already started to 
disentangle the legal entities and the operating activities of 
the two divisions."
"Starting from its annual low of EUR 60.70 on January 2, 2023, 
the Brenntag share price rose steadily over the course of the 
year and marked its annual high at EUR 83.22 on December 
29, 2023."
"This is where the Brenntag shares also closed the 
financial year."
"Share buyback program
At the beginning of March 2023, Brenntag SE announced a 
share buyback program of up to EUR 750 million."
"In an initial 
tranche between March and October 2023, Brenntag shares 
worth around EUR 500 million were repurchased."
"The treasury 
shares acquired in the course of the first tranche were with-
drawn and the share capital of Brenntag SE was reduced 
accordingly."
"In a second tranche between January and 
March 13, 2024 at the latest, Brenntag shares worth up to 
EUR 250 million will be acquired and then also withdrawn."
"Reference data on the Brenntag shares
Due to the share buyback program described above, the sub-
scribed capital of Brenntag SE decreased as at December 31, 
2023, to EUR 147.5 million (previously EUR 154.5 million)."
"The 
share capital is divided into 147,453,837 no-par value regis-
tered shares, each with a notional value of EUR 1.00."
"Since September 2021, Brenntag SE has been a member of 
the German leading index DAX; the stock market flotation 
was in 2010."
"Brenntag shares are also included in major international indi-
ces such as selected MSCI indices and the STOXX Europe 600, 
which tracks the performance of the 600 largest companies 
from 17 European countries, as well as in various sector indi-
ces such as the STOXX Europe 600 Chemicals."
"In addition, 
Brenntag shares are included in various sustainability indices 
such as the DAX 50 ESG and the DAX ESG Target Index."
"According to the criteria of Deutsche Börse AG, the Brenntag 
share ranked 30th among all listed companies in Germany at 
the end of 2023."
"The market capitalization as at Decem-
ber 31, 2023, was EUR 12,271 million."
"This is intended to increase 
awareness of the company as an attractive investment and 
further develop Brenntag’s standing on the capital market."
"The company’s business performance and strategy are com-
municated continuously, promptly and reliably."
"This is 
intended to further strengthen investors’ confidence in 
Brenntag and help to ensure that our shares are adequately 
valued on the capital market."
"In 2023, Brenntag again attached significant importance to 
personal contact with capital market participants."
"The Board 
of Management and the Investor Relations team were in con-
stant dialog with investors and analysts worldwide."
"The com-
pany’s performance was discussed in detail in numerous 
meetings at international roadshows and investor confer-
ences, at the Annual General Meeting and in the course of the 
Capital Markets Day."
"The Investor Relations team made use of a variety of formats 
to communicate with investors, both virtually and in person."
"The corporate governance roadshow in February 2023 is wor-
thy of note."
"As in the previous year, Brenntag SE 
received recognition from the DVFA (Deutsche Vereinigung für 
Finanzanalyse und Asset Management) for its implementa-
tion of corporate governance in 2023, gaining third place 
among DAX companies."
"At the Capital Markets Day in London in December 2023, the 
Board of Management of Brenntag SE presented the further 
steps in the context of the Group strategy toward “Horizon 3”."
"A video recording of the event can be viewed on the 
Brenntag SE website in the Investor Relations section."
"In addi-
tion to the above-mentioned activities, the Board of Manage-
ment and the Investor Relations team regularly provided insti-
tutional investors, analysts and retail investors with 
information on Brenntag SE in numerous discussions."
"In February 2024, Brenntag conducted another corporate 
governance roadshow."
"In the course of this annual event, the 
Chair of the Supervisory Board of Brenntag SE, Richard Ridinger, 
presented the role of the Supervisory Board in the context of 
the new corporate strategy, among other things."
"This year, we will continue to present the company at numer-
ous roadshows and capital market events."

Brenntag has an extremely strong, long-term financial profile."
"We have a capital structure that enables the Group to cover 
its potential financing requirements, even in a difficult capital 
market environment."
"This gives us a high degree of security, 
independence and financial flexibility."
"The most important 
component in the financing structure of Brenntag SE is the 
Group-wide syndicated loan agreement."
"In addition, two 
bonds and a promissory note transaction are currently out-
standing on favorable terms, underscoring Brenntag SE’s high 
credit standing."
"This strong credit profile maintained by Brenntag is reflected 
in investment grade ratings from the two international rating 
agencies Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s."
"In August 2023, Standard & Poor’s raised Brenntag SE’s rating 
to “BBB+” (outlook: stable)."
"Previously, Standard & Poor’s had 
assigned Brenntag a “BBB” rating (outlook: positive)."
"Since 
March 2021, Moody’s has assigned Brenntag SE a “Baa2” rat-
ing (outlook: stable)."
"In February 2023, Brenntag agreed a new syndicated credit 
facility for around EUR 1.5 billion, which has a term of five 
years and is divided into two revolving credit lines: a EUR 1 bil-
lion line of credit and a USD line of credit totaling USD 525 
million."
"In a first for Brenntag, the interest rates on the credit 
facility were linked to the achievement of quantitative ESG 
criteria."

from the ESG strategic objectives for 2030."

"With attendance at around 83%,

"The Annual General Meeting confirmed all reso-
lutions proposed by the Board of Management and the Super-
visory Board."
"At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders 
reelected Richard Ridinger as a member of the Supervisory 
Board."
"In addition, Sujatha Chandrasekaran was elected as 
a new member of the Supervisory Board of Brenntag SE."
"Doreen Nowotne, former Chair of the Supervisory Board, did 
not stand for reelection and stood down from the Supervisory 
Board of Brenntag SE at the close of the Annual General Meet-
ing."
"At the Supervisory Board’s constituting meeting, Richard 
Ridinger was elected to serve as the Board’s new Chair."
"The proposal to pay a dividend of EUR 2.00 per share was

"The dividend increased by 38% compared with the 
previous year."
"Attractive dividend proposal for 2023
Since going public in 2010, the company has paid its share-
holders a higher dividend each year."
"Since the stock market 
flotation in 2010, the average annual increase in the dividend 
on Brenntag shares, including the current dividend proposal, 
has been around 13% per annum, meaning that the absolute 
dividend has increased by around 426% overall."
"Brenntag intends to increase the dividend for its shareholders 
for financial year 2023, too."
"The Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board will recommend to shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting on May 23, 2024, a dividend payment 
of EUR 2.10 per share."
"Subject to its approval at the Annual 
General Meeting, this will be the thirteenth consecutive divi-
dend increase since the stock market flotation."
"The payout 
ratio based on the consolidated profit after tax attributable 
to shareholders of Brenntag SE and based on the shares as at 
December 31, 2023, would therefore be around 43%."
"Through 
this payout ratio, which is in line with capital market commu-
nications, we are allowing shareholders to participate in the 
company’s positive earnings and cash flow performance."
"Due to rounding, the absolute totals may differ."

"In this challenging and volatile environment, the resilience of 
Brenntag's business model has proven itself once again, leading, 
among other things, to the exceptionally strong free cash flow."
"At the same time, Brenntag has continued to pursue its ambitious 
strategy to further strengthen the company and realize its vision 
of shaping the future of the chemical distribution industry."
"We are 
convinced that the transformation process Brenntag is currently 
undergoing will enable the company to master future challenges 
and proactively seize opportunities to create long-term value for all 
stakeholders."

five to four members and the CEO positions for the global Brenntag 
Specialties and Brenntag Essentials divisions were introduced."

the Supervisory Board met a total of seven times without the pres-
ence of the Board of Management, five of which were physical 
meetings in connection with a Supervisory Board meeting and two

gic planning, the agenda for the Annual General Meeting and var-
ious topics from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee."

porate governance statement is the central instrument of 
corporate governance reporting."
"Corporate Governance
Commitment to responsible corporate 
governance
As in previous years, in this reporting year the Board of Man-
agement and the Supervisory Board thoroughly examined 
corporate governance and the requirements of the German 
Corporate Governance Code (“GCGC”)."
"c) ii) SE-VO in conjunction with Section 161 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of 
Brenntag SE are obliged to resolve a Declaration of Confor-
mity in accordance with Article 9, para."
"c) ii) SE-VO in con-
junction with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporate Act 
(Aktiengesetz)."
"The last Declaration of Conformity was 
resolved on December 13, 2022 and updated on April 18, 2023."
"The exception is explained for the fol-
lowing reasons:
According to recommendation G.7 s."
"1 GCGC 2022, referring 
to the forthcoming financial year, the Supervisory Board shall 
establish the performance criteria for all variable remunera-
tion components for each Management Board member, 
which - in addition to operational targets - shall primarily be 
based on strategic goals."
"Furthermore, pursuant to recom-
mendation G.8 GCGC 2022, subsequent changes to the target 
values or the comparison parameters shall be excluded."
"By resolution dated April 18, 2023, the Supervisory Board 
approved a revised remuneration system for the Board of 
Management, which was approved by the Annual General 
Meeting on June 15, 2023 and came into force with effect 
from January 1, 2023."
"To apply the revised remuneration sys-
tem as widely as possible, the Supervisory Board had the 
option of agreeing with the members of the Board of Manage-
ment to adjust their service contracts to the new remunera-
tion system, possibly with retroactive effect from January 1, 
2023."
"If the service contracts of the Board of Management 
members are amended with retroactive effect to the require-
ments of the new remuneration system, new performance cri-
teria must be determined accordingly."
"As the revised remu-
neration system only came into force (retroactively) when it 
was approved by the Annual General Meeting on June 15, 
2023, the new performance criteria could not be set at a point 
in time compliant with the recommendation of G.7 GCGC 
2022."
"To the extent G.7 GCGC 2022 should be applicable in 
such a case, a precautionary deviation from recommenda-
tion G.7 GCGC 2022 is declared."
"The overall composition and 
structure of the variable remuneration has changed as a 
result of the revised remuneration system."
"An adjustment of 
the remuneration of the current members of the Board of 
Management to the revised remuneration system during the 
year therefore automatically led to changes in the targets 
and comparison parameters and thus to a deviation from 
recommendation G.8 GCGC 2022."
"The aim behind the revised remu-
neration system was, on the one hand, to meet the require-
ments and interests of stakeholders in an even better way 
and, on the other hand, to implement the change in strategy 
“Strategy to Win” resolved in November 2022."
"In line with the 
change in strategy, the revised remuneration system for the 
Board of Management includes new and different perfor-
mance criteria for both short-term and long-term variable 
remuneration."
"Where performance criteria have been 
retained, their weighting within the respective variable remu-
neration has changed in some cases under the revised remu-
neration system."
"Therefore, the deviation was only declared in 
financial year 2023."
"Brenntag currently complies with all rec-
ommendations of the GCGC 2022."
"Declaration on the suggestions made  
in the GCGC

nied by a structured offboarding process to ensure that data

she has acquired through her many years of experience as a 
finance expert and managing director as well as her years of 
service on the Audit Committee."

refers to sustainability reporting and auditing."

qualify as finance experts within the meaning of Section 100, 
para."
5 AktG and the recommendation of D.3 GCGC.

the activities of the Committee."
"The Audit and Com-
pliance Committee discusses the audit reports with the audi-
tor."

Board and prepares the consultations and resolutions of the 
Supervisory Board in the fields of strategy and sustainability."

and the optimization of company structures as well as the 
sustainability and digitalization strategies."
"Doreen Nowotne 
chaired this Committee until June 15, 2023."

expertise in the fields of Environment, Social und Governance."

tee are Richard Ridinger and Ulrich Harnacke."

agement and Supervisory Board together also did not exceed

member of the Board of Management has accepted more 
than a total of three offices in non-Group listed companies or

of this, it decided to conduct a selection process for the audit 
of the 2023 single-entity and consolidated financial state-
ments in the 2022 financial year in accordance with Article 16 
of the EU Audit Regulation."
"On the basis of this procedure, the 
Audit Committee formulated and submitted its recommen-
dation and preference to the Supervisory Board, which in turn 
followed the recommendation in its proposal to the Annual 
General Meeting."
"The audit is being managed centrally by the

ment and, in accordance with Section 76, para."
"4 of the Ger-
man Stock Corporation Act, on the first two management lev-
els below the Board of Management."
"The Supervisory Board 
last set new targets for the share of women in 2021."
"In each 
case, the deadline for implementing the target is January 31, 
2026."
"It set the target for the share of women on the Supervi-
sory Board at 33.3% and the target for the share of women on 
the Board of Management at 20%."
"For the Supervisory Board, 
this corresponds to two women; for the Board of Management 
one woman."
"The Board of Management last set new targets for the share 
of women on the two management levels in the company 
below the Board of Management in February 2022."
"The Board 
of Management aims to achieve a target of at least 30% for 
both levels by January 31, 2026."
"Taking into account the cur-
rent structure and staffing of these management levels, a tar-
get of six women has been set for the first management level."
"A target of eight women has been set for the second manage-
ment level."
"Naturally, the aforementioned targets do not rule 
out the possibility that the share of women will increase more 
than that."
"Before the above-mentioned deadline for imple-
mentation expires, the Supervisory Board and Board of Man-
agement will pass a resolution setting new targets."
"In Doreen Nowotne (member until June 15, 2023), Sujatha 
Chandrasekaran (member since June 15, 2023) and Stefanie 
Berlinger, the Supervisory Board has two female members so 
the share of women on the Supervisory Board was 33.3% in 
the reporting period and remains so."
"With Dr. Kristin Neu-
mann as Chief Financial Officer, we again achieved the 20% 
target for the percentage of women on the Board of Manage-
ment in 2023."
"As at December 31, 2023 the percentage of women on the 
first management level below the Board of Management was 
roughly 31.6%, which corresponds to six women."
"The share of 
women on the second management level below the Board of 
Management was 39.5%, which corresponds to 17 women."
"The advancement of young female talent is a major priority 
at Brenntag."
"The positive change in the percentage of women 
on the second management level below the Board of Man-
agement at Brenntag SE is a sign that the internal measures 
implemented are a success."
"The percentage of women in 
management roles is also to be further improved by their par-
ticipation in external programs."
"We are confident that this will 
enable us to set the targets higher in the long term and keep 
them higher."
"Brenntag 
GmbH is not required to disclose a management report 
because it has applied the exemption provisions pursuant to 
Section 264, para."
"In accordance with Section 289a,

ber of the Supervisory Board for more than 14 years."
"However, 
further indicators for a lack of independence as set out in the 
GCGC do not apply to him."
"The length of tenure indicator does 
not conflict with overall independence."
Dr. Andreas Rittstieg considers himself to be independent.
"In 
his consulting and monitoring duties, he demonstrates the 
necessary distance to the Board of Management along with 
the capacity for objective judgment, especially since the 
composition of the Board of Management has changed sev-
eral times during his term of office."
"The manner in which he has performed his duties to date 
gives the company no indication of possible conflicts of inter-
est that could influence his judgment."
"Due to his professional 
experience and expertise, he also demonstrates the critical 
distance from the company and the Board of Management 
that is necessary for the proper performance of his supervi-
sory and advisory function."
"A further aspect considered in the assessment of indepen-
dence was that Dr. Andreas Rittstieg does not represent any 
shareholder on the Supervisory Board."
"He was re-elected by 
a large majority (over 94% of the votes cast) at the Annual 
General Meeting 2020 after disclosing his previous committee 
membership."
"The Supervisory Board sees this as confirmation 
that, in addition to his own assessment, the shareholders also 
have sufficient confidence that Dr. Andreas Rittstieg main-
tains his independence when performing his duties."
"Finally, it should be noted that Dr. Andreas Rittstieg also has 
other duties and holds other offices and no business relations 
exist between him and the company."
"Further information on the members of the Supervisory Board 
can be found on the website at Supervisory Board | Brenntag."
"The remuneration report has been audited by Deloitte GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft."
"This audit went beyond the 
requirements of Section 162, para."
"3 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The audit opinion is attached to the 
remuneration report."
"The remuneration report of Brenntag SE was prepared jointly 
by the company’s Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board and reports on the remuneration awarded and due to 
the current and former members of the Board of Manage-
ment and the Supervisory Board in financial year 2023."
"Michael Friede took on 
the role of Chief Operating Officer (COO) for Brenntag Spe-
cialties at Brenntag SE effective April 1, 2023."
"Brenntag restructured its Board of Management as of August 
1, 2023 and established a new governance model for the two 
divisions."
"The Board of Management of Brenntag SE now con-
sists of four members."
"As part of the restructuring, Ewout van 
Jarwaarde was appointed CEO of Brenntag Essentials and 
succeeded Steven Terwindt, who had decided not to extend 
his contract with Brenntag when it expired on July 31, 2023."
"Michael Friede, the COO of Brenntag Specialties, was also 
appointed CEO of Brenntag Specialties effective August 1, 
2023."
"Prior to this, Ewout van Jarwaarde’s contract was 
extended by five years and now runs from January 1, 2024 to 
December 31, 2028."
"Consideration of the resolution of the 
Annual General Meeting 2023
The remuneration report of Brenntag SE for financial year 2022 
was approved by the Annual General Meeting on June 15, 
2023 with an 89.22% share of the votes cast."
"The investor and proxy adviser feedback received in connec-
tion with the approval of the Remuneration Report 2022 was 
also taken into account when preparing the Remuneration 
Report 2023."
"Business performance and target  
achievement in financial year 2023
Thanks to their robust business model and their global reach, 
the two global divisions, Brenntag Specialties and Brenntag 
Essentials, performed largely in line with expectations in a 
challenging market environment."
"Nevertheless, the Brenntag 
Group’s profit after tax fell by 20% to EUR 721.1 million com-
pared with the previous year’s record figure of EUR 902.5 million."
"The payout amount of the annual bonus under the Remuner-
ation System 2023, which is based on the philosophy of “Pay 
for Performance”, reflects this development."
"The annual 
bonus for the CEO for financial year 2023 amounted to 0% of 
the target amount, which reflects the below-average busi-
ness performance of the Brenntag Group."
"2023 also marked the end of the performance period for the 
first tranche of the long-term variable remuneration under the 
Remuneration System 2020."
"A total payout amount of 200% 
of the target amount was reached over the four-year perfor-
mance period."
"This is based on measurement of the relative 
shareholder return and the change in the share price, which 
underlines the very positive change in shareholder return 
between 2020 and 2023, both in absolute terms and in com-
parison to relevant global competitors and the German stock 
market."
"Further details are to be found in the section “Perfor-
mance criteria for the variable remuneration”."
"This change affects both the presen-
tation of the variable remuneration components in the report 
and the overall length of the remuneration report."
"The aim is 
to improve the clarity and comprehensibility of the report."
"Detailed information on this adjustment can be found in the 
section “Information on remuneration awarded and due to 
Board of Management members serving in financial year 
2023 and former members in accordance with Section 162 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)”."
"Implementation of a revised  
remuneration system 
In order to align the remuneration system of the Board of 
Management of Brenntag SE with the “Strategy to Win”, the 
Supervisory Board has revised the remuneration system in 
consultation with the Nomination and Remuneration Com-
mittee."
"The Board of Management remuneration system for 
2023 was resolved by the Supervisory Board on April 18, 2023 
and approved by 94.11% of the votes cast at the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting on June 15, 2023."
"This revised system applies 
with retroactive effect from January 1, 2023 to all current and 
future Board of Management members."
"The Board of Management Remuneration System 2020 was 
adopted by the Supervisory Board on December 23, 2020 and 
approved by the Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2021 
with a 91.62% share of the vote."
"After approval by the Annual General Meeting 2023, adjust-
ments to the service agreements and target agreements of 
the Board of Management members were necessary in 
order to implement the new remuneration system with retro-
active effect from January 1, 2023."
"In this context, Brenntag 
updated the declaration of conformity in order to explain the 
necessary deviations from recommendations G.7 and G.8 of 
the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of 
April 28, 2022."
"The revised remuneration system also incorporates feedback 
from investors and proxy advisers given during the Annual 
General Meeting 2021, at which the previous remuneration 
system was approved, and during the corporate governance 
roadshows in February 2023 and 2022."

"The 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory 
Board discusses and reviews the remuneration system for the 
Board of Management at regular intervals and prepares res-
olutions on any changes thereto."
"In its decisions on the setting 
of the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board takes into 
account the remuneration and employment conditions of the 
employees of Brenntag SE, in particular the senior managers."
"In setting the remuneration, the Supervisory Board pays 
attention to an appropriate relationship between the tasks 
and performance of the Board of Management members and 
the situation of the company."
"In order to assess the appropri-
ateness of the remuneration system and the individual remu-
neration of the members of the Board of Management, the 
Supervisory Board conducts a horizontal review of the remu-
neration levels and structure."
"The horizontal comparison is 
carried out with companies of comparable size at national 
level, e.g."
with the companies listed in the DAX and MDAX.
"In 
addition, the Supervisory Board may conduct a horizontal 
review at international level, e.g."
"based on the respective 
composition of the global peer group for the performance 
share plan."
"The Board of Management remuneration systems, in partic­
ular the Board of Management remuneration system that 
was introduced in 2023, is in line with the German Corporate 
Governance Code in the version of April 28, 2022 and the 
requirements of the amended German Stock Corporation Act."
"These systems are designed to be clear and comprehensible 
and support the Group's long-term perfor­
mance by creating 
effective incentives for growth and increasing profitability."
"The aim of the remuneration systems is to create an incentive 
for successful and sustainable cor­
porate development."
"The 
systems are therefore geared to transparent, perfor-
mance-based remuneration that is strongly focused on the 
company's success and that depends, in par­
ticular, on long-
term, but also operational targets, the perfor­
mance of the 
Brenntag share price as well as sustainability targets."
Two different remuneration systems were applied in 2023.
"The 
Remuneration System 2023 applies to all Board of Manage-
ment members of Brenntag SE currently in office."
"Henri 
Nejade and Steven Terwindt, who both stepped down from 
the Board of Management in mid-2023, were still covered by 
the provisions of the Remuneration System 2020 until the ter-
mination of their respective contracts."
"The annual base salary and the variable remuneration com-
ponents are shown separately in the following."
"There then fol-
lows a description of benefits in kind and other contractual 
provisions that are structured in a comparable manner in 
both remuneration systems."
"It is applied exactly within 
the framework of the Board of Management remuneration 
system adopted by the Supervisory Board and approved by 
the Annual General Meeting 2023."
"The remuneration comprises fixed remuneration and variable 
remuneration."
"The fixed remuneration consists of a base sal-
ary, pension allowance and benefits in kind."
"The variable 
remuneration is made up of short-term and long-term vari-
able remuneration components."
"Of the target total remuner-
ation of the Board of Management members, fixed remuner-
ation accounts for between 34% and 39%, short-term variable 
remuneration components for between 27% and 28% and 
long-term variable remuneration components for between

"The annual base salary is paid in twelve equal monthly instal­
ments at the end of each month."
"If the service agreement 
begins or ends during a financial year, the annual base salary 
for that financial year is payable on a pro rata temporis basis."
"The annual bonus provides an incentive to achieve the 
operational business objectives of the financial year, which in 
turn are derived from the business strategy and the annual 
budget plans."
"The performance share plan provides an incen-
tive to ensure the long-term performance of the company."
"Annual bonus under the Remuneration System 2023
The annual bonus depends both on Brenntag’s overall perfor-
mance and on the specific responsibilities and challenges of 
the Board of Management members."
"It is determined based 
on the achievement of certain targets set for the financial 
year, which include organic operating EBITA, working capital 
turnover and earnings per share."
"In 2023, the targets set for working capital turnover and earn-
ings per share relate to Group level for all members of the 
Board of Management."
"For Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner, Dr. Kristin 
Neumann and Ewout van Jarwaarde (until July 31), the target 
for organic operating EBITA related to Group level."
"For Michael 
Friede and Ewout van Jarwaarde (since August 1), 75% of the 
target for organic operating EBITA related to Group level and 
the remaining 25% to divisional level in order to align the tar-
gets with their particular divisional responsibilities."
"Organic operating EBITA is the key performance indicator for 
the implementation of Brenntag’s strategy."
"It can take into 
account different depreciation profiles and thus enable the 
differentiated strategic steering of Brenntag’s divisions; this 
KPI is weighted at 60% in the bonus calculation."
"Working capi­
tal turnover is a key performance indicator for Brenntag to 
ensure efficient deployment of capital; the weighting is 20%."
"Earnings per share, as a parameter for measuring Brenntag’s 
shareholder value, is also weighted at 20%."
"The payout factor 
for each key performance indicator lies within a range of 0% 
to 200%."
"Target, threshold and stretch values for the three key 
performance indicators are derived from the annual budget 
plans and are set annually by the Supervisory Board."
"2.03 Remuneration structure – Remuneration System 20231)
1)	 Note: In accordance with Remuneration System 2023, any fixed sign-on bonus is not considered in the presentation of the remuneration structure for benefits in kind."
"If the actual 
value for each performance criterion is equal to or below the 
threshold, this results in a payout factor of 0%."
"If the actual 
value for each performance criterion is equal to or above the 
stretch, this results in a maximum payout factor of 200%."
"If 
the actual values are between the respective target and 
threshold values or between the respective target and stretch 
values, the payout factor is determined by linear interpolation."
"In order to determine the final payout amount, the overall 
payout factor is multiplied by the individual performance 
multiplier and by the target amount."
"The individual perfor-
mance multiplier is set by the Supervisory Board after each 
financial year in a range between 0.8 and 1.2."
"In doing so, the 
Supervisory Board takes into account the individual finan­
cial 
and non-financial performance."
"To measure the individual performance, the Supervisory 
Board defines individual performance aspects to evaluate 
the personal contribution of each member of the Board of 
Management."
"The individual performance aspects may be 
based on the three dimensions growth, people and risk man-
agement."
"They may include strategic and operational 
aspects as well as non-financial aspects as the Supervisory 
Board also sees these aspects as being important for the 
strategy and success of Brenntag and wishes to reward them."
The final payout amount is capped at max.
"200% of the indi-
vidual and contractually agreed target amount (Cap)."
"If the 
overall payout factor for the financial performance criteria is 
already 200%, the individual performance multiplier cannot 
increase the annual bonus further."
"If the service agreement begins or ends during a financial 
year, the target amount for that financial year applies on a 
pro rata temporis basis."
"The annual bonus should be paid out within three months 
from approval of the consolidated financial statements by 
the Supervisory Board, but at the latest twelve months after 
the end of the financial year for which the annual bonus has 
been determined."

"The number of vir-
tual shares may increase or decrease depending on the long-
term performance of Brenntag measured using specified per-
formance criteria over a four-year performance period."
"The number of virtual shares to be granted initially is calcu-
lated by dividing the individual and contractually agreed tar-
get amount by the arithmetic mean of the Brenntag share 
closing prices in the Xetra trading system during the last three 
months before the start of the performance period."
"If the ser-
vice agreement begins or ends during a financial year, the 
target amount for that financial year shall be calculated on 
a pro rata temporis basis."
"The number of virtual shares finally awarded to the member 
of the Board of Management is linked to two financial perfor-
mance criteria and to ESG targets by way of an ESG multi-
plier."
"The two financial performance criteria are Brenntag’s 
total shareholder return (TSR) compared with a global peer 
group (weighting: 70%) and the return on capital employed 
(ROCE) (weighting: 30%)."
"The sum of the respective weighted 
share awards for each performance criterion is then multi-
plied by the achievement of certain ESG targets by means of 
an ESG multiplier, which can range from 0.8 to 1.2."
"The result-
ing overall share award is then multiplied by the number of 
virtual shares initially granted, resulting in the number of virtual 
shares finally awarded to the member of the Board of Man-
agement at the end of the four-year performance period."
"The 
number of virtual shares finally awarded is limited to 200%."
"The payout amount is capped at max-
imum 250% of the individual and contractually set target 
amount (Cap)."
"The payout amount shall be paid out within three months from 
approval of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Supervisory Board, but at the latest twelve months after the 
end of the financial year in which the performance period ends."
The TSR is a key performance indicator for our shareholders.
"The TSR reflects the change in the equity value and dividend 
distributions, i.e."
the return of the Brenntag share.
"In addition 
to changes in share price and dividends, other capital meas­
ures are also considered."
"When comparing the TSR of the 
Brenntag share with the shareholder return of other compa-
nies, the advantages of an investment in the Brenntag share 
are measured compared with alternative investments in 
shares of other companies."
"It is of central importance for the 
long-term stability of the company that shareholders receive 
an attractive return on their investment in Brenntag shares."

"When selecting global peer com-
panies, the Supervisory Board considers the chemical distri-
bution market as well as the distribution business model and 
the underlying market of Brenntag."
"The global peer group can 
be adjusted by the Supervisory Board if necessary to maintain 
a meaningful composition of the peer group (e.g."
"mergers, 
acquisitions and delisting of companies in the peer group)."
"was delisted on August 1, 2023 and the company 
is therefore no longer part of the peer group."
"The global peer 
group therefore now consists of the following companies:

1)	 Koninklijke DSM (DSM) was delisted on May 31, 2023 owing to its merger with Firmenich; it was therefore removed from the peer group."
"The shares of the merged 
companies, DSM-Firmenich AG, were listed on the stock exchange on April 18, 2023."
"will not be part of the peer group for the LTIP tranche 
2023–2026."
"DSM-Firmenich AG will be included in the peer group for the LTIP tranche 2024–2027 as of January 1, 2024."
"The share award for the relative TSR is determined based on 
the percentile ranking method."
"If Brenntag’s TSR percentile 
ranking is equal to the median (50th percentile), the share 
award for the relative TSR is 80%."
"If Brenntag’s TSR percentile 
ranking is equal to or below the 25th percentile, the share 
award for the relative TSR is 0%."
"If Brenntag’s TSR percentile 
ranking is equal to or exceeds the 75th percentile, the share 
award for the relative TSR is 160%."
"The range for relative TSR 
is defined as 0–160%, in contrast to the range for ROCE, to cre-
ate a balanced risk-reward profile around the median through 
symmetry."
"Values in-between are determined by linear inter-
polation."
"This results in a share award curve as follows:

"The multipliers for each ESG target are weighted equally 
resulting in an overall ESG multiplier between 0.8 and 1.2."
"Equally, the company 
is contractually entitled to correct the amount of variable re-
muneration determined if that determination was based on 
incorrect data."
"Malus and clawback events 
generally only have an effect on variable remuneration com-
ponents for those financial years during which they actually 
occurred."
"Variable remuneration can be clawed back for a 
period of three years following payout."
"In financial year 2023, no variable remuneration was retained 
or clawed back."
"The average carrying amounts in the denominator are 
defined for a particular year as the arithmetic average of the 
amounts at each of the following five dates: the beginning of 
the year, the end of each of the first, second and third quarter, 
and the end of the year."
"The Supervisory Board sets a threshold, target and stretch 
value for ROCE in the final year of the four-year performance 
period."
"If the defined target value for ROCE is achieved, this 
results in a share award of 100%."
"If the actual value for ROCE 
is equal to or below the threshold, this results in a share award 
of 0%."
"If the actual value for ROCE is equal to or above the 
stretch, this results in a maximum share award of 200%."
"If the 
actual values are between the respective target and thresh-
old values or between the respective target and stretch val-
ues, the share award is determined by linear interpolation."
"Exceptional per-
formance is required to achieve the cap of each variable 
remuneration component."
"If the upper threshold for the financial key performance indi-
cators of the annual bonus is achieved, a maximum prelim­
inary payout amount of 200% of the target amount is reached."
"Even the application of the individual performance multiplier 
cannot increase the payout amount above this cap of 200%."
"Under the performance share plan, the number of final virtual 
shares achievable is limited to 200% of the number of initial 
virtual shares granted."
"This maximum number of shares can 
only be reached if the Brenntag share performs better than 
75% of the companies in the global peer group and if the 
upper thresholds for both ROCE and the ESG multiplier are 
reached."
"In addition, the payout amount depends on the per-
formance of the Brenntag share price and dividend pay-
ments."
"The total payout under the performance share plan is 
limited to 250% of the initial target amount."
"The maximum total remuneration comprises the annual base 
salary, maximum annual bonus remuneration, maximum per-
formance share plan remuneration, the pension allowance 
and benefits in kind."
"The maximum total remuneration has 
been set at EUR 6,800,000 for Dr.  Christian Kohlpaintner, 
 
at EUR 3,300,000 for Dr.  Kristin Neumann and Ewout van 
­
Jarwaarde, and at EUR 4,150,000 for Michael Friede."

"Share Ownership Guideline
In order to bring the interests of the Board of Management 
and shareholders more closely into line and to strengthen the 
Board of the Management members’ ownership in the com-
pany, an obligation to accumulate and hold Brenntag shares 
(Share Ownership Guideline) applies."
"The chair of the Board 
of Management is obliged to accumulate and con­
tinue to 
hold shares to the value of 200% of their annual base salary 
for two years after the end of their service."
"Dr. Kristin Neumann, 
Michael Friede and Ewout van Jarwaarde are obliged to 
accumulate and continue to hold shares to the value of 100% 
of their annual base salaries for two years after the end of 
their services."
"They must accumulate the shares within four 
years at the latest."
"In each of these four years, shares equiv-
alent to 25% of the holding obligation must be acquired."
"Compliance with the obligation to hold shares is checked 
once a year, as at December 31."
"The last check as at Decem-
ber 31, 2022 showed that all Board of Management members 
subject to the obligation had met their obligation to hold 
shares in full."
"The next check as at December 31, 2023 is 
expected to take place in March 2024."

stepped down from the Board of Management in mid-2023."
"Furthermore, the performance period for tranche 2020 of the 
performance share plan under the Remuneration System 
2020 ended in 2023."
"2.10 Remuneration structure – Remuneration System 20201)

not taken into account in the presentation of the remuneration structure."
"The above remuneration structure under the Remuneration 
System 2020 illustrates the common framework of the two 
remuneration systems through the remuneration compo-
nents."
"The following sections provide a detailed explanation 
of the annual bonus and the performance share plan under 
the Remuneration System 2020."
"Annual bonus under the Remuneration System 2020
The annual bonus depends on the business success of 
Brenntag in the past financial year."
"It is calculated on the 
basis of achievement of the targets set for that financial year 
for organic EBITDA, working capital turnover and earnings 
per share."
"Working capital turnover and 
earnings per share related to Group level."
"If overall target achievement is 100%, 
the preliminary payout amount is 100% of the target amount."
"If overall target achievement is 50% or less, the Board of Man-
agement members receive no annual bonus."
"For an overall 
target achievement of 150% or more, the preliminary payout 
amount is 200% of the target amount."
"Values in-between are 
determined by linear interpolation."
"In order to determine the final payout amount, the preliminary 
payout amount is multiplied by the individual performance 
multiplier."
"The individual performance multiplier is set by the 
Supervisory Board after each financial year in a range 
between 0.7 and 1.3."
"In doing so, the Supervisory Board takes 
into account the individual financial and non-financial per­
formance that cannot be reasonably measured by applying 
KPIs."
"This refers to topics of environmental and social respon­
sibility (e.g."
"succession planning, development of executive 
employees of the company, environmental responsibility, 
compliance) and sustainable corporate development (e.g."
integration of acquisitions).
"The final payout amount is 
capped at max."
"200% of the individual and contractually 
agreed target amount (Cap)."
"If the service agreement begins 
or ends during a financial year, the target amount for that 
financial year is granted on a pro rata temporis basis."
"The annual bonus shall be paid out within three months from 
approval of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Supervisory Board, but at the latest twelve months after the 
end of the financial year for which the annual bonus has been

"Target achievement of each performance criterion is calcu­
lated by subtracting the performance of the DAX or MDAX or 
the average TSR of the global peer group from the TSR of the 
Brenntag share."
"If the performance of the DAX or MDAX or the 
average TSR of the global peer group equals the TSR of the 
Brenntag share, target achievement is 100%."
"If the TSR of the 
Brenntag share outperforms the DAX or MDAX or the average 
TSR of the global peer group by 25% or more percentage 
points, target achievement is 150%."
"If the TSR of the Brenntag 
share underperforms the DAX or MDAX or the average TSR of 
the global peer group by 25% or more percentage points, tar­

"Values in-between are determined by 
linear interpolation."
"Overall target achievement is calculated 
by multiplying the target achievement figures of the two per­
formance criteria by their respective weightings and then add­
ing together these two weighted target achievement figures."
"The number of virtual shares that a Board of Management 
member is finally granted at the end of the four-year perfor­
mance period is calculated by multiplying the number of vir­

The payout amount is capped at max.
"200%

"The payout amount shall be paid within three months from 
approval of the consolidated financial statements by the 
Supervisory Board, but at the latest twelve months after the

"Clawback of variable remu-
neration is possible up to an amount of 25% of the total remu-
neration for the respective financial year."

"Maximum remuneration for Steven

EUR 3,400,000."
"As their service agreements ended during 
2023, a pro rata temporis adjustment is made to these 
amounts for this year."
"Further remuneration and contractual 
provisions
The following describes further remuneration and contrac­
tual provisions that are largely applicable under both remu-
neration systems."
"For building up pension entitlements, Dr. Christian Kohlpaint-
ner receives from the company an annual amount of 
EUR 300,000 and may decide at his own discretion how to use 
this money."
"The annual amount made available is paid in 
twelve equal monthly instalments, in each case at the end of 
the month."
"If the service agreement begins or ends during a 
financial year, the annual amount will be granted on a pro 
rata temporis basis for that financial year."
"For building up pension entitlements, the other members of 
the Board of Management receive an annual amount of 
13.5% (rounded to the next full EUR 1,000) of their annual base 
salary and the short-term variable remuneration (on 100% 
target achievement, i.e."
"irrespective of the actual targets 
achieved)."
"Dr. Kristin Neumann, Michael Friede, Ewout van 
Jarwaarde and Steven Terwindt are paid out the relevant 
amount for building up pension entitlements every year and 
may decide at their own discretion how to use this money."
"Henri Nejade had the option either to use this amount in whole 
or in part for contributions to his French social insurance or to 
also pay it annually into the Deferred Compensation Contin-
gency Plan of Brenntag SE."
"For 2023, Henri Nejade had 
decided to pay the amount into the Deferred Compensation 
Contingency Plan."
"The Brenntag pension plan is a defined benefit pension com­
mitment with pension payments commencing when the 
Board of Management member reaches the age of 63, pro­
vided that he or she is no longer in the service of the company."
"The contributions are converted into pension modules in the 
year in which the contributions are paid."
"The pension entitle­
ments are calculated solely on the basis of the sum of the 
pension modules accumulated up to the age limit."
"This pen­
sion plan also contains an arrangement for a widows and 
orphans pension which would amount to 60% and 20% 
respectively of the full pension entitlements."
"In accordance 
with the statutory provisions pursuant to Section 16 of the 
German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG), the interest on 
the annual installments and the annual increase in pension 
payments is 1%."
"The pension liability insurance policies taken 
out with the Board of Management member as beneficiary 
are pledged to that member."
"In financial year 2023 a total of EUR 22k was recognized for 
Henri Nejade as a pension commitment expense, and the 
present value of his pension commitment is EUR 1,804k."
"Apart 
from that, no expenses or provisions for pension commit-
ments were incurred or recognized for the other members of 
the Board Management serving in financial year 2023, and 
they had no existing pension commitment."
"Apart from the amounts explained above, which are made 
available to build up pension entitlements, no other arrange­
ments for retirement and early retirement have been agreed."
"In addition to the above-mentioned remuneration compo­
nents, the Board of Management members receive benefits 
in kind and other benefits, such as a company car, also for 
private use, or a car allowance, and benefits for health care 
and long-term care insurance."
"The benefits for health care and long-term care insurance are 
limited to max."
"50% of the premium they pay into their health 
care and long-term care insurance."
"Should Ewout van 
­
Jarwaarde be subject to the statutory social security system 
in the Netherlands, Brenntag will pay the corresponding 
employer contributions to the Dutch social security system up 
to an amount of EUR 20,000 per year."
"Steven Terwindt was 
provided with supplementary health insurance based on the 
national health insurance system in Canada."
"Furthermore, a 
group accident insurance has been taken out."
"In addition, the 
company has taken out Directors & Officers Insurance (dam­
age liability insurance) for the Board of Management mem­
bers."
"This provides for a deductible of 10% of the damages 
claimed in each case, but in each year limited to 150% of the 
annual base salary."
"For his services as director for Brenntag 
companies in Asia Pacific of Brenntag Asia Pacific Pte."
"Ltd., 
Singapore, Henri Nejade also received fixed remuneration 
from this subsidiary in the amount of SGD 600,000 per annum, 
depending on the exchange rate but no more than 
EUR 400,000."
"Steven Terwindt was also provided with a bud-
get for a transitional period, which could be used for accom-
modation at the Essen location."
"For Steven Terwindt, this bud-
get was EUR 16,200 per year and was only available until 
July 31, 2023."
"For the first three months of such incapacity, full enti-
tlement to the annual bonus and the target or grant amount 
of the long-term variable remuneration is also retained."
"Contract termination provisions
The service agreements of the Board of Management mem­
bers end automatically on specified dates without any notice 
of termination being required."
"The employment of Board of 
Management members may only be terminated prematurely 
for good cause or by mutual agreement."
"If employment is ter­
minated prematurely, the service agreement limits any sev­
erance pay to the value of twice the total annual remunera­
tion, but no more than the amount of remuneration that would 
be paid until the end of the term of the service agreement."
"A post-contractual non-compete clause has been agreed 
with Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner, Dr. Kristin Neumann, Michael 
Friede, Ewout van Jarwaarde and Steven Terwindt."
"The 
post-contractual non-compete obligation applies for a period 
of 24 months after the termination of the service agreement."
"During this period Dr.  Christian Kohlpaintner, Dr.  Kristin 
­
Neumann, Michael Friede, Ewout van Jarwaarde and Steven 
Terwindt receive a continuous payment amounting to 75% of 
their annual base salary."
"Any earnings pursuant to Section 
74c of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are deducted 
from this payment."
"There is no separate post-contractual 
non-compete clause for Henri Nejade."
There are no separate change-of-control arrangements.
"The target amounts for the 
annual bonus and the performance share plan result from the 
contractually agreed target amounts."
"As Dr. Kristin Neumann 
was appointed to the Board of Management during 2022 
 
and Michael Friede during 2023, and Henri Nejade and Steven 
­
Terwindt stepped down from the Board of Management 
during 2023, the target amounts indicated in the respective 
year are pro rata temporis amounts."
"2)	 The contractually agreed post-contractual non-compete compensation, amounting to EUR 164k, is not included in the target remuneration."
"The following table shows the respective targets and the 
results actually achieved."
"The respective target achievement 
is calculated from the two figures."
"The results of the organic 
operating EBITA and the organic EBITDA were calculated 
based on constant exchange rates."
"Specifically, the exchange 
rates as per the 2023 budget were used, as they were also 
applied in determining the target values."
"This approach enabled a holistic view to be taken 
when determining the individual performance multipliers for 
2023."
"■	
Executing Brenntag's ESG agenda in the divisions and 
across the Group."
"The reference to ESG (environmental, social, governance) in 
the individual performance multiplier is established directly 
through the relevant performance aspects."
"In addition, there 
is a requirement for all serving Board of Management mem-
bers that special weight is given to the avoidance of particu-
larly serious HSE (health, safety, environment) incidents when 
assessing their individual performance."
"In the spring of 2023, 
Henri Nejade stepped down from the Brenntag Board of Man-
agement in order to pave the way for a smooth transition to 
his successor Michael Friede."
"His individual performance 
assessment is therefore primarily based on his role in this cru-
cial transition phase for Brenntag."
"The individual performance multiplier that is applied to the 
annual bonus in both remuneration systems was therefore set 
by the Supervisory Board at 1.0 for Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner, 
Dr. Kristin Neumann, Michael Friede, Ewout van Jarwaarde, 
Henri Nejade, and Steven Terwindt."
"Recipients of this tranche include Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner 
and Steven Terwindt."

"In the past, the first interpretation, which is also acceptable 
to the IDW, was applied, namely that remuneration is deemed 
to have been ""awarded and due in the financial year"" if it has 
actually been received."
"The change in the interpretation option affects the variable 
remuneration components in particular."
"Following the change 
in interpretation, it is the annual bonus for the finan­
cial year 
and not the annual bonus for the previous year that is reported 
as awarded and due."
"In addition, the long-term variable 
remuneration is now reported as awarded and due for the 
performance period ending in the financial year and not for 
the performance period ending in the previous year."
"In line with the ""pay for performance"" philosophy and with a 
view to improving clarity and comparability, consistency of 
reporting over time has been broken."
"The aim is to present the 
correlation between the business results of a financial year 
and the resulting remuneration for the financial year."
"This means that there is also no reporting on the performance 
criteria for variable remuneration for the previous year's 
annual bonus and on the long-term variable remuneration 
the performance period of which ended in the previous year."
"The aim is to shorten the report for the reader by avoiding 
multiple disclosures over time and thus improve the overview."
"Furthermore, the voluntary reporting disclosures on remuner-
ation granted and earned in accordance with Section 4.2.5, 
para."
"3 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the ver-
sion dated February 7, 2017 (GCGC 2017) can also be dis-
pensed with in future."
"Following the change in interpretation, 
the ‘earned’ perspective is already reflected in the remunera-
tion awarded and due."
"The remuneration granted is replaced 
by the voluntary provision of a target remuneration table."
"Information on remuneration awarded and  
due to Board of Management members serving 
in financial year 2023 in accordance with 
Section 162 AktG
On March 31,2023, Henri Nejade stepped down from the 
Board of Management, his service agreement remaining in 
force until June 30, 2023."
"Until this date, Henri Nejade actively 
supported the company, in particular on questions relating to 
Brenntag Specialties and in order to provide Michael Friede 
with the best-possible assistance during his induction process."
"Steven Terwindt stepped down from the Board of Manage­
ment on July 31, 2023 and his service agreement ended on 
the same day in accordance with the terms of the contract."
"By mutual agreement, the post-contractual non-compete 
clause under the Remuneration System 2020 was shortened 
from 24 months to 12 months."
"Consequently, Steven Terwindt 
will only receive non-compete compensation for this short-
ened period."
"In accordance with their respective service agreements, Henri 
Nejade and Steven Terwindt received their annual base salary 
and the pension components on a pro rata temporis basis."
"The annual bonuses for Henri Nejade and Steven Terwindt for 
2023 will also be calculated on a pro rata basis."
"In accor-
dance with the Remuneration System 2020, these bonuses 
will be paid in 2024."
"In accordance with the Remuneration 
System 2020, the performance share plan entitlements will 
be paid after completion of the performance period of the 
respective tranche."
"Details on the 2020–2023 tranche are 
given in the section “Performance criteria for the variable 
remuneration”."
"A sign-on bonus of EUR 1 million was agreed in order to offset 
possible losses from his previous long-term remuneration 
plans, which had a significantly higher payout potential."
"This 
amount will be split as follows: EUR 250,000 was paid 
together with his first monthly salary."
"The target bonus will be 
increased by EUR 50,000 for three years, which gives a total 
of EUR 150,000."
"Furthermore, the target amount for the per-
formance share plan will be increased yearly by EUR 200,000 
for three years, which gives a total of EUR 600,000."
"As Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner had skillfully led the company 
through challenging times and, with Project Brenntag, laid the 
foundation for further sustainable growth, his service agree-
ment was extended from January 1, 2023."
"His exceptional 
performance in the transformation of Brenntag paved the 
way for an 8% increase in his target direct remuneration, 
which comprises the basic salary and both variable remuner-
ation components."
"In his role as Chief Transformation Officer, Ewout van 
­
Jarwaarde has made an important contribution to Brenntag’s 
extremely successful transformation."
"In order to acknowl-
edge his performance and bring his remuneration package 
in line with that of the other Board of Management members, 
his target direct remuneration was increased by 10%."
"These three new remuneration packages remain moderate 
compared with those paid in the peer group of DAX and MDAX 
companies."
"Steven Terwindt received a contractually agreed post-contrac-
tual non-compete compensation in the amount of EUR 164k 
for the period from August 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023."
"Apart from these amounts, no remuneration was awarded or 
due to former Board of Management members in financial 
year 2023."
"The performance share units are paid out after the end of the 
respective four-year performance period."
"The specific perfor-
mance criteria previously defined for the relevant Board of 
Management remuneration system are taken into account."
"These amounts are 
added up and compared with the maximum remuneration to 
be applied for that financial year."
"It was confirmed that the maximum remuneration for each 
Board of Management member was complied with in 2020, 
2021, 2022 and 2023."
"However, it is important to note that not 
all remuneration components for 2021, 2022 and 2023 have 
already been awarded or are currently due."
"In particular, enti-
tlements under the long-term variable remuneration cannot 
be determined until after the end of the respective perfor-
mance periods."
"The provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act and the 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance 
Code on remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board 
provide the regulatory framework for the remuneration sys-
tem."
"The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory 
Board is purely fixed remuneration:
The remuneration of the Supervisory Board members was 
adjusted to reflect the increased requirements of their roles."
"This adjustment ensures that the remuneration remains mar-
ket-competitive to enable Brenntag to attract and retain 
experts with a high level of expertise in various business areas 
in an international market environment."
"The remuneration levels take into account the functions and 
the respective responsibilities of the members of the Super-
visory Board and are in an appropriate relationship to the sit-
uation of Brenntag."
"The remuneration of Supervisory Boards 
and committees in comparable national and international 
companies of the same industry is also considered."
"To main-
tain the competitiveness of the remuneration in national and 
international comparison, the fixed remuneration of the 
members of the Supervisory Board has been increased mod-
erately from EUR 120,000 to EUR 130,000."
"The differentiation made in the remuneration for the various 
roles of the Supervisory Board since 2015 did not adequately 
reflect the increased commitment, effort and responsibility 
the role of Chair of the Supervisory Board involves."
"In line with 
best market practice, a greater difference in the fixed remu-
neration for the Chair­
 of the Supervisory Board by a factor 2.5 
instead of 1.75 is to be made."
"The expertise of Supervisory Board members needed for con-
structive work in different committees and their time commit-
ment are very similar for the committees."
"Therefore, the remu-
neration paid for committee memberships is being 
standardized."

visory Board members serving in financial year 2023 and for-
mer members:

1)	 Note: The remuneration of the Supervisory Board members is purely fixed remuneration."
"The members of the Supervisory Board serving as at Decem-
ber 31, 2023 are obliged to invest 20% of the gross fixed remu-
neration for 2023 as a personal investment in Brenntag shares 
and to hold these shares in their ownership until the end of 
their term of office."
"The investment obligation comes into 
effect at the end of 2023 and must be met by the end of 2024."
"The check for compliance with this obligation as at Decem-
ber 31, 2024 is expected to be performed in March 2025 and 
a report will be made in the Remuneration Report 2025."
"Furthermore, Directors & Officers insurance (damage liabil-
ity insurance) has been taken out for the members of the 
Supervisory Board."
"Beyond this, Supervisory Board members 
received no further remuneration or benefits for personal ser-
vices rendered, in particular advisory and mediatory services, 
in the reporting year."
"No loans or advances were granted to 
members of the Supervisory Board in the reporting year, nor 
were any guarantees or other commitments entered into in 
their favor."
"Changes in remuneration and the company’s earnings were 
shown for the first time from 2020 to 2021 and are now 
updated every year in the remuneration report."

"The corresponding change in 2022 
compared with 2021 can therefore only be stated in absolute terms."
"In the case of current and for-
mer Supervisory Board members, the total remuneration 
awarded and due is taken into account as described in the 
section “Remuneration of the Supervisory Board”."
"Apart from 
apprentices, interns and pre-retirement part-time workers, all 
employees who had a valid employment contract with 
Brenntag SE in the respective financial year are included in 
the changes in average employee remuneration."
"Part-time employment and entries and departures from the 
company during the year are extrapolated to the full-year, 
full-time equivalent."
"Base salary and short-term and long-term 
variable remuneration paid in the financial year are included 
in the calculation for employees."
"Benefits in kind and com-
pany pension schemes for employees are excluded from the 
calculation as these remuneration components are to a large 
extent purely administrative and are not subject to the clas-
sic, annual adjustment mechanism."
"In this analysis, we focus 
only on the employees of Brenntag SE in order to avoid a dis-
torted picture in the future as a result of takeovers and differ-
ent remuneration dynamics in other countries."
"The following table shows a comparison of the remuneration 
awarded and due in the change-over year for financial year 
2022 according to the previous interpretation option."
"Detailed 
information on the change in the interpretation option is given 
in the section “Information on remuneration awarded and due 
to Board of Management members serving in financial year 
2023 and former members in accordance with Section 162 of 
the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)”."

"Auditor’s Responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remunera-
tion report, including the related disclosures, based on our 
audit."
"We conducted our audit in compliance with German 
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"These Standards require that we fulfil the professional 
responsibilities and that we plan and perform the audit so 
that we obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the remu-
neration report, including the related disclosures, is free from 
material misstatements."
"An audit involves performing audit procedures in order to 
obtain audit evidence for the amounts stated in the remuner-
ation report, including the related disclosures."
"The choice of 
the audit procedures is subject to the auditor’s professional 
judgment."
"This includes assessing the risk of material mis-
statements, whether due to fraud or error, in the remuneration 
report, including the related disclosures."
"In assessing these 
risks, the auditor considers the system of internal control, 
which is relevant to preparing the remuneration report, 
including the related disclosures."
"Our objective is to plan and 
perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not to express an audit opinion on the effective-
ness of the Company’s system of internal control."
"An audit 
also comprises an evaluation of the accounting policies used, 
of the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the 
executive directors and the supervisory board as well as an 
evaluation of the overall presentation of the remuneration 
report, including the related disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion."
"Audit Opinion
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the 
audit, the remuneration report for the financial year from 
January 1 to December 31, 2023, including the related disclo-
sures, complies, in all material respects, with the accounting 
principles of Section 162 AktG."
"Since our audit opinion on the audit of the content is 
unmodified, this audit opinion includes that the disclosures 
required under Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG are contained, in 
all material respects, in the remuneration report."
"Intended Use of the Report
We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter 
agreed with the Company."
"The audit has been performed for 
the purposes of the Company and the report is solely intended 
to inform the Company about the result of the audit."
"(IDW) in the version dated 1 January 2017 
(IDW-AAB)."
"However, we do not accept or assume liability to 
third parties."
"Rising energy 
costs for our suppliers in Europe amplify the already-strong pressure in 
a market environment that remains volatile."
"At the same time, companies 
face increasing requirements for transparency and comprehensive ESG 
reporting."
"Nevertheless, or perhaps especially in this environment, clear 
ESG targets provide direction, and their systematic implementation is a 
central focus for us at Brenntag going forward."
"We must play a role in 
shaping the ecological and social transformation of both our company 
and society through responsible governance, thereby contributing to a 
sustainable way of life."
"As the global market leader in chemicals and ingredients distribution, we 
see ourselves in a key position to drive the transition to sustainability in 
the markets we serve."
"In 2023, we once again expanded our product port-
folio so as to offer more sustainable alternatives to many established 
chemicals and ingredients."
"We are helped in this by CO2Xplorer, our tool 
for calculating the greenhouse gases associated with individual prod-
ucts (product carbon footprint (PCF))."
"We are enhancing the transpar-
ency of our portfolio and making it easier for business partners to select 
sustainable product alternatives and thus improve their own carbon 
footprint."
"The independent testing service provider TÜV Rheinland has 
certified the CO2Xplorer calculation method, thereby confirming that it 
meets the requirements of ISO 14067:2018 and the Together for Sustain-
ability PCF Guideline."
"We also see considerable potential for sustainable development in recy-
cling and the circular economy."
"In 2023, Brenntag entered into an agree-
ment with RubberJet Valley Group regarding the distribution of rubber 
powder and granules made from recycled end-of-life tires."
"The polymers 
produced through an environmentally friendly process are a suitable 
replacement for natural rubber."
"Together with our partners, we are thus 
helping to conserve resources, save on costs and diversify supply chains."
"Our long-term ESG strategy also includes assessing our sites worldwide 
for specific risks."
"We investigate physical climate risks, such as those 
arising from flooding, heatwaves or storms, in different global warming 
scenarios."
"In 2023, we worked hard to prepare ourselves for the German 
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act."
"For example, we carried out a risk 
assessment on several thousand of our suppliers in order to identify and 
minimize risks of human rights violations."
Sustainability criteria also play an important role for our own financing.
"In the reporting period, we linked the interest rates on our new, EUR 1.5 
billion credit facility to the achievement of specific ESG targets in a first 
for Brenntag."

The business model
Brenntag is the global market leader in chemicals and ingre-
dients distribution."
"The company plays a central role in con-
necting the chemical industry’s customers and suppliers."
"In 
the field of sustainability, Brenntag pursues specific goals 
and is committed to sustainable solutions in its own sector 
and the industries served."
"In this context, the company iden-
tifies the sustainability needs of its numerous customer indus-
tries and works together with its suppliers to develop appro-
priate products and services."
"In doing so, Brenntag also takes 
care to minimize the effects of its business activities on the 
environment by trying to prevent releases and reduce CO2 
emissions, for example."
"You can read more about the business 
model on page 142 of the Group management report."
"These 
are science-based, 1.5°C-aligned goals."
"In 2022, the company 
developed its sustainability vision Future Sustainable 
Brenntag and formulated an ESG strategy."
"The vision refers 
to Brenntag’s overarching set of long-term objectives and 
describes the basic direction."
"The strategy, in turn, describes 
the planned approach and the specific actions taken to 
achieve the sustainability vision."
"Brenntag’s ESG strategy is 
based on two different and equally important components."
"Firstly, the focus is on shrinking the carbon footprint, for exam-
ple by reducing emissions."
"At the same time, Brenntag strives 
to increase its positive contribution, such as by developing 
environmentally friendly products and solutions."
"These two 
points of focus are intended to drive meaningful and lasting 
changes for the company and society."
"From the ESG strategy, 
the company derives clearly defined and ambitious medium- 
and long-term goals along the value chain."
"Brenntag is 
thus shaping the sustainable future of global chemical 
 
distribution."
"Sustainability at Brenntag
Strategy
Brenntag aims to fulfill its responsibility and play a significant 
role in shaping the future of the industry."
"The company sup-
ports its partners in its networks and promotes collaboration 
and shared success."
"Sustainability has been an integral part of Brenntag’s corpo-
rate strategy for many years now."
"Since as far back as 2014, 
the company has been a member of the UN Global Compact 
and committed to its principles for human rights, labor stan-
dards, environmental protection and fighting corruption."
"Since October 2014, Brenntag has been involved in Together 
for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that 
works to enhance sustainability in the supply chain."
"In Octo-
ber 2016, Brenntag became the first chemical distributor to 
obtain full membership in TfS."
"In 2020, the CEO signed the Global Compact Statement from 
Business Leaders for Renewed Global Cooperation together 
with over 1,000 CEOs of companies from more than 100 coun-
tries."
"In 2021, Brenntag joined the global RE100 initiative, 
thereby pledging its commitment to the goal of sourcing 
100% renewable power by 2025."
"These eight SDGs are: good health and well-being; gender 
equality; affordable and clean energy; decent work and eco-
nomic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; 
reduced inequalities; responsible consumption and produc-
tion; climate action."

was judged to be still valid for 2023."
"The analysis included stakeholders such as employees, man-
agers, customers, suppliers, association representatives and 
investors."
"The findings of the stakeholder survey confirm the 
strategy and long-term Future Sustainable Brenntag vision: 
All topics identified as being material are also taken into 
account in the defined focus areas."
"These include customers, employ-
ees, suppliers and business partners along with investors and 
analysts, the media and other representatives of society."
"The 
aim is to keep stakeholders appropriately up to date on com-
pany developments and objectives and to create transpar-
ency."
"In return, this interaction enables the company to iden-
tify stakeholder expectations and give them appropriate 
consideration in its business decisions."
"As a member of relevant technical and industry associations 
at a local, regional and international level, Brenntag devotes 
time and attention to industry-specific issues."
"It is also essen-
tial to the success of the sustainability strategy that employ-
ees are kept fully informed about sustainability issues and 
given opportunities to actively participate."
"To this end, the 
company offers various communication channels, such as 
the sustainability magazine Sustainability Insights, the sus-
tainability newsletter and virtual information events."
"The 
global Brenntag intranet is also a source of information on 
news and developments."
"In order to meet these standards, 
Brenntag uses five core values to systematically guide its 
actions."
"All business activities and business relationships are 
shaped by these values."

our partners and the world."

and commitment."

We work toward common goals with focus 
and determination."

lence, innovation and collaboration."

"3.05 Values of Brenntag SE
Brenntag wishes to embed these values introduced at the end 
of 2022 in day-to-day business and ensure that employees 
live them."
"In 2023, a series of digital and analog options was 
delivered with the aim of encouraging employees to con-
sciously engage with the values, discuss them within the team 
and use them to guide their own actions."
"This begins during 
the new employee recruitment process, which is shaped by 
the Brenntag values, continues during human resources 
development and involves interaction both among employ-
ees and with external partners."
This is to be continued in 2024.
"ESG management and organization
Sustainability only becomes effective once it is firmly embed-
ded in organizational and management systems."
"The Super-
visory Board of Brenntag SE has established a separate 
Transformation and ESG Committee to enable the implemen-
tation and tracking of the corporate and sustainability strat-
egy, including sustainability objectives, to be monitored at the 
highest level of the company."
"The Committee is composed of 
Supervisory Board members Wijnand Donkers, Richard 
Ridinger and Ulrich Harnacke."
"In 2022, Brenntag established a Sustainability Council made 
up of managers from different regions and functions and 
headed by the CEO."
"The Sustainability Council met three 
times in the reporting period to discuss the implementation 
of the sustainability strategy and cross-function initiatives."
"In order to strengthen its commitment to sustainable gover-
nance, Brenntag’s objective for 2024 was to adapt the Board 
of Management remuneration system and explicitly imple-
ment ESG goals."
"These ESG goals are generally based on measurable, quan-
titative performance criteria derived from Brenntag’s sustain-
ability strategy."
"Sustainability Brenntag Group works to advance 
sustainability topics in a targeted manner throughout the 
company."

Brenntag Group."
"He reports directly to the CEO and is part of 
the global leadership team."
"This promotes the integration of 
sustainability topics in other areas of the Group and in the 
regions."
"In the Brenntag Essentials and Brenntag Specialties 
divisions, there are now dedicated roles that drive and 
assume responsibility for sustainability in business opera-
tions."
"In addition, the individual companies and sites pursue 
a large number of sustainability activities on their own, both 
regionally and locally."
"In order to implement the German Supply Chain Due Dili-
gence Act, a human rights officer was appointed for Brenntag 
back in 2022 before the Act entered into effect."
"This role is 
assumed by the VP Sustainability Brenntag Group."
"He sets out 
and oversees the management of human rights and environ-
mental risks and also keeps an eye on changes in the legal 
framework strictly adhered to by the company."
"The human 
rights officer reports directly to the CEO."
"Compliance and integrity
Brenntag has traditionally attached great importance to 
responsible, future-oriented and sustainable corporate gov-
ernance."
"In 2023, it continuously further developed its com-
pliance processes in order to continue to ensure that the com-
pany and its employees comply consistently with the laws, 
rules and guidelines of relevance to Brenntag."
"Among other 
things, this further development includes the organizational 
expansion of the compliance department, the extension of 
the internal compliance reporting system and the implemen-
tation of new, additional whistleblowing channels."
"The Senior Vice President (SVP) Compliance & Privacy 
Brenntag Group reports once a quarter to the Board of Man-
agement and the Audit and Compliance Committee, on a 
monthly basis to the Supervisory Board and to the CEO of the 
Brenntag Group."
"The Regional Compliance Managers based 
in the regions, who are assisted in their work by local compli-
ance contacts, regularly exchange information and experi-
ence with the SVP Compliance & Privacy Brenntag Group and 
the regional management."
"Based on the organizational 
developments at the company, reporting on the compliance 
management system will be refined accordingly in 2024."
"Brenntag has set up particularly safe and confidential points 
of contact for whistleblowers."
"In the reporting period, the 
compliance department provided employees and third par-
ties with new, additional whistleblowing channels for this pur-
pose."
A case handling system was also implemented.
"This is 
used primarily by the compliance and internal audit depart-
ments in the context of investigating reports."
"Fourteen 
­
confirmed cases were reported in 2023."
"One report of possible 
corrupt action was submitted and an investigation launched."
"In this case, the suspicion was not confirmed at the end of the 
investigation."
"In addition, two reports received in 2023 are still 
the subject of ongoing investigations."
"Employees and third 
parties can access the relevant whistleblowing channels 
through the Brenntag website."
"Seventeen confirmed cases 
were reported in the 2022 reporting period."
"In addition, two 
reports of possible corrupt action were submitted."
"In neither 
of the two cases was the suspicion confirmed at the end of 
the investigation."
"As a global company, Brenntag is subject to a large number 
of local, national and international laws and regulations."
"It is 
the responsibility of all employees to comply with these rules 
without exception."
"Examples of such internal regulations 
developed by Brenntag include the Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics, the Anti-corruption Guideline and other Group 
guidelines based on the corporate values."
"In addition, regu-
lations such as those on trade compliance, whistleblowing 
and the Supplier Code of Conduct were refined in the report-
ing period."
"Among other means, the new Brenntag Compliance intranet 
site, internal newsletters and other communication measures 
are used to familiarize employees with relevant topics and 
provide extensive materials, guidelines and manuals."
"Brenntag also offers regular training through resources such 
as the Group-wide e-learning platform in order to keep 
employees’ knowledge of compliance topics up to date."
"As an 
example, the online training module on the Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics is mandatory for employees once a year."
"This was completed by 96% of the relevant employees in the 
reporting period (2022: 94%)."
"In addition, based on their activ-
ity, employees took part in antitrust law training (completed 
by 96% of the relevant employees; 2022: 92%) and anti-cor-
ruption training (completed by 97% of the relevant employ-
ees; 2022: 91%)."
"Data protection
Group-wide data protection places particular requirements 
on Brenntag."
"Different statutory provisions must be observed 
at each of the Group’s international sites."
"At the same time, it 
is necessary to appropriately protect the interests of all data 
subjects and ensure that data protection standards are 
adhered to throughout the company."
"For this, the provisions 
of the General Data Protection Regulation and the require-
ments of numerous other international data protection laws 
(e.g."
"in Brazil, California (USA), China, South Africa, etc.) must 
be implemented and harmonized."
"As head of the Global Data Protection department, the Group 
Data Protection Officer reports independently and directly to 
the CEO at regular meetings."
"In 2023, the department under-
went expansion and further development of its organizational 
structure."
"Notably, the addition of a privacy engineer was 
made to enhance coverage of technological aspects within 
the area of data protection."
"Data protection coordinators in 
the various regions support the Global Data Protection 
department and report to the central unit."
"Data protection 
recommendations and developments are discussed with 
other departments at least once a quarter."
"The global data privacy management system introduced in 
2020 supports and automates the documentation of all pro-
cessing procedures worldwide, including the service providers 
involved and the corresponding risk analyses."
"Since the sys-
tem was introduced, data and processes have been man-
aged locally and controlled centrally."
"In 2023, the quality of 
documentation was further improved and the data protection 
coordinators in the regions received training in this regard."
"In 
2023, additional measures were implemented to advance the 
digitalization of data potection processes."
"Another point of 
focus was providing support to the Digital.Data.Excellence 
initiatives, including with regard to the auditing of service pro-
viders and projects."
"In addition, the project teams involved 
received comprehensive guidance."
"Internal audit
Brenntag’s governance model is based on the Three Lines 
Model."
"In addition to operational management (first line) and 
standard-setting functions such as compliance and risk 
management (second line), this provides for an internal audit 
function independent of day-to-day business (third line) within 
the corporate structure."
"Brenntag’s Group internal audit function is divided into 
regional audit teams based in Singapore, Houston (USA) and 
Essen (Germany) and functional teams for IT audits, forensic 
audits, audit policies and audit analytics."
"All teams and team 
leaders report to the Senior Vice President Internal Audit 
Brenntag Group, who reports to the CEO."
"The aim of Internal Audit is to protect the Group’s corporate 
values and gain insights into internal processes that are rel-
evant to the Group."
"For this purpose, it conducts independent 
audits of the effectiveness of processes and controls as well 
as compliance with internal guidelines, with these audits 
based on a risk-based audit plan."
"Audit findings are assessed 
with regard to the resulting risk for the Group."
"The results of 
the audits are reported to the Group Board of Management, 
the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee and other stake-
holders, such as subsidiaries’ management teams."
"Internal 
Audit also provides advisory services in accordance with the 
relevant professional standards."
"Internal Audit agrees measures to remedy the weaknesses 
with the units audited and monitors their implementation 
through suitable follow-up processes."
"Thirty-two audits were 
conducted in the Brenntag Group in the reporting period 
(2022: 28 audits)."
"In this context, a total of 205 (2022: 186) 
measures were agreed with the units audited."
"Tax policy
Adherence to applicable tax laws and regulations is an essen-
tial element of compliance (tax compliance)."
"In 2023, the 
Brenntag Group paid EUR 249.1 million (2022: EUR 344.9 mil-
lion) in income taxes."
"Brenntag’s tax policy is based on the following principles:
■	
All relevant tax laws, rules, regulations and reporting 
obligations in countries where Brenntag operates must 
be fully adhered to."
"■	
All tax matters are dealt with in accordance with 
Brenntag’s business strategy and the fundamental 
values specified in the Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics."
"■	
All tax matters are handled with professional diligence."
"■	
Brenntag maintains constructive and transparent rela-
tionships with tax authorities that are based on integrity, 
cooperation and mutual trust."
"■	
Brenntag attaches importance to sustainable tax plan-
ning in accordance with legal regulations."
"The Group 
does not engage in tax planning that is not related to 
business transactions."
"The Brenntag Group’s tax policy is specified by the Board of 
Management of Brenntag SE and implemented with the cen-
tral involvement of the Group Tax department."
"To comply with tax laws and regulations, Brenntag has begun 
to build a tax compliance management system (Tax CMS) 
within the meaning of IDW AuS 980, starting with the German 
subsidiaries."
"This system is to be rolled out across the Group 
on schedule at the end of 2024."
"The Tax CMS is continuously 
enhanced and always adapted to the latest legislation or 
court rulings."
"For information on the handling of tax risks, please refer to the 
practitioner’s report."
"This enables the portfolio to be steered toward greater sus-
tainability."
"The aim is to extend the product portfolio with 
regard to sustainability criteria in light of regional market 
requirements and trends in the customer industries."
"Brenntag benefits from the fact that its global presence and 
comprehensive application and product expertise mean that 
the company has knowledge of heavily regulated markets 
and an extensive supplier network."
"Brenntag can also lever-
age this knowledge in less regulated markets so as to proac-
tively offer appropriate products to customers wishing to 
comply with safety standards that go beyond regional regu-
lations."
"In the reporting period, Brenntag therefore developed 
a guideline with a view to reducing the use of substances of 
very high concern (SVHCs) in sold products at a concentration 
above 0.1 % not just in the EU, but worldwide."
"The company is 
concentrating on SVHCs on the EU-REACH authorization list 
(Annex XIV) and the EU-REACH candidate list."
"Initial steps toward a more sustainable product portfolio were 
taken through Brenntag’s own Step4Change initiative in the 
EMEA region back in 2020."
"Step4Change helps customers to 
reach their sustainability targets by identifying more sustain-
able product solutions from our partners that meet their 
needs and making them available quickly and flexibly."
"The 
business initiative by Brenntag Essentials EMEA made con-
siderable progress in 2023."
"For example, Step4Change 
entered into initial distribution agreements with customers 
and also signed agreements on the joint market development 
of sustainable products."
"In its quest to promote technological advancement in import-
ant industry segments such as e-mobility and chemical recy-
cling, Brenntag aims to develop strategies by the end of 2025."
"For the rapidly developing e-mobility market, Brenntag Essen-
tials Battery Materials and Solutions has already positioned 
itself along the value chain in lithium-ion batteries and similar 
technologies."
"Contact has been established with potential 
customers with a view to developing joint solutions for the 
supply of materials and value-added services."
"Portfolio steering
Brenntag aims to be the chemical industry leader in sustain-
ability."
"This includes the company focusing its product port-
folio more on innovative and sustainable products that result 
in greater efficiency, lower consumption and fewer impacts 
on people and the environment across the entire value chain."
"Close working relationships with customers and suppliers 
play an important role here."
"By offering sustainable products 
and solutions, the company provides its customers with ever 
better support in meeting their own sustainability targets."
"This 
also opens up further business opportunities for Brenntag."
"To this end, Brenntag aims to use sustainability criteria to 
steer 100% of the relevant product portfolio from the end of 
2025 onwards and to market more products that make a par-
ticular contribution to sustainability while reducing products 
that are negative contributors to sustainability."
"On its journey 
to a more sustainable product portfolio, Brenntag analyzed 
around 70% of its product portfolio from a sustainability per-
spective in an initial examination carried out in 2022."
"In the 
reporting period, Brenntag segmented in more detail around 
31% (sales in EUR) of its product portfolio using established 
methods such as the Portfolio Sustainability Assessment of 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) as its guide."
"Industry- and region-specific sustain-
ability trends and sustainability criteria for the products mar-
keted by Brenntag are identified at workshops with the 
respective business segments."
"In contrast to last year, the 
number of workshops is no longer a relevant metric, as seg-
mentation was carried out as a project this year and work-
shops were just one part of the implementation process."
"Sus-
tainability criteria can include RSPO certifications1) for the 
HI&I (Household, Industrial & Institutional Care) segment or 
biobased solvents, for example."
"This method is used to gen-
1)	 RSPO certification is obtained by companies that have themselves been 
audited by an independent certifier against the criteria of the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)."

Investment steering
Sustainability also plays a central role for Brenntag when it 
comes to assessing investments."
"Since 2022, ESG factors 
have been an integral part of due diligence on mergers and 
acquisitions."
"Brenntag prepares a sustainability appraisal on 
each acquisition candidate, in which it determines whether 
the company in question is a good fit with its own ESG strat-
egy."
"Among other things, the appraisals assess energy con-
sumption, energy sources and the products offered by the 
acquisition candidate that are classified as sustainable."
"Port-
folio risks relating to the acquisition candidate’s sustainability 
are also examined and incorporated into the investment 
assessment."
"Brenntag has developed a guideline specifically 
for this purpose."
"Eleven assessments were prepared for merg-
ers and acquisitions in the reporting period (2022: five assess-
ments)."
"Moreover, since 2022 the Sustainability department has been 
involved as a reviewer in investments related to sustainability 
and thus plays an important role in the decision-making pro-
cess."
"For example, the Sustainability department reviews 
investments in buildings or means of transport such as heavy 
goods vehicles, forklift trucks, etc."
"Whenever a decision on 
investments affects Brenntag’s carbon footprint, and where 
steering from a sustainability perspective is therefore appro-
priate, the review examines aspects such as whether the CO₂ 
targets are met."
"Brenntag pursues a sustainability strategy for its own build-
ings, too."
"In 2022, the Corporate Sustainable Building Guide-
line was introduced to this end."
"This requires each new 
Brenntag-owned building to be certified to defined sustain-
able building standards."
"Recognized standards include LEED, 
BREEAM and Green Star."
"Existing buildings also have to be 
certified to one of the aforementioned standards if there are 
any relatively large-scale modernization or renovation proj-
ects scheduled."
"No building projects were part of the Guide-
line in the reporting period."
"In 2022, the company launched a pilot project together with 
an external service provider with a view to identifying future 
physical climate risks for the Brenntag sites worldwide, for 
example as a result of rising sea levels or exceptional heat-
waves."
"The initial focus was on a qualitative assessment of 
each site’s exposure to such risks in different global warming 
scenarios."
"In the reporting period, the project was developed 
in greater detail by holding workshops with different depart-
ments."
"The focus here was on methodology, data quality and 
risk presentation."
"The results are to be used to increase the 
Brenntag sites’ resilience to changes in climatic conditions."
"As a global busi-
ness with a highly diversified supplier and customer structure, 
the company faces particular challenges, as it is confronted 
with different regional laws and requirements, industry stan-
dards and work cultures."
"Safe handling of chemicals 
At Brenntag, there is a combination of various aspects of 
health and safety."
"Chemical process safety provides the 
basis for the safe handling of chemicals."
"However, it is also 
important that all parties have the necessary risk aware-
ness and conduct themselves accordingly and that appro-
priate protective measures are introduced and adhered to."
"Added to this are the occupational safety issues arising 
from activities in transportation, storage, packaging and 
distribution."
"Responsibility for occupational safety also includes 
external transport companies, customers and contractors if 
they are working at Brenntag sites or if they are supplied by 
Brenntag."
"In order to fulfill this responsibility, Brenntag pursues a global, 
standards-based QSHE (quality, safety, health, environment) 
strategy."
"In this context, Brenntag standards are defined 
based on industry standards such as ISO 9001, Responsible 
Care / Responsible Distribution and the CCPS (Center for 
Chemical Process Safety) model."
"The QSHE strategy is built 
on four pillars: Culture, Team, Management System and Mon-
itoring & Controlling."
"Culture 
Throughout the Group, Brenntag operates in accordance 
with the “Safety First” principle, relying strongly on personal 
commitment and responsibility."
"Brenntag uses various meth-
ods to continuously raise employee awareness of occupa-
tional health and safety."
"Documented QSHE training tailored 
to the requirements of each activity provides the basis."
"This 
is supplemented by communication formats such as 
five-minute talks, lessons learned and best practices, which 
enable insights gained from incidents or examples of good 
working practices to be shared within the organization in a 
structured manner."
"Running for a certain period, there are also global and 
regional safety projects on a variety of topics."
"Individual crit-
ical problems are addressed in dedicated global campaigns 
so as to specifically raise awareness among employees in 
this area and ensure harmonized corrective and preventive 
measures."
"
The Brenntag Global QSHE Policy

The Brenntag Global QSHE Policy outlines the com-
pany’s goals and standards in relation to QSHE."
"Under this policy, it upholds quality, health, safety 
and environmental management standards in its 
activities."
"At all times, Brenntag strives for process 
safety, occupational health and safety, customer 
satisfaction, respect for the environment and con-
tinuous improvement."
"The company undertakes to 
provide the resources required for this."
"Employees 
share the company’s ethics and values, maintain 
exemplary behavior and take part in relevant safety 
training."
"The Brenntag Global QSHE Policy applies 
to all employees at all levels of the hierarchy and to 
all activities within the company."
"During the campaign and after it concluded, the number of 
such accidents fell significantly."
"At assessments and site vis-
its carried out in 2023, it was then examined how the content 
of the campaign had been implemented and adopted into 
the daily routine locally."
"In the reporting period, Brenntag ini-
tiated the Contractor Management campaign."
"This covers 
the criteria according to which contractors are selected, how 
preventive measures for safe working are developed in col-
laboration with contractors and how compliance with those 
measures is appropriately monitored."
"The first campaign in 
2024 will address fire safety."

The global Brenntag Enhanced Safety Thinking (BEST) pro-
gram also helps to raise awareness of safety."
"It consists of the 
Brenntag Safety Behavior Standard and an employee survey 
that builds on the behaviors described in the Standard."
"The 
aim is to evaluate safety behavior and safety awareness 
within the company and, if necessary, improve it by way of 
action plans."
"In all global regions, the most recent survey in 
2022 showed employees giving safety awareness and safety 
behavior a much better rating compared with the two previ-
ous editions in 2015 and 2018."
"The next survey is scheduled 
for 2025."
"Once a year, Brenntag presents the Global Safety Awards in 
two categories: the Safety Excellence Award for the best 
safety record and the Safety Phoenix Award for the strongest 
improvement in terms of safety."
"In 2023, the Mosquera site in 
Colombia (Safety Excellence Award) and the Montville site in 
France (Safety Phoenix Award) were honored for the achieve-
ments shown."
"Team 
In order to centralize its QSHE structure, Brenntag has estab-
lished a multinational team made up of QSHE experts work-
ing centrally and the QSHE directors of the global regions."
"They work closely together with the regional and local QSHE 
teams."
"Management system 
Brenntag operates an integrated QSHE management system 
focused on people, sites and their equipment and processes."
"The aim is to harmonize the different regional and local 
approaches, requirements and features within one global 
QSHE system."
"Internally, the company issued a global QSHE manual that 
combines its guidelines setting out company-wide minimum 
standards in QSHE."
"The content has since been regularly 
revised and updated in order to adapt relevant aspects and 
control measures accordingly."
"One important element of the QSHE management system at 
Brenntag is its participation in the international Responsible 
Care / Responsible Distribution (RC/RD) initiative of the Inter-
national Chemical Trade Association (ICTA)."
"Regardless of 
legal requirements, the initiative wishes to ensure that mem-
ber companies continuously improve their environmental and 
health performance and report openly on this progress on a 
regular basis."
"Brenntag companies with operating sites or 
with direct sales are expected to participate if national asso-
ciations offer a corresponding program1)."
"At the end of 2023, 
92 out of a total of 98 relevant companies were taking part in 
an RC/RD program (2022: 85 out of 87 relevant companies)."
"Ensuring safe handling of loose, unpackaged chemicals, 
termed bulk goods, requires safe facilities and processes."
"Brenntag has therefore established process safety man-
agement (PSM) programs at all sites worldwide that work 
with such bulk chemicals."
"For this, the sites conduct a 
self-assessment using a questionnaire based on the inter-
nationally recognized CCPS model, currently at intervals of 
one to two years."
"Within the QSHE organization, Brenntag 
has also built up an international team of PSM experts that 
supports the sites and carries out PSM assessments."
"Using 
a risk-based approach, a structured system was developed 
under which all sites concerned undergo a PSM assessment 
at least once every three years."
"The number of assessments 
carried out was increased from 20 in 2022 to 77 in the 
reporting period."
"To ensure quality, Brenntag aims for all operating sites to be 
certified to ISO 9001."
"Where useful and necessary, the com-
pany has supplemented or replaced this with further prod-
uct- or industry-related quality management systems2)."
"At 
the end of 2023, 363 of Brenntag’s 364 relevant sites world-
wide were certified accordingly (2022: 356 out of 364 rele-
vant sites)."
"1)	 RC/RD self-assessments can be used if an RC/RD program does not exist in 
the country."
"2)	 Management systems that Brenntag recognizes as substitutes for ISO 9001 
include: ISO 13485; ISO 22000; AS 9100; ISO/TS 16949;  
ISO 45001; GFSI systems; GMP/GDP/GMP+; FEMAS/FAMIQS;  
NACD Responsible Distribution."
"While local forces were fighting the fire, large quantities of 
fire-fighting water were used, causing retention capacity to 
be exceeded."
"As a result, products released from the ware-
house made their way into two streams and from there into 
Lake Ontario along with the fire-fighting water."
"Extensive 
clean-up and remediation measures were then immediately 
decided upon and carried out in consultation with the envi-
ronmental authorities."
"Accidental releases of products, energy and such like from 
process facilities are termed process safety events (PSEs)."
"In 2023, as in the previous year, there were eleven PSE12) 
(higher-category events with consequences such as injuries 
that lead to absence, exceeded threshold quantities or 
 
evacuation in the surrounding area)."
"Brenntag is therefore in 
line with the upper limit of twelve PSE1 set for the year as a 
whole."
"The aforementioned fire in Canada is not classed as a 
PSE because, based on the facts as they currently stand, it 
was not caused by a process."
"Despite the large quantity 
released, the release in Poland is classed as a PSE2 
 
(lower-category event), as there were no injured parties and 
the product’s potential for further damage is rated by the 
CCPS as being relatively low."
"Working conditions and employee benefits
Remuneration and employee benefits
Through their expertise and dedication, Brenntag’s employ-
ees make a decisive contribution to the company’s success."
"For this reason, the company wishes to attract the best staff 
available for selection in an appointment process, in terms of 
education and experience for example, and offer them an 
attractive, safe and inspiring environment."
"For the management level, Brenntag has introduced a per-
formance-related remuneration system."
"This consists of three 
components: a fixed annual base salary, a short-term vari-
able annual bonus and long-term variable remuneration."
"The 
variable remuneration is closely linked to personal perfor-
mance, the achievement of targets for predefined perfor-
mance indicators and the company’s results."
"In addition to 
the above-mentioned remuneration components, managers 
Monitoring & controlling 
Brenntag has established an extensive monitoring and con-
trolling system in order to continuously improve its safety 
measures."
"Since 2023, a new central QSHE reporting platform 
has been collating information from the regional systems."
"The 
Brenntag companies report on accidents and incidents in 
accordance with the Brenntag Global Standard Reporting 
Criteria."
"Brenntag also relies strongly on monitoring and con-
trolling as a preventive tool, such as in the case of near misses 
and in the form of safety inspections and certifications."
"Brenntag made further progress on occupational safety in 
the reporting period."
"The TRIR1) (Total Recordable Injury Rate) 
decreased from 2.7 in the previous year to 2.5 in the reporting 
period."
"Nevertheless, an employee of an external company 
engaged by Brenntag was unfortunately seriously injured by 
sulfuric acid in an accident at a tank farm in Germany."
"The 
insights gained and resulting actions fed directly into the Con-
tractor Management campaign."
"In Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland, for example, Brenntag fully revised its contractor 
management and extended it accordingly."
"All spillages in excess of 200 liters of liquid and solid products 
that are classified as dangerous goods in accordance with 
the international UN transport regulations are included in 
Brenntag’s total spillage rate."
"This rose from 0.83 in 2022 to 
1.11 spillages per million man-hours in 2023 and was there-
fore well above the target of no more than 0.80."
"At 83%, the 
rise in spillages of packaged goods, from intermediate bulk 
containers for example, was significantly higher than the 16% 
increase in spillages from process and bulk facilities."
"Such 
process spillages are a subset of the process safety events 
described below and often entail greater risks than those 
from packaging."
"Brenntag therefore places greater focus on 
this type of spillage at a global level and has also modified 
its target accordingly."
"By 2030, Brenntag intends to reduce 
the rate of process spillages by at least 25%, starting from 
1.88 cases per one million tonnes of outgoing products from 
warehouse locations in 2023."
"Brenntag sites are equipped 
with internal retention systems so that all spillages are col-
lected insofar as is possible."
"In an incident in which a storage 
tank in Poland failed, however, around 60 t of hydrochloric 
acid were not contained and some entered the soil."
"The nec-
essary clean-up measures were then agreed with the local 
authorities."
"1)	 Number of injured people who receive medical treatment beyond first aid per 
one million work hours."
"2)	 PSE classification is made based on the definitions of the CCPS (Center for 
Chemical Process Safety)."
"The revised CCPS guide in use since 2023, 
containing new criteria for classifying releases, leads to a lower number of 
PSE1."

receive contractually agreed benefits in kind and other ben-
efits."
"Depending on the country, benefits in kind may include 
payment of relocation costs, a company car or insurance, 
such as health insurance in the USA."
"Other benefits include 
rent or travel allowances, for example."
"One important part of Brenntag’s remuneration structure is 
pension provision, which Brenntag supports in a number of 
countries."
"The pension benefits differ according to the legal, 
tax and economic environment in the country in question and 
depend on the number of years of service and the pay grade 
of the respective employee."
"In 2023, Brenntag also implemented a living wage policy that 
specifies that the salaries of all Brenntag employees should 
meet living wage standards."
"Brenntag works together with an 
organization that provides living wage data for all the coun-
tries in which Brenntag operates."
"In accordance with the 
guideline, Brenntag completes an annual process to identify 
any living wage gaps (gap analysis), where remuneration at 
Brenntag is compared against the living wage data."
"Any gaps 
are to be permanently closed."
"In some countries in which the 
company operates, the statutory minimum wages are less 
than an adequate income."
"In the reporting period, a gap anal-
ysis was again carried out together with external service pro-
viders with a view to determining where at Brenntag there are 
employees whose salaries do not meet living wage stan-
dards."
"Any gaps brought to light by the analysis were then 
closed by making appropriate salary adjustments, as a result 
of which no members of staff were employed below living 
wage standards at the end of the reporting period."
"Global framework ‘New Work’ 
Throughout the Group, Brenntag places emphasis on agile 
and flexible working."
"The company is open to opportunities to 
make working at Brenntag more flexible around the globe, 
and has implemented appropriate measures."
"The framework under the title ‘New Work – Towards Greater 
Flex’, which was developed by Global HR in close cooperation 
with the regional and local human resources departments at 
the international sites, provides the basis for this."
"It includes 
the guiding principles for creating a more flexible work envi-
ronment in all Brenntag regions, business units and functions, 
bearing in mind local differences."
"Various countries have already entered into works agree-
ments on flexible working."
"In Germany, for example, the pro-
visions stipulate that Brenntag employees are entitled to 
three days’ mobile working a week, provided this is compati-
ble with their job profile."
"The measures to enhance flexibility are intended to help make 
working conditions at Brenntag as safe and fair as possible 
and counteract employee turnover."
"The key indicator 
employee turnover is determined centrally for each Brenntag 
company on a quarterly basis and reported to Global HR."
"Due 
to regional and country-specific differences, the figures are 
analyzed at local level."
"In the event of atypical deviations, the 
causes are identified, and suitable measures are taken as 
needed."
"In the reporting period, voluntary employee turnover 
across the Brenntag Group was 7.8% (2022: 9.4%)."

"Diversity and inclusion
As a company with operations worldwide, Brenntag employs 
staff from over 100 nations."
"Diversity at Brenntag encom-
passes several aspects, such as employees’ different cultural 
backgrounds, qualifications and needs."
"Through the 
exchange of knowledge, ideas and experience, diversity 
makes a decisive contribution to Brenntag’s success."
"The 
company wishes to foster this exchange and further increase 
the diversity of the workforce so as to create a cosmopolitan 
work culture and a dynamic work environment where all 
employees can learn from one another."
"The associated goal of 
setting up a global organizational diversity, equity and inclu-
sion structure in 2023 has already been partially achieved."
"The developments in the North America region, where a new 
DE&I1) structure was introduced with sponsors at the most 
senior management level, are particularly worthy of note."
"The 
plan for 2024 is to drive the further development of global 
DE&I."
"Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are also an important ele-
ment of diversity management."
"Led by employees, these 
groups aim to promote a diverse and integrative workplace."
"In addition to the ERG for women already established in the 
EMEA region, a steering group and a sponsor at the most 
senior management level were put in place for an ERG for 
women in North America."
Brenntag strives for diversity at all levels of the company.
"The 
aim by 2030 is to increase the percentage of women at all

"The diversity policy for Brenntag’s Supervisory 
Board likewise stipulates a line-up that is as diverse as pos-
sible in terms of the age, gender, education, career path and 
international experience of the members."
"Among other things, 
the policy stipulates that at least a third of the seats should

"Advancement of women at Brenntag

The company has initiated various mentoring and 
coaching programs with a view to providing women 
at Brenntag with targeted support to promote their 
professional development."
"‘Women at Brenntag’ is a 
six-month coaching program with external coaches 
that is open to all women at Brenntag who have 
been working for the company for at least two years."
"In group and individual coaching sessions, they learn 
strategies that help them in their professional devel-
opment."
The program takes place once a year.
"Women at all career levels can apply, provided their 
line managers approve their application to the pro-
gram."
"In 2023, there were 64 participants (2022: 174 
participants)."
"‘Inspire and Grow’ is an internal mentoring program 
with mentors from the Global Leadership Team or 
senior management level at Brenntag."
"The aim of the 
program is to actively nurture outstanding female 
talent."
"Managers can suggest suitable employees for 
the program."
"In order to better meet the changing conditions and require-
ments in day-to-day professional and private life and support 
people with different family backgrounds, Brenntag is pro-
moting a flexible way of working (see ‘New Work’ in the section 
on working conditions and employee benefits)."
"Brenntag nurtures the strengths and potential of disabled 
people and optimally integrates their skills so as to create an 
atmosphere that puts people with and without disabilities on 
a level playing field."
"Since 2020, Brenntag has been a member 
of the Valuable 500 initiative."
"This brings together the leaders 
of 500 international companies who have undertaken to put 
disability inclusion on their management agenda."
"People development and training
Brenntag wishes to develop its employees according to their 
talents and qualifications."
"Across all levels of the company 
and at all sites, it establishes a culture of learning and gives 
employees numerous opportunities to develop professionally 
and personally."
"The individual and continuous support given 
to our employees accords with Brenntag’s corporate values 
(see Values, page 93)."
"In this context, the company places 
emphasis on development measures and a feedback culture 
at all levels that is also part of the training programs."
"Brenntag offers several learning programs aimed at different 
target groups."
"Connecting Potential 
This six-month program is aimed at employees at the start of 
their career who could take on leadership roles at Brenntag

Leading to New Horizons 
This newly introduced development program is aimed at 
experienced managers."
"Thirty-seven managers took part in 
this eight-month program in the reporting period."
"Other options such as language courses, online learning, 
coaching based on individual needs and mandatory training 
such as compliance training are aimed at employees at all 
levels of the hierarchy."
"Brenntag has also established a reg-
ular Global Learning Time newsletter to flag up specific con-
tent on the company’s own learning platform and foster the 
culture of learning within the company."
"Through all these 
training and development options, Brenntag wishes to train 
and upskill its employees in a targeted manner so that they 
can successfully master current challenges and future roles."
"Even after the restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-
19 pandemic came to an end, Brenntag continued to make 
its training and continuing education options flexible and ini-
tiated more digital learning options."
"Due to the positive 
response from employees, the company continued and 
expanded virtual learning formats in the reporting period."
"In 
doing so, Brenntag was able to build on its already-extensive 
online learning range and thus further enhance it."
"One key 
success factor here is its internal preparation of digital learn-
ing content with a focus on Brenntag-specific topics – “by us 
for us” as it were."
"Due to increased demand for individual 
coaching for the purposes of personal and professional devel-
opment, coaching has become a significant element of the 
culture of learning at Brenntag."
"Responsible partner
Supply chain and human rights
As the global market leader in chemicals and ingredients dis-
tribution, Brenntag takes its responsibility to uphold human 
rights very seriously."
"The company undertakes to respect 
human rights worldwide within its supply chains."
"These are 
among Brenntag’s top principles."
"Brenntag is a member of 
the UN Global Compact and committed to its ten principles 
for human rights, labor standards, fair remuneration, environ-
mental protection and fighting corruption."
"Worldwide, the 
company works to ensure fair working relationships and, as 
described in the sustainability strategy, acts as a responsible 
partner to suppliers."
"In order to meet this aspiration, Brenntag 
has implemented numerous measures developed centrally 
by various departments such as Sustainability, Legal and 
Compliance Brenntag Group."
"In addition, the human rights 
officer has been responsible for human rights risk manage-
ment since 2022 and regularly reports on this to the CEO."
"Employees can report human rights violations via the whis-
tle-blowing system."
"External third parties can also use this 
system."
"The system was further developed in the reporting 
period (see Compliance and integrity, page 94)."
"As was also 
the case in the previous year, Brenntag did not receive any 
reports of human rights violations within the company in the 
reporting period."
"Brenntag tries to minimize the risk of human rights violations 
in its complex supply chains by communicating its expecta-
tions to suppliers at the beginning of the business relation-
ship."
"In its Supplier Code of Conduct, Brenntag requests that 
they actively work to protect human rights within the organi-
zation and their supply chains."
"In the reporting period, this 
Supplier Code of Conduct was updated to meet the extended 
requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act 
(LkSG)."
"Since 2016, Brenntag has been a member of the industry’s 
Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative."
"One core element 
of the joint work within TfS involves audits or online assess-
ments of companies in the chemical industry, for example."
The aim is to always to create and leverage synergies.
"The 
central idea behind the audits and assessments is that a sup-
plier assessment can be used by all member companies, 
thereby reducing the cost and effort for suppliers."
"EcoVadis evaluates companies in terms of 
four categories: environment, labor and human rights, ethics 
and sustainable procurement."
"In doing so, it scores the com-
panies’ sustainability performance on a scale from 0 to 100."
"In addition, each company receives a detailed overview of 
strengths and weaknesses as well as specific suggestions for 
improvement."
"In the reporting period, Brenntag continued to see its suppli-
ers making considerable advances in improving their sustain-
ability performance."
"By the end of 2023, for example, it 
appeared that 60% (2022: 69%) of suppliers who underwent 
re-assessment had improved their score compared with the 
previous year.1) 
Brenntag itself also undergoes an EcoVadis assessment on a 
regular basis."
"In the most recent assessment published in 
December 2022, the company improved on its previous score 
and achieved 77 points (previous assessment: 71 points), the 
highest result in the company’s history since assessments 
began in 2014."
"Brenntag was awarded the EcoVadis platinum 
metal for this result and thus ranks among the top 1% of all 
companies rated by EcoVadis."
"On sustainable procurement, 
the company scores a particularly high 90 out of a possible 
total of 100 points and is rated as outstanding."
"Brenntag obtains a more detailed picture of sustainability 
performance by performing on-site supplier sustainability 
audits."
"In this case, the audits are based on a catalog of 
requirements developed by TfS and cover sustainability man-
agement, the environment, health and safety, employee and 
human rights, and corporate governance."
"The results of all 
audits are shared within TfS."
"Like the other TfS members, 
Brenntag also accepts sustainability audits conducted in 
accordance with SQAS (Safety and Quality Assessment Sys-
tem), SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) and PSCI 
(Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative) standards."
"Brenntag 
reviews its suppliers’ audit results."
"If necessary, it agrees on 
corrective measures with the supplier and the auditor and 
follows up on their implementation."
"In the reporting period, Brenntag also initiated further signif-
icant steps to augment the existing human rights risk man-
agement system in order to prepare itself for future statutory 
provisions, such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence 
Act."
"Brenntag will first fall under the Supply Chain Due 
­
Diligence Act in 2024, as the company employs fewer than 
3,000 staff in Germany."
"The measures include expanding the cross-function project 
team entrusted with implementing the due diligence obliga-
tions, for example."
"The interdisciplinary project team consists 
of experts from the fields of sustainability, QSHE (quality, safety, 
health and environment), compliance, legal and procure-
ment."
"In the field of sustainability, the team was augmented 
by adding an employee who deals solely with human rights."
"In the reporting period, the innovative IT solution of a third-
party provider was established based on preparations 
already made for the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act in 2022, 
enabling a risk analysis to be produced."
"This risk analysis 
serves as a basis for preparing a guideline for preventive 
measures and is part of our holistic approach to risk manage-
ment."
"This includes carrying out extensive risk analysis and 
prioritization, and building on that by initiating preventive 
measures."
"Our aim is to have all suppliers covered by risk 
management as of 2024."
"The multi-step process includes an initial risk analysis that 
takes into account sector and industry risks as well as the 
degree of influence that Brenntag is able to exercise over the 
supplier in question."
"All suppliers on the platform are assigned 
to four different risk categories based on a score from 1 to 100 
and prioritized accordingly."
"For suppliers for which this results 
in an increased risk profile, detailed AI2)-supported screening 
is also carried out for potential incidents on the supplier’s side."
"For 100% of the suppliers categorized as high-risk, Brenntag 
has also assigned internal responsibilities so as to ensure that 
potential human rights risks at the supplier’s end are 
addressed and thus reduced."
"Additional preventive measures are based on the existing 
risk management system and include EcoVadis supplier 
audits, TfS audits and the Supplier Code of Conduct."
"In addi-
tion, the company has prepared and published a Policy 
Statement on Human Rights."
"In this context, internal training 
sessions were conducted for the employees concerned from 
the human resources, QSHE, legal, compliance and procure-
ment departments."
"Brenntag will continue working to also train its suppliers more 
on sustainability issues, to which end it will make greater use 
of the TfS Academy or e-learning resources, for example."
"In 
1)	 The KPI “Coverage of purchasing volume by sustainability certifications” is no 
longer reported."
"In the reporting year, Brenntag started to change the ESG 
assessment system for its suppliers."
"Together for Sustainability (TfS)

Together for Sustainability is a chemical industry initia-
tive."
"It wishes to make the sector more sustainable by 
gradually establishing a uniform global program for the 
responsible procurement of goods and services in the 
chemical industry."
"The aim of TfS is to increase trans-
parency over sustainability in the supply chain and 
improve environmental and social standards worldwide."
"TfS was established in 2011 and currently has 50 mem-
bers."
"In 2023, the member companies generated com-
bined revenues of over EUR 800 billion."
"The members 
evaluate and review their suppliers by means of a stan-
dardized process using assessments and audits."
"This 
information is shared confidentially and used jointly 
within the network, which provides efficiency benefits 
for every member and creates more transparency."
"TfS also develops standards and guidelines for the 
industry, including the Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) 
Guideline (see Environment, page 108)."
"This assists 
manufacturers and suppliers in determining the envi-
ronmental footprint of their products."
"Brenntag was 
involved in developing the Guideline."
"In addition, tailored 
learning and development courses are offered through 
the TfS Academy in order to train TfS member compa-
nies’ procurement teams and their suppliers in sustain-
ability matters."
"Through its involvement at TfS, Brenntag actively helps 
to make the chemical industry more sustainable."
"The 
interaction at workshops, the sharing of members’ best 
practices and the synergies from the EcoVadis assess-
ments and audits help the company to promote sus-
tainability across the board and worldwide."
"Environmental protection and efficiency 
measures are implemented at the company’s sites worldwide 
in the context of local and regional conditions and legislative 
requirements."
"The focus here is on energy and water con-
sumption, the protection of soil, water and air, waste reduc-
tion, and transport and fleet management."
"Climate protection plays a particularly important role in 
Brenntag’s ESG strategy, as the entire value chain is affected."
"Not only do Brenntag’s own activities produce CO2 emissions; 
the products that the company buys have also emitted 
greenhouse gases during their manufacture."
"Moreover, cli-
mate protection is important to many of Brenntag’s custom-
ers."
"The CEO of the Brenntag Group is therefore responsible 
for climate protection as part of his direct responsibility for 
Sustainability Brenntag Group, which has functional man-
agement responsibility for all climate protection-related mat-
ters."
"As a result, the CEO is responsible, among other things, 
for developing CO2 reduction targets, monitoring target 
achievement, driving forward measures to achieve targets 
and promoting climate-related issues in different areas of the 
company."
"The Vice President Sustainability Brenntag Group 
is involved in all important investment decisions as well as 
decisions regarding mergers and acquisitions so that align-
ment with the climate protection strategy can be ensured in 
these areas, too."
"For Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, i.e."
"The company also wants to procure 100% of 
its electricity from renewable sources3) by 2025."
"In order to 
achieve the net-zero target, Brenntag intends to gradually 
replace company cars and forklift trucks with low-carbon 
alternatives, substitute heating systems with sustainable 
alternatives such as heat pumps, and switch the truck fleet 
over to carbon-free transport, for example."
"In accordance 
with technological developments (e.g."
"in the case of electric 
trucks), conditions at the individual sites (e.g."
"available 
charging infrastructure) and the need for replacements (e.g."
"in the case of heating systems), the focus here will first be on 
replacing company cars and forklift trucks, then heating sys-
tems and trucks."
"A further aim is to offset 100% of unavoid-
able emissions from 2025 onward."
"With regard to Scope 3 emissions, which include all other indi-
rect emissions generated in a company’s value chain, 
Brenntag wants to work together with its suppliers and data 
service providers to create a better data set."
"On this basis, the 
company wants to reduce Scope 3 emissions through sus-
tainable portfolio steering, for example."
"A Scope 3 emissions 
reduction target has not yet been set and is to be developed 
in 2024."
"In 2022, Brenntag pledged its commitment to the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) that it would set science-based 
targets by October 2024."
"The SBTi is a joint climate protection 
initiative between WRI, CDP, WWF and the UN Global Com-
pact."
"It helps companies to set science-based climate tar-
gets."
"The Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets are 
already partly guided by the SBTi specifications."
"Brenntag 
had already expressed its commitment to climate protection 
(100% renewable electricity by 2025) and contributed to rais-
ing awareness of this issue among employees by joining the 
RE100 initiative back in summer 2021."
"RE100 provides a 
global guideline where businesses pledge to source 100% 
renewable electricity over the medium term."
1)	 Reduction with respect to the sites already included in the 2020 base year.
New sites will be tracked separately.
"2)	 The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate 
change."
"It was adopted by 196 parties at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 
2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016."
"Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, compared with pre-industrial levels."
"3)	 Electricity from renewable sources which we procure through direct supply 
contracts, by purchasing guarantees of origin and by generating it on site."
"emissions from fuels and coolants at the 
company’s own site or from the company’s own ve-
hicle fleet."
"Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the 
generation of purchased energy, e.g."
"electricity or 
district heating from an energy provider."
"
Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emis-
sions produced in upstream and downstream sup-
ply chains, e.g."
"through the purchase and sale of 
goods and services, employee mobility, and the pro-
cessing and use of sold products."
"Energy and Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Brenntag established Group-wide energy reporting back 
 
in 2016."
"Information on the sites’ energy consumption is 
 
collected on a quarterly basis."
"The Brenntag sustainability 
team centrally consolidates the data, evaluates them and 
calculates the associated direct and indirect greenhouse 
 
gas emissions."
"During 2023 Brenntag started to track the 
emissions related to refrigerants."
"This inventory will continue 
during 2024."
"To increase transparency over Scope 2 emissions, Brenntag 
has calculated these emissions using the market-based 
method in addition to the location-based method since 2020."
"In the case of the location-based method, location-based, 
average emission factors in the region where energy con-
sumption occurs are used for the calculation."
"In the case of 
the market-based method, the calculation uses the emission 
factors of the energy supplier or an individual electricity prod-
uct."
"Using the market-based method enables company- 
specific purchases of energy from renewable sources to be 
presented in a more transparent manner."
"It is therefore used 
as the basis for the following information and for setting tar-
gets."
"The calculations under the location-based method 
serve only to facilitate comparability with earlier reports."
Brenntag achieved – 22.2% (2022: –9.3%).
"Includ-
ing acquisitions recognized from 2021, the reduction is – 15.6% 
(2022: – 7.0%)."
"If the specific emission 
factor of the purchased electricity (e.g."
"of the energy producer) was available, 
the factor has been applied in the market-based method instead of the 
country-specific factor."
"Since not all energy consumption 
could be reported at the time of the audit, extrapolations were made."
"In the 
reporting period, the extrapolated emissions for 2022 (for the 2022 report) were 
compared against the real values determined in the course of Q1 2023."
"This 
resulted in only minimal changes (<0.3%), as a result of which only a low level of 
uncertainty can be assumed for this year’s extrapolations."

2)	 Compared with the base year.
"The main contributor to the reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emis-
sions was the company’s continued drive in the reporting 
period to purchase electricity from renewable energy sources 
(2025 target: 100%)."
"In the reporting period, the share was 
82% (2022: 82%)."
"Brenntag procures electricity from renew-
able sources by generating it on site, through direct supply 
contracts and by purchasing guarantees of origin."
"It is 
intended to install solar panels at sites where this is techni-
cally possible (e.g."
"there must be no storage of flammable 
liquids) and makes financial sense."
"In the reporting period, 
solar panels were installed and put into operation at the 
Brenntag site in Santa Fe Springs (USA) and Brenntag Ingred."
"These supplement the existing 
installations on Brenntag warehouses and offices in places 
such as Anelo and Zarate (Argentina), Kandrzin-Cosel 
(Poland), Padua (Italy), Singapore and Gurugram (India)."
"­
Further savings were achieved by switching partly to biodiesel 
in filling up company cars, for example."
"Biodiesel’s share of 
total diesel consumption was 0.5% in the reporting period 
(2022: N/A)."
1)	 Reduction with respect to the sites already included in the 2020 base year.
New sites will be tracked separately.
"In 
the reporting period, 43 project ideas for cutting the green-
house gas emissions produced by the respective sites were 
submitted for internal funding from the resulting central bud-
get for 2024 (approximately EUR 6.6 million)."
"Awareness and 
the appeal of the program increased compared with the pre-
vious year, when 16 project proposals were submitted."
"The 
projects put forward range from purchasing electric com-
pany cars and trucks plus charging stations to replacing gas 
heating systems with heat pumps and installing solar panels."
"The Traun site in Austria is even aiming to complete the switch 
to being a zero-emissions site in the next few years."
"Brenntag 
determines who is awarded the support on the basis of factors 
such as the projects’ potential emissions savings and innova-
tive spirit as well as the opportunity to gain experience and 
foster the cultural transition toward greater sustainability."
"The 
eleven projects that were awarded support in 2022 were 
mostly implemented in the reporting period."
"The first electric 
trucks are now in operation in the USA and Brazil, for example, 
sites in Belgium and Switzerland are being heated using heat 
pumps, and the installation of charging stations at a number 
of sites worldwide enables electric vehicles to be charged."
"In addition, back in 2022 Brenntag began to offset unavoid-
able Scope 1 and 2 emissions through certified projects."
"In 
2023, 45% (2022: 26%) were offset in this way."
"This percentage 
is to be increased each year in order to offset 100% of the 
remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025."
"In the reporting period, two different carbon offset projects 
were selected that cover additional sustainability targets: 
producing green energy in Indonesia and supplying the pop-
ulation with clean drinking water in Uganda."
"Both offset proj-
ects take place in countries where Brenntag itself has sites, 
and meet the certified emission reduction (CER) quality stan-
dard."
"On these projects, greenhouse gas emissions are saved 
and CO2 certificates generated, which Brenntag uses to off-
set its own emissions."
"The Ulubelu geothermal power plant in 
South Sumatra is expected to produce 867,000 MWh of 
renewable energy a year and thus save a total of around 
581,000 t of CO2e."
"The drinking water project in Uganda not 
only reduces greenhouse gas emissions; it is also intended to 
serve the health of over a million people, improve their stan-
dard of living and protect forests by dispensing with the need 
for firewood to boil drinking water."
"Scope 3 emissions 
To create more transparency over environmental impacts in 
the value chain, Brenntag has also included Scope 3 emis-
sions in its reporting since 2020."
"emissions from 
purchased chemicals, was identified as the main Scope 3 
emission source and accounts for approximately 98% of total 
calculated emissions1)."
"In the reporting period, the Scope 3.1 
calculation was switched to an improved data source (Car-
bon Minds), rather than solely to generic ecoinvent data."
"This 
explains the year-on-year increase."
"Emissions resulting from 
outbound transport carried out by external companies (cat-
egories 3.4 and 3.9) decreased compared with the previous 
year due to the updated emission factor."
"A target has not yet 
been developed for Scope 3 emissions."
"In 2023, Brenntag worked intensively to further improve the 
quality of the data."
"In particular, it looks at transportation by 
external companies and the products purchased by Brenntag."
"Under the transportation management system (TMS), it is cur-
1)	 Scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based method) and emissions in the 
following Scope 3 categories: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.9."
"Carbon management program

The carbon management program is an innovative, 
internal incentive system for climate protection 
measures with an internal CO2e price: Each 
Brenntag company is held accountable for the 
emissions it causes through a set internal price for 
the emissions."
"The amount generated under this 
system is paid virtually into an internal climate pro-
tection fund, which provides the resulting budget."
"Each company or site can apply for this budget by 
submitting greenhouse-gas-saving projects."
"Brenntag is relying on the inventiveness of its em-
ployees to propose innovative projects that best fit 
the local conditions."
"At the end of each year, the 
emissions caused are compared against the 
Brenntag Group’s desired emissions reduction tar-
get toward net zero."
"In the following year, the CO2e 
price is set based on the results."
"This is intended to 
create a stronger incentive to reduce emissions 
while simultaneously increasing the budget to fund 
projects."
"Responsibility for setting the internal price 
and selecting the projects that are to receive sup-
port lies with the Sustainability Council."

"The PCF service 
named CO2Xplorer aims to promote and improve transpar-
ency over greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with a view to driv-
ing the reduction of emissions throughout the supply chain."
"In 
addition to suppliers’ primary data, Brenntag uses carbon 
footprints from an external data provider that provides coun-
try-specific data for a number of chemicals."
"Brenntag’s own 
distribution-related emissions are also included in the overall 
calculation."
"In the reporting period, the calculation method 
was certified by the independent external testing service pro-
vider TÜV Rheinland following a systematic review."
"This con-
firms that Brenntag’s PCF methodology meets the require-
ments of the internationally recognized ISO 14067:2018 
standard and the Together for Sustainability (TfS) PCF Guide-
line."
"It was also determined that the principles underlying the 
method are generally suitable for assessing the potential 
effects of chemicals on greenhouse gas emissions."
"At present, very few values are available from suppliers 
(<1%)."
"The company therefore works together with specialist 
providers such as Carbon Minds in order to calculate second-
ary data that are as precise as possible and uses other data-
bases in order to estimate Scope 3 emissions as precisely as 
possible."
2)	 Not included in Scope 1 or 2.
3)	 The values given for incoming transportation and direct business have not been audited by Deloitte.
"Every year, 
CDP compares more than ten thousand companies world-
wide in terms of their strategic approach to the challenges of 
climate change and assesses their climate management sys-
tem based on a comprehensive catalog of criteria."
"Other emissions
Emissions such as NOx (nitrogen oxides) and SOx (sulfur 
oxides) are not relevant to Brenntag as a chemical distributor."
"In order to counter the potential impact of VOC emissions (vol-
atile organic compounds)1), VOCs are treated in accordance 
with the respective applicable legal framework."
"Depending 
on technical conditions, this involves the application of acti-
vated carbon filters in exhaust air, the use of incinerators or 
gas displacement when filling containers."
"Transport and fleet management 
To keep the fuel consumption and harmful emissions of the 
vehicle fleet to a minimum, trips are planned as efficiently as 
possible through structured transport logistics."
"In the course 
of transport planning, systems that differ locally are used for 
effective transport management."
"The transport network is 
analyzed for potential synergies and optimized."
"The aim in 
this context is to combine volumes by allocating hubs or 
cross-docks."
"Make-or-buy analyses aim to determine the opti-
mum fleet size bearing in mind efficiency criteria."
"By using its 
own vehicle fleet, Brenntag creates synergies between incom-
ing and outgoing shipments, particularly in empty-container 
management."
"Delivery frequency analyses provide the basis 
for optimizing shipment sizes with the aim of further increas-
ing the vehicles’ capacity utilization rate."
"Requesting freight 
quotations for intermodal transportation on suitable trans-
port routes is an integral part of strategic freight service pro-
curement and enables the use of more environmentally-friendly 
modes of transport."
"Operational planning aims to optimize 
freight capacity utilization and is supported by strategic 
analyses and the strategic procurement of freight services."
"In addition, more and more Brenntag companies are using 
telematics systems in order to optimize the use of their vehicle 
fleets."
"They record vehicle- and trip-related data and thus 
facilitate safe and eco-efficient driving."
"The data captured 
through a telematics system serve as the basis for the fuel and 
energy report."
"Metrics such as the ratio of distance traveled 
to fuel consumption, estimated CO2 emissions and idle times 
create transparency and provide information on the fuel effi-
ciency and the fuel consumption of the vehicles in the fleet."
"1)	 Organic materials that vaporize into the gas phase at room temperature or 
higher temperatures, i.e."
"The company implements 
appropriate environmental protection measures at all sites."
"Depending on conditions and the nature of the products, this 
may include multi-stage retention systems or water treat-
ment facilities, for example."
"Any soil and groundwater con-
tamination that is known to already exist is regularly reviewed 
and assessed in the course of the annual IFRS project."
"Resource efficiency measures such as water and waste are 
implemented at process level by the QSHE department."
"Prod-
uct- and service-specific matters such as the use of critical 
materials and recycling options are handled by the operating 
business."
"The overarching sustainability reporting and the 
consolidation of the topics are the responsibility of Sustain-
ability Brenntag Group."
"Waste 
The Brenntag sites have established processes for the han-
dling of waste that are appropriate to the nature and scale 
of their business."
"The company maintains constant dialog 
with the national umbrella associations of chemical dealers 
with a view to further improving waste management."
"The 
common goal is to reduce the volume of waste in the industry 
and increase recycling rates."
"Brenntag gives its employees regular training on the handling 
of chemical products, including with regard to storage and 
transportation, in order to avoid unnecessary waste from the 
outset and reduce the volume of waste."
"The company also 
carries out various measures to reduce the environmental 
impacts of waste in countries where legal requirements for 
avoiding and separating waste are not yet implemented to 
the same extent as they are in the EU."
"All sites in the Latin 
America region, for example, are required to systematically 
separate waste."
"As part of its digital enhancements, the company is central-
izing global waste tracking."
"This initiative aims to standardize 
and improve waste monitoring at a global level, and reflects 
Brenntag’s commitment to end-to-end waste management."
"Brenntag is currently in the data capture and process adap-
tation phase."
"In the reporting period, an analysis of the vari-
ous data capture processes across all global regions was 
carried out for this purpose."
"Brenntag’s future aim is to improve and harmonize waste 
reporting for all operating sites."
"One important milestone 
planned for 2024 is the provision of corporate guidelines and 
the development of reporting functions for waste management."
"Water
Brenntag uses water in many areas of its business operations, 
for example to produce solutions, to clean pipe systems and 
to cool or heat chemicals and tank facilities."
"The total amount 
of water consumed depends to a significant extent on the 
nature and scope of the products and services being handled."
"Water consumption is therefore subject to fluctuations and 
differs from site to site."
"Brenntag also consumes water in operating the buildings and 
plants, for example in sanitary facilities or to clean surfaces, 
road tankers and buildings."
"The used water is treated in 
wastewater treatment facilities that purify it in line with stat-
utory regulations before being returned to the system."
"Brenntag obtains water mainly from the public water supply 
network."
"Some sites also use other types of water supply, such 
as rainwater or their own wells."
"Brenntag’s aim here is to min-
imize water consumption and be economical with resources 
in all processes."
"The site in Zarate (Argentina), for example, 
captures rainwater, treats it and uses it for industrial purposes."

REPORT
As part of its digital enhancements, the company is central-
izing the global recording of water consumption."
"This initiative 
aims to standardize and improve water consumption moni-
toring at a global level, and reflects Brenntag’s commitment 
to end-to-end water management."
"Brenntag is currently in 
the data capture and process adaptation phase."
"In the 
reporting period, the company conducted an analysis in order 
to better understand in a global context where there are 
regional differences in water management."
"In 2024, Brenntag wishes to improve and harmonize the 
reporting for all operating sites."
"The company therefore plans 
to develop corporate guidelines and reporting functions for 
water consumption."
"Packaging
Brenntag has a strategy for reused packaging (reusable 
packaging)."
"The aim is to reduce the need to purchase pack-
aging materials by designing standardized packaging and 
increasing the fill weight per package."
"In collaboration with 
customers, Brenntag is also working to increase packaging 
material return rates."
"Tracking tools and software solutions 
are being examined in order to make the lifecycle of the indi-
vidual packaging visible."
"A global guideline for packaging 
standardization and utilization has been planned for 2024 
with a view to implementing the current initiatives worldwide."
"Circular economy
Brenntag is aware of the importance of a circular economy 
model for managing environmental challenges and fostering 
responsible resource management."
"Brenntag’s aim is there-
fore to establish ten circular businesses by the end of 2025, 
each generating more than EUR 1 million a year."
"To this end, 
a list for circular economy business models was created and 
24 business models were analyzed in the reporting period."
"Brenntag in EMEA, for example, entered into an agreement 
with a rubber recycling company regarding the technical 
development and commercialization of rubber powder and 
granules."
"This fully recycled end product is produced by recy-
cling large, end-of-life off-the-road tires."
"Brenntag signed a 
further collaboration agreement with a plastics recycling 
company to promote the distribution of high-quality recyclate 
for applications such as in the automotive and household 
appliance industry."
"In order to achieve the target of ten circu-
lar businesses by the end of 2025, the following goal was set 
for 2024 together with the two divisions Brenntag Essentials 
and Brenntag Specialties: develop a plan for each business and 
start implementing the plan for five businesses per division."
"In the reporting period, Brenntag further expanded its internal 
organization for the circular economy in EMEA with a view to 
centralizing regional knowledge and thus being able to offer 
more support for new circular development projects in the 
individual countries."
"In this context, Brenntag is developing a 
communication and support strategy for the individual coun-
tries in EMEA and using special tracking, analysis and report-
ing tools for the circular economy."
"In addition, Brenntag 
intends to work even more closely together with suppliers and 
customers in future."
"One tool in the action plan pre-
sented in March 2018 is the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU Tax-
onomy)."
"This uniform and legally binding classification sys-
tem sets out which economic activities are regarded as 
environmentally sustainable and how they should be reported."
The aim is to steer financial flows toward green investments.
"Investors should thus be able to decide whether they wish to 
contribute to the EU’s goals through their investments."
"All 
companies that are required to provide non-financial report-
ing pursuant to Section 315b et seq."
"of the German Commer-
cial Code (HGB) have been obliged to disclose information 
on the implementation of the EU Taxonomy since financial 
year 2021."
"Brenntag also discloses information on 
Taxonomy-alignment in relation to the first two environmental 
objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change 
adaptation) pursuant to Art."
"Informa-
tion on Taxonomy-alignment in relation to the other environ-
mental objectives is only required to be disclosed as of the 
following reporting period."
"Brenntag’s Taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities
Brenntag, as a distributor, generates external sales only in the 
context of one activity: the sale of chemicals and ingredients."
"More specifically, this means that a small 
portion of the turnover is attributable to certain chemicals 
named in the Regulation which we recycle ourselves (which, 
in the context of the Regulation, is regarded as the “treatment 
of hazardous waste”), i.e."
"we receive hazardous waste and 
reprocess it such that it can be reused by our business part-
ners."
"Brenntag therefore presents both the turnover attribut-
able to this Taxonomy-eligible and, where applicable, Taxon-
omy-aligned economic activity (see table 3.16) and the 
capital and operating expenditure related to assets or pro-
cesses that are associated with this activity (“category a” acc."
to Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Art.
"Description of the 
Brenntag activity
Annex II to the Environmental 
Delegated Act 
Recycling of hazardous 
waste
2.4."
"These are economic activities and individual 
measures listed in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act and 
in Annexes I to IV to the Environmental Delegated Act (“cate-
gory c” Section 1.1.2.2."
"8 Delegated Act; 
see table 3.16)."
"In this way, Brenntag ensures that no turnover, CapEx or OpEx 
is included more than once."
"The turnover, CapEx or OpEx thus 
identified forms the numerator of the performance indicators 
reported below."
"It consists of multiple steps that must be 
followed individually, with the results documented by the 
Group companies."
"With regard to compliance with the 
minimum requirements, the review must also be carried out 
for Brenntag SE without reference to a specific economic 
activity."
"The review of Brenntag SE’s compliance with the minimum 
requirements revealed that not all of the criteria are met 
because Brenntag has so far only taken into account direct 
suppliers with regard to fulfilling human rights due diligence 
obligations."
"As all of the above-mentioned criteria must be 
met, no Taxonomy-aligned turnover, CapEx or OpEx can be 
presented."

KPI is based on the company’s consolidated net turnover in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 
1.82(a), which can be taken from the consolidated financial 
statements; see the consolidated income statement on 
page 186."
"You can find further details on Brenntag’s account-
ing policies for consolidated net turnover on page 200."
"With regard to the numerator, the company refers to the 
explanations above (“Brenntag’s Taxonomy-eligible eco-
nomic activities” section)."
"CapEx KPI
The CapEx KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible CapEx (numer-
ator) divided by total CapEx (denominator) as specified in the 
EU Taxonomy."
"Total CapEx consists of additions to tangible 
and intangible fixed assets during the financial year, before 
depreciation, amortization and any remeasurements, includ-
ing those resulting from revaluations and impairments, and 
excluding fair value changes."
"It includes additions to property, plant and equipment (IAS 
16), intangible assets (IAS 38) and right-of-use assets (Inter-
national Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS 16)."
"Additions 
resulting from business combinations are also included."
"Goodwill is not included in CapEx because it is not defined as 
an intangible asset in accordance with IAS 38."
"You can find 
further details on the accounting policies with regard to the 
company’s CapEx on pages 201 to 202."
"It is the sum total of the following trans-
action types:
■	
Business combinations
■	
Other additions
for property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (exclud-
ing goodwill) and right-of-use assets."
"With regard to the numerator, Brenntag refers to the expla-
nations above (“Brenntag’s Taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities” section)."
"OpEx KPI
The OpEx KPI is defined as Taxonomy-eligible OpEx (numera-
tor) divided by total OpEx (denominator)."
"Total OpEx consists of direct uncapitalized costs that relate 
to research and development, building renovation measures, 
short-term leases, maintenance and repair, remediation and 
any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day ser-
vicing of assets of property, plant and equipment."
"For the Brenntag Group, the following aspects must be taken 
into account in this regard:
■	
The Brenntag Group does not incur any research and 
development expenses."
"■	
The volume of uncapitalized leases was determined in 
accordance with IFRS 16 and includes expenses for 
short-term leases, variable leases and low-value leases 
(see table 5.53 Lease expenses)."
"Even though variable 
leases and low-value leases are not explicitly mentioned 
in the Art."
"8 Delegated Act, Brenntag has interpreted the 
legislation as to include these leases."
"The 
related cost items can be found in the other operating 
expenses item in the consolidated income statement 
and are part of maintenance and energy costs (see table 
5.26 Other operating expenses)."
"This also includes build-
ing renovation measures."
"As a rule, these are costs for 
services and material costs."
"■	
Expenses for the remediation of environmental damage, 
mainly for soil and groundwater for current and former, 
owned or leased sites."
"The related cost items are included 
in the other operating expenses item in the consolidated 
income statement and are part of miscellaneous operat-
ing expenses (see 5.26 Other operating expenses)."
"With regard to the numerator, Brenntag refers to the expla-
nations above (“Brenntag’s Taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities” section)."
"They were calculated using a com-
bined approach of volume- and consumption-based emis-
sion factors from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) databases, 
which were considered to be representative of Brenntag’s 
respective product categories."
"By multiplying them by the vol-
ume-related purchasing data for the product categories 
taken from our Global Business Warehouse (GBW) and 
extrapolating them to the total spend, it was possible to 
determine a value that reflects the total emissions in cate-
gory 3.1."
"Scope 3.4 Transportation and distribution  
(upstream and downstream):
All emissions caused by incoming and outgoing transporta-
tion as well as direct business involving external trucks were 
calculated."
"They were calculated using a combined approach 
of volume- and consumption-based emission factors from 
DBEIS, which were correlated with the number of tonne-kilo-
meters."
"In addition, the average distance per consignment 
was initially calculated with the material transport volumes 
for individual EMEA countries."
"For the North America region, it 
was possible to use the distances per consignment, on the 
basis of a ZIP-based geodata distance calculation, for a por-
tion of the total goods transported."
"These distances were 
multiplied by the respective tonnes of transported goods and 
by the corresponding emission factor."
"The emissions calcu-
lated served in turn as a basis for extrapolating the total 
emissions in categories 3.4 and 3.9 using volume-related 
transport data taken from our Hyperion Financial Manage-
ment (HFM) system and the GBW for the respective global 
regions."
"Finally, the total emissions calculated were allocated 
to categories 3.4 and 3.9 based on the International Commer-
cial Terms (Incoterms)."

"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts

"The 
choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner’s pro-

"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of

required to interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the imma-
nent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted dif-
ferently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, 
accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject 
to uncertainties."
"In particular, these uncertainties also relate

"We do not express an opinion on the references to websites

"Therefore, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than 
the aforementioned."

"The disclosures are excluded from the stat-
utory auditor’s audit of the management report content (“dis-

system; they have also been set apart from the disclosures 
required to be audited by placing them in separate para-

"Brenntag is a partner to chemical manufacturers (its suppli-
ers) and its roughly 180,000 customers1)."
"As the global market 
leader in chemical and ingredients distribution, Brenntag has 
the vision of shaping the future of the industry."
"Brenntag purchases large-scale quantities of industrial and 
specialty chemicals and ingredients from a large number of 
suppliers."
"This enables it to achieve economies of scale and 
offer a comprehensive range of products and value-added 
services."
"The products it purchases are stored in distribution 
facilities, packed into quantities the customers require and 
delivered, typically in less-than-truckloads."
"Overall, Brenntag 
offers a broad product range comprising more than 20,000 
chemicals2) and ingredients as well as extensive value-added 
services such as just-in-time delivery, product mixing, repack-
aging, inventory management and drum return handling."
"Among other things, Brenntag also offers tailor-made appli-
cation, marketing and supply chain solutions, technical and 
formulation support, comprehensive regulatory know-how 
and digital solutions such as digital sales channels and prod-
uct platforms."
"To enable it to best respond to its customers’ and suppliers’ 
diverse and changing requirements, Brenntag manages its 
business through two global divisions: Brenntag Specialties 
and Brenntag Essentials."
"It is managed through the geographical 
segments EMEA, Americas and APAC."
"Brenntag Essentials 
markets a broad portfolio of process chemicals across a wide 
range of industries and applications, and is managed through 
the geographical segments EMEA, North America, Latin 
America and APAC."
"1)	 The number of customers includes the customers that bought from Brenntag 
at least once in the reporting period."
"The decision criterion is “sold-to”;  
a sold-to party is the legal entity that is responsible for the purchase order 
and makes contact with the supplier’s branch."
"2)	 Chemical substances, including the quality grade and concentration level  
(in the case of diluted products) or the product form (in the case of solid 
substances), are recorded as chemicals."
"A divisional 
Executive Committee (ExCo) headed by a divisional Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) was introduced for each division."
"Since January 1, 2024, Brenntag Specialties has been divided 
into two reportable segments, Life Science and Material Sci-
ence."
"The Brenntag Essentials division continues to be man-
aged through the geographical segments EMEA, North Amer-
ica, Latin America and APAC."
"The two divisions are supported by Brenntag Business Ser-
vices, which have been allocated to “All other Segments”."
"In 
addition, “All other Segments” combine the central functions 
for the entire Group and the activities with regard to the dig-
italization of Brenntag’s business."
"The international opera-
tions of BRENNTAG International Chemicals GmbH, which 
buys and sells chemicals in bulk on an international scale 
without regional boundaries, are also included here."
"As at December 31, 2023, the scope of consolidation com-
prised Brenntag SE and in addition 27 (Dec."

"Objectives and strategy
In the coming years, Brenntag aims to strengthen and further 
expand its position as the global market leader in chemical 
and ingredients distribution in a changing global market 
environment."
"In financial year 2023, Brenntag worked systematically to 
drive the execution of its “Strategy to Win” presented in 
November 2022."
"Firstly, the core elements comprised differ-
entiated strategies for the two divisions Brenntag Specialties 
and Brenntag Essentials, which will be further developed 
through the “Advanced Operating Model” from January 2024 
onwards."
"Secondly, Brenntag is pursuing a sustainability 
agenda with the aim of assuming a leading role in the respon-
sible distribution of sustainable chemicals and ingredients."
"This includes using 100% environmentally-friendly energy by 
2025 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2045, for example."
"Thirdly, Brenntag aims to drive market consolidation through 
value-creating M&A activity."
"Its focus here is on expanding its 
position in emerging markets in both divisions, improving stra-
tegic capabilities and market positions, augmenting the 
existing portfolio and improving technical capabilities."
"Fourthly, it is transforming itself into a data- and technology-­
driven company."
"Through the “Advanced Operating Model” announced in 
July 2023 and operationalized in January 2024, Brenntag is 
continuing to implement the two divisions’ differentiated 
steering."
"This includes the divisions’ new steering and gover-
nance structure via divisional CEOs and Executive Commit-
tees."
"In addition, specific functions and responsibilities will be 
transferred from corporate level to the divisions to enable 
them to manage their business independently, enhance their 
decision-making and improve their business performance."
They will be supported in this by a leaner corporate center.
"From the beginning of 2024, the Group will also create dedi-
cated legal entity structures for both divisions along the new 
organizational structure."
"In December 2023, Brenntag then presented its strategic 
roadmap extending through to 2027."
"This is centered around 
the further separation of Brenntag Essentials and Brenntag 
Specialties into two independent and autonomous global 
divisions with honed profiles."
"Brenntag Essentials’ strategy 
rests on three pillars: 1) last-mile delivery services, 2) regional 
provision and supply chain services, and 3) global sourcing 
and interregional optimization."
"Through this triple business 
model, Brenntag Essentials plans to accelerate its growth in 
the highly attractive, globally expanding chemical distribu-
tion market."
"The division plans to continue to invest in contin-
uously enhancing its performance and to further implement 
a disciplined and targeted M&A strategy."
"Brenntag Special-
ties is placing emphasis on five performance levers: 1) price 
and margin management, 2) cost and efficiency improve-
ments, 3) portfolio management and strategic portfolio deci-
sions, 4) value-added services and 5) strategic acquisitions."
"With its global industry-segment setup, Brenntag Specialties 
will implement dedicated industry strategies and by doing so 
plans to extend its focus on very attractive market segments 
and further increase Life Science’s share of the portfolio."
"As 
communicated at the Capital Markets Day, a EUR 300 million 
cost reduction program was put in place with a view to 
enhancing efficiency and offsetting inflation-driven increases 
in costs."
"This also includes the reduction in costs from the 
DiDEX program."
"Brenntag also measures return on capital and sets strict 
requirements for the performance of investment projects and 
acquisitions."
"In the following, the performance indicators used to measure 
the Group’s financial performance are explained."
"They also 
include alternative performance indicators not defined under 
IFRSs (operating EBITA, working capital turnover and free 
cash flow), as a result of which these terms may be defined 
differently by other companies."
"These alternative perfor-
mance indicators are calculated continuously using a uni-
form approach, which ensures that metrics from different 
financial years can be compared."
"Brenntag sometimes also 
adjusts for acquisition effects, in which case it talks about 
organic growth."
"Most significant financial performance indicators 
For Brenntag as a chemical distributor, operating gross profit 
is an important factor for increasing enterprise value over the 
long term."
"Operating gross profit is defined as the difference 
between external sales and cost of materials, adjusted for 
certain items."
"The goal is for the growth in operating gross 
profit to exceed macroeconomic benchmarks such as indus-
trial production and the Global Manufacturing Purchasing 
Managers’ Index (PMI)."
"In order to ensure that measurement 
of performance at Group or regional level is meaningful, the 
growth in operating gross profit is adjusted for currency 
translation effects."
"Operating EBITA is the key performance indicator in the 
Brenntag Group."
"This is the operating profit as recorded in the 
consolidated income statement, plus amortization and 
impairment of intangible assets and depreciation and impair-
ment of investment property, adjusted for certain items."
"In the course of operationalizing its strategy, Brenntag decided 
to replace operating EBITDA with operating EBITA as its key 
performance indicator from financial year 2023 onwards."
"Brenntag adjusts operating EBITA for holding charges and for 
income and expenses arising from special items so as to 
improve comparability in presenting the performance of its 
business operations over multiple reporting periods and 
explain it more appropriately."
"Holding charges are certain 
costs charged between holding companies and operating 
companies."
"At Group level, these effects net to zero."
"Special 
items are income and expenses outside ordinary activities that 
have a special and material effect on the results of operations."
"In its efforts to generate increasing cash flow, Brenntag ana-
lyzes working capital turnover."
"This is defined as:
Working capital is defined as trade receivables plus inven­
tories less trade payables."
"Average working capital for a particular year is defined as the 
arithmetic average of working capital at each of the following 
five dates: the beginning of the year, the end of each of the 
first, second and third quarters, and the end of the year."
"To measure cash generation, Brenntag uses the performance 
indicator free cash flow."
"Free cash flow is an important per-
formance indicator for Brenntag, as it shows what level of 
cash is generated from operating activities and will therefore 
be available for growth through acquisitions as well as for 
lenders, shareholders and tax payments."
"In the Brenntag Group, return on capital is measured using 
the indicator return on capital employed (ROCE)."
"ROCE is 
defined as:
The average carrying amounts in the denominator are 
defined for a particular year as the arithmetic average of the 
amounts at each of the following five dates: the beginning of 
the year, the end of each of the first, second and third quar-
ters, and the end of the year."
"The conversion ratio is an indicator calculated in order to 
measure the efficiency of a segment or the Group, more spe-
cifically by expressing operating EBITA for a given period as a 
percentage of operating gross profit for the same period."
"The 
indicator is used primarily to assess longer-term trends and 
less so to analyze short-term fluctuations between quarters."
"To determine whether a particular investment project is 
expected to generate value for Brenntag, it takes the modified 
internal rate of return (MIRR) and the payback period as meas­
ures of the risk involved in the project."
"An investment project 
is generally only approved if the MIRR is above the hurdle rate 
and the combination of return and payback seems attractive."
"The hurdle rate for the MIRR varies according to the risk 
involved in the project and depends, among other factors, on 
the respective country risk."
"In addition to these metrics, Brenntag has also set strategic 
objectives as well as financial hurdle rates that generally 
have to be considered when an acquisition is carried out."
"In 
particular, potential acquisitions must be able to satisfy the 
hurdle rate of return in the form of free cash flow on capital 
employed."
"Again, the hurdle rate of return depends, among 
other factors, on the country risk of the acquisition."
"Further performance indicators such as tax rate, earnings per 
share (EPS) and net debt leverage are only used at Group 
level."
"They are not used to measure the performance of 
Brenntag’s divisions and segments since factors such as inter-
est or tax are less a reflection of the operating performance 
of the segments, but are above all based on central decisions."
"Net debt leverage is used to continuously review the ade-
quacy of the company’s capital structure."
"In this case, the dif-
ference between financial and lease liabilities and cash and 
cash equivalents is expressed relative to operating EBITDA."
"Adjustments for exchange rate effects
For Group accounting, the results of all Group companies are 
translated into the Group currency, the euro."
"The results are 
generally translated at the average rate for the reporting 
period or, for Group companies in hyperinflationary econo-
mies, at the closing rate."
"Therefore, the results and in particular the change between 
reporting periods may not only be affected by changes in 
operating performance, but also by effects of translation 
from functional currencies into the Group currency, the euro 
(translation effects)."
"As Brenntag considers it important to 
assess the operating performance of the Group companies 
and in particular the change in operating performance 
between reporting periods free of distortions from translation 
effects, it also reports the changes adjusted for these effects."
"Exchange rate-adjusted financial metrics are not to be seen 
as substitutes or as more meaningful financial indicators, but 
always as additional information on sales, operating 
expenses, earnings or other metrics."
"A sustain-
ability strategy has been developed with a view to strength-
ening sustainable governance."
"Climate protection plays a particularly important role within 
Brenntag’s sustainability strategy, as the entire value chain is 
affected."
"Not only do Brenntag’s own activities produce CO2 
emissions; the products that the company buys have also 
emitted greenhouse gases during their manufacture."
"More-
over, climate protection is important to many of Brenntag’s 
customers."
"Scope 1 emissions are all direct emis-
sions from sources that are owned or controlled by a com-
pany itself, e.g."
"emissions from fuels and coolants at the com-
pany’s own site or from the company’s own vehicle fleet."
"Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation 
of purchased energy, e.g."
"electricity or district heating from 
an energy provider."
"The market-based method is taken as the 
basis for setting targets."
"Under this method, the calculation 
uses the emission factors of the energy supplier or an individ-
ual electricity product."
"Using the market-based method 
enables company-specific purchases of energy from renew-
able sources to be presented in a transparent manner."
"To improve health and safety in the workplace, training ses-
sions, safety projects and dedicated campaigns are carried 
out so as to continuously raise employee awareness of health 
and occupational safety, particularly the safe handling of 
chemicals."
"The Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) is used as 
a performance indicator."
"This shows the number of injured 
people who receive medical treatment beyond first aid per 
one million work hours."
"For Brenntag as a company with operations worldwide, the 
diversity of its workforce is another factor in its success."
Brenntag strives for diversity at all levels of the company.
"The 
aim by 2030 is to increase the percentage of women at all 
levels of management below the Group Board of Manage-
ment to at least 30%."
1)	 Reduction with respect to the sites already included in the 2020 base year.
New sites will be tracked separately.
2)	 The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change.
"It was adopted by 196 parties at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 2015 and 
entered into force on November 4, 2016."
"Its goal is to limit global warming to 
well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with pre-industrial 
levels."
"Overall, the Latin American economy expanded year 
on year in 2023, with industrial production increasing by 
around 1.3%."
"The emerging economies of Asia (excluding China and Japan) 
also achieved growth in 2023, with production expanding by 
2.7% compared with the prior-year figure."
"Overall too, the 
Asia Pacific region remained one of the main sources of 
global growth, driven by growing consumption and rising 
capital spending."
"Although China continues to make an important contribution 
to global growth, the Chinese economy fell short of the growth 
rates achieved in past years due to weak consumption and 
weak exports, especially in the second half of 2023."
"Industrial 
production in China grew by 4.4% in 2023."
"The global chemical industry also moved along these global 
trend lines."
"In Europe, produc-
tion fell by 4.9% due to high production costs."
"The trend was 
less dramatic in North America, where chemical production 
dropped only slightly, contracting by 0.3%."
"In Asia, on the other 
hand, chemical production grew by 4.5%, making the region 
the chemical industry’s main growth driver again in 2023."
"Economic and sector-specific environment
Geopolitical conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the Mid-
dle East conflict made for a difficult market environment 
again last year."
"These uncertainties affected business activ-
ities across various sectors."
"Together with an only slow decline 
in inflation and sustained high procurement and personnel 
costs, they caused investors to generally hold back and eco-
nomic growth to slow."
"In the first nine months of financial year 
2023, the restrictive monetary policy of national and supra-
national banks also acted as a drag on general economic 
performance."
"Economic performance in the euro zone remained weak in 
2023, with industrial production falling by 1.1% compared 
with the previous year."
"High inflation, more restrictive financ-
ing conditions and weak demand from abroad continued to 
weigh on business and consumer confidence."
"Much like the euro zone, the US economy was also marked by 
falling, yet still high inflation."
"The uncertainties and vulnera-
bilities remained significant, driven not only by inflation, but 
also by the turmoil in the US banking sector."
"However, buoyed 
by the nevertheless sustained momentum in consumer 
spending and stable employment markets, industrial produc-
tion showed a year-on-year increase of 0.9% last year."
"1)	 All data in this section were taken from the Oxford Economics global industry 
databank."
"Taking on the role of Chief Operating Officer (COO) Brenntag 
Specialties, he succeeded Henri Nejade, who chose not to 
extend his contract when it expired on June 30, 2023."
"In February 2023, Brenntag agreed a new syndicated credit 
facility for EUR 1.5 billion."
"This new credit facility has a term 
of five years."
"In a first for Brenntag, the interest rates on the 
credit facility are linked to the achievement of quantitative 
ESG criteria."
"The ESG targets defined for this purpose are 
derived from the ESG strategic objectives for 2030, which 
Brenntag redefined back in 2022."
"In March 2023, Brenntag launched a share buyback program 
of up to EUR 750 million."
"This is intended to allow shareholders 
to share in the company’s success."
"The first tranche of the 
share buyback program, in the amount of EUR 500 million, 
was to be conducted by December 2023 at the latest."
"By the 
end of October 2023, Brenntag had already completed this 
first tranche of the share buyback program and acquired 
around seven million treasury shares."
"These shares with a 
nominal value of around EUR 7 million were withdrawn and 
the company’s share capital was reduced to around 
EUR 147.5 million."
"In the course of the second tranche from 
January 2, 2024 through March 31, 2024 at the latest, it is 
intended to acquire further Brenntag SE shares on the stock 
market up to a total purchase price of EUR 250 million (a max-
imum of 7,699,220 shares)."
"Also in March 2023, Brenntag acquired the entire business 
operations of Al-Azzaz Chemicals Company headquartered 
in Al-Khobar Dammam, Saudi Arabia."
"The company gener-
ated sales of around EUR 34 million in financial year 2022."
"The 
acquisition of one of the largest specialty chemical distribu-
tors on the Arabian Peninsula expands Brenntag’s market 
presence in this area."
"At the Annual General Meeting of Brenntag SE on June 15, 
2023, Richard Ridinger was re-elected as a member of 
 
the Supervisory Board for four years."
"In addition, Sujatha 
Chandrasekaran was elected as a new member of the Super-
visory Board for three years."
"At its constituting meeting 
­
following the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board 
of Brenntag SE unanimously elected Richard Ridinger to serve 
as its new Chairman."
"He thus succeeds Doreen Nowotne, who 
had chaired the Supervisory Board since June 2020 and 
decided not to seek re-election."
"At the beginning of July, Brenntag announced a restructuring 
of the Board of Management and a new governance structure 
for the two divisions."
"Since August 2023, the Board of Manage-
ment of Brenntag SE has consisted of four members."
"Ewout 
van Jarwaarde was appointed CEO Brenntag Essentials and 
succeeded Steven Terwindt, who did not extend his contract 
with Brenntag when it expired at the end of July 2023."
"Michael 
Friede, COO Brenntag Specialties, was appointed CEO 
Brenntag Specialties effective August 1, 2023."
"The CTO role 
established at Board of Management level at the beginning 
of 2021 no longer exists and the related responsibilities are 
assigned to the various Board of Management members."
"In July 2023, Brenntag acquired all shares in the Aik Moh 
Group (Aik Moh) based in Singapore."
"Aik Moh owns further 
sites in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines and mostly 
distributes solvents, glycols and blends."
"In financial year 2022, 
Aik Moh generated sales of around EUR 77 million."
"The acqui-
sition expands Brenntag Essentials’ business in key focus mar-
kets in the Asia Pacific region."
"This step supports the ongoing 
transformation and promotes the execution of the Brenntag 
Essentials strategy of strengthening local capacity and market 
coverage in high-growth markets such as Asia Pacific."
"At the end of September, Brenntag acquired 70% of the 
shares in Shanghai Saifu Chemical Development Co., Ltd."
"Headquartered in Shanghai, China, the company is a leading 
market player in the specialty distribution of personal care 
ingredients in the Greater China region."
"In financial year 2022, 
the company generated annual sales of EUR 71 million."
"Headquartered in 
Izmir, Turkey, the company specializes in potato starch and 
protein products."
"These are used, among other things, in 
foods, animal feed and the construction industry."
"This expan-
sion of the portfolio to include innovative and sustainable 
products, particularly in the Life Science segment, is part of 
Brenntag’s “Strategy to Win”."
"The acquiree generated annual 
sales of around EUR 19 million in financial year 2022."
"In October 2023, Brenntag acquired all shares in Colony 
Gums, Inc."
"and Harvest Moon Holdings, LLC, a US manufac-
turer of stabilizer blends and provider of blending services, 
based in Monroe, North Carolina (Colony Gums)."
"The company 
reported sales of EUR 35 million in financial year 2022."
"The 
acquisition complements and expands Brenntag’s product 
portfolio and services in the global Specialties division."
"At the end of October, Brenntag acquired all shares in Old 
World Specialty Chemicals, LLC and Old World Logistics, LLC 
(OWI Chlor Alkali), one of the largest independent distributors 
of caustic soda in North America."
"OWI Chlor Alkali’s annual 
sales revenues amounted to around EUR 259 million in finan-
cial year 2022."
"The companies will be integrated into Brenntag 
Essentials’ existing network in North America, significantly 
expanding Brenntag Essentials’ local and regional presence."
"The decision issued by the French Competition Authority in 
2013 in relation to the allocation of customers and the coor-
dination of prices was set aside by a court of appeal due to 
procedural errors at Brenntag’s request in February 2017."
"In December 2020, the court of appeal imposed a fine of 
EUR 47 million."
"In September 2023, the Cour de cassation 
(Court of cassation) repealed the court of appeal judgment 
at Brenntag’s request and referred the matter back to the 
court of appeal."
"In November 2023, the fine of EUR 47 million 
imposed by the court of appeal was reimbursed."
"With fur-
ther steps expected to be taken by the French authorities 
responsible, a provision was recognized in the amount of the 
EUR 47 million reimbursement."
"In financial year 2023, there was a major fire at a warehouse 
site in Canada and another at a warehouse of an external 
warehouse operator in Turkey."
"In this context, operating EBITA 
was adjusted for a special item in the form of costs totaling 
EUR 29.4 million after deduction of insurance payouts."
"These 
costs are mainly attributable to the loss of inventories, but also 
include among others environmental remediation measures."
"This enabled it to 
reduce the Group’s operating costs compared with the previ-
ous year despite inflation-driven increases in costs."
"Due to a significant reduction in inventories, the Group 
recorded a substantial reduction in working capital in finan-
cial year 2023."
"This was driven largely by falling volumes and 
prices."
"At the same time, annualized working capital turnover 
fell year on year."
"At EUR 321.1 million in financial year 2023, the total cash out-
flow for investments was well above the prior-year figure 
(2022: EUR 267.2 million)."
"Investments were made in the 
global site network in particular."
"Brenntag generated a high free cash flow of EUR 1,712.0 mil-
lion in financial year 2023 (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 1,005.1 million)."
"This is a significant increase on the prior-year figure and 
offers the Group financial flexibility."
"It was also achieved 
thanks in particular to the clear reduction in working capital."
"Based on the operating results, Brenntag posted significantly 
lower profit after tax of EUR 721.1 million in financial year 
2023 (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 902.5 million)."
"Brenntag’s results of operations did not remain unscathed by 
the macroeconomic challenges and difficult economic con-
ditions in financial year 2023."
"In these circumstances, 
Brenntag is nevertheless satisfied with its earnings perfor-
mance overall."
"Statement by the Board of Management on the 
situation and business performance in 2023
The Brenntag Group achieved operating EBITA of EUR 1,265.0 
million in financial year 2023, a decrease of 16.3% compared 
with the previous year."
"On a constant currency basis, this rep-
resents a decline of 13.1%."
"Given the challenging geopolitical 
and economic environment, Brenntag is satisfied overall with 
the results achieved in the past financial year."
"In 2023, Brenntag continued to operate in a difficult macro-
economic environment as a result of the years of the pan-
demic, the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions."
"In 
light of these challenging conditions, Brenntag was able to 
fully maintain its operating activities, supply its customers 
with the required products and offer its employees a safe 
working environment in financial year 2023 due primarily to 
the resilience of its business model."
"As market leader, Brenntag 
plays an important role in global distribution markets and 
enjoys a high level of trust among its business partners, also 
in times of major uncertainty."
"In particular, Brenntag’s broad 
and globally diversified customer and product portfolio and 
its close relationships with suppliers paid off again."
"In line with expectations, both divisions, Brenntag Specialties 
and Brenntag Essentials, recorded a year-on-year decline in 
earnings, with the decline at Brenntag Specialties being 
stronger than that at Brenntag Essentials."
"At Brenntag Spe-
cialties, the focus industries Pharma and Water Treatment 
performed particularly well, but failed to offset the decline in 
earnings in other areas, particularly in Nutrition."
"At Brenntag 
Essentials, the North America segment achieved an extremely 
encouraging result."
"Apart from EMEA, the remaining seg-
ments were able to increase their volumes in the second half 
of 2023, compared with the first half of the year."
"Nevertheless, 
the earnings of all segments except North America fell short 
of the previous year."
adj.) is the percentage change on a constant currency basis.
"2)	 Gross profit was adjusted by EUR 21.6 million in the reporting period due to the loss of inventories during major fires at sites in Canada and Turkey in the Brenntag 
Specialties division."
"The Brenntag Group generated sales of EUR 16,815.1 million 
in financial year 2023, a year-on-year decline of 13.5%."
"On a 
constant currency basis, sales were down by 11.0% on the 
prior-year figure."
"The decline was due mainly to lower sales 
prices, but also to falling volumes."
Both divisions contributed to this performance.
"Brenntag Essentials’ sales were down by 11.2% on the previ-
ous year, with more than half of the decline attributable to 
weaker business within the EMEA region."
"Brenntag Specialties 
generated sales of EUR 6,983.4 million, 8.6% less than in 2022."
"Business was weaker in the Americas in particular, decreasing 
by 13.5%."
"The Brenntag Group generated operating gross profit of 
EUR 4,041.8 million in financial year 2023, a year-on-year 
decline of 6.4%."
"On a constant currency basis, operating gross 
profit was down by 3.7% on the prior-year figure."
"Both divi-
sions recorded volume-related decreases in earnings in par-
ticular, while operating gross profit per unit rose slightly both 
for the Brenntag Group overall and for the Brenntag Essentials 
division."
"This decline was only partly offset by the additional 
operating gross profit from the acquisitions closed."
"The Brenntag Group’s operating expenses amounted to 
EUR 2,457.2 million in financial year 2023, a fall of 2.1% year 
on year."
"On a constant currency basis, operating expenses 
were roughly in line with the prior-year figure."
"This was due 
mainly to the acquisitions closed."
"On an organic basis, on the 
other hand, costs were down slightly on the prior-year figure."
"A decline in advisory, variable personnel and transport 
expenses was partly offset by increased costs for IT imple-
mentation, primarily in connection with the DiDEX initiative, 
and inflation-driven increases in costs."
"Brenntag sees these 
additional costs as an investment in the Group’s future."
"Over-
all, the acquisitions newly closed led to operating expenses 
at the prior-year level for the Brenntag Group."
"The Brenntag Group achieved operating EBITDA of EUR 1,584.6 
million overall in financial year 2023, a year-on-year decline 
of 12.4%, or 9.2% on a constant currency basis."
"Depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equip-
ment and right-of-use assets rose by EUR 22.7 million year 
on year to EUR 319.6 million in financial year 2023."
"This rep-
resents a rise of 7.6% compared with the previous year, or 
10.5% on a constant currency basis."
"On a con-
stant currency basis, this represents a decline in earnings of 
13.1% compared with the prior-year figure."
"This decline in 
earnings compared with the above-average earnings 
achieved in the prior-year period stemmed from both divi-
sions in financial year 2023."
"Falling demand in the Brenntag 
Specialties division, particularly in the Americas segment, 
made it difficult to repeat the strong prior-year results despite 
a fall in costs on an organic basis."
"Across the segments, the 
focus industries Nutrition and Material Science in particular 
were affected."
"Amortization of intangible assets amounted to EUR 64.0 mil-
lion."
"Compared with financial year 2022, Brenntag recorded 
a decrease of EUR 45.5 million."
"However, in the previous year, 
an impairment loss of EUR 38.1 million was recognized for 
the goodwill of the Brenntag Essentials Latin America seg-
ment."
"The write-down was due in particular to the lower 
income expected from the cash-generating unit in combina-
tion with the appreciable year-on-year increase in country 
risk premiums."
"The official investigations into possible 
violations of export control regulations were concluded with-
out any fines being imposed, enabling the existing provisions 
of EUR 3.3 million to be reversed."
"In 2023, further tax decision notices for the tax on alcohol 
were received in relation to provisions recognized in 2021 for 
excise duties, leading to a lower-than-expected tax liability."
"The reversal of the relevant provisions resulted in other oper-
ating income of EUR 10.3 million in financial year 2023."
"At the 
end of the financial year, provisions of EUR 11.5 million were 
recognized for a further case in Sweden."
"Costs amounting to EUR 19.1 million after deduction of insur-
ance payouts of EUR 8.2 million were incurred as a result of a 
major fire at a warehouse site in Canada."
"They comprise costs 
for the loss of inventories, repairs, remediation of the resulting 
environmental damage and maintaining business operations."
"Costs totaling EUR 10.3 million after deduction of insurance 
payouts of EUR 6.0 million were incurred in another major fire 
at a warehouse of an external warehouse operator in Turkey."
"They consist predominantly of expenses arising from the loss 
of inventories."
"Other special items amounting to EUR 16.3 million include 
advisory and other one-time expenses necessary in order to 
achieve the desired structure, such as restructuring expenses 
in connection with vacating sites, severance payments and 
withdrawing from certain markets."
"Net finance costs came to EUR 119.9 million in financial year 
2023 (2022: EUR 147.5 million), with the year-on-year change 
attributable mainly to four effects."
"Firstly, net interest expense 
widened year on year to EUR 103.9 million (2022: EUR 92.1 mil-
lion)."
"This was due mainly to general interest rate levels being 
higher than in the previous year."
"The translation of foreign cur-
rency receivables and liabilities, on the other hand, had an 
opposite effect."
"In financial year 2023, this resulted in slightly 
lower expenses than in the prior-year period."
"A reduction in 
purchase price obligations relating to the acquisition of 
non-controlling interests also contributed to the improvement 
in net finance costs (2023: income of EUR 26.4 million; 2022: 
expense of EUR 7.6 million)."
"Moreover, in financial year 2023, 
the classification of Turkey as a hyperinflationary economy in 
financial year 2022 increased net finance costs to a slightly 
lesser extent than it did in the previous year."
"Income tax expense fell by EUR 50.7 million year on year to 
EUR 281.7 million in financial year 2023."
"Profit after tax stood at EUR 721.1 million in financial year 
2023 (2022: EUR 902.5 million)."

 4.05 Business performance in the segments / Brenntag Specialties
1)	 Gross profit was adjusted by EUR 21.6 million in the reporting period due to the loss of inventories during major fires at sites in Canada and Turkey."
"2)	 The difference between the sum total of the reportable segments and a particular division is the result of central activities which are part of the division but not 
directly attributable to any one segment."
"Operating gross profit in the Brenntag Specialties division 
came to EUR 1,479.6 million in financial year 2023, a decrease 
of 11.8% on the prior-year figure."
"On a constant currency 
basis, operating gross profit was down by 8.2% year on year."
"This change was due especially to declining volumes in com-
bination with slightly lower operating gross profit per unit."
"All 
segments contributed to the decrease in operating gross 
profit, with the largest effects occurring in the Americas seg-
ment."
"Across the segments, the focus industries Nutrition and 
Material Science in particular were affected."
"Overall, this was 
driven by subdued demand, as customers ran down inven­
tories that had been built up previously and waited for prices 
to fall."
"Demand was also negatively impacted by higher inter-
est rates and energy costs as well as economic weakness in 
a number of economies."
"Overall, the Brenntag Specialties division generated operat-
ing EBITDA of EUR 595.1 million in financial year 2023, a 
decrease of 23.7% on the prior-year figure."
"On a constant cur-
rency basis, this represents a decline of 19.7%."
"Operating EBITA in the Brenntag Specialties division came to 
EUR 550.8 million in financial year 2023, a decrease of 25.4% 
on the prior-year figure."
"On a constant currency basis, this 
represents a decline of 21.5%."
"All segments of the Brenntag 
Specialties division contributed to this result."
"The decline was 
due in particular to the aforementioned performance at oper-
ating gross profit level."
"On an organic basis, costs were 
roughly in line with the prior-year figure."
"Overall – on an 
organic basis and including the acquisitions – costs were up 
slightly year on year."
"Volume-related reductions in costs were 
partly offset by inflation-driven increases in costs."
"In addition, 
costs were incurred in connection with the new strategy; 
these are an investment in Brenntag’s future."

"Operating gross profit in the Brenntag Essentials division 
decreased by 2.9% year on year to EUR 2,533.5 million in 
financial year 2023."
"On a constant currency basis, operating 
gross profit was down by 0.7% on the prior-year figure."
"This 
performance is due to declining volumes in the EMEA, North 
America and Latin America segments and the fall in operat-
ing gross profit per unit in the EMEA, Latin America and APAC 
segments."
"Both on an organic basis and including the new 
acquisition, the APAC segment achieved an increase in vol-
umes."
"In the North America segment, operating gross profit 
per unit was well above the previous year, as a result of which 
this segment posted growth in operating gross profit overall 
and operating gross profit per unit for the entire Brenntag 
Essentials division also increased year on year."
"This underlines 
the segment’s performance, which was further supported by 
the entities acquired."
"Operating EBITDA in the Brenntag Essentials division came to 
EUR 1,109.6 million in financial year 2023, a 3.8% decline 
compared with the previous year."
"On a constant currency 
basis, this represents a decrease of 1.6%."
"Operating EBITA in the Brenntag Essentials division dropped 
by 6.8% year on year to EUR 848.9 million in financial year 
2023."
"On a constant currency basis, it showed a decrease of 
4.7%."
This was due to the decline in operating gross profit.
"On 
an organic basis, the division was able to reduce costs mod-
erately compared with the previous year."
"Overall – on an 
organic basis and including the acquisitions – costs were 
roughly in line with the prior-year figure."
"Operating EBITA in 
the Latin America segment was down considerably on the 
previous year."
"The decline is primarily attributable to a slump 
in demand at Brenntag Brazil as a result of competition."
"At 
the end of the year, an improvement was achieved in both 
margins and volumes by initiating appropriate measures."
"In 
the EMEA segment, falling costs were not enough to offset the 
fall in demand."
"All other Segments 
In “All other Segments”, which also include the holding com-
panies, Brenntag recorded a clear year-on-year reduction in 
costs in financial year 2023."
"This was due in particular to 
lower variable personnel expenses."
"BRENNTAG International Chemicals GmbH, the only operat-
ing company within “All other Segments”, achieved operating 
EBITDA below the prior-year figure in financial year 2023 due 
to the trend in volumes."
"Overall, the operating EBITDA of “All other Segments” amounted 
to EUR – 120.1 million in financial year 2023, an improvement 
of 3.0% compared with the previous year."
"The operating EBITA 
of “All other Segments” came to EUR – 134.7 million in financial 
year 2023 and therefore improved by 1.2% year on year."
"This earnings forecast is inclusive of the contribution from the 
acquisitions closed and exclusive of foreign currency transla-
tion effects arising after the date of the forecast’s prepara-
tion."
"The year-end results were slightly below the range fore-
cast at the beginning of the year."
"For the reporting period, 
Brenntag had initially forecast operating EBITA of between 
EUR 1,300.0 million and EUR 1,500.0 million and operating 
EBITDA of between EUR 1,600 million and EUR 1,800 million."
"When publishing the half-year report, Brenntag confirmed the 
lower half of this forecast range."
"Most recently, when publish-
ing the financial results for the third quarter, it predicted oper-
ating EBITA and operating EBITDA around the lower end of the 
forecast range."
"The revisions were in each case based on the 
results for the quarters of 2023 already ended, the trend in 
earnings in the past quarter and the outlook for the rest of the 
year."
"The forecast also reflected expectations for future mar-
ket conditions."
"The forecasts were based on the assumption 
at the date of their publication that exchange rates would 
remain stable."
"At year-end, the Brenntag Group achieved oper-
ating EBITA of EUR 1,265.0 million and operating EBITDA of 
EUR 1,584.6 million, putting it around the lower end of the 
aforementioned range in each case, as most recently forecast."
"In financial year 2023, the Brenntag Group expected a decline 
in both operating EBITA and operating EBITDA in both divi-
sions, with the relative decline for the Brenntag Essentials 
division expected to be lower than for the Brenntag Special-
ties division."
"For Brenntag Essentials, operating EBITA was 
down by 4.7% and operating EBITDA by 1.6% on the prior-year 
figure."
"For Brenntag Specialties, operating EBITA fell by 21.5% 
and operating EBITDA by 19.7% compared with the previous 
year."
This confirmed the performance expected in the divisions.
"Moreover, the Brenntag Group anticipated a decline in oper-
ating gross profit slightly below that in operating EBITA."
"It 
expected the decline in operating gross profit to be attribut-
able to both divisions and assumed that the decline recorded 
by Brenntag Essentials would be relatively lower than that 
recorded by Brenntag Specialties."
"Overall in financial year 
2023, the Brenntag Group generated operating gross profit of 
EUR 4,041.8 million, a decrease of 3.7% on the prior-year fig-
ure."
"Operating gross profit showed a year-on-year fall of 0.7% 
for Brenntag Essentials and 8.2% for Brenntag Specialties."
"All 
forecasts for operating gross profit were thus confirmed."
"At the beginning of financial year 2023, Brenntag anticipated 
a moderate improvement in working capital turnover com-
pared with the reported averages for the previous financial 
year."
"Brenntag also expected a reduction in working capital 
overall."
"Despite a positive change in absolute working capital, 
the decline in external sales resulted in a reduction in average 
working capital turnover of 0.2x, although there was a contin-
uous improvement over the course of the year."
"Overall in 
financial year 2023, Brenntag achieved a significant reduc-
tion in average working capital of more than EUR 280 million 
compared with the previous year."
"This contributed to a sub-
stantial improvement in free cash flow."
"In financial year 2023, Brenntag expected a high free cash 
flow roughly in line with the prior-year figure."
"By generating 
free cash flow of EUR 1,712.0 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 1,005.1 
million), it exceeded this forecast by a significant margin."
"This is 
due especially to the substantial reduction in working capital."
"Brenntag concen-
trates on a capital structure which enables the Group to cover 
its potential financing requirements at all times."
"This gives 
Brenntag a high degree of independence, security and flexi-
bility."
"Our liquidity, interest rate and currency risks are largely 
managed on a Group-wide basis."
"Derivative financial instru-
ments are only used to hedge the above-mentioned risks from 
underlying transactions and not for speculative purposes."
"A 
Group-wide Finance Guideline ensures the implementation of 
these policies and standard processes throughout the Group."
"The most important component in Brenntag’s financing 
structure is the Group-wide syndicated loan agreement."
"As 
the old loan would have matured in January 2024, Brenntag 
agreed a new syndicated loan with a consortium of interna-
tional banks in February 2023."
"As at December 31, 2023, this 
totaled the equivalent of EUR 1.5 billion."
"The new syndicated 
loan originally had a term running until February 2028, which 
at the beginning of 2024 was extended until February 2029."
"It 
is based on variable interest rates with margins depending on 
the credit rating, and is divided into two revolving credit facil-
ities – one credit facility in the amount of EUR 1 billion and a 
USD credit facility in the amount of USD 525.0 million (euro 
equivalent as at Dec."
"31, 2023: EUR 475.1 million)."
"The margin 
is also linked to the achievement of certain Brenntag Group 
sustainability targets."
"At the beginning of 2023, Brenntag was 
still paying down outstanding liabilities under the old syndi-
cated loan."
"As at December 31, 2023, total liabilities (excluding accrued 
interest and before offsetting of transaction costs) under the 
new syndicated loan amounted to EUR 50.0 million."
"These lia-
bilities were drawn entirely under the EUR 1 billion credit facil-
ity."
"The USD credit facility, on the other hand, was entirely 
unutilized as at December 31, 2023."
"Both credit facilities are 
available for further drawdowns at any time."
"The syndicated 
loan is guaranteed by Brenntag SE."
"In September 2017, Brenntag Finance B.V."
"issued a EUR 600 
million bond (Bond 2025) maturing in 2025 and bearing a cou-
pon of 1.125% with interest paid annually."
"In October 2021, Brenntag Finance B.V."
"issued a further bond 
for EUR 500.0 million (Bond 2029)."
"The bond has a maturity of 
eight years and carries an annual coupon of 0.50%."
"It is the 
first bond issue to take place under a EUR 3.0 billion debt issu-
ance program newly established in 2021 and updated in 
2023."
"Most of the proceeds from the Bond 2029 were swapped 
into US dollars by way of a long-dated derivative (cross-cur-
rency interest rate swap)."
"In addition, in August 2022, Brenntag closed a promissory 
note (Schuldschein) transaction for around EUR 640.0 million."
"The promissory notes were issued by Brenntag SE and com-
prise a total of seven tranches with tenors of three, five and 
seven years and carrying floating or fixed interest rates."
"Alongside euro-denominated tranches totaling EUR 390.0 
million, the company also issued US dollar-denominated 
tranches totaling USD 250.0 million (euro equivalent as at 
Dec."
"31, 2023: EUR 226.2 million)."
"In addition to the four above-mentioned financing instru-
ments, some Group companies make use of credit lines with 
local banks in consultation with Group Treasury."
"Due to the two fixed-rate bonds and the partly fixed-rate 
promissory notes, over 60% of the Brenntag Group’s financial 
liabilities were hedged against the risk of interest rate 
increases as at December 31, 2023."
"According to its short- and mid-term financial planning, 
Brenntag expects the capital requirements for operating 
activities, planned investments and projects, and dividends 
and acquisitions on the assumed scale to be covered by the 
cash provided by operating activities."
"To cover short-term 
liquidity requirements and for general corporate purposes, it 
likewise has the aforementioned credit facilities under the 
syndicated loan."
"Brenntag regularly invests in the maintenance, replacement 
and extension of the Group infrastructure necessary to per-
form its services, such as warehouses, offices, trucks, field 
service vehicles and IT hardware for various systems."
"Investments in intangible assets amounted to EUR 15.5 mil-
lion in financial year 2023 (2022: EUR 8.0 million) and related 
mainly to digitalization."
"Investments are typically funded from cash flow and/or avail-
able cash from the respective Group companies."
"With larger 
investment projects which cannot be covered by local funds, 
financing is provided by the Group and external borrowings 
are mostly not necessary."
"4.07 Maturity profile of our credit portfolio

"The illustration shows the maturity profile as at 
February 7, 2024 (at the exchange rates applicable on February 7, 2024), i.e."
after the syndicated loan was extended in February 2024.
"Of the net cash of EUR 558.3 million used in investing activi-

of EUR 1,553.8 million (2022: EUR 225.8 million) also included 
the repayment of EUR 549.0 million on the syndicated loan."

"This is due predominantly to the decline in working cap-
ital from EUR 2,588.6 million to EUR 1,999.6 million, with inven-
tories and trade receivables down substantially compared 
with the prior-year reporting date."
"This is attributable to fall-
ing prices, falling volumes and continuous measures for 
improvement."
"At the same time, trade payables fell consider-
ably and partly offset the positive contribution."
"At 7.3, annualized working capital turnover was below the pri-
or-year figure (7.5)."
"The Brenntag Group’s non-current assets rose by EUR 272.5 
million year on year to EUR 5,725.2 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: 
EUR 5,452.7 million)."
"The rise is due mainly to acquisitions 
amounting to EUR 296.2 million."
"In March 2023, Brenntag launched a share buyback program 
of up to EUR 750 million."
"The first tranche of the share buy-
back program, in the amount of EUR 500 million, was com-
pleted in October 2023, the share capital was reduced by a 
nominal amount of around EUR 7 million by withdrawing the 
shares and the excess amount was eliminated against addi-
tional paid-in capital."
"The company’s share capital now 
amounts to around EUR 147.5 million."
"In the course of the sec-
ond tranche between January 2, 2024 and March 13, 2024 at 
the latest, it is intended to acquire further Brenntag SE shares 
on the stock market up to a total purchase price of EUR 250 
million."
"As set out in Article 4, para."
"(b) of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052, the buyback program 
is being lead-managed by a credit institution engaged by 
Brenntag SE which makes its trading decisions concerning 
the timing of the purchases of the shares independently of 
Brenntag."
"For this, in December 2023, Brenntag recognized a 
liability of EUR 250.0 million directly in equity for the obligation 
to acquire treasury shares."
"Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 469.2 million 
compared with the 2022 year-end figure to EUR 576.9 million 
(Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 1,046.1 million)."
"The key manage-
ment functions at overall Group level are the responsibility of 
the Board of Management."
"These primarily include setting the 
Group strategy and deciding on the allocation of resources, 
as well as executive development and financial management."
"The annual financial statements of Brenntag SE have been 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB) and the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG)."
"Brenntag SE has its registered office at Messeallee 
11, 45131 Essen and is entered in the commercial register at 
the Essen Local Court under commercial register number 
HRB 31943."
"The full annual financial statements of Brenntag SE are pub-
lished in the Company Register and can be ordered as an 
offprint from Brenntag SE."
"Business performance
The net assets, financial position and results of operations of 
Brenntag SE are determined mainly by the business success 
of the Brenntag Group’s investees."
"The section “Business per-
formance” in the Report on economic position reports in detail 
on the performance and success of the Group and the divisions."
"Net income for financial year 2023 was expected to be similar 
to the prior-year figure."
"Net income for the financial year 
came to EUR 120.6 million (2022: EUR 250.7 million) and 
therefore fell significantly short of expectations."
"The main 
contributing factor here were the lower-than-forecast profit 
distributions from subsidiaries and second-tier subsidiaries."
"Of the total, revenues from the provision of services to affili-
ated companies, which resulted mainly from IT services and 
other management services provided, accounted for 
EUR 222.8 million (2022: EUR 62.5 million)."
"The year-on-year 
rise in sales in financial year 2023 is due to the revision of 
intra-Group service agreements."
"Other operating income decreased by EUR 77.6 million to 
EUR 91.8 million."
"The decrease is attributable mainly to a 
decline in income from foreign currency hedges and foreign 
exchange gains."
"Cost of materials of EUR 194.7 million (2022: EUR 32.1 million) 
consisted solely of the cost of purchased services."
"Cost of 
materials rose due to the revision of intra-Group service 
agreements."
"The EUR 8.0 million rise in personnel expenses to EUR 62.4 mil-
lion is attributable to the increase in headcount."

"31, 2022: EUR 2,550.5 million) consisted almost exclu-
sively of financial assets."
"These mainly include the investment 
in Brenntag Holding GmbH, an intermediate holding company 
with further subsidiaries and second-tier subsidiaries."
"Current assets including prepaid expenses fell by EUR 349.6 
million to EUR 1,686.8 million."
"The decrease related, firstly, to 
finance receivables due from affiliated companies, which 
amounted to EUR 1,596.7 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 1,747.6 
million), and, secondly, to cash at bank and in hand, which 
amounted to EUR 45.5 million (Dec."
"It is 
important to bear in mind here that, due to the reporting date, 
the prior-year disclosure included invested funds from prom-
issory notes raised during the year."
"The equity of Brenntag SE decreased by EUR 680.3 million to 
EUR 2,112.4 million."
"In addition to the dividend of EUR 304.7 
million paid for financial year 2022, this decrease is due in 
particular to the withdrawal of EUR 496.2 million of treasury 
shares under the share buyback program explained below."
"On March 7, 2023, the Board of Management of Brenntag SE 
resolved on a share buyback program of up to EUR 750 million 
with the approval of the Supervisory Board and exercising the 
authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting held on 
June 9, 2022."
"In the course of an initial tranche in the period 
to October 20, 2023, Brenntag SE acquired 7,046,163 no-par 
value shares, each with a notional value of EUR  1.00 
(EUR 499,999,911.28 in total)."
"The shares were acquired on the 
electronic trading platform of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange 
(Xetra)."
"Exercising the above-mentioned authorization to 
withdraw treasury shares acquired pursuant to Section 71, 
para."
"8 of the German Stock Corporation Act, the com-
pany’s share capital was reduced from EUR 154,500,000.00 
– by EUR 7,046,163 – by withdrawing 7,046,163 no-par value 
registered shares, each with a notional value of EUR 1.00, 
which the company acquired in the period to October 20, 
2023."
"The 7,046,163 no-par value shares held by the company 
and acquired under the share buyback program were with-
drawn."
"The subscribed capital therefore amounted to 
EUR 147.5 million in total as at December 31, 2023 (Dec."
"31, 
2022: EUR 154.5 million) and is divided into 147,453,837 (Dec."
"31, 2022: 154,500,000) no-par value registered shares."
"In the 
course of a second tranche between January 2, 2024 and 
March 13, 2024 at the latest, it is intended to acquire further 
Brenntag SE shares on the stock market up to a total pur-
chase price of EUR 250 million (maximum of 7,699,220 
shares)."
"As set out in Article 4, para."
"(b) of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052, the buyback program 
is being lead-managed by a credit institution engaged by 
Brenntag SE which makes its trading decisions concerning 
the timing of the purchases of the shares independently of 
Brenntag."
"This has no effect on the annual financial state-
ments of Brenntag SE as at December 31, 2023."

Provisions amounted to EUR 90.4 million in total (Dec."
"31,

for pensions and similar obligations, provisions for outstand-
ing invoices and provisions for other personnel expenses."

"Liabilities of EUR 2,051.8 million (Dec."

"Thus, Brenntag SE’s expected performance in finan-
cial year 2024 and the risk situation also depend to a signifi-
cant extent on the performance of the Group as a whole and 
its opportunities and risk situation."
"This is covered in the 
Report on expected developments, opportunities and risks."
"In 
this respect, the statements made there regarding the 
expected performance and the risk position of the Group also 
apply to the future performance and the risk position of 
Brenntag SE."
"In addition, the risk management tools and 
methods for the financial instruments of Brenntag SE are 
explained in the report on opportunities and risks."
"Brenntag SE’s most significant financial performance indica-
tor is the net income for the financial year recognized in the 
financial statements prepared in accordance with German 
commercial law."
"Due to the potential for distributions of 
retained profits at subsidiaries and the profit and loss transfer 
agreements entered into, we expect to generate positive net 
income for financial year 2024 that is well above net income 
for financial year 2023."
"At Brenntag, intra-Group profits are 
distributed taking local financing requirements and further 
constraints into consideration."
"Even if no intra-Group divi-
dends are distributed to Brenntag SE in a financial year, there 
are sufficient reserves to pay an appropriate dividend to the 
Brenntag shareholders."
"Appropriation of distributable profit  
of Brenntag SE
The net income of Brenntag SE as at December 31, 2023 
was EUR 120,598,676.91."
"After allowing for the withdrawal of 
EUR 203,851,323.09 from retained earnings, the distributable 
profit is EUR 324,450,000.00."
"90% of the workforce work outside 
Germany."
"The total number of employees is determined on 
the basis of headcount, i.e."
"part-time employees are fully 
included."
"Excluding the new acquisitions, the total number of 
people employed in the Brenntag Group declined by 242, or 
1.4%, compared with the previous year."
"Voluntary employee 
turnover was 7.8% on average across the Group (2022: 9.4%)."
"To take account of this in the segment result, the other division 
is charged at the amount of the logistics services it uses."
"The 
same applies to the services provided to Essentials or 
Specialties by Business Services."
Brenntag strives for diversity at all levels of the company.
"One 
important element of its diversity management is its aim to 
increase the percentage of women at all levels of manage-
ment below the Group Board of Management to at least 30% 
by 2030."
"The following table shows the percentage of women 
in leadership positions at management level L-1 (first level 
below the Board of Management of Brenntag SE) through to 
L-5+ (fifth level and all other levels below the Board of Man-
agement of Brenntag SE)."
"Brenntag’s global business operations and its highly diversi-
fied customer and supplier structure bring a diverse range of 
operating conditions (legislation, cultures, industry standards 
and other requirements)."
"The combination of the safe han-
dling of chemicals, particularly chemical process safety and 
typical occupational safety issues arising from transporta-
tion, storage, packaging and distribution add to the complex-
ity at Brenntag."
"The TRIR accident rate fell from 2.7 in the 
previous year to 2.5."
"With regard to environmental and climate protection, 
Brenntag’s target for 2023, derived from the linear reduction 
target toward net zero in 2045, was to reduce total Scope 1 
and 2 emissions by at least 12.6% compared with the 2020 
base year."
Brenntag achieved – 22.5% (2022: – 9.6%).
"Further information on quality, safety, health and environmen-
tal protection is published in the separate non-financial 
Group report along with quantitative disclosures on relevant 
performance indicators."
"Overall, however, Brenntag expects the planned busi-
ness activity and the improvement in working capital turnover 
to result in a moderate increase in working capital."
"Assuming that exchange rates remain stable, Brenntag 
expects free cash flow in 2024 to be significantly lower than 
in the previous year."
"This takes into account capital expendi-
ture of around EUR 350 million in financial year 2024, includ-
ing expenditure to optimize the global site network."
"Brenntag 
is also investing more in safety and sustainability at the sites."
"Further investments relate to measures under Brenntag’s dig-
italization strategy."
"It is intended to use this free cash flow to 
continue to ensure Brenntag’s acquisition strategy and divi-
dend policy and fund the expenses in 2024 in connection with 
the implementation of the company’s transformation and 
growth strategy."
"At the same time, it is intended to maintain 
liquidity at an adequate level."
"Main elements of the internal control / risk 
management system
It is essential to Brenntag’s long-term success that opportu-
nities and risks are identified at an early stage and leveraged 
or managed."
"The aim of risk management is to identify, mon-
itor and mitigate emerging risks at an early stage or to pre-
vent them completely."
"The risk management system consists 
of risk reporting (an early detection system), controlling, an 
internal monitoring system and individual measures to iden-
tify new risks at an early stage and limit any known risks."
"The 
planning, controlling and reporting processes of the Brenntag 
Group are integral parts of the risk management systems of 
all operational and legal units as well as the central functions."
"Report on expected developments
The Brenntag Group expects 2024 to be another financial 
year shaped by the war in Ukraine, the Middle East conflict, 
geopolitical tensions and an only slow fall in inflationary pres-
sures."
"This continues to result in a still greater-than-average 
degree of uncertainty over growth expectations for the global 
economy in 2024."
"Oxford Economics currently predicts that 
the global economy, measured in terms of industrial produc-
tion (IP), will grow only slightly in 2024: Weighted by the sales 
generated by Brenntag in the individual countries, this results 
in a forecast average real IP growth rate of +1.2% in 2024."
"In light of the continuing economic uncertainty and the fact 
that global economic growth is expected to remain subdued, 
Brenntag expects the Group’s operating EBITA for financial 
year 2024 to be between EUR 1,230 million and EUR 1,430 
million."
"This includes improvements in earnings and addi-
tional expenses arising from our digitalization strategy."
"Our 
forecast takes into account the contributions to earnings 
from acquisitions already closed and assumes that exchange 
rates will remain stable compared with those at the time of 
the forecast."
"After the Brenntag Specialties and Brenntag Essentials divi-
sions recorded a decline in operating EBITA in 2023, the 
Brenntag Group expects a moderate rise in operating EBITA 
in both divisions in 2024."
"It is expected that Brenntag Special-
ties will report a slightly higher relative rise in operating EBITA."
"The forecast increase in operating EBITA is lower than the 
meaningful increase expected in operating gross profit due 
to the fact that further initial expenditure will be incurred in 
connection with the digitalization initiatives."
"Brenntag expects 
the rise in the Group’s operating gross profit to be driven by a 
rise in operating gross profit in both divisions."
"In this case, it is 
anticipated that the relative rise at Brenntag Specialties and 
Brenntag Essentials will be of a similar magnitude."
2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).
"In the reporting period, a Risk Management and Internal Con-
trol Committee was established that monitors, coordinates 
and initiates continuous improvements in risk management 
and in internal control functions and activities."
"It reviews risk 
management-related strategies and guidelines and monitors 
their implementation, maintenance and approval."
"It also 
deals with the process-related review in that it tracks counter-
measures and checks their plausibility."
"The risk-bearing capacity concept introduced in the previous 
year was revised and is now based on a combined equity and 
liquidity approach."
"To determine the entities included in the risk capture process, 
risk-related materiality thresholds are derived from 
Brenntag’s risk appetite, with EBITA serving as the key metric."
"Material qualitative risk factors such as business model com-
plexity, the maturity of governance, risk and compliance func-
tions, specific local regulatory requirements and an entity’s 
significance are also considered."
"To take into account early risk detection, the risks for the fol-
lowing two years are also captured."
"Measures to effectively reduce a potential or real risk are 
assigned a specific mitigation strategy and a status."
"If the 
measure is to be implemented in the future, an implementa-
tion date must be given."
"Risk reporting (early detection system)
Brenntag continually identifies and analyzes risks at the 
Group companies and constantly improves internal work-
flows and the IT systems used throughout the Group."
"Responsibility for risks at the entities included in the risk cap-
ture process lies initially with the legal units in the Brenntag 
Group."
"This includes identifying risks and estimating their 
effects."
"It must also be ensured that there are suitable meas­
ures in place to reduce risks."
"The biannual risk inventories are one important tool for global 
risk management."
"These are performed at the Group compa-
nies and at the highest Group level with system support and 
documented by the system."
"In addition, all units have been 
instructed to immediately report any significant risks emerg-
ing (ad hoc reporting) to Group headquarters."
"Since this 
reporting period, risks have been captured using a sys-
tem-supported tool."
"The prescribed risk catalog was extended to include the risk 
categories strategic risks, ESG risks and quality assurance 
risks."
"In the reporting period, the risk register was augmented 
accordingly so as to ensure that risks with a relatively low 
probability of occurrence and high extent of damage (tail 
event risks) are captured."
The risk inventories gather estimations on existing risks.
"Stan-
dardized risk catalogs giving examples of the typical risks for 
the Brenntag Group are used as a system for gathering this 
information."
"In doing so, thematically related risks are grouped 
into risk categories."
"Any risks which are identified are assessed 
with regard to the possible extent of damage and their prob-
ability of occurrence, in each case on a five-level scale."
"First, the gross risk is assessed."
"The gross risk is the maximum 
damage if no counteraction is taken."
"If a risk can be reliably 
counteracted by effective action, these measures have to be 
shown in risk profiles and assessed with regard to their effec-
tiveness."
"The residual risk (net risk) is then the gross risk less 
the effect of measures taken to reduce the risk."
"These meas­
ures are supplemented with the mitigation strategy applied 
and the status of implementation."
"the negative impact 
on the results of operations, the financial position and cash 
flow."
"The extent of damage is classified by inferring percent-
ages with respect to Group EBITA."
"As at December 31, 2023, 
this gives the following risk matrix for the 2024 analysis period:
Controlling
The Corporate Controlling department immediately pro-
cesses the information gained from the monthly and quar-
terly reports and can thus identify and communicate risks 
and opportunities."
"This also includes an analysis of the rea-
sons for any deviations from planned figures."
"On the basis of 
any identified deviations from planned figures, the Corporate 
Controlling department regularly examines the achievability 
of targets in forecasts, indicating the associated opportuni-
ties and risks."
"The financial performance indicators examined 
are described mainly in the section “Financial management 
system”, first and foremost operating EBITA."
"The ongoing evaluation of opportunity and risk potential in all 
segments is also an elementary part of Brenntag’s strategy, 
which is described in detail in the section “Objectives and 
strategy”."
"As part of regular strategy development, Brenntag 
analyzes the market opportunity and risk situation in each 
Brenntag segment and, on this basis, establishes goals and 
value-enhancing measures designed to mitigate risks and 
exploit opportunities."
"Finally, the situation analysis and busi-
ness operation plans are regularly reviewed in discussions on 
business performance."
"The individual risks reported are consolidated at regional 
level and for the Group and then presented to the Risk Man-
agement and Internal Control Committee and the Board of 
Management."
"A Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess and aggregate the 
risks."
"The resulting value at risk (VaR 95) is compared against 
risk-bearing capacity in order to ensure the stability and sus-
tainability of business activities from a risk perspective as well."
"Risk capture at local level includes risks only, not opportuni-
ties."
"In addition, the risks identified are evaluated and oppor-
tunities assessed by the function heads at the level of 
Brenntag SE (top-down review)."
"The estimate of the risks per 
risk category and the opportunities and risks are explained in 
detail in the section “Report on opportunities and risks”."
"The process for systematically identifying and assessing risks 
for the Group companies is regularly audited by Internal Audit 
Brenntag Group."
"In addition, the statutory auditor, as an inde-
pendent, external party, assesses the general suitability of the 
risk early detection system in the course of its audit of the 
annual financial statements."
"For the purposes of comparison, the prior-year figures are shown in brackets."
"Both the efficiency of the workflows and processes and the 
effectiveness of the internal control systems set up in the 
decentralized units as well as the reliability of the systems 
used are regularly examined by Internal Audit Brenntag 
Group."
The results of these audits are reported immediately.
"Thus, Brenntag ensures that the Board of Management and 
the Audit Committee are kept continuously informed of any 
weaknesses and any resulting risks, along with the appropri-
ate recommendations to eliminate the weaknesses."
"Moreover, 
in 2023 measures were implemented to further develop cen-
tral management of the internal control system."
"These aim to 
ensure and further enhance the quality and transparency of 
internal controls."
"Internal control system related to the (Group) accounting 
process (report in accordance with Section 289, para."
"4 
and Section 315, para."
"4 of the German Commercial 
Code (HGB))
The Group accounting process is managed by the Corporate 
Accounting department."
"A major element of the internal con-
trol system related to the (Group) accounting process is an 
IFRS accounting manual applicable throughout the Group 
which specifies accounting and measurement policies for all 
companies included in the consolidated financial statements."
"Preparation of the consolidated financial statements is sup-
ported by the use of uniform, standardized reporting and con-
solidation software (SAP SEM-BCS) containing comprehensive 
testing and validation routines."
"The services of external experts 
are used for special areas of accounting, e.g."
"the annual 
goodwill impairment test as well as environmental and pen-
sion actuarial reports to determine the relevant provisions."
"There are also other Group-wide guidelines which have con-
crete effects on accounting."
"The management of the local 
units confirm compliance with these guidelines by issuing a 
management certificate."
"In addition, Internal Audit Brenntag Group regularly checks 
compliance with these Group guidelines at the subsidiaries."
"Summary assessment of the internal control and risk 
management system1)
In continually addressing internal control and risk manage-
ment in financial year 2023, the Board of Management iden-
tified the potential for improvement in some areas."
"It 
responded to any risks detected by initiating immediate mea-
sures and organizational changes."
"In summary, bearing in 
mind these initiatives, the Board of Management has no indi-
cations that the internal control and risk management sys-
tem is not appropriate and effective."
"Report on opportunities and risks
Brenntag’s strategy is geared to steadily improving the effi-
ciency and underlying profitability of the business."
"The 
Brenntag Group companies are exposed to a number of 
risks arising from their business activities in the field of 
chemical distribution and related areas."
"At the same time, 
these business activities also give rise to numerous oppor-
tunities to safeguard and nurture the company’s competi-
tiveness and growth."
"Projects, in particular the strategic initiatives (see the section 
“Objectives and strategy”), are regularly implemented to 
maintain and strengthen the Group’s profitability."
"These proj-
ects focus on developing opportunities to increase operating 
gross profit and on optimizing costs."
"1)	 The disclosures in this paragraph are disclosures not typically part of the 
management report as defined in the preamble to this management report."
"The following sections 
describe the risks and opportunities which could influence the 
business performance, financial position and results of oper-
ations of the Brenntag Group."
"Similar, organizationally or 
functionally related risks have been systematically grouped 
in risk categories."
"The estimates made per risk category 
relate to the net risk."
"Unless stated otherwise or obvious from 
the context, the following statements on risks and opportuni-
ties refer to all Brenntag segments."
"As part of Group risk management, Brenntag also analyzes 
environmental, social and governance-related (ESG) aspects, 
such as environmental matters, employee matters, human 
rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters and their respec-
tive risk aspects."
"The risks are transferred into the non-finan-
cial Group report in accordance with Section 289c of the Ger-
man Commercial Code (HGB) if risks have a severe, negative 
impact on the environment and society and it is highly prob-
able that they will occur."
"The process of aggregation into risk categories includes risks 
only and does not offset risks against opportunities."
"In the 
further explanations of the risk categories, possible opportu-
nities are considered individually and described separately 
and independently of the risks."
"For three risk categories, the 
year-on-year change in the overall risk from medium to high 
is due to the adaptation of the risk matrix described above."
"For risk categories for which the overall risk decreased com-
pared with the previous year, the change is discussed sepa-
rately in the relevant paragraphs."
"This gives the following 
assessment of corporate risks for financial year 2023 in the 
2024 analysis period (as at Dec."
"31, 2023) plus the prior-year 
comparative assessment:
Overall risk

"For 
example, natural disasters, pandemics or the instability of the 
economic and political situation in regions or countries in 
which Brenntag operates may have a negative impact on its 
business and its operating result."
"Countries and regions with 
an unstable economic and political situation are often 
emerging markets, which offer great opportunities due to 
above-average growth."
"Overall, the international nature of 
the business balances out the risks."
"Moreover, a large per-
centage of business is conducted in stable economies."
"Economic downturns may have a negative impact on 
Brenntag’s sales and operating gross profit."
"Global supply 
chains have remained very strained and the trend in energy 
prices, driven primarily by various, global crises such as the 
war in Ukraine and the unrest in the Middle East, poses an 
additional challenge for international trade."
"The significant 
factors influencing the outlook include further developments 
and effects attributable to higher energy and supply costs in 
Europe, the trend in inflation in the USA and Europe, and the 
economic trend in China."
"Brenntag has drawn up lists of 
meas­
ures for various scenarios, depending on possible polit-
ical and economic developments."
"The constant dialog with customers and suppliers in the 
region also enables Brenntag to identify any impact on its 
business and supply chains at an early stage and act accord-
ingly."
"In a recession, lower profitability on the part of custom-
ers could lead to higher bad debt losses."
"We counter this risk 
through a high level of diversification by geography, customer 
industries, suppliers, products and customers."
"The increase in geopolitical risks could lead to more supply 
chain bottlenecks and therefore require rapid adaptability 
and flexibility in sourcing goods."
"In addition, difficult-to-pre-
dict processes of industrial change have accelerated."
"Due to 
its broad geographical footprint, close supplier relationships, 
diversified product portfolio, and global supplier and cus-
tomer relationships, Brenntag is well able to balance out and 
overcome bottlenecks in the supply chain."
"However, any strain 
on global supply chains harbors the risk of further increases 
in raw materials prices as well as the risk that these addi-
tional costs cannot be passed on to customers."
"In order to 
ensure a supply of raw materials at the best possible price, 
Brenntag continuously analyzes supply chains and occasion-
ally stockpiles inventories as a safety cushion."
"This, in turn, 
raises the risk that, if the situation in the raw materials market 
were to ease, the inventories would be too expensive and have 
to be sold at less than their value."
"At the same time, custom-
ers could start substituting the products with cheaper alter-
natives."
"Brenntag continuously analyzes all risks relevant to its busi-
ness and promptly takes all the necessary and possible 
meas­
ures to counter them."
"On the sales side, risks may arise from political measures, 
more specifically from tighter standards and increasing reg-
ulation, which at the same time, however, frequently represent 
an opportunity for advantage over many medium-sized com-
petitors."
"Based on its global expertise, such as in the field of 
regulation, and its broad portfolio of products and services, 
as a result of which alternative procurement channels can 
frequently be used, Brenntag is superbly positioned to be able 
to serve its customers’ requirements at all times."
"This was 
seen especially during the COVID-19 pandemic and the con-
tainer shortage, for example."
"■
Market risks and opportunities:
Brenntag’s strategic development is geared to the current 
global, regional and local market growth drivers."
"Brenntag’s business is managed through two global divisions 
focused on customer and supplier needs: Brenntag Specialties 
and Brenntag Essentials."
"In addition, 
its global network and comprehensive portfolio of products 
and services places Brenntag in a unique position to meet 
customers’ increasing requirements for pan-regional and 
global end-to-end solutions."
"The growing demand for cus-
tomer-specific solutions, blending and services and alterna-
tive sales channels also open up further growth opportunities."
"The continuous 
expansion of its geographic presence in emerging markets, 
particularly in the Asia Pacific region, offers above-average 
growth opportunities."
"Brenntag intends to continue to opti-
mally exploit the opportunities presented by company acqui-
sitions and the active consolidation of the fragmented chem-
ical distribution market."
"In terms of product sourcing, Brenntag’s operating model 
enables it to achieve economies of scale."
"The optimization of 
the local product portfolios through sales partnership agree-
ments with chemical producers for new products or product 
categories offers further potential."
"In addition, Brenntag 
intends to continue to actively realize the potential that arises 
as a result of chemical producers outsourcing supply chain 
and sales activities."
"The global distribution network and the 
experienced professional organization at all levels of the 
Brenntag Group are key elements for tapping this potential."
"Through the “Advanced Operating Model”, Brenntag is opti-
mizing the differentiated management of the two divisions 
Brenntag Essentials and Brenntag Specialties with a view to 
making optimum use of the opportunities outlined (please 
also see the section “Objectives and strategy”)."
"This is cen-
tered around the further separation of Brenntag Essentials 
and Brenntag Specialties into two independent and autono-
mous global divisions with honed profiles."
"For each of the two 
divisions, specific strategies were set out to address the par-
ticular potential in their respective markets."
"Brenntag plans to leverage customers’ increasing need for 
sustainable solutions and products to strengthen its position 
as market leader through the pioneering role it aims to play 
in responsible and sustainable chemical distribution."
"Through 
its transformation into a data- and technology-driven com-
pany which began some years ago, it also intends to fully 
exploit the potential of digital solutions in all Brenntag busi-
ness models while at the same time enabling more efficient 
and reliable supply chains."
"Lastly, through continuing M&A 
activities, Brenntag wishes to leverage growth opportunities 
in attractive market segments."
"At local level, Brenntag creates the right conditions through 
its operating activities to effectively and efficiently exploit the 
opportunities which the markets offer."
"In some local markets Brenntag serves, competition from 
other chemical distributors is growing."
"This stronger compe-
tition, which is partly due to the increasing pan-regional activ-
ities and consolidation among competitors as well as the 
development of new sales channels, some of them digital, is 
a risk that might negatively impact sales and earnings."
"Brenntag therefore works continually to improve its portfolio 
of products and services."
"The local business might also be 
impacted by customers relocating to low-cost countries."
"However, Brenntag sees its extensive global presence as a key 
factor in balancing out these local risks."
"As far as possible, the sourcing risk related to the supply of 
strategically important raw materials is offset through long-
term contracts and/or partnerships with different suppliers 
and alternative supply sources."
"However, the purchase prices 
can vary considerably depending on the market situation 
and impact on cost structures."
"To safeguard its competitive-
ness, Brenntag counteracts these risks by adjusting sales 
prices, through international procurement and through strict 
cost management."
"In the course of the central review process, the estimate of 
probability of occurrence resulting from aggregation was 
changed from “improbable” to “possible” on the basis of the 
current market assessment."
"The risk arising from future market developments is counter-
acted by constantly monitoring markets and competitors as 
well as by holding regular strategy meetings."
"■
Strategic risks
The risk portfolio was extended to include the strategic risk 
category in order to take account of the increased signifi-
cance of geopolitical change and the possible effects of the 
Advanced Operating Model."
"Strategic opportunities and risks 
for the Brenntag Group stem primarily from the ongoing 
transformation efforts and their successful or delayed imple-
mentation."
"Due to our global footprint, however, Brenntag is well posi-
tioned to offset the effects in one region though others."
"Intensifying competition as a result of competitors’ transfor-
mative M&A activities may lead to an increased risk of being 
at a disadvantage in the trend toward consolidation in chem-
ical distribution markets regionally and globally."
"However, 
Brenntag intends to carefully analyze such inorganic growth 
opportunities and actively participate if the risk/reward pro-
file is judged to be positive for Brenntag."
"■
IT risks and opportunities:
IT and cyber risks arise, on the one hand, from the dependency 
of business processes and the increasing integration of sys-
tems, and on the other from external IT security risks, such as 
the increasing threat posed by cybercrime (e.g."
"manipulation 
and theft of data through hacker attacks)."
"These risks could 
result in network failure and system slowness or errors; data 
can be falsified, stolen or destroyed by errors in system oper-
ations, program errors or external influences."
"These IT security measures are monitored using 
Group-wide IT security standards and IT policies."
"On the other 
hand, the increasing use of IT systems and data analytics 
opens up efficiency gains in operational processes and in 
improved communication with customers and suppliers."
"In 
addition, IT-managed systems generally improve the quality 
and security of internal controls and data protection."
"Brenntag invests in the further development and security of 
its digital landscape and the software used, especially on ERP 
systems and digital platforms."
"This opens up opportunities for 
improved business process support."
"On the other hand, risks 
arise in the course of implementation and development pro-
cesses (e.g."
"from requirements that may change over time), 
which Brenntag counters by constantly monitoring and, if nec-
essary, adjusting the implementation plans and solutions."
"■
Tax risks:
To enhance transparency, the two risk categories legal and 
tax risks were separated and are now examined individually."
"As a global company, Brenntag has to comply with the coun-
try-specific tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction."
"Tax 
exposures could result in particular from current and future 
tax audits of German and foreign subsidiaries."
"These expo-
sures are generally reflected in the balance sheet by recog-
nizing provisions."
"In the course of the central review, the esti-
mate of probability of occurrence was changed from 
“improbable” to “possible” bearing in mind past experience."
"The German Group companies BRENNTAG GmbH and BCD 
Chemie GmbH were the subject of routine reviews of the tax 
on alcohol and energy conducted by the German customs 
authorities for the years 2014 to 2018."
"As a result, in financial 
years 2021 and 2023, tax decision notices relating to alcohol 
tax were received for the years 2014 to 2017 in the amount of 
EUR 143.6 million and the appropriate taxes were paid."
"Legal 
redress was sought against these decisions."
"For the 
above-mentioned review period, the reviews have been com-
pleted, decision notices have been received and the tax 
assessment amounts have been paid."
The findings of the review relate only to formal errors.
"At no 
time were there doubts concerning the tax-free use of alco-
holic products by our customers."
"Brenntag and its legal advis-
ers believe that the legal redress being sought and the argu-
ments presented in the proceedings can be successful."
"Under further tax audit notices issued in 2022 and 2023, 
BRENNTAG GmbH was also the subject of a review for 2021 
and 2022."
"The assessments for those years so far amount to 
EUR 30.6k in total."
"Ultimately, 
this investigation has so far identified one case in Sweden, 
which is currently being dealt with in detail with a local, exter-
nal legal adviser."
"Based on the information available, a pro-
vision of EUR 12.5 million, including interest payable, was 
re­
cognized for this."
"■
Operational risks:
Brenntag’s business is exposed to operational risks."
"As a 
chemical distributor, Brenntag is exposed to the risk of inter-
ruptions to business, quality problems or unexpected techni-
cal difficulties, for example as a result of the incorrect han-
dling of chemicals or machinery and equipment on site and 
during transportation."
"Disruptions and outages at its ware-
house sites or during transportation may lead to delivery 
delays and falling sales revenues."
"Brenntag counters this risk 
through extensive safety measures at its sites and regionally 
standardized quality and safety manuals, by specifically 
training employees in how to handle chemicals correctly and 
through safety campaigns across the sites."
"In addition, 
Brenntag has taken out appropriate business interruption 
insurance for sites where any disruption might pose the threat 
of interruptions to business due to the local geographical site 
structure and/or portfolio structure, as well as increased cost 
of working cover for all sites."
"As Brenntag frequently uses the 
sites of external providers as well as its own sites, it is possible 
that it may (partly) relocate to different external sites in the 
event of an interruption to business so that it can continue to 
ensure that our customers are supplied."
"Risks may also arise if the products purchased and delivered 
to customers do not meet the specified and agreed quality, 
the wrong products are delivered or if, in specific cases, their 
sale is subject to restrictions."
"The distribution of certain prod-
ucts may result in particular liability risks."
"However, the pro-
cedures that have been established guarantee a good level 
of assurance that products are procured from reliable 
sources and that they are the right ones, meet the required 
standard of quality and are sold on in accordance with the 
law."
"In addition, there is product liability insurance, including 
extended product liability cover, to cover the above-men-
tioned losses."
"■
Quality management, safety, health, environmental 
protection and ESG:
The risks to safety, health and the environment arising from 
the distribution of chemicals are countered by maintaining a 
high standard of safety precautions at the sites."
"This is part 
of Brenntag’s QSHE strategy (QSHE: quality, safety, health 
and environment)."
"Information on the QSHE strategy is pub-
lished in the separate non-financial Group report."
"The moni-
toring of respect for human rights as well as environmental, 
health and safety risks is part of the sustainability strategy."
"The Board of Management sets the ESG targets at the begin-
ning of the year and is informed about the achievement of 
those targets once a quarter."
"As a chemical distributor, Brenntag generally operates in a 
complex regulatory environment."
"Cross-country teams of 
regulatory specialists are deployed to ensure that operating 
and business processes are in compliance with the relevant 
requirements."
"Here too, Brenntag sees itself in a good posi-
tion due to its scale, the central systems it has in place and 
its expertise."
"As a key player in the chemicals industry, Brenntag is aware 
of its responsibility as regards social standards."
"Respect for 
international human rights is embedded in the Group through 
a human rights risk management system that is monitored 
by the Human Rights Officer."
"Among other things, the system 
includes risk analyses conducted both in Brenntag’s own 
operations and for suppliers."
"More information on human 
rights and the supply chain is published in the separate 
non-financial Group report."
"Environmental and climate protection plays an important 
role at Brenntag."
"Brenntag’s goal worldwide is to conserve 
resources, make optimum use of them and minimize the 
impact of its business activities on soil, water and air."
"Climate 
change may give rise to a range of different risks for Brenntag, 
but also to opportunities for the company."
"Brenntag has sites 
all over the world, and more and more acute risks can be 
expected as a result of extreme weather events such as hur-
ricanes and flooding."
"In 2022, the company conducted a pilot 
project with a view to better preparing the Brenntag sites for 
such climatic changes."
"This was developed in greater detail 
and continued in 2023."
"The aim of the project is to analyze the 
exposure of all sites to physical risks in three different global 
warming scenarios."
"Sites at risk prepare for the relevant 
weather conditions by taking advance action to remove 
mainly critical products and sensitive equipment from stor-
age areas that are particularly under threat or to secure those 
products and equipment."
"In addition, the global fight against climate 
change will lead to structural, regulatory and technological 
changes in the market on the one hand, but also to increased 
costs as a result of preventive technologies or government 
carbon taxes on the other."
"Reducing CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) to net zero by 2045 
is one of the ESG targets through which Brenntag contributes 
to climate protection and wishes to fulfil its responsibility."
"In 
addition, the sustainability component will be an important 
management metric for Brenntag’s product portfolio in future 
so that Brenntag is well positioned with regard to the afore-
mentioned market changes."
"There is also a risk that 
qualified Brenntag employees will be headhunted by compet-
itors."
"Brenntag counters these risks by positioning itself glob-
ally as the preferred employer in chemical distribution, by fos-
tering long-term employee retention and through suitable 
retention measures."
"It also limits these risks through Brenntag’s 
global employer brand and through globally uniform pro-
grams and measures that allow the Brenntag companies to 
take into account country-specific legislation and circum-
stances."
"Information on Brenntag’s HR strategies and tools is 
provided in the “Social” section of the separate non-financial 
Group report for 2023."
"Combining these with other early warn-
ing indicators, Brenntag is able to promptly identify possible 
changes in employees’ attachment to the company and initi-
ate appropriate management measures where necessary."
"■
Compliance risks:
For Brenntag to be able to cooperate with its business part-
ners as a reliable partner of integrity, it is essential to comply 
with the applicable rules and laws."
"This ensures a working 
relationship of trust with partners based on shared funda-
mental beliefs."
"The aim here is to guarantee that Brenntag 
acts in accordance with its corporate values in its dealings 
with all stakeholders."
"Risks that may arise from employee 
misconduct are minimized through suitable measures."
"At the 
same time, the internal compliance management system is 
constantly further developed."
"Compliance involves conducting business in accordance with 
the relevant regulations."
"In particular, any form of corruption, 
bribery or fraud is forbidden at Brenntag."
"Other focal points of 
compliance at Brenntag include working toward compliance 
with antitrust, foreign trade and data protection requirements."
"As the global market leader in chemical distribution and as a 
company with operations around the globe, Brenntag con-
ducts business worldwide."
"In a rapidly changing environment, 
export control regulations, embargoes or other types of trade 
restriction can impact on Brenntag’s business."
"Brenntag must 
comply with all the foreign trade laws applicable to it, such 
as restrictions on exports and imports of particular goods, 
services and technologies to or from countries subject to 
sanctions or embargoes."
"When it comes to checking compa-
nies and persons against sanction lists, Brenntag uses an 
automated, IT-based solution, among other things."
"With the 
help of a special software application, regular checks are 
carried out against the sanction lists issued by the United 
Nations, the European Union, the USA and various other coun-
tries."
"The aim is to identify sanctioned companies and per-
sons, and comply with various sanctions provisions."
"The binding rules requiring all employees to treat one another 
and business partners fairly are set out in particular in 
Brenntag’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and in other 
internal guidelines."
"Failure to observe the relevant rules can 
give rise to risks and this is counteracted primarily through 
various control measures and regular audits."
"Brenntag’s 
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is binding on all employ-
ees throughout the Group."
"Employees are required to famil-
iarize themselves with its content and comply with the Code 
of Business Conduct and Ethics."
"Employees are made aware of compliance issues through 
comprehensive training measures, among other things."
"Reports of possible compliance violations are received, among 
other means, through an electronic whistleblowing system."
"All 
incoming reports are taken seriously and investigated."
"If an 
investigation confirms the suspicion, measures are taken to 
punish a violation or eliminate weaknesses in processes."
"Breaches 
of data protection regulations may lead to large penalties 
and substantial reputational damage."
"Among other meas­
ures, a global data protection guideline was introduced to 
mitigate these risks."
"In addition, both the central data protec-
tion department and the regional and local data protection 
coordinators continuously monitor data protection compli-
ance."
Employees receive regular data protection training.
"■
Acquisition risks and opportunities:
In the Brenntag Group, every decision to acquire is linked to 
minimum requirements on the internal rate of return of the 
particular investment."
"The company valuations incorporating 
the findings of due diligence work performed are of central 
importance in acquisitions."
"Therefore, all significant risks and 
opportunities are systematically recorded and an appropri-
ate purchase price determined."
"Company acquisitions 
always involve risks surrounding the integration of employees 
and business operations."
"Particularly when acquiring small 
companies, there is often a particular dependency on a hand-
ful of key employees."
"Significant integration risks mainly 
include the loss of the acquiree’s key employees and the loss 
of business relationships with suppliers and customers."
"Achieving the planned growth in the acquired business and 
realizing the planned synergies from the transaction are other 
significant areas of risk."
"Brenntag strives to limit these risks 
with adequate transaction structures, by conducting oppor-
tunity and risk analyses at an early stage in the approval pro-
cess, with the support of external consultants and with spe-
cific contract structures (e.g."
"incentive, warranty and retention 
clauses)."
"In the past, M&A activities focused on Europe, North 
America and Asia."
"In the case of acquisitions in emerging 
markets in Asia and Latin America, purchase prices are some-
times relatively high and the risks also higher (e.g."
"compliance 
risks, higher working capital funding requirements, integra-
tion risks, foreign currency risks)."
"In the course of the central 
review, the risk was changed from “insignificant” to “high” 
bearing in mind the intended increase in acquisition volume."
"However, there are also much greater opportunities due to 
higher expected growth rates."
"Strong market fragmentation 
regularly gives rise to acquisition opportunities for Brenntag 
(multitude of acquisition opportunities)."
"Brenntag can selec-
tively pursue acquisition targets with the most suitable target 
entities and a number of opportunities arise to support stra-
tegic objectives through acquisitions."
"Systematic use of a 
practiced acquisition and integration process helps to mini-
mize risks and exploit potential."
"■
Legal risks:
Brenntag SE and individual subsidiaries have been named as 
defendants in various legal actions and proceedings arising 
in connection with their activities as a global group."
"Some-
times, Brenntag is also the subject of investigations by the 
authorities."
"Brenntag cooperates with the relevant authorities 
and, where appropriate, conducts internal investigations 
regarding alleged wrongdoings with the assistance of 
in-house and external counsel."
"The decision issued by the French Competition Authority in 
2013 in relation to the allocation of customers and coordina-
tion of prices was set aside by a court of appeal due to pro-
cedural errors at Brenntag’s request in February 2017."
"In 
December 2020, the court imposed a fine of EUR 47 million."
"Brenntag lodged an appeal against the decision, whereupon 
the imposed fine was reimbursed in November 2023 and the 
proceedings referred back by the Cour de cassation (Court of 
cassation) for a further decision."
"With further steps expected 
to be taken by the French authorities responsible, a provision 
was recognized in the amount of the EUR 47 million reim-
bursement."
"Regarding the investigation also ongoing at the 
French Competition Authority concerning whether BRENNTAG 
SA has illegally made use of its market position, a decision by 
the Authority is still pending."
"Based on current knowledge, 
Brenntag assumes that claims for civil liability arising from 
the above-mentioned proceedings are not sufficiently sub-
stantiated."
"Given the number of legal disputes and other proceedings 
that Brenntag is involved in, it is possible that a ruling may be 
made against Brenntag in some of these proceedings."
"The 
company contests actions and proceedings where it consid-
ers it appropriate."
"Provisions are established for ongoing legal 
disputes on the basis of the estimated risk and, if necessary, 
with the help of external consultants."
"It is very difficult to pre-
dict the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in 
which claimants seek indeterminate compensation."
"Any 
adverse decisions rendered in such cases may have material 
effects on Brenntag’s net assets, financial position and results 
of operations for a reporting period."
"However, Brenntag cur-
rently does not expect its net assets, financial position and 
results of operations to be materially affected."
"In addition, Brenntag has taken measures to 
mitigate the risk and is asserting claims for compensation 
from third parties."
"Nevertheless, the possibility that these 
legal disputes will result in significant adverse effects on the 
results of operations cannot be ruled out."
"In the course of the central review, the estimate of the effect 
was changed from “low” to “medium” and the estimate of 
probability of occurrence from “improbable” to “possible” 
bearing in mind past experience."
"■
Financial risks and opportunities:
Brenntag’s business is generally exposed to exchange rate, 
interest rate, credit and price risks."
"Due to the fact that 
Brenntag conducts business in different currency areas, 
changes in exchange rates may have positive or negative 
translation effects on the results of the Group."
"In particular, 
any change in the euro/US dollar exchange rate may have a 
substantial impact as a large proportion of business is con-
ducted in the US dollar area."
"Brenntag has decided not to 
hedge exchange rate differences resulting from the transla-
tion of financial statements of subsidiaries whose functional 
currency is not the euro (translation risks)."
"On the other hand, 
transaction exposures resulting from the translation of for-
eign currency receivables and liabilities into the functional 
currency of a subsidiary are hedged insofar as is possible and 
where it makes economic sense to do so."
"This is based on a 
Group-wide Finance Guideline that sets out basic require-
ments and objectives, threshold values and hedging instru-
ments to be used."
"The Finance Guideline requires Group com-
panies to offset the risks of open net foreign currency exposure 
using suitable instruments such as forward and swap con-
tracts or to keep them within certain limits."
"Any exceptions 
exceeding the above limits must be agreed on a case-by-
case basis with the Treasury department."
"Unfavorable political developments and financial policy deci-
sions in specific countries may have a particularly negative 
impact in this context."
"Risks related to cash investments are limited by only doing 
business with banks and business partners considered to be 
of strong credit standing."
"Payments are also handled through 
such banks."
"The credit facility under the syndicated loan is 
made available by a large number of international banks, 
meaning that availability is ensured through high diversity."
"Uncollectibility risk is reduced by continually monitoring cus-
tomers’ credit ratings and payment behavior and setting 
appropriate credit limits."
"The risk is limited by the large num-
ber of customers the company has in different countries; even 
the largest key account customer only accounts for a very 
small single-digit percentage of Group sales."
"In some cases, 
credit insurance is also taken out in order to limit risks."
The Brenntag Group is partly financed with debt capital.
"Brenntag is confident that the loan agreements and credit 
lines, the bonds issued and the liquid funds available are ade-
quate to cover the Group’s future liquidity needs, even if 
requirements should increase unexpectedly."
"Like comparable 
loan agreements, the syndicated loan contains a number of 
customary provisions."
"In the event of a severe breach of the 
provisions of the loan agreement, the facility agent appointed 
by the lenders may call in the loans if he deems this move 
necessary to safeguard the lenders’ interests."
"As the Group’s 
main financing instruments (syndicated loan, two bonds and 
promissory notes) all contain so-called cross-default clauses, 
any breach of contract or calling due of outstanding amounts 
in respect to one financing instrument could also have a neg-
ative impact on the others."
"The terms and conditions of the financing instruments are 
also influenced by the Group’s credit rating."
"A change in the 
rating that the international rating agencies Standard & 
Poor’s and Moody’s assign to Brenntag may impact on the 
Group’s financing terms."
"The rating may have a positive or a 
negative impact."
"Both rating agencies continue to assign an 
investment grade rating, thereby confirming Brenntag’s high 
credit standing."
"Moody’s currently rates Brenntag at “Baa2” 
with a stable outlook, while Standard & Poor’s has given 
Brenntag a rating of “BBB+” with a stable outlook."
"Some of Brenntag’s financing is based on variable interest 
rates which are subject to fluctuations in market interest 
rates."
"This means that Brenntag has both the opportunity to 
participate in falling market interest rates but also the risk of 
incurring higher interest cost as a result of rising market inter-
est rates."
"The split between variable and fixed interest rates 
is determined as part of interest risk management."
"Derivative 
instruments such as foreign exchange forwards, interest rate 
and currency swaps or combined instruments may be used 
to hedge risks from financing."
"Interest rate-related financial 
risks are mainly managed by the Treasury department at 
Group headquarters."
"If individual companies hedge financial 
risks from operating activities themselves, this is done in con-
sultation with and under the supervision of Group headquar-
ters."
This permits a balancing of risks throughout the Group.
"The Brenntag Group has obligations to current and former 
employees as a result of pension commitments."
"Some of the 
pension obligations are covered by plan assets."
"The plan 
assets are subject to capital market risks, as a portion of 
them is invested in funds and equities."
"To some extent regionally, 
contributions are also paid into defined benefit pension plans 
maintained by more than one employer (termed multi-­
employer plans)."
"If other participating employers do not meet 
their payment obligations, Brenntag may be liable for the 
obligations of those employers."
"The above-mentioned financial risks are also relevant mainly 
for the single-entity financial statements of Brenntag SE pre-
pared in accordance with German commercial law."
"In addi-
tion, the company is exposed to impairment risk on the equity 
investments it holds."
"The continuous monitoring of our invest-
ments in subsidiaries is an integral part of our risk manage-
ment, meaning that potential impairments are identified at 
an early stage and, if necessary, countermeasures can be 
taken to stabilize or improve the subsidiaries’ profitability."
"The year-on-year decrease in the overall risk from medium to 
low is attributable to the fact that offsetting foreign currency 
effects within the Group were taken into account in this 
reporting period."
"Summary of the opportunities  
and risk situation
During the past financial year, the executive directors once 
again continuously updated and assessed the risk situation 
for the Brenntag Group."
"The Group’s risk position did not 
change significantly during that period."
"In our opinion, the risks 
described in the section “Report on opportunities and risks” do 
not jeopardize the continued existence of the company, either 
individually or collectively, and do not exceed its risk-bearing 
capacity."
"It can be concluded, therefore, that none of the risks, 
either in isolation or in aggregate, compromises the going 
concern principle from an equity or liquidity standpoint."
"Addi-
tional risks and opportunities that are not yet known or risks 
that are currently considered immaterial may also have a 
negative impact on our business operations."
"Brenntag is con-
vinced that the challenges arising from the risks described 
above can continue to be mastered successfully."
"On September 1, 
2023, Brenntag was informed pursuant to Section 33 of the 
German Securities Trading Act that Kühne Holding AG’s share 
of the voting rights exceeded 10%."
"Other voting right notifi-
cations in accordance with Section 33 of the German Secu-
rities Trading Act received by Brenntag SE in the reporting 
period concern shares of the voting rights in excess of the 3% 
and 5% thresholds."
"Shares with special rights conferring  
powers of control
There are no shares with special rights conferring powers of 
control."
"System of control of any employee  
participation scheme where the control 
rights are not exercised directly by the 
employees
Brenntag SE does not have a general employee participation 
scheme."
"Explanatory report on information required under 
Sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial

notional value of EUR 1.00."
"According to article 7, para."
"3 of the Articles of Association of 
Brenntag SE, any right of shareholders to certification of their 
shares is excluded to the extent permitted by law and that 
certification is not required under the rules of any stock

"The com-
pany is entitled to issue share certificates embodying several 
shares (consolidated certificates)."
"Pursuant to Section 67,

junction with Article 9, para."
"1 (c) (ii) of Council Regulation (EC) 
No 2157/2001 on the Statute for a European company (“the 
SE Regulation”), only those persons recorded in the compa-
ny’s share register will be recognized as shareholders of 
Brenntag SE."
"All shares confer the same 
rights and obligations."
"At the Annual General Meeting, each 
share has one vote and accounts for the shareholders’ pro-
portionate share in the net income of Brenntag SE."
"Excepted 
from this rule are any treasury shares held by Brenntag SE 
that do not entitle Brenntag SE to any membership rights."
Brenntag SE does not currently have any treasury shares.
"and

"Restrictions on voting rights  
or transfer of shares
The Board of Management of Brenntag SE is not aware of any 
agreements relating to restrictions on voting rights or on the 
transfer of shares."
"The shareholders shall generally 
be granted a subscription right."
"However, in certain cases the 
Board of Management is authorized, with the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, to exclude the shareholders’ statutory 
subscription rights for one or more capital increases under 
the authorized capital."

"3, sentence 4 of the German Stock Corpo-
ration Act is not less than 10% of the registered share capital 
(simplified exclusion of subscription rights)."
"The 10% threshold 
will be determined based on the share capital at the time the 
authorization becomes effective."
"If the share capital is lower 
at the time this authorization is exercised, that lower amount 
will apply."
"The Board of Management shall decide on the further content 
of the share rights and the conditions of the issuance of 
shares with the approval of the Supervisory Board."
"Authorization to acquire and use treasury shares  
in accordance with Section 71, para."
"8 of the

company which Brenntag SE has already acquired and still 
holds, may at no time account for more than 10% of the 
respective registered share capital."
"The authorization may be 
exercised in whole or in part, once or several times."
"It took 
effect at the close of the Annual General Meeting on June 9,

nition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insur-
ance contracts by insurers."
"The amendments to IAS 1 are part of the IASB’s Disclosure 
Initiative, the fundamental objective of which is to improve the 
quality of financial reporting."
"This also includes ridding the 
notes to IFRS financial statements of information that is irrel-
evant to users of the financial statements."
"In future, disclo-
sures will be required only on material accounting policy 
information and not on significant accounting policy informa-
tion."

ful to users of the financial statements."
"The amendments to IAS 8 contain clarifications to help enti-
ties distinguish between accounting policies and accounting 
estimates."

hibition on the recognition of deferred tax at initial recognition

the amendment, liabilities are classified as non-current if, at 
the end of the reporting period, the entity has a substantive 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve 
months after the reporting date."
"In assessing whether a (sub-
stantive) right exists, the entity does not consider whether it 
will exercise its right."
"Classification is unaffected by manage-
ment’s intentions in this regard."
"such conditions do not affect a liability’s clas-
sification as current or non-current."

subsequently measure the lease liability in such a way that it 
does not recognize any gain or loss that relates to the right of 
use it retains."

Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that con-
cern additional disclosure requirements in connection with 
reverse factoring arrangements in particular."

currency is exchangeable and when it is not, and set out how 
an entity determines the exchange rate to be applied when a 
currency is not exchangeable."
"Moreover, IAS 21 is extended to 
include a provision requiring the disclosure of additional infor-
mation when a currency is not exchangeable."

Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate, 
income and expense at the annual average rate."

a performance obligation."
"Revenue is recognized in the amount of consideration to 
which Brenntag expects to be entitled in exchange for goods 
or services."
"Variable consideration, such as cash discounts, 
discounts and rebates, is estimated and taken into account 
when determining the transaction price."
"Revenue from the sale of goods or services is recognized when 
control of the goods or services transfers to the customer."
"Control transfers when the customer obtains control of the 
agreed goods or services and can obtain benefits from them."
"In a sale of goods, control usually transfers when the goods 
are collected by the customer or dispatched by Brenntag or 
a third party."
"In this case, revenue is recognized at a point in 
time."
Revenue from services is recognized over time.
"There are currently no significant financing components in 
the Brenntag Group."
"Payment terms are negotiated locally 
and reflect standard market practice."

Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing 
component are initially recognized at the transaction price in 
accordance with IFRS 15."
"All other financial assets are meas­
ured on initial recognition at fair value (if applicable, including 
transaction costs)."
"Fair value is defined as the price that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liabil-
ity in an orderly transaction between market participants at 
the measurement date."
"Trade receivables, other receivables and receivables included 
in other financial assets are measured at amortized cost."
"There are no financial instruments measured at fair value

Trade receivables are subsequently measured using provision 
matrices under the simplified impairment model."
"Based on 
historical credit losses and forward-looking estimates, the 
country-specific valuation allowances expected over the life-
time of the trade receivables are determined for receivables 
in the same credit risk class (e.g."
"customer industries) (stage 
2 of the impairment model)."
"In this context, credit risk is 
assessed primarily on the basis of the extent to which the 
receivables are past due."
"For other receivables and financial assets subsequently meas­
ured at amortized cost, the lifetime expected losses resulting 
from default events within the next twelve months are recog-
nized in profit or loss on initial recognition and subsequent 
measurement (stage 1 of the impairment model)."
"In the event 
of a significant increase in credit risk, the total losses expected 
over the lifetime of the assets are reflected (stage 2 of the 
impairment model)."
"If there is objective evidence that trade receivables or other 
financial assets measured at amortized cost should be con-
sidered impaired, e.g."
"because they are more than 180 days 
past due or because insolvency or similar proceedings are 
opened, a specific valuation allowance reflecting the credit 
risk in question is recognized in profit or loss."
"The valuation 
allowances are posted to an allowance account in the bal-
ance sheet."
"If a receivable is uncollectible, the gross amount 
and the valuation allowance are both derecognized."
"Uncol-
lectibility is determined on a case-by-case basis, based on 
appropriate indicators."
"A regular way purchase or sale of non-derivative financial 
assets is recognized at the settlement date."
"Derivative finan-
cial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet when 
Brenntag becomes a party to the contractual provisions of 
that instrument."
"Financial assets are derecognized if the contractual rights to 
the cash flows from the financial asset have expired or 
Brenntag has transferred substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the financial asset."
"Inventories 
Inventories mainly comprise merchandise."
"They are initially 
recognized at cost."
"Production costs for the inventories pro-
duced through further processing are also capitalized."
"Inventories are subsequently measured in accordance with 
IAS 2 at the lower of cost (on the basis of the average cost 
formula) and net realizable value."
"Net realizable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less 
the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs 
necessary to make the sale."
"Net realizable value also reflects 
effects of obsolescence or reduced marketability."
"Earlier val-
uation allowances on inventories are reversed if the net real-
izable value of the inventories increases again."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost of acquisition 
or construction and, except for land, depreciated over its esti-
mated useful life on a straight-line basis."
"If major components 
of an item of property, plant and equipment have different 
useful lives, these components are accounted for separately 
and depreciated over their respective useful lives."
"Acquisition costs include all expenditure directly attributable 
to the acquisition."
"In accordance with IAS 20, government grants and assistance 
for investments are deducted from the related asset."
"The charges on property, plant and equipment include both 
depreciation charges and impairment losses."
"When items of property, plant and equipment are sold, the 
difference between the net proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the respective asset is recognized as a gain or loss 
in other operating income or expenses."
"Intangible assets acquired through business combinations 
are measured on initial recognition at their acquisition-date 
fair value."
Separately acquired intangible assets are carried at cost.
"Acquired software licenses are recognized at cost plus 
directly attributable costs incurred to acquire and bring to 
use the specific software."
"For the purposes of accounting for cloud computing arrange-
ments, the individual contract components, such as the soft-
ware used in the context of such arrangements, are assessed 
separately."
"Software applications provided by cloud service 
providers are assessed as to whether they are an intangible 
asset under IAS 38."
"The accounting for implementation costs arising in cloud 
computing arrangements follows the accounting for the 
related software component."
"If the related software compo-
nent is an intangible asset under IAS 38, the criteria for rec-
ognizing acquisition-related costs as part of the cost of an 
intangible asset apply."
"If, on the other hand, the software 
component is a service contract, the implementation costs 
are accounted for based on the IFRS IC’s 2021 agenda deci-
sion “Configuration or Customization Costs in a Cloud Com-
puting Arrangement”."
"In addition to goodwill, the “Brenntag” trademark also has an 
indefinite useful life as, based on an analysis of all of the rel-
evant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over 
which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for 
the entity."
"The other intangible assets are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives."
"Leases
The leases at Brenntag relate mainly to land and buildings 
(warehouse and office space), vehicles and other plant and 
equipment."
"Leases are entered into for fixed terms of more 
than one year to 70 years in limited cases, but may also con-
tain extension options."
"For leases where Brenntag is lessee, a lease liability is gener-
ally recognized along with a corresponding right-of-use asset, 
if applicable taking into account any further cost compo-
nents."
"This excludes short-term leases with a term of one year 
or less and leases of low-value and intangible assets, for 
which expenditure is recognized as an expense over the term."
"If that 
rate cannot be readily determined, Brenntag uses the incre-
mental borrowing rate."
"The incremental borrowing rates were 
determined on the basis of a base rate plus a risk premium."
"The base rates in major currencies and countries were derived 
from interest rate swaps (if available) or government bond 
yields for a period of up to twenty years."
"For countries or cur-
rencies for which there were no reliable data available on 
which to base the determination, the euro base rate was 
adjusted to reflect a country risk premium."
"Lease payments are not separated into payments for lease 
components and payments for non-lease components (e.g."
payments for maintenance or servicing costs).
"In subsequent periods, the right-of-use asset is generally 
depreciated on a straight-line basis."
"The lease liability is 
adjusted using the effective interest method."
"Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and are, 
therefore, not subject to amortization are also tested for 
impairment at least annually."
"Impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset 
exceeds the estimated recoverable amount."
"Recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and 
value in use."
"Value in use is the present value of the future 
cash flows expected to be derived from an asset."
"If the carry-
ing amount is higher than the recoverable amount, the asset 
is written down to the recoverable amount."
"If the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be 
determined, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit (CGU) or group of cash-generating units to which this 
asset belongs is determined and compared with the carrying 
amount of the CGU or group of CGUs."
"Impairments, except for impairments of goodwill, are reversed 
as soon as the reasons for the impairment no longer exist."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment regularly, at least annually, 
after completion of the annual budget process by comparing 
the carrying amount of the relevant group of CGUs with its 
recoverable amount."
"If the carrying amount of a group of CGUs exceeds the recov-
erable amount, an impairment exists in the amount of the 
difference."
"In this case, the goodwill of the relevant group of 
CGUs would first be written down."
"Any remaining impairment 
would be allocated to the assets of the group of CGUs in pro-
portion to the net carrying amounts of the assets at the 
reporting date."
"The carrying amount of an individual asset 
must not be less than the highest of fair value less costs of 
disposal, value in use (in each case in as far as they can be 
determined) and zero."
"Non-current provisions are recognized at the present value of 
the expected outflow and their discounting is unwound over 
the period until their expected utilization."
"For provisions for 
long-service anniversary bonuses and pre-retirement part-
time working arrangements, this is carried out bearing in mind 
actuarial principles or by obtaining external appraisals."
"If the amount of an obligation declines as a result of a change 
in an estimate, the provision is reversed by the corresponding 
amount."
"Reversals of provisions for personnel expenses are rec-
ognized in personnel expenses."
"Provisions recognized as other 
operating expenses are reversed as other operating income."
"Provisions are recognized for cash-settled share-based pay-
ments in accordance with IFRS 2."
"The Long-Term Incentive 
Program and the expiring long-term, virtual share-based 
remuneration program for the members of the Board of Man-
agement and the Long-Term Incentive Plan for Executives and 
Senior Managers are classified as cash-settled share-based 
payments."
"Provisions are established for the resulting obliga-
tions."
The obligations are measured at fair value.
"They are 
recognized as personnel expenses over the vesting period 
during which the beneficiaries acquire a vested right (uncon-
ditional right)."
"The fair value is remeasured at each reporting 
date and at the settlement date."
"The contributions to be paid into defined contribution pension 
plans are recognized directly as expense."
"Provisions for pen-
sion obligations are not established as, in these cases, 
Brenntag has no additional obligation apart from the obliga-
tion to pay the premiums."
"In accordance with IAS 19, provisions are established for 
defined benefit plans, unless the plans are multi-employer 
pension funds for which insufficient information is available."
"For this purpose, an 
actuarial valuation is obtained every year."
"The actuarial 
assumptions for the discount rate, salary increase rate, pen-
sion trend, life expectancy and cost increases for medical 
care used to calculate the defined benefit obligation are 
established on the basis of the respective economic circum-
stances."
"The plan assets measured at fair value are deducted 
from the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
(gross pension obligation)."
"Plan assets are assets where the 
claim to said assets has, in principle, been assigned to the 
beneficiaries."
"This results in the net liability required to be 
recognized or the net asset required to be recognized."
"The discount rate is determined by reference to market 
yields at the end of the reporting period on fixed-rate senior 
corporate bonds."
"The currency and term of the corporate 
bonds taken as a basis are consistent with the currency and 
estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations."
"Life expectancy is determined using the latest mortality 
tables."
"Pension costs are made up of three components:
Component
Constituents
Recognized in
Service cost
– Current service cost
– Past service cost incl."
"Multi-employer defined benefit plans are treated as defined 
contribution plans when insufficient information is available."
"Trade payables, financial liabilities and  
other liabilities
Trade payables, financial liabilities (excluding derivative finan-
cial instruments and contingent purchase prices payable in 
business combinations) and other liabilities are classified as 
at amortized cost."
"They are initially recognized at their fair 
value net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently car-
ried at amortized cost using the effective interest method."
"Derivative financial instruments and contingent purchase 
prices payable in business combinations are initially recog-
nized at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"On initial recognition, forwards, symmetric call / put options, 
written put options and liabilities arising from limited part-
ners’ rights to repayment of contributions are recognized out-
side profit or loss as a synthetic liability at the present value 
of the settlement amount."
"Until the forwards and options are 
exercised, non-controlling interests are presented in consoli-
dated equity."
"These items are subsequently measured at 
amortized cost."
"Unwinding of discounting and changes in 
estimates are recognized in profit or loss."
"Liabilities arising 
from limited partners’ rights to repayment of contributions 
are recognized in profit or loss at amortized cost, in the 
amount of the expected right to repayment of contributions."
"Exchange rate effects are recognized in profit or loss or, in the 
case of net investment hedges, directly in equity."
"Call options without a symmetric put option are initially rec-
ognized at fair value outside profit or loss and subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Deferred taxes and current income taxes
Current income taxes for current and prior periods are recog-
nized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from 
the taxation authorities."
"Deferred taxes are determined in accordance with IAS 12 
(Income Taxes)."
"They arise from temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
IFRS balance sheet and their tax base, from consolidation 
adjustments and from tax loss carryforwards that are 
expected to be utilized."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that there 
are sufficient taxable differences available for utilization and 
it is likely that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences and unutilized loss carryfor-
wards can be utilized."
"Deferred taxes for domestic companies are calculated on the 
basis of the combined income tax rate of the German consol-
idated tax group of Brenntag SE of 32% (2022: 32%) for cor-
porate income tax, solidarity surcharge and trade income tax, 
and for foreign companies, at local tax rates."
"These are tax 
rates which can be expected to apply on the basis of laws in 
the different countries that have been enacted or substan-
tially enacted at the reporting date."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted against each 
other if they relate to the same taxation authority, the com-
pany has a legally enforceable right to set them off against 
each other and they mature in the same period."
"Brenntag falls within the scope of the OECD’s Pillar Two model 
rules."
"In Germany, the jurisdiction in which Brenntag SE is 
domiciled, the Pillar Two legislation has been enacted and 
becomes effective for financial years beginning after Decem-
ber 30, 2023."
"As the Pillar Two legislation was not yet in effect 
at the reporting date, Brenntag is not currently subject to a 
tax charge in this respect."
"The Group is applying the exception 
to the accounting for deferred taxes related to Pillar Two 
income taxes that was the subject of the amendments to IAS 
12 issued in May 2023."
"Brenntag is currently making an assessment of the effects of 
Pillar Two after the legislation enters into effect."
"So far, this 
analysis has shown that only a very small number of countries 
(among others, Switzerland, Ireland, Bulgaria, Hungary and 
the United Arab Emirates) fall below the average effective tax 
rate of 15% based on the IFRS results."
"Based on current 
knowledge, any additional tax for the countries identified 
would not have had a significant effect on the Group tax rate."
"Although they fall below the average effective tax rate, the 
Group may not have to pay any Pillar Two income taxes in 
respect of these countries."
"This is due to specific adjustments 
provided for in the Pillar Two legislation, as a result of which 
differences may arise versus the effective tax rates calcu-
lated in accordance with IAS 12.86."
"Even for 
companies with an effective tax rate of over 15%, Pillar Two 
could therefore result in tax effects."
"Brenntag is currently 
working together with tax specialists to support it in applying 
the Pillar Two legislation."
"Subscribed capital
The subscribed capital is carried at its nominal value."
"Assumptions and estimates
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires 
the use of assumptions and estimates which may affect the 
amount and presentation of assets and liabilities and income 
and expenses."
"In 2023, Brenntag continued to operate in a difficult macro-
economic environment as a result of the years of the pan-
demic, the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions."
"Brenntag’s business performance and the assumptions 
about its future free cash flow performance therefore remain 
subject to uncertainties which may affect the recognition and 
amount of assets and liabilities stated in the balance sheet, 
particularly goodwill."
"If the free cash flow taken as a basis for 
goodwill impairment testing, which is influenced mainly by 
gross profit performance, had been 10% lower (previous year: 
15% lower), with all other conditions remaining the same, a 
goodwill impairment loss would not have arisen in any group 
of CGUs."
"A 20% lower (previous year: 30% lower) growth rate 
over the entire planning period would have resulted in an 
impairment loss of EUR 16.0 million in the group of CGUs 
China Hong Kong (BES)."
"An increase of 1.0 percentage points 
(previous year: 1.5 percentage points) in the WACC (weighted 
average cost of capital after taxes) taken as a basis for good-
will impairment testing would have resulted in an impairment 
loss of EUR 10.1 million in the group of CGUs China Hong Kong 
(BES)."
"No impairment loss would have arisen in the other 
groups of CGUs."
"Even applying the increased sensitivity 
ranges used in the previous year due to a heightened level of 
uncertainty would have resulted only in an impairment loss of 
up to EUR 37.0 million for the group of CGUs China Hong Kong 
(BES)."
"In the previous year, no goodwill impairment arose 
during the sensitivity analyses."
"If the discount rates used to determine the environmental pro-
visions had been one percentage point higher or lower and all 
other conditions had remained the same, the provision would 
have decreased by EUR 5.7 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 5.8 mil-
lion) or increased by EUR 6.3 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 6.6 
million), respectively."
"Sensitivity analyses of defined benefit pension obligations are 
described in the section “Provisions for pensions and other 
post-employment benefits”."
"Due to purchase prices being contingent on earnings, liabili-
ties relating to the acquisition of non-controlling interests are 
subject to estimation uncertainty over the amount of the pur-
chase prices payable."
"In the case of right-of-use assets under IFRS 16 (Leases), pur-
chase and extension options are recognized if they are rea-
sonably certain to be exercised."
"In this respect, the assess-
ment is subject to a high degree of judgment."
"If circumstances 
change, the assessment of whether an option is reasonably 
certain to be exercised must be made anew."
"When measuring deferred tax assets for tax loss carryfor-
wards, the future taxable profit available is based on a plan-
ning horizon of five years."
"The useful lives of items of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets are shown in the 
sections Property, plant and equipment and Intangible assets."
"The actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and 
estimates in individual cases."
"Adjustments are recognized 
when estimates are revised."
"Climate protection plays a particularly 
important role within Brenntag’s sustainability strategy, as 
the entire value chain is affected."
"Moreover, climate protec-
tion is important to many of Brenntag’s customers."
"In this context, Brenntag’s net assets, financial posi-
tion and results of operations could potentially be affected."
"In financial year 2023, there were neither any discernible spe-
cific indications of impairment losses on non-current assets 
or a material change in the remaining useful lives of assets, 
nor any discernable effects on existing or potentially new 
environmental or restoration obligations."
"Moreover, there 
were no effects on the estimates and assumptions made."
"Cash flow statement
The cash flow statement classifies cash flows by operating, 
investing and financing activities."
"The cash provided by oper-
ating activities is determined using the indirect method on the 
basis of the profit / loss after tax."
"Interest payments made and 
received, tax payments and dividends received are presented 
as components of cash provided by operating activities."
"The 
effects of acquisitions of consolidated subsidiaries and other 
business units as defined by IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) 
are eliminated from the individual items of the cash flow 
statement and combined under cash flow from investing 
activities."
"Under IFRS 16 (Leases), lease payments made are 
included in cash used in financing activities as repayments 
of borrowings and in cash provided by operating activities as 
interest paid."
"Payments under short-term leases or leases of 
low-value assets are a component of cash flow from operat-
ing activities."
"Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow 
statement correspond to the cash and cash equivalents in 
the balance sheet."
"The effect of exchange rate changes on 
cash and cash equivalents is shown separately."
"Hyperinflation
As of June 30, 2022, Turkey has been required to be classified 
as a hyperinflationary economy in accordance with IAS 29 
(Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies)."
"This 
standard requires non-monetary assets and liabilities, the 
statement of comprehensive income and equity to be 
restated at the end of each reporting period by applying the 
price index applicable at the end of the reporting period."
"The 
balance of those adjustments is presented in profit or loss as 
a loss on the net monetary position."
"IAS 29 must be applied 
as if Turkey had always been hyperinflationary."
"Brenntag 
used the consumer price index published by the Turkish Sta-
tistical Institute (Dec."
"31, 2022: 1,129 index points; Dec."
"31, 
2023: 1,859 index points)."
"All items are translated at the clos-
ing rate due to hyperinflation."
"Inflation resulted in a loss on 
the net monetary position of EUR 16.0 million for 2023 (2022: 
EUR 16.3 million)."
1)	 Reduction with respect to the sites already included in the 2020 base year.
New sites will be tracked separately.
"2)	 The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate 
change."
"It was adopted by 196 parties at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 
2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016."
"Its goal is to limit global 
warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared with 
pre-industrial levels."
"It is therefore based on the inter-
nal control and reporting information used by the senior 
management as the Group’s chief operating decision maker 
to assess segment performance and allocate resources."
"The 
accounting policies applied are generally the same as those 
described for the Group in the section “Consolidation policies 
and methods”."
"Since financial year 2022, operating EBITA has 
been the key performance indicator within the Brenntag 
Group."
"This is calculated as the operating profit as reported 
in the consolidated income statement, plus amortization and 
impairment of intangible assets."
"It is also adjusted for hold-
ing charges and for income and expenses arising from spe-
cial items."
"The Brenntag Group is managed through two global divisions, 
Brenntag Specialties and Brenntag Essentials, which are 
each managed through geographically structured segments."
"Brenntag Specialties focuses on selling ingredients and 
 
value-added services to the selected industries, Nutrition, 
Pharma, Personal Care/HI&I (Home, Industrial & Institutional), 
Material Science (Coatings & Construction, Polymers, Rub-
ber), Water Treatment and Lubricants."
"Brenntag Essentials 
markets a broad portfolio of process chemicals across a wide 
range of industries and applications."
"The global Brenntag 
Specialties division comprises the geographical reportable 
segments EMEA, Americas and APAC."
"The global Brenntag 
Essentials division comprises the geographical reportable 
segments EMEA, North America, Latin America and APAC."
"The 
two divisions are supported by Brenntag Business Services, 
which have been subsumed under “All other Segments” in the 
following table."
"In addition, “All other Segments” combines the 
central functions for the entire Group."
"The international oper-
ations of BRENNTAG International Chemicals GmbH, which 
buys and sells chemicals in bulk on an international scale 
without regional boundaries, are also included here."

sions to the Group:

The goodwill and the “Brenntag” trademark are assets with 
an indefinite useful life."
"They are tested regularly, at least 
annually, for impairment after completion of the annual bud-
get process."
"The carrying amount of the “Brenntag” trade-
mark is EUR 196.9 million as in the previous year."
"The Brenntag Group is managed through two global divisions, 
Brenntag Specialties (BSP) and Brenntag Essentials (BES), 
which are each managed through geographically structured 
segments."
"These are the groups of cash-generating units 
(groups of CGUs) for the goodwill impairment test."
"Goodwill 
breaks down by group of CGUs as follows:
in EUR m
Dec."
"Fair value less 
costs of disposal is taken as the recoverable amount."
"This 
amount is determined on the basis of a recognized company 
valuation model."
"The company valuation model is based on 
cash flow plans, which are in turn based on the five-year plan 
approved by the Board of Management and applicable at the 
date of the performance of the impairment test, taking into 
account IFRS 16 (Leases)."
"The five-year plan consists of a mid-
term plan for the first four years prepared by management in 
collaboration with the subsidiaries and an extrapolation for 
one further year performed by management."
"The fair value 
thus determined is required to be classified into Level 3 of the 
IFRS 13 measurement hierarchy."
"The cash flow forecasts for the impairment test of the finan-
cial year ended December 31, 2023 were derived from the 
budget for 2024 and the plan years 2025 to 2028."
"The growth 
rates are based on management’s past experience, 
Brenntag-specific changes in quantities and sales prices, the 
resulting gross profit and the trend in costs based on external 
macroeconomic data."
"These forecasts are in each case 
based on country-specific assumptions about the trend in key 
macroeconomic variables, such as gross domestic product, 
consumer prices, interest rate levels and nominal wages, and 
are derived on the basis of economic and financial studies."
"In the detailed planning period from 2024 to 2028, the average 
gross profit growth rates (CAGR) of the cash-generating units 
of Brenntag Specialties and Brenntag Essentials are between 
2.9% and 10.0% (Dec."
"31, 2022: between 3.0% and 14.4%)."
"They 
were determined on the basis of long-term growth expecta-
tions for the individual countries, and for all regions they are 
below the growth rates anticipated for gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP)."
"The year-on-year increases in the growth rates 
reflect management’s higher long-term growth expectations."
"The region-specific WACC used to discount the cash flows 
thus determined is based on a risk-free interest rate of 2.75% 
(2022: 2.00%) and a market risk premium of 6.50% (2022: 
7.00%)."
"The estimates of daily yield curves published by the 
German central bank, the Bundesbank, are taken as a basis 
for determining the risk-free interest rate."
"The beta factor 
used and the capital structure are derived from a peer group."
"When unlevering, IFRS 16 (Leases) was reflected by making a 
retrospective adjustment to the leverage of the peer group 
companies."
"Furthermore, region-specific tax rates and coun-
try risk premiums (according to Damodaran) are used."
"Sensitivity analyses for cash flow forecasts, growth 
rates and the WACC taken as a basis are outlined in the sec-
tion Assumptions and estimates."

23.) Financial liabilities
In February 2023, Brenntag agreed a new, EUR 1.5 billion syn-
dicated loan that replaces the previous syndicated loan."
"The 
new syndicated loan has a term running until February 2028, 
which at the beginning of 2024 was extended until February 
2029."
"It is based on variable interest rates with margins 
depending on the credit rating, and is divided into two revolv-
ing credit facilities – one credit facility in the amount of EUR 1 
billion and a USD credit facility in the amount of USD 525.0 
million (euro equivalent as at Dec."
"31, 2023: EUR 475.1 million)."
"Moreover, the margin is also linked to the achievement of cer-
tain Brenntag Group sustainability targets."
"While some subsidiaries are direct borrowers under the loan, 
others obtain their financing from intra-Group loans."
"The syn-
dicated loan is guaranteed by Brenntag SE."

rate euro-denominated tranches, and annually for the fixed-
rate euro-denominated tranches."

Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 81.1 million)."
"The provision amounts are determined on the basis 
of individual cost estimates for each case."
"Allowance is made 
not only for the nature and severity of pollution but also for 
the conditions at the respective sites and the sovereign terri-
tories in which these sites are located."
Environmental provisions are stated at their present values.
"They are discounted at maturity-dependent, risk-free interest 
rates for the respective functional currencies."
"Increases in the 
future expenditure due to inflation are allowed for."
"The dis-
count rates for environmental provisions range from 1.3% to 
11.1%, depending on the currency (Dec."
"31, 2022: from 1.6% 
to 13.4%)."
"As at December 31, 2023, environmental provisions total 
EUR  107.5 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 108.9 million)."
"They 
mainly relate to the rehabilitation of soil and ground water for 
current and former, owned and leased sites but also cover 
costs for further and accompanying measures such as nec-
essary environmental inspections and observations."
"The pro-
visions include EUR 19.4 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 20.7 mil-
lion) for contingencies for which a cash outflow is not likely 
but nevertheless possible."
"In line with the requirements of 
IFRS 3, these contingencies have entered the balance sheet 
largely through the purchase price allocation in connection 
with the acquisition of the Brenntag Group by funds advised 
by BC Partners Limited, Bain Capital, Ltd."
"and subsidiaries of 
Goldman Sachs International at the end of the third quarter 
of 2006."

"This 
applies both to the amount and the timing of future expendi-
ture."
"In some cases, special agreements have been reached which 
ensure that the cost of any future environmental work neces-
sary will be borne by third parties."
"If receipt of payment from 
the third party is virtually certain provided Brenntag meets its 
obligations, these claims to reimbursement are recognized."
"They are generally measured in the same way as the corre-
sponding provisions."
"The amount recognized does not exceed 
the amount of the provision."
"The claims to reimbursement 
recognized at December 31, 2023 amount to EUR 6.7 million 
(Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 4.4 million)."
"Provisions for virtual share-
based remuneration programs are also presented under this 
item."
"These programs are long-term bonus systems for mem-
bers of the Board of Management of Brenntag SE, on the one 
hand, and for executives and senior managers of the Brenntag 
Group, on the other."
"For the period from 2013 to 2020, an LTI Plan was offered to 
a group of managers which is to be redefined every year by 
the Board of Management of Brenntag SE."
"The term of the 
program is divided into a one-year performance period and 
a general vesting period of three years."
"The total bonus pool 
amount available for one annual tranche of the LTI Plan basi-
cally depends on the change in operating EBITDA in the per-
formance period; further amounts can be assigned to the 
bonus pool at the discretion of the Board of Management."
"Restrictions exist to the extent that the bonus pool may not 
exceed 0.675% of the actual operating EBITDA."
"On the basis 
of this bonus pool, the number of virtual shares is determined 
for each plan participant pro rata based on the average price 
of the Brenntag shares and the annual salary of the partici-
pant in relation to the total annual salaries of all participants."
"After expiry of the vesting period, the plan participants 
receive remuneration resulting from the virtual shares allo-
cated multiplied by the average Brenntag share price, 
adjusted for dividends, capital transactions and stock splits."
"Payment per virtual share must not exceed 250% of the aver-
age share price, on the basis of which the number of virtual 
shares was determined."
"In 2021, a new LTI Plan was set up for selected members of 
the Brenntag Group’s Global Leadership Team (GLT)."
"This spe-
cial long-term incentive program is aimed at retaining GLT 
members and motivating them to ensure and share in the 
long-term success of “Project Brenntag” and therefore the 
Brenntag Group."
"These selected GLT members are condition-
ally entitled to bonus payments based on two components."
"The first component is dependent on the respective LTI target 
bonus and the achievement of a defined EBITDA target for 
financial year 2023."
50% of this is paid out in cash.
"The other 
50% flows into the second component in the form of virtual 
shares in Brenntag SE."
"After a holding period of one year and 
depending on Brenntag SE’s average share price perfor-
mance in financial year 2024, a further cash payment will be 
made."
"Both components are recognized uniformly as a pro-
vision for share-based remuneration, even though the first 
component is to be regarded as other long-term employee 
benefits (IAS 19)."
"Personnel expenses for the share-based remuneration pro-
grams on the basis of virtual shares amount to EUR 19.5 mil-
lion in total (2022: EUR 15.3 million)."
"Provisions for share-based remuneration total EUR 52.6 mil-
lion as at December 31, 2023 (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 37.9 million) 
and disaggregate into the following maturities:
in EUR m
Dec."
"As at December 31, 2023, there were no 
longer any provisions for these proceedings (for details, please 
see the section “Legal proceedings and disputes”)."
"In addition, other provisions primarily include provisions for 
compensation payable and for legal proceedings and dis-
putes in the amount of EUR 139.1 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: 
EUR 50.5 million)."
"Provisions for current and likely litigation are established in 
those cases where reasonable estimates are possible."
"These 
provisions contain all estimated legal costs as well as the 
possible settlement costs."
"The amounts are based on infor-
mation and cost estimates provided by lawyers (for details, 
please see the section “Legal proceedings and disputes”)."
"26.) 
Provisions for pensions and  
other post-employment benefits
There are both defined contribution and defined benefit pen-
sion plans for the employees of the Brenntag Group."
"The pen-
sion obligations vary depending on the legal, tax and eco-
nomic circumstances in the respective country and the 
employee’s years of service with the company and pay grade."
"Defined contribution plans 
A large number of the employees of the Brenntag Group will 
receive benefits from the statutory social insurance fund, into 
which the contributions are paid as part of their salary."
"In 
addition, various other pension fund commitments exist at the 
companies of the Brenntag Group."
"As the company has no 
further obligations after payment of the retirement pension 
contributions to the state social insurance fund and private 
insurance companies, these plans are treated as defined con-
tribution plans."
"Current pension contribution payments are 
recognized as expense for the relevant period."
"In financial year 
2023, pension expenses in the Brenntag Group for employer 
contributions to the statutory pension insurance fund and for 
non-statutory defined contribution plans amounted to a total 
of EUR 115.7 million (2022: EUR 108.6 million)."
"In the USA, subsidiaries of the Brenntag Group pay into 
defined benefit plans maintained by more than one employer 
(termed multi-employer plans)."
"These multi-employer defined 
benefit plans are accounted for in the consolidated financial 
statements as defined contribution plans because the infor-
mation required to use defined benefit accounting is not 
available in a timely manner and in sufficient detail."
"Further-
more, there is no consistent and reliable basis for allocating 
the obligation, plan assets and cost to individual participat-
ing employers, which is necessary for accounting for defined 
benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19."
"If other participating employers do not meet their payment 
obligations, Brenntag may be liable for the obligations of 
those employers."
"Any potential withdrawal from the plans by 
an entity may lead to that entity having to offset the potential 
shortfall relating to its share of the plan."
"The funding level of 
the individual plans ranged from about 14% to 99% as at 
December 31, 2023 (about 15% to 102% as at December 31, 
2022)."
"Brenntag Group subsidiaries account for approxi-
mately 0.06% to 1.42% of the total contributions (2022: 
approximately 0.06% to 1.26%), depending on the plan."
"With-
drawal from all plans at the present time would lead to an 
estimated one-time expense of approximately EUR 49 million 
or approximately USD 53 million (2022: approximately EUR 61 
million or approximately USD 64 million)."
"It is not intended to 
withdraw from any of these plans at this time."
"In financial year 2023, contributions of EUR 2.8 million or 
USD 3.0 million (2022: EUR 2.9 million or USD 3.0 million) were 
paid."
"The contributions are included in the above-mentioned 
contributions for non-statutory defined contribution plans."
"In 
2024, the contributions are expected to amount to approxi-
mately EUR 2.9 million."
"Defined benefit plans
The defined benefit plans of the Brenntag Group are funded 
by provisions and largely covered by assets."
"The principal 
obligations (over 90% of the total volume) are in Switzerland, 
Germany, Canada and the Netherlands."
"The remaining obli-
gations are spread over another eleven countries in the EMEA, 
Latin America and Asia Pacific segments."

Switzerland
In Switzerland, every employer is obliged by national law to set 
up a company retirement pension scheme."
"The Swiss group company maintains a funded pension plan 
for its employees."
"The assets of this plan are held in two 
autonomous foundations."
"The foundation board is made up 
of equal numbers of employer and employee representatives."
"It is responsible for setting the investment strategy, for 
changes in the plan rules and in particular also for determin-
ing the financing of the pension benefits."
"The pension benefits are based on the retirement assets 
accrued."
"The annual retirement credits and interest are cred-
ited to these retirement assets."
"On retirement, the insured per-
son is obliged to take 30% of the accrued retirement assets in 
the form of a lump-sum payment and may choose whether to 
take the remaining 70% of the accrued retirement assets in 
the form of a life-long pension or another lump-sum payment."
"In addition to the retirement benefits, the pension benefits 
also include disability and surviving dependents’ pensions."
"The 
insured person may also dispose of parts of their accrued 
retirement assets prematurely if this serves to improve their 
pension situation (for owner-occupied residential property)."
"If 
there is a change of employer, the retirement assets are trans-
ferred to the pension scheme of the new employer."
"The employee and employer contributions are set by the 
foundation board."
"According to the BVG, the employer pays 
at least 50% of the necessary contributions."
"In the case of 
Brenntag Schweizerhall AG, the employer pays some 70% of 
the contributions in accordance with the rules of the plan."
"As the contributions to the pension plan that the employees 
in Switzerland pay are based on formal rules, the risk distri-
bution between employee and employer is taken into account 
when measuring the obligation."
"In the case of Brenntag 
Schweizerhall AG, this leads to an only minor reduction in the 
present value of the benefit obligation."
"Germany
The German group companies have retirement pension plans 
which are based on contractual provisions or works agree-
ments."
"The Employee Pension Plan 2000/2012 (Mitarbeiter Vorsorge-
plan 2000/2012) is a pension plan funded by the employer."
"The employer awards an annual pension contribution of 
between EUR 250 and EUR 500 depending on length of ser-
vice, which is converted into pension modules."
"The amount 
of the benefits depends on the pension modules accrued 
before retirement."
"The Pension Scheme 2000/2012 for Executives (Leistungsord-
nung 2000/2012 für Führungskräfte) of the German Brenntag 
companies is a pension plan for executives funded by the 
employer in the form of individual commitments."
"The annual 
pension contribution depends on the pensionable remunera-
tion (basis of assessment)."
"The annual basis of assessment is 
the sum total of the fixed remuneration, Christmas and vaca-
tion allowances and bonuses but no more than three times 
the contribution assessment limit for the statutory pension 
system."
"The pension contribution is a maximum of 4% of the 
basis of assessment up to the contribution assessment limit 
plus a maximum of 10% for parts exceeding the contribution 
assessment limit."
"The annual pension contributions are con-
verted into pension modules."
"The amount of the benefits 
depends on the pension modules accrued before retirement."
"The annual pen-
sion contribution for participating employees is between at 
least EUR 250 and a maximum of 4% of the contribution 
assessment limit for the statutory pension system (Section 1a 
BetrAVG)."
"The company also pays an additional pension 
allowance of 15% to the converted amount provided that the 
pension contribution comes from remuneration subject to 
statutory pension insurance contributions."
"Furthermore, 
through the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP), employees 
have the option to convert pay components into an entitle-
ment to pension benefits."
"The converted employee contribu-
tions are protected by pension liability insurance pledged to 
the employee who is entitled to the pension."
"With both 
employee-funded plans, the employees must decide every 
year on the pension contribution they wish to make."
"The Pension Scheme 2000/2012 for Executives (Leistungsord-
nung 2000/2012 für Führungskräfte) is a pure retirement pen-
sion plan with a monthly life-long pension."
"With the other pen-
sion plans, the pension benefit is paid out as a lump sum or 
as an annual capital instalment spread over a maximum of 
five years or as a life-long pension."
"Furthermore, in Germany, Brenntag still has isolated retire-
ment and disability pension commitments under pension 
plans set up in the past."
"These commitments depend on the 
years of service and the pay grades of the respective employ-
ees."
"They are mainly commitments involving monthly pension 
payments."
"Canada
In Canada, Brenntag maintains an employer-funded pension 
plan with a life-long monthly pension for employees who 
joined the company before December 31, 2011."
"The basis of 
assessment for calculating the annual pension is 1% of the 
average salary of the three highest annual salaries of the 
beneficiary multiplied by the number of years of service."
"In 
addition to the retirement benefits, the pension benefits 
include disability and surviving dependents’ pensions."
"The plan participants in the employer-funded pension plan 
who are under 50 or who have less than 15 years of service or 
less than 55 points (sum of age and years of service) must pay 
into a defined contribution plan newly set up in 2014 in order 
to continue to build up their retirement pension."
"Employer and 
employee pay equal portions of the contributions."
"The enti-
tlements accrued up to the date of transition remain in place."
"For employees in Canada who joined the company up to and 
including May 31, 2013, there is an employer-funded supple-
mentary medical cost plan in retirement as well as a life 
insurance payout of CAD 5,000 on retirement."
"As this plan has 
the characteristics of a pension, it is classified under pensions 
and other post-employment benefits."
"Netherlands
Company pension systems play a prominent role in the Neth-
erlands as the pay-as-you-go statutory pension scheme only 
provides a basic pension."
"The companies maintain a funded retirement plan for their 
employees."
"When there is a change of employer, the credit 
balance from the plan assets can be transferred to the pen-
sion scheme of the new employer or remains in the previous 
company’s pension scheme."
"About 20% of the retirement 
pension plan is funded by the employee and about 80% by 
the employer."
"Depending on the employer’s commitment, the 
basis of assessment for calculating the annual pension is the 
last salary before the employee reaches retirement age or 
the average salary over the employee’s active career before 
reaching retirement age."
"The amount calculated from the 
basis of assessment is multiplied by the years of service."
"The 
retirement pension plan is a pure pension plan with a life-
long monthly pension."
"In addition to the retirement benefits, 
the pension benefits include disability and surviving depen-
dents’ pensions."
"Risks arising from defined benefit pension plans
Brenntag is exposed to risks arising from the plans."
"There is investment risk in Switzerland primar-
ily with regard to the proportion of the plan assets invested in 
shares."
"There is no investment risk in Germany or the Nether-
lands as the plan assets consist solely of insurance policies."
"In 
Canada, the plan assets consisting of external fund shares are 
in principle exposed to investment risk."
"In order to minimize 
this risk, the plan assets in Canada are subject by law to an 
audit every three years to establish whether the assets 
invested are sufficient to fund the pension obligations."

The plan assets are solely for fulfilling the defined benefit 
obligations and constitute protection for pension entitle-
ments, which is a legal requirement in some countries and is 
voluntary in other countries."
"The structure of the plan assets is reviewed at regular inter-
vals."
"All assets, which, in Brenntag’s case, mainly consist of 
insurance policies, are tailored long-term to the amount and 
maturity of the pension commitments, taking investment risks 
and statutory regulations governing the investment of retire-
ment assets into account."
"Owing to the composition of the plan assets, investment risk at 
Brenntag is limited to securities traded in active markets 
(shares and fixed-interest securities)."
"This part (2023: 34.6% of 
plan assets; 2022: 34.6% of plan assets) is subject to market 
fluctuations."
All other assets are not traded in an active market.
"The annual payments made into the plan assets, which, 
according to the plan rules, consist almost exclusively of 
obligatory payments, amount to EUR  7.0  million (2022: 
EUR 6.9 million)."
"From a present perspective, the cash outflow 
resulting from contributions made by the company will 
remain at a level of EUR 6 million to EUR 7 million over the 
long term."
"Payments into plan assets for financial year 2024 
are expected to total EUR 6.7 million."
"payments expected to be made by the company directly in 
2024 total EUR 6.7 million."
"That means, for example, that the life expectancy of 
a 63-year-old employee as at December 31, 2023 increases 
by about one year."
"In order to determine the sensitivity of lon-
gevity, the mortality rates for the beneficiaries were reduced 
by 10%."
"If the mortality rates decreased by 10%, the present 
value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by 
EUR 9.5 million (2022: EUR 8.2 million)."

ment hedge accounting are recognized within equity in the 
net investment hedge reserve."
"Of the liabilities relating to the 
acquisition of non-controlling interests, EUR 57.4 million (Dec."

"The effects of the change in liabilities relating to the acquisi-
tion of non-controlling interests recognized in profit or loss are

"In 2023, the Group generated ROCE of 18.9% (2022: 22.3%)."
"The average carrying amounts in the denominator are defined 
for a particular year as the arithmetic average of the amounts at each of the 
following five dates: the beginning of the year, the end of each of the first, 
second and third quarters, and the end of the year."
"Brenntag monitors the appropriateness of borrowings inter 
alia through the ratio of net financial liabilities to operating 
EBITDA (leverage)."
"Brenntag generally considers leverage of 
approximately 2x to be appropriate."
"At 1.4x as at December 31, 
2023, the ratio was once again well below that level."
"The slight 
increase compared with the prior-year ratio (1.1x) is due 
mainly to the EUR 750.0 million share buyback program."
"Brenntag will monitor changes in leverage going forward and 
examine how it can create an optimum capital structure."
"In 
addition to current business performance and the trend in 
chemicals prices, our analysis also takes into account rela-
tively large cash payments, such as those for acquisitions."
"The first tranche of the share buy-
back program, in the amount of EUR 500 million, was com-
pleted in October 2023, the share capital was reduced by a 
nominal amount of around EUR 7 million by withdrawing the 
shares and the excess amount was eliminated against addi-
tional paid-in capital."
"The company’s share capital now 
amounts to around EUR 147.5 million."
"In the course of the sec-
ond tranche between January 2, 2024 and March 13, 2024 at 
the latest, it is intended to acquire further Brenntag SE shares 
on the stock market up to a total purchase price of EUR 250 
million."
"As set out in Article 4, para."
"(b) of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052, the buyback program 
is being lead-managed by a credit institution engaged by 
Brenntag SE which makes its trading decisions concerning 
the timing of the purchases of the shares independently of 
Brenntag."
"For this, in December 2023, Brenntag recognized a 
liability of EUR 250.0 million directly in equity for the obligation 
to acquire treasury shares."
"Subscribed capital
As at December 31, 2023, the subscribed capital of 
Brenntag SE totaled EUR  147,453,837 (Dec."

portionate share in the net income of Brenntag SE."

that do not entitle Brenntag SE to any membership rights."
Brenntag SE does not currently have any treasury shares.

The additional paid-in capital amounts to EUR 1,002.2 million 
(Dec."

"Retained earnings
Retained earnings include cumulative profit after tax and the 
remeasurement component of the defined benefit pension 
plans including deferred taxes."
"Transactions with owners are 
also recognized here."
"The latter are effects of share pur-
chases and sales which have no influence on existing control 
and are recognized in retained earnings."
"As proposed by the Board of Management and the Supervi-
sory Board, the Annual General Meeting of Brenntag SE on 
June 15, 2023 passed a resolution to pay a dividend of 
EUR 304,700,000.00 (2022: EUR 224,025,000.00)."
"Based on 
152.4 million shares, that is a dividend of EUR 2.00 (2022: 
EUR 1.45) per no-par value share entitled to a dividend."
"Other components of equity / Non-controlling interests
Exchange rate differences include the inflation effect on 
equity of EUR 18.3 million in financial year 2023 (2022: 
EUR 17.8 million) arising on the application of IAS 29 (hyper-
inflation) in Turkey."
"Other components of equity comprise the cumulative 
gain / loss from exchange rate differences, the net investment 
hedge reserve and the cash flow hedge reserve."
"The cumulative gain / loss from exchange rate differences 
contains the differences from the translation of the financial 
statements of foreign companies into the Group currency 
(euro), which are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"The foreign exchange losses of EUR 98.5 million recognized 
here in financial year 2023 (2022: foreign exchange gains of 
EUR 91.0 million) resulted primarily from the depreciation of 
the US dollar against the euro."
"Exchange rate differences from liabilities included in net 
investment hedge accounting are recognized within equity in 
the net investment hedge reserve."
"The cash flow hedge reserve contains the effective portion of 
the cumulative fair value changes in derivative financial 
instruments included in cash flow hedge accounting."

total of 10% of the share capital."
"The shares acquired on the 
basis of this authorization, together with other shares in the 
company which Brenntag SE has already acquired and still 
holds, may at no time account for more than 10% of the 
respective registered share capital."
"The authorization may be 
exercised in whole or in part, once or several times."
"It took 
effect at the close of the Annual General Meeting on June 9, 
2022 and shall be valid until June 8, 2027."

without any further resolution by the Annual General Meeting."
"The withdrawal may be limited to a portion of the shares 
acquired."
"The authorization to withdraw shares may be exer-
cised more than once."
"The withdrawal of shares generally 
leads to a reduction in registered share capital."
"In derogation 
of this, the Board of Management may determine that the 
registered share capital shall remain unchanged and that 
instead the withdrawal shall increase the proportion of the 
registered share capital represented by the remaining shares 
in accordance with Section 8, para."

Corporation Act."
"In this case, the Board of Management is 
authorized to adjust the indication of the corresponding num-

certain circumstances, also be used subject to exclusion of 
the shareholders’ subscription rights existing in principle and 
in particular by way of simplified exclusion of subscription 
rights as specified above."
"On March 7, 2023, the Board of Management of Brenntag SE 
decided on a share buyback program of up to EUR 750 million 
with the approval of the Supervisory Board and exercising the 
authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting held on 
June 9, 2022."
"In the course of an initial tranche in the period 
to October 20, 2023, Brenntag SE acquired 7,046,163 no-par 
value shares, each with a notional value of EUR 1.00

ther Brenntag SE shares on the stock market up to a total

the time the authorization becomes effective."
"If the share 
capital is lower at the time this authorization is exercised, that 
lower amount will apply."

ing authorization."
The authorization has not so far been exercised.
"EUR 496.2 million were used to acquire treasury shares and a 
further EUR 304.7 million for the dividend payment to 
Brenntag shareholders."

adjustment to net cash provided by operating activities as a 
separate line item."
"Other non-cash effects were adjusted in 
the respective line items in the cash flow statement insofar 
as they can be allocated."

"31.) Legal proceedings and disputes
Brenntag SE and individual subsidiaries have been named as 
defendants in various legal actions and proceedings arising 
in connection with their activities as a global group."
"Some-
times, Brenntag is also the subject of investigations by the 
authorities."
"Brenntag cooperates with the relevant authorities 
and, where appropriate, conducts internal investigations 
regarding alleged wrongdoings with the assistance of 
in-house and external counsel."
"The decision issued by the French Competition Authority in 
2013 in relation to the allocation of customers and coordina-
tion of prices was set aside by a court of appeal due to proce-
dural errors at Brenntag’s request in February 2017."
"In Decem-
ber 2020, the court imposed a fine of EUR 47 million."
"Brenntag 
lodged an appeal against the decision, whereupon the imposed 
fine was reimbursed in November 2023 and the proceedings 
referred back by the Cour de cassation (Court of cassation) for 
a further decision."
"With further steps expected to be taken by 
the French authorities responsible, a provision was recognized 
in the amount of the EUR 47 million reimbursement."
"Regarding 
the investigation also ongoing at the French Competition 
Authority concerning whether BRENNTAG SA has illegally made 
use of its market position, a decision by the Authority is still 
pending."
"Based on current knowledge, Brenntag assumes that 
claims for civil liability arising from the above-mentioned pro-
ceedings are not sufficiently substantiated."
"The 
company contests actions and proceedings where it consid-
ers it appropriate."
"Provisions are established for ongoing legal 
disputes on the basis of the estimated risk and, if necessary, 
with the help of external consultants."
"It is very difficult to pre-
dict the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in 
which claimants seek indeterminate compensation."
"Any 
adverse decisions rendered in such cases may have material 
effects on Brenntag’s net assets, financial position and results 
of operations for a reporting period."
"However, Brenntag cur-
rently does not expect its net assets, financial position and 
results of operations to be materially affected."
"In connection with the sale of talc and similar products, 
actions have been brought against our North American sub-
sidiaries, against which the Brenntag Group is actively 
defending itself."
"In addition, Brenntag has taken measures to 
mitigate the risk and is asserting claims for compensation 
from third parties."
"Nevertheless, the possibility that these 
legal disputes will result in significant adverse effects on the 
results of operations cannot be ruled out."
"As a global company, Brenntag has to comply with the 
country-specific tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction."
"Tax exposures could result in particular from current and 
future tax audits of our German and foreign subsidiaries."
"These exposures are generally reflected in the balance sheet 
by recognizing provisions."
"The German Group companies BRENNTAG GmbH and BCD 
Chemie GmbH were the subject of routine reviews of the tax 
on alcohol and energy conducted by the German customs 
authorities for the years 2014 to 2018."
"As a result, in financial 
years 2021 and 2023, tax decision notices relating to alcohol 
tax were received for the years 2014 to 2017 in the amount of 
EUR 143.6 million and the appropriate taxes were paid."
"Legal 
redress was sought against these decisions."
"For the 
above-mentioned review period, the reviews have been com-
pleted, decision notices have been received and the tax 
assessment amounts have been paid."
The findings of the review relate only to formal errors.
"At no 
time were there doubts concerning the tax-free use of alco-
holic products by our customers."
"Brenntag and its legal advis-
ers believe that the legal redress being sought and the argu-
ments presented in the proceedings can be successful."
"Under further tax audit notices issued in 2022 and 2023, 
BRENNTAG GmbH was also the subject of a review for 2021 
and 2022."
"The assessments for those years so far amount to 
EUR 30.6k in total."
"With the support of external experts on excise duties, 
Brenntag is examining the extent to which comparable excise 
duty risks also exist in other European countries."
"Ultimately, 
this investigation has so far identified one case in Sweden, 
which is currently being dealt with in detail with a local, exter-
nal legal adviser."
"Based on the information available, a pro-
vision of EUR 12.5 million was recognized for this."

"The majority of the trade payables and other liabilities mea-
sured at amortized cost have remaining terms of less than 
one year."
"Their carrying amounts at the reporting date there-
fore approximate their fair values."
"The fair values of the bonds 
measured at amortized cost under financial liabilities were 
determined using quoted or market prices in an active market 
(Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"The fair values of the other 
financial liabilities measured at amortized cost were deter-
mined using the discounted cash flow method on the basis of 
inputs observable on the market (Level 2 of the fair value hier-
archy)."
"The fair values of the synthetic liabilities relating to the 
acquisition of non-controlling interests carried at amortized 
cost were determined on the basis of recognized company 
valuation models."
"The company valuation models are based 
on cash flow plans (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"The fair 
values of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange 
swaps are determined by comparing forward rates and dis-
counted to present value (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"The fair value of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is 
determined in two steps."
"First, the expected future cash flows 
are discounted using maturity-matched market interest rates 
according to the currency."
"In the second step, the cash flows 
discounted in foreign currency (US dollar) are then translated 
into the reporting currency (EUR) at market exchange rates 
(Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy)."
"The fair value of a call option to acquire non-controlling inter-
ests is calculated from the intrinsic value and the time value 
of the option."
"The intrinsic value of the call option is calcu-
lated as the difference between the enterprise value and the 
strike price."
"The time value reflects the optionality of move-
ments in the future strike price and the future enterprise value 
of the non-controlling interests."
"This is illustrated by way of a 
Monte Carlo simulation and the fair value of the option then 
determined (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy)."

"Currency risk
Currency risks arise particularly when monetary items or con-
tracted future transactions are in a currency other than the 
functional currency of a company."
"Overall, this results in a sur-
plus of (partly intra-Group) monetary assets over liabilities of 
EUR 268.4 million as at December 31, 2023 (Dec."
"31, 2022: 
EUR 296.4 million)."
"Foreign exchange forwards, foreign 
exchange swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps are 
used as hedging instruments."
"The notional amount of the 
hedges used was EUR – 132.0 million as at December 31, 2023 
(Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR – 231.4 million)."
"The foreign exchange for-
wards and foreign exchange swaps used have maturities of 
less than one year and are not included in hedge accounting."
"The hedged items are the share of the net assets of Saifu 
and Zhongbai Xingye attributable to Brenntag."
"Exchange 
rate-related changes in the liabilities are recognized within 
equity in the net investment hedge reserve."
"An economic rela-
tionship exists in each case, as the hedging instrument and 
the hedged item have values that move in the opposite direc-
tion because of a change in the hedged currency risk."
"Any 
increase (decrease) in the Chinese yuan renminbi (CNY) 
against the euro leads to an increase (decrease) in the net 
assets and an increase (decrease) in the CNY-denominated 
liabilities."
"The effectiveness of the hedging relationships was 
determined at inception of the hedging relationships and is 
regularly determined on a retrospective basis to ensure that 
there is an economic relationship between the hedged item 
and the hedging instrument."
"There was no hedge ineffective-
ness as at December 31, 2023."
"If the euro had been worth 10% 
more or less against the Chinese yuan renminbi (CNY) as at 
December 31, 2023, the net investment hedge reserve would 
have increased by EUR 9.4 million (Dec."

 5.99 Change in cash flow hedge reserve 
One significant component in the fair value measurement of 
the cross-currency interest rate swaps is the exchange rate 
of the underlying currencies (EUR/USD)."
"As the exchange rate 
component – moving in the opposite direction to the hedged 
item – is designated as part of the hedging relationship, 
ceteris paribus, an assumed change in the exchange rate 
leads only to a change in the cash flow hedge reserve."
"If the 
euro had been worth 10% more or less against the US dollar 
as at December 31, 2023, the cash flow hedge reserve would 
have decreased by EUR 3.3 million or increased by EUR 4.1 
million (December 31, 2022: decreased by EUR 4.5 million or 
increased by EUR 5.5 million)."
"Interest rate risk
Interest rate risks can occur due to changes in market interest 
rates."
"The risks result from changes in the fair values of fixed-
rate financial instruments or from changes in the cash flows 
of variable-rate financial instruments."
"Due to the two fixed-rate bonds and the partly fixed-rate 
promissory notes, over 60% of the Brenntag Group’s financial 
liabilities were hedged against the risk of interest rate 
increases as at December 31, 2023."
"Interest rate-related fair value changes in the cross-currency 
interest rate swaps have no impact on net income for the 
financial year due to the agreed swap rates and hedge 
accounting."
"Conversely, the current difference between the 
euro market interest rate and the US dollar market interest 
rate has a significant impact on the amount of the cash flow 
hedge reserve; as at December 31, 2023, the USD market 
interest rate was above the euro market interest rate."
"If the 
euro market interest rate as at December 31, 2023 had been 
25 basis points higher or lower with the US dollar market inter-
est rate remaining unchanged, the cash flow hedge reserve 
In October 2021, Brenntag Finance B.V., Amsterdam, Nether-
lands, issued a EUR 500 million bond (Bond 2029)."
"swapped most of the proceeds from the Bond 
2029 for US dollars by way of cross-currency interest rate 
swaps and passed them on to Brenntag North America, Inc., 
Reading, USA, as an intra-Group loan."
"The intra-Group loan 
and the cross-currency interest rate swaps were included in 
cash flow hedge accounting so as to limit currency and inter-
est rate risk in the consolidated financial statements."
"Critical terms matching is used to assess the effectiveness of 
the hedging relationship."
"The economic relationship between 
hedged items and hedging instruments results from closely 
aligned terms."
"The cross-currency basis is not part of the 
hedging relationship and is recognized in a separate compo-
nent of equity as a reserve for costs of hedging."
"The ineffec-
tive portions of the hedging relationship are determined using 
the hypothetical derivative method."
"They result mainly from 
counterparty risk and, if necessary, are recognized in profit or 
loss within net interest expense."
"In financial year 2023, this did 
not give rise to any effects in profit or loss (2022: interest 
income of EUR 0.7 million)."
"Credit risk
Credit risk on non-derivative financial instruments is the risk 
that the contracting parties concerned will fail to make con-
tractually agreed payments."
"The maximum credit risk on 
non-derivative financial instruments is their carrying amount."
"The expected credit risk from individual receivables is allowed 
for by recognizing write-downs of the assets (see also Note 13.)."
"With the derivative financial instruments used, the maximum 
credit risk is the total of all positive fair values of these instru-
ments as, in the event of non-performance by the contracting 
parties, losses on assets would be restricted to this amount."
"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Brenntag Group may in future 
not be able to meet its contractual payment obligations."
"Due 
to the fact that the Brenntag Group’s business is not subject 
to any pronounced seasonal fluctuations, there is relatively 
little fluctuation in liquidity during the financial year."
"To ensure that the Brenntag Group can pay at all times, it not 
only has appropriate liquidity reserves in the form of cash and 
cash equivalents but also credit lines under the syndicated 
loan which can be utilized as needed."
"In order to identify the liquidity risks, the Group has a 
multi-annual liquidity plan which is regularly reviewed and 
adjusted if necessary."
"Of the other liabilities to banks, EUR 44.9 million (Dec."
"31, 
2022: EUR 14.1 million) are secured by non-current assets 
totaling EUR 45.9 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 18.2 million)."
"In a 
few cases in the APAC region, other liabilities to banks pre-
sented within current financial liabilities include liabilities in 
connection with reverse factoring arrangements where liabil-
ities to suppliers are initially settled by banks."
"The Brenntag 
company concerned then settles the invoice from the respec-
tive bank with longer payment terms."
"As at December 31, 
2023, the resulting financial liabilities amounted to around 
EUR 33.2 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 25.4 million)."

"Remuneration of the Board of Management
The total remuneration of the Board of Management consists 
of three components: a fixed annual base salary, short-term, 
capped variable cash remuneration (annual bonus) and long-
term, capped variable remuneration (long-term incentive 
bonus)."
"In addition to the above-mentioned remuneration 
components, the members of the Board of Management 
receive pension benefits, contractually agreed benefits in 
kind and other benefits."
"The annual base salary is payable in twelve equal monthly 
instalments."
"If the service agreement begins or ends during a 
financial year, the Annual Base Salary for that financial year 
is payable on a pro rata temporis basis."
"The annual bonus depends on Brenntag’s business success 
in the past financial year."
"It is calculated based on achieve-
ment of the targets set for specific key performance indica-
tors for the financial year."
"Under the Remuneration System 
2023, the key performance indicators are organic EBITA (60%), 
working capital turnover (20%) and earnings per share (20%)."
"In the case of the Remuneration System 2020, the key perfor-
mance indicators are organic EBITDA growth (60%), the 
improvement in working capital turnover (20%) and earnings 
per share growth (20%)."
"An individual performance multiplier 
is also used to assess the performance of the Board of Man-
agement members."
"The individual performance multiplier is 
set by the Supervisory Board after each financial year within 
a range from 0.8 to 1.2 for the Remuneration System 2023 and 
within a range from 0.7 to 1.3 for the Remuneration System 
2020."
"In doing so, the Supervisory Board takes into account 
the individual financial and non-financial performance."
"The 
individual performance aspects may be based on three 
dimensions: growth, people and risk management."
"They 
may include not only strategic and operational, but also 
non-financial aspects."
"The final payout amount is capped 
at a maximum of 200% of the individual and contractually 
agreed target amount (Cap)."
"The Board of Management members also receive long-term 
variable remuneration."
"Different remuneration systems apply, 
depending on the year of award and individual contractual 
arrangements."
"As of 2023, a new remuneration system applies to serving 
Board of Management members Dr. Christian Kohlpaintner 
(CEO), Dr. Kristin Neumann, Michael Friede and Ewout van 
Jarwaarde."
"Among other components, this includes long-
term variable remuneration in the form of virtual shares (Per-
formance Share Units)."
"The number of virtual shares may 
increase or decrease, depending on Brenntag’s long-term 
performance measured over a four-year performance period."
The performance share plan is structured as follows.
"The number of virtual shares initially awarded is calculated 
by dividing the individual and contractually agreed target 
amount by the arithmetic mean of the Brenntag share closing 
prices in the Xetra trading system during the last three 
months before the start of the performance period."
"If the ser-
vice agreement begins or ends during a financial year, the 
target amount for that financial year is calculated on a pro 
rata temporis basis."
"The two 
financial performance criteria are Brenntag’s total share-
holder return (TSR) compared with a global peer group 
(weighting: 70%) and return on capital employed (ROCE) 
(weighting: 30%)."
"The sum total of the weighted share awards 
for each performance criterion is multiplied by the achieve-
ment figure of specific ESG targets using an ESG multiplier 
that may be between 0.8 and 1.2."
"The resulting total share 
award is then multiplied by the number of virtual shares ini-
tially awarded, giving the number of virtual shares finally 
awarded to the Board of Management member at the end of 
the four-year performance period."
"The number of virtual 
shares finally awarded is capped at 200%."
"The payout 
amount is capped at a maximum of 250% of the individual 
and contractually agreed target amount (Cap)."
"The Remuneration System 2020 still applies to Henri Nejade 
and Steven Terwindt, who stepped down as Board of Manage-
ment members in 2023."
"It is also applied to the tranches that 
were awarded to the serving Board of Management members 
in previous years and for which the performance period has 
not yet ended."
"The amount of the payout for long-term variable remunera-
tion under the Remuneration System 2020 depends on the 
relative performance of the Brenntag share compared with 
two peer groups and the absolute change in the Brenntag 
share price over a four-year performance period."
"The virtual 
shares are awarded in annual tranches."
"Payout is made fol-
lowing completion of the performance period."
"The annual virtual shares are awarded on January 1 of each 
financial year."
"The number of shares to be awarded initially is 
calculated by dividing the individual and contractually 
agreed grant amount by the arithmetic mean of the Brenntag 
share closing prices in the Xetra trading system during the 
last three months before the start of the performance period."
"If the service agreement begins or ends during a financial 
year, the grant amount for that financial year shall be calcu-
lated on a pro rata temporis basis."
"Target achievement of each performance criterion is calcu-
lated by subtracting the performance of the MDAX/DAX or the 
average TSR of the selected peer group from the TSR of the 
Brenntag share."
"If the performance of the MDAX/DAX or the 
average TSR of the selected peer group equals the TSR of the 
Brenntag share, target achievement is 100%."
"If the TSR of the 
Brenntag share outperforms the MDAX/DAX or the average 
TSR of the selected peer group by 25% or more percentage 
points, target achievement is 150%."
"If the TSR of the Brenntag 
share underperforms the MDAX/DAX or the average TSR of the 
selected peer group by 25% or more percentage points, target 
achievement is 0%."
"Values in-between are determined by lin-
ear interpolation."
"Overall target achievement is calculated by 
multiplying the target achievement figures of the two perfor-
mance criteria by their respective weightings and then adding 
together these two weighted target achievement figures."
"The number of virtual shares finally awarded at the end of the 
four-year performance period is calculated by multiplying the 
number of virtual shares initially awarded by the overall tar-
get achievement."
"The payout amount is capped at a maximum 
of 200% of the individual and contractually set target grant 
amount (Cap)."
"Among other components, this likewise included a long-term 
share-based remuneration program (Long-Term Incentive 
Plan)."
"In this case, the long-term variable remuneration was 
awarded every year and was partly based on the perfor-
mance of the Brenntag share."
"On the basis of a contractually 
set Annual Target Amount, this remuneration component was 
subject to a vesting period of in each case three years."
"50% of 
the Target Amount was contingent on the change in the value 
of the company’s shares during these three years (External LTI 
Portion) and 50% was contingent on the long-term develop-
ment of specific Group-wide KPIs (Internal LTI Portion)."
"For every per-
centage point by which the average share price on the last 
trade day of the vesting period exceeded or fell short of the 
average share price on the last trade day before the vesting 
period, the Absolute External LTI Portion was increased or 
decreased by 2%."
"For every percentage point by which the 
MDAX was over- or underperformed in the vesting period, the 
Relative External LTI Portion was increased or decreased by 
3%."
"The overall External LTI Portion at the end of the relevant 
vesting period equaled the sum of the Absolute External LTI 
Portion and Relative External LTI Portion."
"The Absolute Exter-
nal LTI Portion and Relative External LTI Portion could not be 
less than EUR 0."
"The External LTI Portion was capped overall 
at 200% of the contractually set Target Amount for the Exter-
nal LTI Portion."
"The Internal LTI Portion is measured by the following KPI tar-
gets, which are agreed at the end of each financial year for 
the following vesting period in an LTI Bonus Plan: EBITDA, 
ROCE and earnings per share."
"At the end of each financial 
year during a vesting period, the achievement of the KPI tar-
gets in the particular financial year is calculated for a share 
of 1/3 of the Internal LTI Portion."
"For every percentage point 
by which the targets of a given KPI are over- or underper-
formed in the particular financial year, the Annual Internal LTI 
Portion is increased or decreased by 3%."
"This may also lead 
to a negative Annual Internal LTI Portion."
"The overall Internal 
LTI Portion at the end of the relevant vesting period equals the 
sum of the Annual Internal LTI Portions."
"The Internal LTI Portion 
is also capped at 200% of the contractually set Target 
Amount for the Internal LTI Portion."
"The overall Internal LTI 
Portion for a vesting period may not be less than EUR 0."
"The 
Long-Term Incentive Bonus for each financial year equals the 
sum of the External and Internal LTI Portions."
"The Long-Term Incentive Bonus for each financial year was 
also capped at 200% of the Target Amount (LTI Cap)."
"The serving members of the Board of Management receive a 
fixed annual amount for the purpose of building up pension 
entitlements."
"For this purpose, one member of the Board of 
Management receives an annual amount of EUR 300,000 and 
may decide at their own discretion how to use this money."
"The 
annual amount made available is paid in twelve equal 
monthly instalments, in each case at the end of the month."
"If 
the service agreement begins or ends during a financial year, 
the annual amount for that financial year will be granted on 
a pro rata temporis basis."
"For the purpose of building up pen-
sion entitlements, the other members of the Board of Man-
agement receive an annual amount of 13.5% of their Annual 
Base Salary and the short-term variable remuneration (on 
100% target achievement, i.e."
"irrespective of the actual tar-
gets achieved), rounded up to the next EUR 1,000."
"One mem-
ber of the Board of Management has the option either to use 
this amount in whole or in part for contributions to his French 
social insurance or to also pay it annually into the Deferred 
Compensation Contingency Plan of Brenntag SE."
"Further 
members of the Board of Management are paid out the rele-
vant amount for building up pension entitlements every year 
and may decide at their own discretion how to use this money."
"The members of the Board of Management also receive ben-
efits in kind and other benefits, such as a company car, also 
for private use, or a car allowance, benefits for health care 
and long-term care insurance as well as social insurance."
"31, 2022: EUR 5.7 million) and the fair 
value of plan assets EUR 1.0 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 4.3 
million)."
"In this context, the capitalized surrender value of pen-
sion liability insurance is EUR 1.0 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: 
EUR 4.3 million)."
"The service agreements of the Board of Management mem-
bers end automatically on specified dates without any notice 
of termination being required."
"The employment of Board of 
Management members may only be terminated prematurely 
for good cause or by mutual agreement."
"If employment is ter-
minated prematurely, the service agreement limits any sever-
ance pay to the value of twice the total annual remuneration, 
but no more than the amount of remuneration that would be 
paid until the end of the term of the service agreement."
"As at 
December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of severance pay-
able would have been EUR 32.6 million (Dec."
"31, 2022: EUR 29.0 
million)."
"A post-contractual non-compete clause has been 
agreed with several Board of Management members who are 
incentivized under the Remuneration System 2020."
"The 
post-contractual non-compete clause applies for a period of 
24 months after the termination of the service agreement."
"For 
one member, this period is twelve months."
"During this period, 
these Board of Management members receive a continuous 
payment amounting to 75% of their annual base salary."
"Any 
earnings pursuant to Section 74c of the German Commercial 
Code (HGB) are deducted from this payment."

"In addition, we have audited the combined man-
agement report for the parent and the group of Brenntag SE, 
Essen/Germany, for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2023."
"In all material respects, this combined manage-
ment report is consistent with the consolidated financial 
statements, complies with German legal requirements 
and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of 
future development."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that 
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of 
the combined management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and of the combined management report in accor-
dance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) 
and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Stan-
dards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the 
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"We performed the audit 
of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary 
compliance with the International Standards on Auditing 
(ISA)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles 
and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Respon-
sibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial State-
ments and of the Combined Management Report” section of 
our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities 
in accordance with the requirements of European law and 
German commercial and professional law, and we have ful-
filled our other German professional responsibilities in accor-
dance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance 
with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we 
declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohib-
ited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the combined 
management report."
"These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion 
on these matters."
"In the following we present the key audit matters we have 
determined in the course of our audit: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
2."
"Accounting treatment of business acquisitions 
3."
"
Recognition and measurement of environmental 
provisions
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been struc-
tured as follows:
a)	 
description (including reference to corresponding informa-
tion in the consolidated financial statements)
b)	 
auditor’s response
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill
a)	 
Goodwill amounting to EUR 3.2 billion (31% of consolidated 
total assets) is reported under the “Intangible assets” item 
in the consolidated balance sheet of Brenntag SE."
"
The Company allocates goodwill to the respective groups 
of cash-generating units."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment 
by the Company once a year as of the end of the reporting 
period, or when there are indications of impairment."
"To carry out the impairment testing, the 
Company engaged an external advisor to determine the 
present values using a discounted cash flow model and to 
prepare an expert opinion."
"
The cash flow projections are based on the five-year plan-
ning prepared by the executive directors, approved by the 
supervisory board and applicable at the time the impair-
ment test is carried out."
"The supervisory board’s approval 
relates to the planning of the first four years in the detailed 
planning period."
"The current planning is based on the 
management and control structure applicable as of 
January 1, 2024 and was allocated to the groups of cash-
generating units existing as at December 31, 2023 for the 
purposes of impairment testing."
"The planning also takes 
into account the executive directors’ fundamental growth 
assumptions, which are specified in detail by the budget 
managers in the context of middle-up planning for the 
first four years and consolidated into medium-term busi-
ness planning at segment level."
"The executive directors 
extrapolate them for another planning year taking into 
account information from the planning process."
"Discoun-
ting is based on the discount rate determined from the 
weighted cost of capitals for the relevant group of cash-
generating units."
"
The result of this measurement depends to a large extent 
on the executive directors’ assessment of future cash flows 
and the discount rate used, and is therefore subject to 
major uncertainties."
"Against this background and in view 
of the complexity of the measurement of this high-value 
item, this matter was of particular significance in the con-
text of our audit."
"
The executive directors’ disclosures on goodwill are con-
tained in section “19.) Intangible assets” of the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"With respect to the projection of 
future cash flows, we assessed the planning reliability by 
reviewing the past adherence to planning."
"Additionally, we also 
reviewed the allocation of the planning to the existing 
groups of cash-generating units and assessed whether the 
costs of group functions were properly included in the 
impairment tests on the respective cash-generating units."
"
Knowing that even small changes in the discount rates 
applied can have a material impact, we intensively dealt 
with the parameters used to determine the discount rates."
We reviewed the calculation model of the method applied.
"Furthermore, due to the material significance 
of goodwill for the Group’s assets and liabilities, we perfor-
med a complementary own sensitivity analysis in order to 
be able to assess a possible impairment risk in the event of 
a potential change of a material valuation assumption."
"In 
addition, we audited the completeness and correctness of 
the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements required to be made under IAS 36."
"Accounting treatment of business acquisitions
a)	 
In the financial year 2023, the Brenntag Group acquired the 
entire business of Al-Azzaz Chemicals Company, with 
registered office in Al-Khobar Dammam / Saudi Arabia, as 
part of an asset deal."
"Moreover, the Group acquired 100% of the shares in 
Old World Specialty Chemicals, LLC and Old World Logis-
tics, LLC from Old World Industries, LLC, with registered 
office in Northbrook (Illinois), USA."
"
The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognized 
at fair value arising from the acquisition are based on 
values from the preliminary purchase price allocations 
that were prepared by the executive directors of 
Brenntag SE, partly by calling in an external advisor."
"Taking 
into account net assets acquired of EUR 185.4 million attri-
butable to Brenntag (in relation to 100%), the transactions 
generated EUR 166.0 million in goodwill acquired."
"In addi-
tion, the Group brought its valuation of the assets and lia-
bilities resulting from prior-year acquisitions to a timely 
close in the reporting period with valuation adjustments 
relating to net assets acquired (EUR – 8.0 million) and 
goodwill (EUR +9.9 million)."
"
The executive directors’ disclosures on business acquisiti-
ons are contained in section “Business combinations in 
accordance with IFRS 3” of the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"b)	 
In reviewing the accounting treatment of the business 
acquisitions, we obtained an understanding of the acqui-
sitions by dealing with the respective contractual agree-
ments."
"We reconciled the purchase prices paid as consi-
deration for the acquired business operations with the 
contractual agreements and the supporting payment 
documentation provided to us."
"In respect of the prelimi-
nary purchase price allocations, we evaluated the method 
used to identify the assets, liabilities and contingent liabi-
lities acquired and the overall design of the valuation 
models used."
"We also assessed the valuation adjustments 
made to the assets and liabilities resulting from the prior-
year business acquisitions."
"Furthermore, we evaluated 
whether the initial consolidation was appropriately 
accounted for and examined the completeness and cor-
rectness of disclosures required to be made under IFRS 3 
by using checklists."
"The provisions 
also include contingent liabilities of EUR 19.4 million for 
which cash outflows are not likely but nonetheless possi-
ble."
"Due to purchase price allocations, these were reported 
in the consolidated balance sheet under acquisitions in 
accordance with IFRS 3."
"The recognition of environmental 
provisions at the subsidiaries was coordinated centrally by 
an external expert."
"In addition, another audit firm assisted 
the Group in measuring the provisions and summarized 
the results in an expert opinion."
"The environmental provi-
sions were recognized at the present value of the expected 
expenditures, taking into account future inflation-related 
increases."
"The provisions were discounted using interest 
rates for risk-free assets with matching terms for each 
functional currency."
"
The executive directors’ disclosures on the measurement 
of environmental provisions are contained in the sections 
“Environmental provisions” and “Assumptions and estima-
tes” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"b)	 
As part of our audit, we first obtained an understanding of 
the underlying processes for determining environmental 
provisions and assessed whether recognition criteria exis-
ted and whether the environmental provisions were mea-
sured appropriately under IAS 37."
"For this purpose, we eva-
luated, among others, the appropriateness of the 
measurement assumptions and models used as well as 
the underlying individual facts and the competence, capa-
bilities and objectivity of the external experts engaged."
"We 
reviewed the future cash outflows expected by the group 
companies on a sample basis and made an additional 
evaluation of the plausibility of changes in individual future 
cash outflows against the estimate made at the end of the 
prior year."
"By calling in our valuation specialists, we also 
reviewed measurement parameters (in particular inflation 
rates, discount rates and currency translation from the 
functional to the reporting currency) used by the Company."
"Furthermore, we reviewed and assessed the mathemati-
cal accuracy of the calculations and the appropriateness 
of the calculations performed by the other auditing firm in 
its sensitivity analyses."
"Moreover, we examined the Com-
pany’s disclosures on the measurement of environmental 
provisions in the sections “Environmental provisions” and 
“Assumptions and estimates” of the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements."
"Other Information
The executive directors and / or the supervisory board are 
responsible for the other information."
"The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the 
supervisory board."
"Otherwise the 
executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements 
and on the combined management report do not cover the 
other information, and consequently we do not express an audit 
opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in 
this regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the exec-
utive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s abil-
ity to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the respon-
sibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial report-
ing based on the going concern basis of accounting unless 
there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease oper-
ations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the combined man-
agement report."
"Mis-
statements can arise from fraud or error and are considered 
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reason-
ably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements 
and this combined management report."

AUDITOR’S REPORT
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a 
material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may 
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepre-
sentations, or the override of internal controls."
"■	
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used by the executive directors and the reasonableness 
of estimates made by the executive directors and related 
disclosures."
"If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements and in the 
combined management report or, if such disclosures are 
inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to 
continue as a going concern."
"■	
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on 
the consolidated financial statements and on the com-
bined management report."
"We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit."
"We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinions."
"■	
evaluate the consistency of the combined management 
report with the consolidated financial statements, its 
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s 
position it provides."
"■	
perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the executive directors in the combined 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropri-
ate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the signifi-
cant assumptions used by the executive directors as a 
basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the 
proper derivation of the prospective information from 
these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit 
opinion on the prospective information and on the 
assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial 
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially 
from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and tim-
ing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with gov-
ernance, we determine those matters that were of most signif-
icance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We 
describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or reg-
ulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibilities in this context are further 
described in the “Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm has applied the 
requirements of the IDW Quality Management Standards."
"1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated 
financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 
no."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the pro-
cess for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the finan-
cial reporting process."
"Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit  
of the ESEF Documents
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the ESEF documents are free from material inten-
tional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements 
of Section 328 (1) HGB."
"We exercise professional judgment 
and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit."
"■	
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance 
opinion on the effectiveness of these controls."
"■	
evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, 
i.e., whether the file containing the ESEF documents 
meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet 
date, on the technical specification for this electronic file."
"■	
evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML 
reproduction with content equivalent to the audited 
consolidated financial statements and to the audited 
combined management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of  
the EU Audit Regulation
We were elected as group auditor by the general meeting on 
June 15, 2023."
"We were engaged by the supervisory board on 
August 3, 2023."
"We have been the group auditor of 
Brenntag SE, Essen / Germany, since the financial year 2023."
"We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor’s 
report are consistent with the additional report to the audit 
committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation 
(long-form audit report)."
"Other matter – use of the auditor’s report
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the audited 
combined management report as well as with the audited 
ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion 
contained therein are to be used solely together with the 
audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form."
