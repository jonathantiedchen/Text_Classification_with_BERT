"2 Before amortization of intangible assets from purchase price allocation (PPA), changes in the scope of consolidation, and special effects."
"Despite continuing to face major challenges due to the geopolitical situation, additional inflation-related costs,  
negative exchange-rate effects and high costs for special freight, we performed well and generated solid earnings."
Consistently aligning the company with our strategy is clearly paying off.
"Continental is well positioned for the  
future – as the mobility and material technology group for safe, smart and sustainable solutions."
"Our results in 2023 show that we are on the right track: 
› 
At €41.4 billion, our sales were 5.1 percent higher year-on-year."
"We were also able to increase our adjusted EBIT 
margin from 4.9 percent in the previous year to 6.1 percent."
"› 
In the Automotive group sector, we improved by adopting and rigorously implementing the right measures,  
significantly increasing sales and the adjusted EBIT margin to €20.3 billion and 1.9 percent."
"This represents a 
further step toward the profitability we are striving for."
"› 
With sales of €14.0 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.5 percent, the Tires group sector once again 
achieved a very good result."
Tires is highly profitable and excels when it comes to technology and sustainability.
"› 
In a weak industrial environment, the ContiTech group sector demonstrated its resilience, with sales totaling 
€6.8 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin up significantly at 6.7 percent."
"› 
Thanks to an improvement in operating earnings and a reduction in inventories and receivables, we significantly 
increased our adjusted free cash flow to €1.3 billion."
"Chairman’s Letter 
 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Chairman’s Letter 
5 
 
As a team, we are capable of great things."
"Our approximately 200,000 employees worldwide achieved a lot in 
2023 despite the challenging conditions."
"Competition is tough, and the transformation in our industries is incredibly 
demanding."
"The entire Executive Board would therefore like to extend its thanks and appreciation to all employees 
at Continental."
"Together, we have entered a new phase: a phase of growth and increased value creation."
"This is based on three key elements: 
 › 
Continental has a clear strategy to achieve its mid-term targets."
"› 
We will invest in particular in those areas with value creation upside and continuously expand our technology 
position in areas where we can expect to gain an edge over the competition."
"› 
The Automotive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors make up a balanced and resilient portfolio."
"With these elements in mind, we made some key decisions in 2023: 
 › 
The Automotive group sector will pursue the strategy of becoming the preferred system integrator for software-
defined vehicles."
"As part of this, the User Experience business area will become organizationally independent, 
which will open up new strategic options for this business."
"In addition, further business activities will be reviewed 
that contributed around €1.4 billion to consolidated sales in fiscal 2023."
"› 
In the Tires group sector, we see strong growth potential in the Asia-Pacific region as well as in North and South 
America."
"Based on our strategy of being in the market for the market, we will therefore expand production ca-
pacity in these regions."
"Our mid-term targets – sales of around €51 billion to €56 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of around 8 to 11 
percent – serve as a clear guide for the future, thus creating the foundation for further investment."
"In the short 
term, we hope to already reach the lower end of our profitability target."
"As shareholders of Continental, you should also benefit from this increase in value."
"The Executive Board and  
Supervisory Board will therefore propose a dividend of €2.20 per share to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"At 
our Capital Market Day in December 2023, we presented an adjusted dividend payout corridor."
"We now intend  
to distribute 20 to 40 percent of net income to ensure Continental remains a worthwhile investment."
"With our hardware, software and digitalization portfolio, as well as our employees’ expertise, we are uniquely  
positioned."
Continental is on the right track – of that I am certain.
"Positive trend on the stock markets 
In 2023, the stock markets were influenced in particular by solid 
corporate earnings as well as investor expectations regarding in-
terest rate developments."
"The overall trend on the stock markets 
was positive in the first half of 2023, despite some global challenges."
"With price increases for energy and production materials having 
weighed heavily on global stock markets in 2022, a positive effect 
was felt in the first half of 2023 thanks to initial relief measures, 
among other factors."
"Nevertheless, persistently high inflation and 
consecutive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and the  
European Central Bank (ECB), for example, led to repeated price 
losses."
"Expectations of a possible recession also dampened stock market 
sentiment, while fears of a global banking crisis following the insol-
vency of Silicon Valley Bank caused share prices to fall in March  
in particular."
"However, the markets recovered more quickly than 
expected."
"Inflation eased from the second quarter onward, first in the USA 
and then in the eurozone."
"In response to this, central banks such 
as the Federal Reserve and the ECB announced a pause in interest 
rate rises, resulting in a strong year-end rally on the stock markets."
"The DAX, which reached a new all-time high of 17,003.28 points in 
mid-December, closed 2023 at 16,751.64 points."
"This represented 
an increase of 20.3% compared with the end of 2022, when it was 
quoted at 13,923.59 points."
"The EURO STOXX 50 rose by 19.2% 
in 2023 and ended the year at 4,521.65 points."
"Significant rally among automotive stocks 
Many automotive stocks benefited from a gradual stabilization of 
supply chains in 2023, together with an overall improvement in 
the availability of semiconductors and other electronic products."
"At the same time, recurring fears of a recession and the resulting 
purchasing restraint shown by consumers weighed on the auto-
motive industry."
"Overall, however, manufacturers were able to in-
crease car production compared with the previous year."
"Even the 
strike in the US automotive industry, which lasted several weeks, 
had no long-term impact on stock market values following the 
share price rally at the end of the year."
"Despite this challenging environment, which was additionally 
driven by inflationary pressure and cost increases, most automo-
tive suppliers were able to achieve solid earnings in 2023, causing 
the share prices of many listed suppliers to increase."
"The STOXX 
Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts rose to 627.86 points in 2023, 
recording growth of 19.1% compared with the end of 2022."
"Good performance by Continental shares 
In the first quarter of 2023, Continental’s share price performance 
– like that of other automotive suppliers – was influenced in par-
ticular by the improvement in global supply chains and the expec-
tation of falling production costs."
"However, after a strong start to 
the year, Continental shares underperformed in a negative market 
environment."
"This sharp decline was followed in the second quarter by a period 
of stabilization at a level between €60 and €70."
"On April 28, 2023, 
the share price was marked down to reflect the dividend of €1.50 
for fiscal 2022 resolved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"Continental’s share price remained relatively stable in the third 
quarter."
"In the fourth quarter, it fell initially before expectations 
regarding the Capital Market Day in December and the company’s 
announced strategy led to a sharp increase."
"At the end of 2023, Continental’s shares were listed at €76.92."
"This represented an increase of 37.4% compared with the year-
end price of €55.98 in 2022."
"Taking into account a reinvestment 
of the dividend paid out on the distribution date, the share price 
rose by 40.7% in 2023."

"Positive earnings per share 
The significant rise in automotive production, combined with a 
gradual stabilization of supply chains, resulted in a positive overall 
earnings trend in the year under review."
"In addition, the prior year 
was negatively affected by impairment losses owing to higher inter-
est rates and other valuation-related effects."
"Consequently, net in-
come attributable to the shareholders of the parent increased to 
€1,156.4 million in fiscal 2023 (PY: €66.6 million)."
"Earnings per 
share amounted to €5.78 in 2023 (PY: €0.33)."

and 40% of net income attributable to the shareholders."
"For fiscal 2022, a dividend of 
€1.50 per share was paid out on May 3, 2023."
"Share capital unchanged 
As at the end of fiscal 2023, the share capital of Continental AG  
still amounted to €512,015,316.48."
"It is divided into 200,005,983 
no-par-value shares with a notional value of €2.56 per share."
"In line with Article 20 of Continental AG’s Articles of Incorporation, 
each share grants one vote at the Shareholders’ Meeting."
"The  
current Articles of Incorporation are available on our website at  
 www.continental.com under Company/Corporate Governance."
All shares have the same dividend and voting rights.
"Free float stable at 54.0% 
As in the previous year, free float as defined by Deutsche Börse AG 
amounted to 54.0% as at the end of 2023."
"The most recent change 
took place on September 17, 2013, when our major shareholder, 
the IHO Group, Herzogenaurach, Germany, announced the sale of 
7.8 million Continental shares, reducing its shareholding in Conti-
nental AG from 49.9% to 46.0%."
"As at the end of 2023, the market capitalization of Continental AG 
amounted to €15.4 billion (PY: €11.2 billion)."
"Market capitalization 
on the basis of free float averaged €8.0 billion over the last 20 trad-
ing days of the reporting year (PY: €6.1 billion)."
"Free-float market 
capitalization is the decisive factor for index calculation in the regu-
latory framework of Deutsche Börse AG."
"At the end of 2023, Conti-
nental AG ranked 37th in terms of free-float market capitalization 
on the DAX (PY: 39th)."

ratio was 99.9% (PY: 98.5%)."
"The identified level of Continental shares held in Europe was slightly 
higher than in the previous year at 51.1% of free float (PY: 49.7%)."
"In particular, the identified level of shares held by investors from the 
UK and Ireland, at 31.5%, led to the year-on-year rise (PY: 30.0%)."
"The free-float holdings of Scandinavian investors fell to 3.3% in 
2023 (PY: 3.6%)."

10 
 
Dear shareholders,
The Supervisory Board comprehensively fulfilled all tasks incum-
bent upon it under applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation and 
By-Laws in fiscal 2023."
"We closely supervised, carefully monitored 
and advised the Executive Board in the management of the com-
pany."
"We were directly involved in a timely manner in all decisions 
of fundamental importance to the company."
"The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with regular, 
timely and comprehensive updates at its meetings as well as ver-
bally and in writing on all issues of relevance to the company."
"In 
particular, these include the business performance, business strat-
egy, planning, significant business transactions in the company and 
the Continental Group, and the related risks and opportunities, as 
well as compliance issues."
"The members of the Supervisory Board 
were also available to the Executive Board for consultation outside 
the meetings."
"As chairman of the Supervisory Board, I had regular 
contact with the members of the Executive Board, in particular with 
its chairman, and discussed current company issues and develop-
ments with them."
"Pursuant to a suggestion of the German Corpo-
rate Governance Code, I also held discussions with investors in fis-
cal 2023, for example as part of a governance roadshow in Novem-
ber, on topics specific to the Supervisory Board."
"Meetings of the Supervisory Board and the committees 
The Supervisory Board convened for five ordinary meetings and 
one extraordinary meeting in fiscal 2023, as well as for the strategy 
meeting."
"The meeting in July and the extraordinary meeting in De-
cember took place virtually, while all other meetings were held in 
person."
"At its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly conferred 
part of the time in the absence of the Executive Board."
"The Chairman’s Committee held five meetings in the reporting year 
(four in person or hybrid and one virtually) and passed one resolu-
tion by written procedure."
"The Audit Committee met four times in 
2023 (three in person and one virtually)."
"It also discussed updating the profile of 
skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board."
"The Mediation Com-
mittee in accordance with Section 27 (3) of the German Co-deter-
mination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – MitbestG) was not required 
to meet in 2023, and neither was the Committee for Related Party 
Transactions (RPT Committee)."
"The special committee formed in connection with the Supervisory 
Board’s investigation into the manipulation of emission limits by 
certain automotive manufacturers (Special Emissions Committee) 
met three times in the year under review."
"The special committee 
formed in connection with the investigation into irregularities in the 
production of air conditioning lines and industrial hoses in two of 
the ContiTech group sector’s business areas (Special ContiTech 
Committee) also met three times in the year under review."
"Upon 
completion of the investigation, the Supervisory Board resolved at 
its meeting on December 13, 2023, to dissolve the Special Conti-
Tech Committee."
There are no other committees.
"All committees report to the plenary 
session."
"The corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 
289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetz-
buch – HGB) starting on page 16 describes their responsibilities in

"Where the actual course of business deviated from the defined plans 
and targets, the Executive Board provided detailed explanations."
"It 
discussed the reasons for these deviations and the measures intro-
duced in depth with the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, the Execu-
tive Board regularly informed us about the Continental Group’s 
main procurement and sales markets and about Continental AG’s 
share price performance."
"In addition, the work of the Supervisory Board and its collaboration 
with the Executive Board in the year under review continued to be 
shaped by the transformation process in the automotive industry 
and its consequences for the company."
"Sustainability-related issues 
– in particular the reduction of CO2 emissions – were also regularly 
discussed."
"Another focus of the Supervisory Board’s work was again 
on the Supervisory Board’s investigation into the manipulation of 
emission limits in vehicles of specific automotive manufacturers, in-
cluding monitoring of the corresponding investigative proceedings 
by public prosecutors."
"The Supervisory Board also addressed the 
irregularities in the production of air-conditioning lines and industrial 
hoses."
"The Supervisory Board discussed both of these issues at 
each ordinary meeting."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board received 
regular reports on the processing of the cyberattack from the previ-
ous fiscal year and the measures taken to improve cybersecurity."
"Finally, reporting on strengthening the risk management and inter-
nal control system and compliance management system overseen 
by the newly created Executive Board function for Integrity and 
Law was regularly discussed, as was reporting on further internal 
investigations."
"At its meeting on March 15, 2023, the resolution of December 14, 
2022, to create a new Executive Board function for Integrity and 
Law and appoint Olaf Schick to head this function was specified 
such that he would take up his new position on May 1, 2023."
"Olaf 
Schick is responsible for the central areas of Group Compliance; 
Group Internal Audit; Group Law and Intellectual Property; Group 
Quality, Technical Compliance, Continental Business System and 
Environment; and the new area of Group Risks and Controls."
"The 
company’s annual financial statements and the consolidated finan-
cial statements for 2022 were also discussed and subsequently  
approved in the presence of the auditor."
"As part of the reporting  
for the current fiscal year, the business development of the Auton-
omous Mobility business area, the partnership with Ambarella Inter-
national LP and the status of the business model with Aurora Inno-
vation Inc."
were discussed in detail.
"The decision by the Executive Board to again hold the Annual Share-
holders’ Meeting virtually in 2023 was also approved, as was the 
draft agenda for the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"The agenda  
included granting the Executive Board the authorization to decide, 
for a period of three years, whether the Annual Shareholders’ Meet-
ing would be held virtually or as an in-person event."
"Finally, the  
Supervisory Board adopted its proposed resolutions for the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board additionally addressed 
the status of the investigation into the cyberattack on Continental 
in fiscal 2022 and received reports on the investigation activities."
"It also dealt with the reorganization of the ContiTech group sector 
into the Industrial Solutions (Americas, APAC, EMEA), Surface Solu-
tions and Original Equipment Solutions business areas."
"Finally, dis-
cussions were held on the planned sale of shares in Russian subsid-
iaries of the Tires group sector with the resolution to sell the com-
panies OOO Continental Tires RUS and OOO Continental Kaluga to 
the Russian joint-stock company S8 Industrial Assets."
"At the Supervisory Board meeting on April 27, 2023, we decided 
to reappoint Nikolai Setzer as a member of the Executive Board 
and chairman of the Executive Board from April 1, 2024, for a period 
of five years until March 31, 2029."
"In addition, Philipp von Hirsch-
heydt was appointed as member of the Executive Board responsible 
for the Automotive group sector from May 1, 2023, for a period of 
three years until April 30, 2026."
"The ongoing business development 
was also discussed."
"At the meeting on July 6, 2023, we decided to reappoint Philip 
Nelles as member of the Executive Board responsible for the Con-
tiTech group sector from June 1, 2024, for a period of five years 
until May 31, 2029."
"Measures to reduce fixed costs in the Automo-
tive group sector were another important topic of discussion."
"The 
Supervisory Board also addressed the steps being taken to strengthen 
the risk and compliance management system."
"The strategy of the Executive Board function for In-
tegrity and Law, the Continental Group’s sustainability requirements 
– as well as own sustainability ambitions – and the HR strategy were 
also discussed."
"In particular, the “from work to work” initiative was 
presented, which aims to ensure a seamless transition to new jobs 
for employees through training programs and to help shape the 
transformation process."
"At the meeting on September 27, 2023, discussions were initially 
held without the Executive Board present, including discussions re-
lating to succession planning for the Executive Board."
"It was also  
decided that shareholder representatives would in the future follow 
the staggered board concept."
"Under this concept, the terms of of-
fice of the shareholder representatives do not run in parallel but are 
staggered, each for a term of office of four years."
"Five shareholder 
representatives will thus be up for election every two years."
"To es-
tablish the rhythm of the staggered election cycles, five shareholder 
representatives are to stand for election at the Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting for a one-time term of office of two years."
"The Supervisory 
Board also discussed adjustments to the remuneration system of 
the Executive Board, which are to be presented for approval to the 
Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in fiscal 2024."
"In the course of the 
presentation on ongoing business development, the Executive 
Board gave another status report on the processing of the cyberat-
tack on Continental and improvements to IT security."
"Discussions 
were also held with the Executive Board on options for the planned 
exit from the business at the Gifhorn plant."
"In particular, the status of its strategic re-
view of measures for the Automotive group sector was described 
and discussed."
"At its meeting on December 13, 2023, the adjustments to the  
remuneration system that were discussed for the first time at the 
meeting on September 27, 2023, were resolved without the Execu-
tive Board present."
"The revised remuneration system with these ad-
justments will be submitted to the upcoming Annual Shareholders’ 
Meeting for approval."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board determined 
the targets for the short-term incentive (STI) and the long-term in-
centive (LTI)."
"The Supervisory Board also discussed updating its 
profile of skills and expertise and agreed to pass a resolution in 
February 2024 and create an updated qualifications matrix."
"The 
shareholder representatives additionally passed a resolution on  
the candidates for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting in 2024."
"The shareholder representatives 
will all stand for re-election, with five standing for a (one-time) short-
ened term of two years to allow for a transition to elections accord-
ing to the staggered board concept that has been adopted."
"In the 
presence of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board extensively 
addressed the annual planning for 2024 and the long-term plan-
ning."
"It also approved the planning and investment plans for fiscal 
2024."
"As part of the regular reporting on irregularities in the pro-
duction of air conditioning lines and industrial hoses, the Executive 
Board prepared its final report on the internal investigation that had 
been ongoing since 2022."
"By means of a resolution, the Supervisory 
Board declared the investigation previously resolved at the meeting 
on December 14, 2022, to be complete and dissolved the Special 
ContiTech Committee."
"The Chairman’s Committee held five meetings in the year under 
review, in which it primarily prepared the personnel-related decisions 
of the plenary session and made recommendations for resolutions."
"At its first meeting on March 15, 2023, the appointment of Olaf 
Schick to head the Executive Board function for Integrity and Law 
was adjusted to become effective from May 1, 2023."
"In addition, 
proposals to the plenary session relating to targets set for the vari-
able remuneration of the Executive Board were resolved."
"The com-
mittee also approved Dr. Ariane Reinhart’s request to assume a 
supervisory board appointment at Evonik Industries AG."
"In March, 
the Chairman’s Committee approved an increase to the budget for 
the completion of the new company headquarters."

"Key topics dealt with by the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee was also informed by the Executive Board in 
detail and on an ongoing basis about sales, results and employ-
ment development in the Continental Group and individual group 
sectors as well as the financial situation of the company."
"The Execu-
tive Board is assisted by the head of Accounting and the head of 
Group Controlling, who attend the meetings of the Audit Commit-
tee and can thereby provide information directly."
"The chairman of the Audit Com-
mittee shares key information with the Audit Committee."
"As a focus of each of its quarterly meetings, the Audit Committee 
talked with the Executive Board about the accounting as at the end 
of the previous quarter and the outlook for the year as a whole as 
well as the quarterly statements and the half-year financial report 
prior to their publication."
"Another focus of the Audit Committee’s 
work in the past fiscal year was again on dealing with the com-
pany’s internal control system and risk management system."

ment of PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs-

ment of the Continental Group’s protection against cyberattacks

"Corporate governance 
At its meeting on December 13, 2023, the Supervisory Board 
adopted its declaration in accordance with Section 161 AktG on 
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"At the same meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed updat-
ing its profile of skills and expertise and agreed to pass a resolution 
in the first quarter of 2024 and create an updated qualifications 
matrix."
"The resolution was passed in February 2024 in the form  
of a circular resolution."
"The chairman of the Supervisory Board was not notified of any  
potential conflicts of interest in 2023."
"These still do not constitute such significant and long-term 
conflicts of interest that would require the members to step down."
"In its opinion, the Supervisory Board also had an appropriate num-
ber of independent members, in particular on the shareholder side, 
as defined in the code at all times in the period under review."
"Fur-
ther information on this topic and on corporate governance in gen-
eral is included in the corporate governance statement pursuant to

relations with affiliated companies pursuant to Section 312 AktG 
(dependent company report)."
"Fur-
thermore, the plenary session of the Supervisory Board discussed 
these at length at its meeting to approve the annual financial state-
ments on March 12, 2024."
"The discussions also concerned the 
combined non-financial statement for the Continental Group and 
for Continental AG according to Sections 289b and 315b HGB."
"The 
required documents were distributed to all members of the Audit 
Committee and the Supervisory Board in good time before these 
meetings so that the members had sufficient opportunity to review 
them."
The auditor was present at these discussions.

vide additional information to the Audit Committee and the Super-
visory Board."

tions from the recommendations of the German Corporate Govern-
ance Code explained therein."
"According to recommendation C.2 of the German Corporate Gov-
ernance Code, the Supervisory Board shall set an age limit for 
members of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board does 
not set an age limit because it does not consider such a general

Supervisory Board member."

values, desired behavior and self-image of the Continental Group; 
available on Continental’s website  under Company/Corporate 
Governance/Vision & Mission."
"› 
Sustainability ambition; available on Continental’s website

"For more information, see Continental’s website  
 under Sustainability/Strategy and Sustainable Corporate Gov-
ernance/Organization and Management."
"Corporate bodies 
In line with the law and the Articles of Incorporation, the company’s 
corporate bodies are the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board 
and the Shareholders’ Meeting."
"As a German stock corporation, 
Continental AG has a dual management system characterized by a 
strict personnel division between the Executive Board as the man-
agement body and the Supervisory Board as the monitoring body."
"The cooperation between the Executive Board, Supervisory Board 
and Shareholders’ Meeting is depicted on the next page."
"All members of the 
Executive Board share responsibility for the management of the 
company jointly."
"Regardless of this principle of joint responsibility, 
each Executive Board member is individually responsible for the  
areas entrusted to them."
"The chairman of the Executive Board is  
responsible for the company’s overall management and business 
policy."
"He ensures management coordination and uniformity on 
the Executive Board and represents the company to the public."
"The 
Executive Board jointly develops the company’s strategy, agrees it 
with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation."
"Information on areas of respon-
sibility and resumes of the Executive Board members are available 
on Continental’s website  under Company/Corporate Governance-
/Executive Board."
"The Executive Board was expanded from five to 
seven members effective May 1, 2023."
"The Executive Board func-
tion for Integrity and Law was newly created and filled."
"In addition, 
the management of the Automotive group sector was transferred 
from the chairman of the Executive Board to a new member of the 
Executive Board."
"The first time a person is appointed to the Execu-
tive Board, his or her term as a rule is three years only."
"As a rule, a 
member of the Executive Board is not appointed beyond the statu-
tory retirement age."
"Only under exceptional circumstances will a 
member of the Executive Board be reappointed earlier than one 
year prior to the end of their term of  
appointment with simultaneous annulment of their current appoint-
ment."
"More information on the members of the Executive Board 
can be found on page 223 and on Continental’s website  under 
Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board."
"The Executive Board By-Laws are available on 
Continental’s website  under Company/Corporate Governance/-
Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board By-Laws on the basis of 
the Articles of Incorporation require the consent of the Supervisory 
Board for significant actions taken by management."
"The Executive Board has established separate boards for the Auto-
motive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors."
"This measure supports 
the decentralization of responsibility that the global organization  
of the company seeks to achieve, and relieves the burden on the 
Executive Board."
"In addition to establishing these boards, the Exec-
utive Board has delegated to them decision-making powers for cer-
tain matters that affect only the relevant group sectors."
"The Supervisory Board and its practices 
The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive 
Board and collaborates with the Executive Board to develop a long-
term succession plan."
"The Supervisory Board discusses this at least 
once a year without the Executive Board."
"In order to become ac-
quainted with potential successors, the Supervisory Board, in con-
sultation with the Executive Board, offers them the opportunity to 
deliver presentations to the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board 
in managing the company."
"This includes, in particular, issues relating 
to the company’s strategy, planning, business development, risk sit-
uation, risk management, compliance and sustainability."
"The Super-
visory Board is directly involved in decisions of material importance 
to the company."
"As specified by law, the Articles of Incorporation or 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   To Our Shareholders   Corporate Governance 
18 
 
the Supervisory Board By-Laws, certain corporate management 
matters require the approval of the Supervisory Board."
"The chair-
man of the Supervisory Board coordinates its work and represents 
it vis-à-vis third parties."
"Within reasonable limits, he is prepared to 
talk to investors about issues specific to the Supervisory Board."
"He 
maintains regular contact between meetings with the Executive 
Board, and in particular with its chairman, to discuss issues relating 
in particular to the company’s strategy, business development, risk 
situation, risk management and compliance."
"Composition of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board comprises 20 members in accordance with 
the German Co-determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz – Mit-
bestG) and the company’s Articles of Incorporation."
"Half the mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board are elected individually by the share-
holders in the Shareholders’ Meeting (shareholder representatives), 
while the other half are elected by the employees of Continen-
tal AG and its German subsidiaries (employee representatives)."
"Both the shareholder representatives and the employee represent-
atives have an equal duty to act in the interests of the company."
The Supervisory Board’s chairman is a shareholder representative.
"In accordance with the provisions of the Co-determination Act, he 
has the casting vote in the event of a tie."
"The current Supervisory Board was constituted on April 26, 2019."
"The term of office of the Supervisory Board members lasts until the 
end of the 2024 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting."
"The chairman of 
the Supervisory Board is Prof. Dr.-Ing."
"Wolfgang Reitzle who, in ac-
cordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, is inde-
pendent of the company and its Executive Board."
"The Supervisory 
Board does not include any members who previously belonged to 
the Executive Board of Continental AG, who exercise an executive 
function or advisory role at a major competitor of Continental, or 
who have a personal relationship with such a competitor."
"In the year under review, the Supervisory Board resolved at its 
meeting on September 27 that shareholder representatives would 
in the future follow the staggered board concept."
"Moreover, share-
holder representatives will be nominated for terms of office of four 
years each."
"Under this staggered board concept, the terms of office 
of the shareholder representatives do not run in parallel but are 
staggered between two groups of five shareholder representatives, 
each for a term of office of four years."
"Five shareholder representa-
tives will thus be up for election every two years."
"This increased 
flexibility in the Supervisory Board’s composition makes it easier  
for the Supervisory Board to respond to the changing demands on 
its tasks and areas of expertise."
"To establish the rhythm of the stag-
gered election cycles, five shareholder representatives will stand for 
election at the 2024 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting for a one-time 
term of office of two years."
"The company has set up an informational program that provides 
newly elected members of the Supervisory Board with a comprehen-
sive overview of the company’s products and technologies as well as 
finances, controlling and corporate governance at Continental."
"The Supervisory Board By-Laws are available on Continen-
tal’s website  under Company/Corporate Governance/Supervisory 
Board."
"The Supervisory Board also consults on a regular basis in 
the absence of the Executive Board."
"Before each regular meeting of 
the Supervisory Board, the representatives of the shareholders and 
of the employees each meet separately with members of the Exec-
utive Board to discuss the upcoming meeting."
"The Supervisory Board regularly reviews how effectively it and its 
committees have fulfilled their responsibilities."
"It recently carried 
out such a review in 2021 with the help of an external consultant."
"This confirmed the Supervisory Board’s efficient and professional 
approach to its work in the past years."
"The Supervisory Board has 
adopted the recommendations from the 2021 self-assessment."
"Profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board 
In accordance with recommendation C.1 of the German Corporate 
Governance Code, the Supervisory Board has prepared a profile of 
skills and expertise and specified targets for its composition."
"The 
Supervisory Board updated the current profile of skills and exper-
tise in the reporting year and adopted it by circular resolution in 
February 2024."
"The Supervisory Board as a whole should possess the skills and  
expertise noted below."
"It is not expected that all Supervisory Board 
members possess all of the skills and expertise noted below."
"Instead, 
each area of expertise must be covered by at least one Supervisory 
Board member."
"In particular, 
these include integrity, commitment, capacity for discussion and 
teamwork, sufficient availability and discretion."
"The Supervisory Board members should collectively cover all skills, 
expertise and experience deemed to be significant in view of Conti-
nental’s business activities."
"The progress achieved to date in implement-
ing the profile of skills and expertise can be viewed in the qualifi-
cations matrix."
"› 
Independence: The Supervisory Board should have an appropri-
ate number of members on the shareholder side whom it deems 
to be independent in accordance with the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"Taking into account the ownership structure, a 
Supervisory Board member is therefore considered independent 
if they are independent of the company and its Executive Board, 
and also independent of a controlling shareholder."
"The Supervisory 
Board has specified the following targets for this purpose: 
› 
More than half of the shareholder representatives should 
be independent of Continental AG and its Executive Board."
"The independence of shareholder representatives was assessed 
in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code by 
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"As part 
of the assessment of independence from the Executive Board 
and the company, it was taken into account that four shareholder 
representatives will have been members of the Supervisory 
Board for more than 12 years in 2023."
"In the assessment of the 
independence of these four shareholder representatives, given 
the former and ongoing administration of the members in ques-
tion, the shareholder representatives overall see no grounds to 
accept changing the existing assessment of independence."
"The 
shareholder representatives currently on the Supervisory Board 
are therefore all, without exception, independent of Continen-
tal AG and its Executive Board."
"› 
At least five shareholder representatives should be inde-
pendent of the controlling shareholder, the IHO Group, 
headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Germany."
"It was taken into consideration in the assessment of independ-
ence from any controlling shareholder that two Supervisory 
Board members are linked to the controlling shareholder, the 
IHO Group, Herzogenaurach, Germany."
"As determined in the  
assessment by the shareholder representatives on the Super-
visory Board, the Supervisory Board still has an appropriate 
number of members on the shareholder side who are inde-
pendent in accordance with the German Corporate Governance 
Code."
"These include: 
› 
Prof. Dr.-Ing."
"Wolfgang Reitzle 
› 
Dorothea von Boxberg  
› 
Stefan E."
"In its nominations of candidates for election to the Supervisory 
Board, the Supervisory Board takes into account the requirements 
of the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole as well 
as the aforementioned targets."
"Does the Supervisory Board 
member currently maintain or 
have they maintained a 
material business relationship 
with the company or a 
company dependent on it (e.g."

Diligent corporate management and good corporate governance 
also require that the company deal with risks responsibly."
"Continen-
tal has a corporate-wide internal control and risk management sys-
tem that is used to analyze and manage the company’s risk situa-
tion."
"We report on this in detail in the report on risks and opportuni-
ties starting on page 93, which forms part of the management re-
port for the consolidated financial statements."
"All 
shareholders have instant access to all the information that is also 
available to financial analysts and similar parties."

"4 to 6 HGB 
Pursuant to Section 96 (2) AktG, the Supervisory Board of Conti-
nental AG as a listed stock corporation subject to the German Co-
determination Act consists of at least 30% women and at least 30% 
men."
"This minimum quota must, as a general rule, be fulfilled by 
the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"Women made up 30% of both the shareholder and employee rep-
resentatives on the Supervisory Board of Continental AG as at De-
cember 31, 2023."
"This re-
quirement was met in the fiscal year under review."
"The Supervisory 
Board continues to follow the general debate around the represen-
tation of women on executive and supervisory boards and will take 
any future regulations into account."
"In accordance with Section 76 (4) AktG, the Executive Board of 
Continental AG is required to set targets for the ratio of women in 
the first two management levels below the Executive Board and a 
deadline for achieving these targets."
"In December 2021, the Execu-
tive Board set new target quotas for women in the first two manage-
ment levels below the Executive Board at Continental AG for the 
period up until December 31, 2026: 37% for the first management 
level and 33% for the second management level."
"As at December 31, 
2023, the ratio of women was 30% in the first management level 
and 30% in the second management level."
"As a global company, Continental continues to attach high priority 
to the goal of steadily increasing the proportion of women in man-
agement positions throughout the Continental Group, above and 
beyond the legal requirements in Germany."
"Diversity concept 
Continental counts on the diversity of its employees."
"The current 
focus of its commitment to promote diversity is on internationality 
and a balanced gender ratio."
"The Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of the 
composition of the Executive Board."
"The Executive Board does the 
same when appointing people to management positions."
"As a basic 
principle, the Executive Board aims to achieve a balanced ratio of 
domestic to international managers everywhere."
"The proportion  
of local and international managers varies according to region."
"In 
2023, a total of around 49% of the Continental Group’s managers 
came from countries other than Germany (PY: around 49%)."
"Conti-
nental is also working on increasing the proportion of women in 
management positions."
"In 2023, we were able to increase this 
number to around 20% across the Continental Group (PY: 19%)."
The proportion is to be increased to 25% by 2025.
"The aim in the medium term is to use 
these measures to increase the diversity of the Executive Board 
even further."
"The Supervisory Board also pays attention to the diversity of its 
own composition."
"For the Supervisory Board, diversity refers to age, 
gender, background and professional experience, among other 
things."
"The Supervisory Board is convinced that it will achieve di-
versity in its composition in particular by fulfilling the profile of skills 
and expertise and meeting the targets for its composition."
"The following management report is a combined management report as defined in  
Section 315 (5) of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB), as the  
future opportunities and risks of the Continental Group and of the parent company,  
Continental AG, are inextricably linked."
"EBIT before amortization of intangible assets from 
purchase price allocation (PPA), changes in the scope of consolida-
tion, and special effects."
"negative goodwill, purchase price refunds) or signifi-
cant changes to the corporate structure (e.g."
"spin-off effects)  
Since it eliminates one-off effects, adjusted EBIT can also be used 
to compare operational profitability between periods."
"Adjusted EBIT as a percentage of adjusted 
sales."
"Since it eliminates one-off effects, the adjusted EBIT margin 
can also be used to compare operational profitability between peri-
ods and, by using a percentage value, to compare specific units."
"Free cash flow adjusted for acquisitions 
and divestments of companies and business operations."
"Since it 
eliminates one-off effects, adjusted free cash flow can also be used 
to compare financial strength between periods."

"Adjustments were made 
for additions in the reporting year and for disposals in the compara-
tive period of the prior year."
Continental Value Contribution (CVC).
"The absolute amount of 
additional value created."
"The delta CVC represents the change in 
absolute value creation compared with the prior year."
"The delta 
CVC allows us to monitor the extent to which operating units gen-
erate value-creating growth or employ resources more efficiently."
"The CVC is measured by subtracting the weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC) from the return on capital employed (ROCE) and 
multiplying this by the average operating assets for the fiscal year."
"The WACC calculated for the Continental Group corresponds to the 
required minimum return."
"The cost of capital is calculated as the 
weighted average ratio of the cost of equity and borrowing costs."

ties and cash flow arising from investing activities."
"Also referred to 
as cash flow before financing activities."

Automotive, Tires and ContiTech: the three 
strong pillars of the Continental Group."
"Organizational structure  
The Continental Group is divided into four group sectors: Automo-
tive, Tires, ContiTech and Contract Manufacturing."
"As of January 1, 
2024, these comprise a total of 16 business areas."
"A group sector or business area with overall responsibility for a 
business, including its results, is classified according to product  
requirements, market trends, customer groups and distribution 
channels."
"Business responsibility 
Overall responsibility for managing the company is borne by the 
Executive Board of Continental Aktiengesellschaft (AG)."
"The Auto-
motive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors are each represented  
on the Executive Board."
"They include, in particular, Finance, Con-
trolling, IT, Human Relations, Sustainability, Law and Intellectual 
Property, Internal Audit, Quality Management, and Compliance."
"The 
Group Purchasing group function is represented by the Executive 
Board member responsible for the Tires group sector."
"Customer structure 
With a 64% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – 
with the exception of the replacement business – is our most im-
portant customer group."
"This industry is particularly important for 
the growth of the Automotive group sector."
"In the Tires group sec-
tor, sales to dealers and end users represent the largest share of 
the tire-replacement business."
"In the ContiTech group sector, the 
customer base is made up of the energy, agriculture and construc-
tion industries, interior design and the automotive and replacement 
businesses."
"In the Contract Manufacturing group sector, Vitesco 
Technologies constitutes the sole customer."
"Companies and locations 
Continental AG is the parent company of the Continental Group."
"In 
addition to Continental AG, the Continental Group comprises 457 
companies, including non-controlled companies."
"The Continental 
team is made up of 202,763 employees at 505 locations for pro-
duction, research & development and administration in 56 coun-
tries and markets."
"Added to this are distribution locations, with 865 
company-owned tire outlets and a total of around 5,300 franchises 
and operations with a Continental brand presence."
"Corporate Profile 
Structure of the Continental Group 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report    Corporate Profile

The Automotive group sector offers technologies for safety, brake, 
chassis, motion and motion-control systems."
"Comprehen-
sive activities relating to vehicle connectivity, architecture and elec-
tronics, as well as high-performance computers and software solu-
tions, round off the range of products and services."
"With its premium portfolio in the car, truck, bus, two-wheel and  
specialty tire segment, the Tires group sector stands for innova-
tive solutions in tire technology."
"Intelligent products and services 
related to tires and the promotion of sustainability complete the 
portfolio."
"For specialist dealers and fleet management, Tires offers 
digital tire monitoring and tire management systems, in addition to 
other services, with the aim of keeping fleets mobile and increasing 
their efficiency."
"With its tires, Continental contributes to safe, effi-
cient and environmentally friendly mobility."
"In the reporting year, 
26% of sales in Tires related to business with vehicle manufactur-
ers, and 74% related to the tire-replacement business."
"ContiTech’s industrial growth areas are primarily in energy, 
agriculture and construction as well as interior design."
"ContiTech 
also serves the automotive and transportation industries along with 
the railway engineering sector."
"In the reporting year, 48% of sales 
in ContiTech related to business with automotive manufacturers, 
and 52% to business with other industries and in the automotive 
replacement market."
"The contract manufacturing of products by Continental companies 
for Vitesco Technologies is consolidated in the Contract Manufac-
turing group sector."
"This contract manufacturing is not intended 
to be a permanent situation; rather, the operational separation of 
production will continue to be promoted and the volume of contract 
manufacturing reduced."
"This applies particu-
larly to projects of the Automotive and ContiTech group sectors."
"In 
the Tires group sector, R&D is largely centrally organized, since prod-
uct requirements for tires are much the same across the world."
"They are adapted according to the specific requirements of each 
market."
"Continental generally invests around 7% of sales in R&D 
each year."
"For more information, see the Research and Develop-
ment section."
"Continental processes a wide range of raw materials and semi-fin-
ished products."
"The purchasing volume in the reporting year was 
€29.1 billion in total, €19.8 billion of which was for production ma-
terials."
"Electronics and electromechanical components together 
make up around 43% of the Continental Group’s purchasing vol-
ume for production materials, which are primarily used in the Auto-
motive and Contract Manufacturing group sectors, while mechani-
cal components account for around 20%."
"Natural rubber and oil-
based chemicals as well as synthetic rubber and carbon black are 
key raw materials for the Tires and ContiTech group sectors."
"The  
total purchasing volume for these materials likewise amounts to 
around 20% of the total volume for production materials."
"For more 
information, see the Development of Raw Materials Markets section 
in the economic report."
"Production and sales in the Automotive and ContiTech group sec-
tors are organized across regions."
"For the Tires group sector, econ-
omies of scale play a key role when it comes to tire manufacturing."
"Low production costs coupled with large volumes and proximity to 
our customers or high rates of regional growth constitute key suc-
cess factors."
"For this reason, manufacturing takes place at major  
locations in the dominant automotive markets, namely Europe,  
the USA and China."
"Tires are sold worldwide via our dealer network 
with tire outlets and franchises, as well as through tire trading in 
general."
"In 2023, Continental announced its updated strategy for increasing 
value creation at its Capital Market Day in December."
"This will allow 
Continental to develop into the mobility and material technology 
group for safe, smart and sustainable solutions and is based on 
three key elements: 
› 
Continental has a clear strategy to achieve its mid-term targets."
"› 
The company will invest in particular in those areas with value 
creation upside and continuously expand its technology position 
in areas where it can expect to gain an edge over the competition."
"› 
The Automotive, Tires and ContiTech group sectors make up a 
balanced and resilient portfolio."
"These elements build upon the three strategic pillars introduced  
by Continental in 2020 in response to the transformation in the 
mobility industry and to pave the way for profitable growth."
"Its 
overall organizational structure and management processes were 
realigned to turn the transformation in the mobility industry into  
an opportunity."
"› 
Strengthening operational performance  
By strengthening its operational performance, Continental can 
ensure its future viability and competitiveness."
"The company is 
aligning its cost structure to global market conditions."
"› 
Differentiating the portfolio 
Continental continues to pursue the targeted differentiation of its 
product portfolio with a focus on growth and value."
"› 
Turning change into opportunity 
Continental’s comprehensive organizational structure helps it to 
seize market opportunities and translate them into profit even 
more quickly."
"Transparent structures and a high level of auton-
omy make the company more flexible in an increasingly complex 
market environment."
"Continental’s strategic goals are based on its vision:  
 
CREATING VALUE FOR A BETTER TOMORROW."
"POWERED BY THE  
PASSION OF OUR PEOPLE."
"“CREATING VALUE”: Continental aims to create value in everything 
it does."
"This can be financial value for its shareholders as well as 
value for its customers, its employees and the social environment 
in which it operates."
"“A BETTER TOMORROW”: With its products and services, Conti-
nental contributes to making the world a little better."
"It develops 
and produces the mobility of tomorrow in a way that is more con-
venient and comfortable, safer and more sustainable."
"At the same 
time, “a better tomorrow” means acting now and not in the distant 
future."
"YOUR SOLUTIONS”: Continental is a tech-
nology company and believes that it will only be able to tackle the 
challenges of our time by rapidly developing the right technologies."
"Continental’s technology should help its customers make their 
products even better and more useful."
"Because Continental is  
customer-focused in everything it does."
"“POWERED BY THE PASSION OF OUR PEOPLE”: Continental 
stands for a certain culture."
A culture of mutual respect.
"A culture 
of togetherness."
And a culture of passion.
"Automotive: focus on value-creating business areas with high 
growth 
In the Automotive group sector, Continental will step up its focus 
on value-creating business areas with high growth."
"With its updated 
strategy, the group sector aims to increase its long-term profitability 
and competitiveness."
"The strategy is geared toward achieving a 
leading market position in all business areas and becoming the  
preferred system integrator for software-defined vehicles."
"The group sector decided on a number of measures in 2023, in-
cluding making the User Experience business area organizationally 
independent, which will open up new strategic options for this busi-
ness."
"With sales of €3.5 billion in 2023 and a total order volume of 
more than €7 billion (production launch after 2022), User Experi-
ence is among the market leaders in display solutions, head-up  
displays and digital instrument clusters."
"The Automotive group sector is also reviewing further business ac-
tivities that contributed around €1.4 billion to consolidated sales in 
fiscal 2023."
"A review is therefore being carried out with a view to 
improving performance or selling or discontinuing these business 
activities."
"Continental is aiming for above-average growth of 3% to 5% in the 
Automotive group sector compared with the market environment."
"This is to be achieved by improving the group sector’s market share 
– in particular among Asian automotive manufacturers, which are 
growing at a disproportionate rate – increasing value creation per 
vehicle and adjusting prices."
"In addition, Continental has taken vari-
ous measures to optimize operational costs and cash inflow."
"These 
include increasing efficiency in the manufacture of electronic com-
ponents, reducing freight costs and optimizing inventory turnover."
"Strategy of the Continental Group

Independently of this, Automotive is aiming to reduce costs signifi-
cantly by €400 million per year from 2025."
"Administrative struc-
tures, interfaces, hierarchy levels and complexity will be reduced, 
for example, and decision-making structures and processes simpli-
fied."
"Automotive is also planning to further optimize its use of re-
search and development resources."
"The group sector is therefore 
aiming to reduce net research and development expenses in the 
short term to around 11% of sales (2023: 11.8%)."
"In the medium 
term, the share is expected to be less than 10%."
"This will be achieved 
by consolidating its approximately 80 development locations world-
wide, for example."
"Tires: premium tires will continue to create opportunities for 
profitable growth 
In the Tires group sector, Continental will continue to rely on stable 
earnings and operational excellence."
"Sustainability, electric mobility 
and digital tire services will also create various opportunities for fur-
ther profitable growth and exceptional value creation."
"Over the past 
five years, Tires has increased its sales by an average of 4.3% annu-
ally."
"The basis for the group sector’s commercial success is its oper-
ational efficiency."
"Capacity and modern production technologies 
are continually adapted to changing market requirements."
"This en-
ables Tires to benefit from major economies of scale and scope, 
with more than 80% of its global production capacity bundled in 
so-called megafactories."
"Continental already offers its most sustainable passenger car tire 
on the market as a production tire and is growing strongly in the 
area of data-based tire services."
"In total, it has more than 500 origi-
nal equipment approvals for supplying fully electric models from 
automotive manufacturers worldwide, including the 10 highest-
volume manufacturers of fully electric cars."
"The Tires group sector sees strong growth potential in the Asia-
Pacific region as well as North and South America."
"Based on its 
strategy of being in the market for the market, production capacity 
will therefore be expanded in these regions."
"The recovery of the 
current weak demand, particularly in the European tire-replace-
ment business, continuous increases in efficiency, the ongoing 
trend worldwide toward larger and higher-performing tires as well 
as high cost discipline will form the basis for sales and margin in-
creases."
"ContiTech: group sector to strengthen strategic focus on 
industrial business 
In its ContiTech group sector, Continental will focus on reliable prof-
itability thanks to material solutions made from rubber and plastics."
"At the same time, the group sector will strengthen its strategic fo-
cus on the industrial business and plans to increase the share of 
sales accounted for by the industrial business from 52% currently 
to 60% in the medium term."
"ContiTech’s ambition is to achieve an 
industrial share of sales of around 80%."
"This is to be achieved or-
ganically through greater market development and an expanded 
product portfolio, as well as inorganically through investments and 
divestments."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile 
33 
 
ContiTech’s industrial growth areas are primarily in energy, agricul-
ture and construction as well as interior design."
"These industrial 
fields place high demands on materials and products, for which the 
group sector is well positioned thanks to its high level of materials 
expertise, including for hoses, belts, conveyor belts and surfaces,  
as well as its diverse product portfolio."
"As already announced, the Original Equipment Solutions (OESL) 
business area – comprising the automotive business of ContiTech, 
with the exception of surface materials – will also become organiza-
tionally independent."
"OESL is expected to become fully independ-
ent in 2025."
"All strategic options will be reviewed as part of this 
process."
"The target for its adjusted EBIT margin is more 
than 8% in the short term and around 8% to 11% in the medium 
term."
"The cash conversion ratio is expected to exceed 70% in the 
short and medium term."
"› 
For the Automotive group sector, Continental expects sales of 
around €22 billion to €24 billion in the short term and around 
€26 billion to €29 billion in the medium term."
"The adjusted EBIT 
margin is expected to exceed 6% in the short term and to be 
around 6% to 8% in the medium term."
"Additionally, it aims to 
achieve a return on capital employed (ROCE) of more than 15% 
in the short term and more than 20% in the medium term."
"› 
For the Tires group sector, Continental expects sales of around 
€15 billion to €16 billion in the short term and around €17 billion 
to €18 billion in the medium term."
"The adjusted EBIT margin is 
expected to exceed 13% in the short term and to be around 13% 
to 16% in the medium term."
"It aims to achieve an ROCE of more 
than 20% in the short term and more than 23% in the medium 
term."
"› 
For the ContiTech group sector, Continental expects sales of 
around €7 billion to €8 billion in the short term and around 
€8 billion to €9 billion in the medium term."
"The adjusted EBIT 
margin is expected to exceed 9% in the short term and to be 
around 9% to 11% in the medium term, assuming that the share 
of the industrial business is around 60%."
"It aims to achieve an 
ROCE of more than 20% in the short term and more than 22%  
in the medium term."
"Increase in value creation 
We are confident that our strategic setup, with the three group sec-
tors mentioned above, is our path to long-term success."
"The three 
group sectors make up a balanced and resilient portfolio."
"Our busi-
ness activities continue to be independent when necessary and 
united where purposeful."
"Together with the group functions, Auto-
motive, Tires and ContiTech make up the mobility and material 
technology group for safe, smart and sustainable solutions."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile

The goal is the sustained increase in the 
Continental Group’s value."
"Value management  
Value management at Continental is focused on value creation 
through profitable sales growth."
"Key financial performance indica-
tors are sales, the adjusted EBIT margin, capital expenditure, ad-
justed free cash flow and capital employed."
"For management pur-
poses and to map interdependencies, we use key figures based on 
these financial performance indicators as part of a value-driver sys-
tem."
"Our mid-term corporate objectives center on the sustainable 
enhancement of the value of each individual operating unit."
"This 
goal is achieved by generating a positive return on the capital 
employed that sustainably exceeds the associated equity and debt 
financing costs within each individual unit."
"Crucial to this is that the 
absolute contribution to value (the Continental Value Contribution 
(CVC)) increases year-on-year."
"This can be achieved by increasing 
the return on capital employed (with the costs of capital remaining 
constant), lowering the costs of capital (while maintaining the return 
on capital employed) or decreasing capital employed over time."
"The performance indicators used are earnings before income and 
tax (EBIT), capital employed and the weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC), which is calculated from the proportional weight 
of equity and debt costs."
"For 2021, the figures for continuing operations are shown."
"EBIT is the net total of sales, other income and expenses plus in-
come from equity-accounted investees and from investments but 
before financial result and income tax expense."
"In the year under 
review, EBIT for the Continental Group was €1.9 billion."
"Capital employed is the funds used by the company to generate its 
sales."
"At Continental, this figure is calculated as the average of oper-
ating assets as at the end of the quarterly reporting periods."
"In 
2023, average operating assets amounted to €20.7 billion."
"The return on capital employed (ROCE) represents the ratio of 
these two calculated values."
"Comparing a figure from the state-
ment of income (EBIT) with one from the statement of financial  
position (capital employed) produces an integral analysis."
"We deal 
with the problem of the different periods of analysis by calculating 
the capital employed as an average figure over the ends of quar-
terly reporting periods."
The ROCE amounted to 8.9% in 2023.
"The WACC is calculated to determine the cost of financing the capi-
tal employed."
"Equity costs are based on the return from a risk-free 
alternative investment plus a market risk premium, taking into ac-
count Continental’s specific risk."
"Borrowing costs are calculated 
based on Continental’s weighted debt-capital cost rate."
"Based on 
the long-term average, the cost of capital for our company is about 
10%."
Value is added if the ROCE exceeds the WACC.
"We call this value 
added, produced by subtracting the WACC from the ROCE multi-
plied by average operating assets, the Continental Value Contribu-
tion (CVC)."
"In 2023, the CVC amounted to -€217.6 million."
"The Finance & Treasury group function provides the necessary  
financial framework to finance corporate growth and secure the 
long-term existence of the company."
"The company's annual invest-
ment requirements are likely to continue to range from 6% to 7%  
of sales in the coming years."
"Other investment projects, such as major ac-
quisitions, should be financed from a balanced mix of equity and 
debt depending on the ratio of net indebtedness to equity (gearing 
ratio) and the liquidity situation to achieve constant improvement 
in the respective capital market environment."
"In general, the gear-
ing ratio should be below 40% in the coming years."
"If justified by 
extraordinary financing reasons or specific market circumstances, 
we can rise above this ratio under certain conditions."
"The equity  
ratio should exceed 30%."
"In the reporting year, the equity ratio  
was 37.4% and the gearing ratio 28.6%."
"Gross indebtedness amounted to €7,170.3 million as at Decem-
ber 31, 2023."
"Key financing instruments are the syndicated loan 
with a revolving credit line of €4.0 billion that has been granted un-
til December 2026, and bonds issued on the capital market."
"Our 
gross indebtedness should be a balanced mix of liabilities to banks 
and other sources of financing on the capital market."
"For short-
term financing in particular, we use a wide range of financing in-
struments."
"As at the end of 2023, this mix consisted of bonds 
(55%), a syndicated loan (4%), other bank liabilities (15%) and other 
indebtedness (25%) based on gross indebtedness."
"The syndicated 
loan that was renewed ahead of schedule in December 2019 con-
sists of a revolving tranche of €4.0 billion and has an original term 
of five years."
"The margin for the loan will also depend on the Conti-
nental Group’s sustainability performance."
"If the Continental Group 
achieves the performance improvements in sustainability as set out 
in detail in the loan agreement, this will reduce the margin; non-
achievement will result in a margin increase."
"Continental has exer-
cised two options, each extending the term of the loan by one year."
"This ensures the financing commitment of the banks until Decem-
ber 2026."
"The company strives to have at its disposal unrestricted liquidity of 
about €1.5 billion."
"This is supplemented by committed, unutilized 
credit lines from banks in order to cover liquidity requirements at 
all times."
"These requirements fluctuate during a calendar year 
owing in particular to the seasonal nature of some business areas."
"In addition, the amount of liquidity required is also influenced by 
corporate growth."
"Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents amounted 
to €2,683.4 million as at December 31, 2023."
"There were also 
committed and unutilized credit lines of €4,569.1 million."
"As at December 31, 2023, €316.3 million of the revolving credit 
line of €4.0 billion had been utilized."
"Around 55% of gross indebt-
edness is financed on the capital market in the form of bonds."
"The 
interest coupons vary between 0.231% and 4.000% p.a."
"In 2023, 
Continental redeemed two maturing bonds in the amounts of 
€500.0 million and €750.0 million."
"In conjunction with this, and in 
order to optimize the maturity profile of its indebtedness, Continen-
tal issued two new bonds in June and August 2023."
"One bond with 
a volume of €750.0 million and a term of five years and a second 
bond with a volume of €500.0 million and a term of three and a 
half years were placed with investors."
"Both bonds have an interest 
rate of 4.000% p.a."
"In addition to the forms of financing already 
mentioned, there were also bilateral credit lines with various banks 
in the amount of €1,982.0 million as at December 31, 2023."
"Conti-
nental’s corporate financing instruments currently also include sale-
of-receivables programs and commercial paper programs."
"As in the 
previous year, Continental had two commercial paper programs in 
Germany and the USA in 2023."
"Neither of these two programs had 
been utilized as at the end of 2023."
"Maturity profile 
Continental strives for a balanced maturity profile, particularly with 
respect to its capital market liabilities, in order to be able to repay 
the amounts due each year from free cash flow as far as possible."
"Aside from short-term indebtedness, most of which can be rolled 
on to the next year, two bonds in the amounts of €625.0 million 
and €100.0 million, respectively, will mature in 2024."
"The other 
bonds issued in the period from 2019 to 2023 require repayments 
of €600.0 million in 2025, €750.0 million in 2026, €1,125.0 million 
in 2027 and €750.0 million in 2028."
"The rating 
outlook from Standard & Poor's improved in March 2023 from  
negative to stable."
"The most recent rating adjustment took place  
in spring 2020, when all three rating agencies adjusted their long-
term credit rating downward by one notch."
"Our goal remains a 
credit rating of BBB/BBB+."
"2 Contracted rating since November 7, 2013."
"3 Contracted rating since January 1, 2019."

"A large number of new cars worldwide 
are already fitted with hardware and software solutions from Conti-
nental – ensuring safety, convenience and sustainability."
"Continental and Aurora partnership for commercially scalable 
autonomous trucking systems 
The technology companies Continental and Aurora entered into an 
exclusive partnership in April 2023."
"Together, they will deliver the 
first commercially scalable generation of Aurora’s integrated hard-
ware and software system – the Aurora Driver – in the USA."
"The 
SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Level 4 system will be avail-
able to carriers and commercial fleet operators across the USA to 
help reduce costs to facilitate broader adoption."
"Production is set  
to commence in 2027."
"In order to industrialize the Aurora Driver, Continental will bring its 
decades of experience in the field of system development for safe 
and reliable vehicle solutions to the partnership."
"Continental will 
contribute not only the entire hardware system, but also a new 
fallback system."
"This ensures, in the unlikely event of a malfunction 
of the autonomous primary system, that the driverless truck’s 
fallback system will safely take over and safely drive to the nearest 
safe location."
"In addition, Continental will take care of the entire 
life cycle of the supplied autonomous hardware solutions for the 
Aurora Driver, from the production line all the way through to  
decommissioning."
"Continental and Google Cloud equip cars with generative 
artificial intelligence (AI) 
Continental announced a partnership with Google Cloud at IAA  
Mobility in September 2023."
"Together, the two companies will 
equip cars with artificial intelligence (AI), making Continental one 
of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabili-
ties directly into vehicle computers – allowing drivers quite literally 
to “talk” with their vehicles."
"No matter if drivers, for example, need 
helping find the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or 
want to know more about local places of interest at their destina-
tion or along their route, the generative AI gathers the required in-
formation and answers the driver’s questions."
"The two companies 
each bring their respective expertise to the partnership, namely in 
automotive, software, artificial intelligence and cloud computing."
"With this technology, Continental is offering yet another building 
block from the road to the cloud and expanding the instrumenta-
tion, entertainment and driver assistance functions already inte-
grated into its high-performance computer for smart cockpits 
(Smart Cockpit HPC)."
"This, in turn, cuts the development time and 
effort, complexity and cost for automotive manufacturers."
"The 
Smart Cockpit HPC combines user experience and system perfor-
mance, while meeting customer requirements for typical cockpit 
designs featuring driver and center displays."
"The pre-integrated 
functionality reduces costs, which ultimately results in fast time  
to market – from order to start of production in just 18 months."
"Continental and Synopsys accelerate software development 
Continental and Synopsys are accelerating the development and 
validation of software features and applications for the software-
defined vehicle."
"The companies have teamed up to develop ad-
vanced virtual prototyping solutions for virtual electronic control 
units (vECUs), combining the virtual prototyping of Synopsys with 
Continental’s cloud-based development framework, Automotive 
Edge (CAEdge)."
"The result is a digital twin that helps automotive 
manufacturers simplify software development and get their prod-
uct to market faster."

"Continental starts production of its most sustainable tire to 
date and presents concept tire Conti CityPlus 
In mid-2023, Continental started production of the UltraContact 
NXT, its most sustainable production tire to date, at its plant in 
Lousado, Portugal."
"Comprising up to 65% renewable, recycled and 
mass balance-certified materials, the tire combines a high share of 
sustainable materials with maximum safety and performance."
"All 
sizes have the highest possible rating (“A”) of the EU tire label in 
terms of rolling resistance, wet braking and exterior noise."
"Continental unveiled its new Conti CityPlus concept tire at IAA  
Mobility in Munich in September 2023."
"The new tire technology  
reduces energy consumption by up to 10%, meaning lower CO2 
emissions for cars with combustion engines and longer ranges for 
electric vehicles."
"This is achieved by optimizing tire behavior during 
stop-and-go urban traffic, which can extend a car’s range by up to 
3%."
"This corresponds to a saving of 0.6 kWh per 100 kilometers for 
electric vehicles."
"All passenger car 
tires of the Continental brand meet the requirements of electric ve-
hicles, while at the same time they are able to sustainably reduce 
the emissions of combustion engine vehicles."
"This strategy is pay-
ing off, with the 10 highest-volume manufacturers of fully electric 
cars currently putting their trust in Continental’s technological ex-
pertise for their original equipment."
"Since last year, Chinese vehicle 
manufacturer BYD has been equipping its Seal electric sedan for 
the Chinese market with the Continental SportContact 7 and factory-
fitting it with the Continental EcoContact 6 Q for global export."
"Continental is the preferred tire partner of Mercedes-Benz in the 
Asia-Pacific region, comprising China, Australia, Malaysia and Indo-
nesia."
"On top of this, the existing partnership in India has been  
extended."
"Tires bearing the label “MO” (“Mercedes-Benz Original”) on the side-
wall mean that they have been specially approved by Mercedes-
Benz and meet strict requirements and standards."
"They are tailored 
specifically to the respective Mercedes-Benz vehicle model."
"Conti-
nental has fitted the automotive manufacturer’s entire portfolio 
with its tires, from the A-Class to the GLS-Class."
"In Europe and in the 
Asia-Pacific region, these include the SportContact, EcoContact and 
PremiumContact tire lines."
"In the Americas region, most notably in 
the USA and Canada, they also include the ProContact range."
"Continental enables digital tire monitoring in real time 
Since 2023, Continental has been offering an entry-level solution 
that streamlines the process for outfitting fleets with digital tire 
management."
"The new valve cap sensor supplies data on the con-
dition of a vehicle’s tires, independent of the manufacturer, in a way 
that is straightforward, saves time and makes sure tires are running 
at their optimum performance."
"This results in greater fuel efficiency 
and longer tire life."
"In addition, the new sensor bolsters Continen-
tal’s “Lowest Overall Driving Costs“ (LODC) concept, through which 
Continental helps fleet operators manage their fleets more safely, 
sustainably and cost-efficiently."
"The valve cap sensor is screwed directly onto a bus, truck or 
trailer’s tire valve, from where it measures the tire pressure in real 
time."
"The sensor is compatible with commercial-vehicle tires of all 
established manufacturers and autonomously links up to ContiCon-
nect receiver units."
"Deviations from the target condition are rec-
orded via the tire management platform of the same name and for-
warded to users."
"A QR code on the valve cap sensor makes it easy 
to assign the sensor to the respective tire position, meaning there is 
no need for a special reader to determine the position; instead, this 
is done via a mobile device using the ContiConnect on-site app."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Corporate Profile 
39 
 
Continental also supplies relevant tire data in real time for the digi-
tal tire monitoring of truck trailers."
"New telematics units mean that 
tire data from truck trailers can continue to be received and deliv-
ered to the ContiConnect 2.0 tire management system even when 
parked, whereas before this was only possible while driving."
"Thanks 
to digital tire control, information on the trailer tires’ fill level and 
temperature can be consulted at any time."
"An integrated battery 
ensures daily measurement values can be sent for up to 28 days 
without an external power source."
"In this way, ContiConnect Live 
helps to reduce tire-related downtime."
"Tires can be maintained 
more proactively, keeping vehicles in roadworthy condition."
"On top 
of this, real-time status updates and warning signals increase effi-
ciency and reduce labor and maintenance costs."
"ContiConnect Live 
additionally offers track-and-trace functionality using GPS data that 
shows the precise location of vehicles in the system at all times."
"Since July 2023, digital tire monitoring has also been available for 
free-standing truck trailers in multiple markets worldwide."
"Continental to start testing tires for customers in a driving 
simulator 
In November 2023, Continental commissioned its new driving  
simulator for tires, which effective immediately will be used for 
new developments and advancements, especially in the tire origi-
nal equipment business."
"This was preceded by an intensive trial 
phase spanning approximately 12 months."
"Virtual tests save raw 
materials and shorten the development time for tires."
"The high-tech 
system, known as a driver-in-the-loop (DIL) simulator, calculates the 
exact driving dynamics parameters of the tires and the respective 
test vehicle."
"The simulator is highly flexible and can give Continen-
tal’s test drivers subjective driving impressions that are comparable 
with those gained from tire tests on a real test track."
"The simulator can test tires for all vehicle and drive system variants, 
for both passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for electric and 
hybrid vehicles and for vehicles with combustion engines."
"The deci-
sive advantage is that the tire parameters can be adjusted digitally 
at any time, meaning test drives can be repeated at short intervals 
and subjective driving impressions compared directly with one an-
other."
"Equipped with a large motion platform (four meters long, five 
meters wide) and a maximum acceleration of 12 meters per sec-
ond, test drivers experience all six degrees of freedom – just like in 
a real vehicle on a physical test track."
"These include longitudinal 
and lateral movements, the stroke movement and the yaw, pitch 
and roll of a vehicle."
"Continental presents the vehicle interior of the future with its 
sustainable SPACE D design concept 
With its new SPACE D concept, Continental gives a glimpse into  
the future of vehicle interior design, one that is shaped by electric 
mobility and autonomous driving."
"Continental is bringing the living 
room to the automotive interior, while placing the focus firmly on 
comfort, convenience and sustainability."
"Many of the applied surface solutions have been engineered in line 
with the three defined pillars of sustainability – economy, ecology 
and social responsibility."
"Up close, the individual surfaces of SPACE 
D really catch the eye."
"Continental opens TechCenter for hydrogen technologies in 
Hamburg 
In July 2023, Continental opened a new TechCenter for hydrogen

Responsibilities  
Within the Executive Board, the Executive Board member for Group 
Human Relations (director of Labor Relations) and Group Sustaina-
bility is responsible for sustainability."
"Sustainability management 
within the Continental Group is regulated by a dedicated internal 
sustainability policy."
"The Group Sustainability group function is further supplemented 
by sustainability functions in the group sectors as well as coordina-
tors in several business areas and countries."
"The sustainability func-
tions in the group sectors and in the Continental Group were fur-
ther expanded and strengthened over the course of 2023."
"The 
Group Sustainability Steering Committee is responsible for assessing 
interdepartmental issues, weighing up opportunities and risks and 
discussing relevant Executive Board decisions in advance."
"In fiscal 
2023, it consisted of the entire Executive Board, the heads of the

nually by the Group Sustainability Steering Committee on behalf  
of the Executive Board."
"The scorecard is based on defined quality 
criteria for the indicators, is continuously developed further and  
establishes the formal basis for integrating sustainability into other 
corporate processes."
"The topic of sustainability is also an integral part of the Continental 
Group’s strategy development."
"Significant investments must be  
reviewed and assessed as to their contribution to sustainability as  
a standard part of the approval process."
"For the Automotive, Tires 
and ContiTech group sectors, detailed roadmaps for the implemen-
tation of sustainability ambitions in the relevant topic areas are un-
der development."
"Remuneration  
The Executive Board, senior executives and executives worldwide 
are measured against the achievement of sustainability goals."
"Long-term remuneration components (long-term incentive – LTI) 
are thus also linked to sustainability aspects."
"The LTI plans are up-
dated on an annual basis."
"For more information, see the remunera-
tion report on our website under  Company/Executive Board."
"Cultural Change 
To continue to support cultural change in the organization, we 
stepped up internal communication with respect to sustainability in 
fiscal 2023, held numerous events and further integrated the topic 
into key internal event formats for managers."
"These events included 
the Global Sustainability Conference held in Hanover in 2023, which 
was attended by Continental employees from around the world as 
well as invited guests from outside the company."
"Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and 
speed of transformation of our customers, industries and markets 
as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks."
"Concept 
We have set ourselves the corporate target of achieving carbon 
neutrality throughout our production processes."
"In terms of Scope 
1 and market-based Scope 2 CO2 emissions in accordance with the 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, we aim to be carbon-neutral by 
2040 (2040 climate goal)."
"The corporate target of carbon neutrality throughout our produc-
tion processes is managed by the Group Environmental and Climate 
Protection group function as part of the corporate roadmap for de-
carbonization."
"The group sectors are each responsible for the im-
plementation of appropriate programs and must report on this in-
ternally on a regular basis."
"Together with the group sectors, the “Decarbonization Roadmap 
2040” group project team has set clear interim targets for each 
group sector and defined two key steps: 
› 
100% procurement of electricity from renewable sources (Scope 
2), which has already been implemented since 2020."
"This represents a 
further reduction of more than 20% compared with 2023."
"Continental has introduced an internal CO2 pricing system for deci-
sions regarding investments that affect Scope 1 and Scope 2 emis-
sions."
"This shadow price has been set on the basis of current and 
projected future market prices for CO2 and a comparison with 
other prices."
It is reviewed on a regular basis.
"The goal of this 
mechanism is to support the group sectors in achieving their CO2 
reduction targets and further improve our environmental perfor-
mance."
"The shadow price applies worldwide to the entire Continen-
tal Group."
"Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 CO2 emissions have 
also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive 
Board and global managers since fiscal 2020."
"For more information, 
see the remuneration report on our website under  Company/Ex-
ecutive Board."
"In terms of Scope 3 CO2 emissions in accordance with the GHG 
Protocol, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest 
in line with our sustainability ambition."
"To this end, we have identi-
fied various levers throughout the value chain."
"These relate to the 
use phase of our products, coupled with the global shift toward 
emission-free mobility and industry; product design and the con-
version of materials used to renewable and recycled materials; as 
well as a general transition to circular processes."
"For more information on our concepts in this respect, see the sec-
tions on emission-free mobility and industry and circular economy 
in this combined non-financial statement."
"It will also be necessary to increase the use of green electricity 
along the supply chain."
"The Business Partner Code of Conduct was 
expanded accordingly with a view to carbon neutrality in 2021 and  
reviewed in fiscal 2023."
"The implementation of carbon neutrality 
throughout the value chain is managed in the individual group sec-
tors, each of which is responsible for taking appropriate measures."
"In addition, achieving carbon neutrality throughout our value chains 
requires joint sustainability efforts with customers, suppliers and 
other partners."
"The Continental Group’s 2040 climate goal and ambition for 2050 
were reviewed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 
2020."
"On the basis of the method used, the linear derivations for 
2030 were validated and confirmed as being compliant with the 
Paris climate agreement."
"The derived absolute emission reductions 
for Scope 1 and Scope 2 are set to keep us on track for the 1.5°C 
pathway."
"With Net|Zero|Now – our immediate action program for climate 
change mitigation – we also offer customers and the Continental 
group sectors an additional building block to support their individ-
ual climate strategies."
"The program is offered for the business with 
emission-free and combustion-engine vehicles as well as the indus-
trial business, and is also used internally, for example, at events."
"Continental is working with partners on certified ecosystem resto-
ration, especially on reforestation projects, to remove CO2 from the 
atmosphere and ease the global CO2 budget by means of negative 
emissions."
"To this end, Continental has defined its own quality crite-
ria, beyond the requirements for the respective register."
"The de-
fined CO2 removals are calculated individually within the group sec-
tors."
"The amount of negative emissions used under Net|Zero|Now 
is determined and documented accordingly within the group sec-
tors."
Continental has purchased a quota of certified projects.
"Appro-
priate certificates are issued to Continental in stages and subse-
quently deleted from the register."
"These are calculated as the sum of Scope 1 and market-
based Scope 2 CO2 emissions."
"The decrease in direct CO2 emis-
sions (Scope 1) in fiscal 2023 is attributable, among other things, 
to energy efficiency and substitution measures aimed at reducing 
fossil fuel consumption and to some degree also to a decline in 
production volumes."
"CO2 emissions here correspond to CO2 equiv-
alents (CO2e)."
"Following the switch to green electricity for reported energy con-
sumption in fiscal 2020, Continental’s total CO2 emissions (Scopes 
1 and 2) have been reduced by 70% compared with fiscal 2019,  
as this green electricity produces no CO2 emissions."
"Appropriate 
green energy attribute certificates were purchased for the full vol-
ume of reported purchased electricity not already covered by other 
instruments (such as green electricity contracts, power purchase 
agreements or self-generated electricity from renewable sources)."
"Due to national register processes, not all deletions of energy attrib-
ute certificates were available for small residual quantities at the 
time the report was prepared."
"The reported market-based Scope 2 
emissions were as a result of purchased steam and district heating."
"Scope 1 includes emissions from 
the burning of fossil fuels as part of Continental’s own processes, and Scope 2 
includes emissions from purchased electricity, steam and heat."
"CO2 emission factors 
correspond to CO2 equivalents (CO2e)."
"2 Contains a small amount of imputed data for parts of the Continental Group that did 
not report data directly."
3 Excluding emissions from refrigerants.
4 Calculated using the market-based calculation method of the GHG Protocol.
"Where 
contract-specific emission factors were not available, the standard emission factors 
from Defra (September 2023) were used."
"5 The location-based calculation method of the GHG Protocol (without taking green 
electricity into account) produces a value of 1.46 million metric tons of CO2 for 
Scope 2 emissions."
"Negative emissions were used again within the Net|Zero|Now pro-
gram in 2023."
"Their volume declined to 1.6 thousand metric tons 
of CO2 in the reporting year (PY: 27.6 thousand metric tons of CO2) 
in the wake of significantly lower demand."
"The negative CO2 emis-
sions used took the form of voluntary carbon credits."
"These certifi-
cates were obtained solely from reforestation and afforestation pro-
jects and in fiscal 2023 and in previous years were deleted exclu-
sively for Continental in the Gold Standard, VCS, American Carbon 
Registry and Climate Action Reserve registries."
"In February 2024, global non-profit organization CDP (formerly  
operating as the Carbon Disclosure Project) raised Continental’s  
climate change mitigation rating from A- to A based on its reported 
data."
"For more information on carbon neutrality, including reporting on 
indirect CO2 emissions along the value chain (Scope 3 of the GHG 
Protocol), see the integrated sustainability report on our website at

"Emission-free Mobility and Industry 
Our ambition  
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we strive for 100% emis-
sion-free mobility and industry by 2050 at the latest, together with 
our partners along the value chain."
"“Emission-free” refers to zero 
emissions of greenhouse gases and nitrogen oxides (NOx), for ex-
ample."
"It does not include harmless emissions such as steam, non-
toxic, biodegradable particle emissions or minimal noise emissions."
"Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and 
speed of transformation of our customers, industries and markets 
as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks."
"Concept 
Continental is shaping the transformation toward emission-free mo-
bility and industry with customer-oriented solutions, such as for 
electric mobility, emission-free railway engineering, bicycles and 
wind turbines."
"In doing so, we rely both on new product develop-
ments and on the further development of our existing product port-
folio."
"Components, software and products from Continental can be 
found in a wide range of electric vehicles, for example – from tires 
to high-performance computers and interior surfaces."
"For current 
examples of innovative products and systems from Continental, 
see the Research and Development section of this annual report."
"The respective group sectors and business areas are responsible 
for implementing this sustainability ambition, particularly with re-
gard to portfolio development, product strategies and business 
models, and are supported by the group functions of the Continen-
tal Group."
"To this end, relevant aspects have been and will continue 
to be incorporated in portfolio analyses, and are included in the 
strategy and business development processes for the group sec-
tors and business areas."
"For the implementation of our concept with respect to emission-
free mobility and industry, we record our allocated business with 
zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles as a performance indicator."
"Clearly 
allocated sales are recorded."
"In terms of vehicles, these include 
sales of tires, displays, sensors, electronic control units, artificial 
leather and hoses for emission-free passenger cars and trucks,  
as well as air springs for emission-free trains and trams."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability and Combined Non-Financial Statement 
46 
 
In fiscal 2022, Continental reported the performance indicator of 
allocated low-carbon business beyond business with zero-tailpipe-
emission vehicles."
"The highest share of this indicator was accounted 
for by the replacement business with highly efficient tires with low 
rolling resistance."
"In view of the ongoing uncertainty about how tires 
and various industrial businesses can be classified as low-carbon 
business under the various regulations (e.g."
"EU Taxonomy), Conti-
nental decided to discontinue reporting on allocated low-carbon 
business beyond business with zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles in 
fiscal 2023 and to develop a new reporting approach going forward."
"Results of the concept 
In fiscal 2023, the allocated business with zero-tailpipe-emission  
vehicles amounted to €2,244 million (PY: €1,657 million)."
"The year-
on-year growth is attributable in particular to the growing market 
success of electric mobility, since Continental’s products can now 
be found in many mass-produced models."
"2 The business can be allocated via the vehicle manufacturer, the vehicle platform or 
the product specification, for example."
"The data includes both pure business and 
attributable business, such as in the case of combined vehicle platforms."
"For the 
Tires, ContiTech and Contract Manufacturing group sectors, the sales reported at the 
end of the year were included."
"For more information on emission-free mobility and industry, see 
the integrated sustainability report on our website at  www.conti-
nental-sustainability.com."
"Circular Economy 
Our ambition 
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we strive for 100% closed 
resource and product cycles by 2050 at the latest, together with 
our partners along the value chain."
"Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and 
speed of transformation of our customers, industries and markets 
as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks."
"Concept 
The switch to a circular economy is a profound and complex trans-
formation process for Continental, which at the same time is highly 
relevant for the achievement of other topic areas of the company’s 
sustainability ambition."
"The group sectors are responsible for im-
plementing circularity, in particular with respect to product design, 
business models, material use and material procurement."
"They 
have each started to design and/or implement specific initiatives 
and projects that are aimed at improving the use of product-re-
lated, technological and biological cycles."
"In addition, work is con-
tinuously being done on the durability, recyclability and adaptability 
of products."
"To cite some examples:  
› 
In the reporting year, the Automotive group sector become a 
partner of the international CIRC-UITS project (Circular Integration 
of independent Reverse supply Chains for the smart reUse of In-
dusTrially relevant Semiconductors)."
"› 
Together with partner Pyrum Innovations, the Tires group sector 
is currently developing various processes to further optimize and 
expand the recycling of scrap tires through pyrolysis."
"Since Sep-
tember 2023, the carbon black recovered in this process has 
been used at the Korbach tire plant for solid tires fitted primarily 
on forklift trucks."
"It is also set to be used in more and more of 
Continental’s rubber compounds in the future."
"› 
The ContiTech group sector has launched skai rPET PureLux, a 
plain-colored furniture film made from 100% recycled PET poly-
mer, which conserves natural resources."
"For more information, see the respective press release on our  
website under  Press."
"With regard to operational waste management, as a further key 
component of the circular economy, we have set ourselves the cor-
porate target of increasing the waste for recovery quota to 95% by 
2030."
"Waste for recovery includes material recycling, thermal re-
covery or any other form of recycling or reuse."
"This objective gives 
priority to recycling over disposal."
"The implementation of the cor-
porate target is managed by Group Environmental and Climate  
Protection as part of operational environmental management."
"For more information on the organization of operational environ-
mental management, see the section on green and safe factories  
in this combined non-financial statement."
"The waste for recovery 
quota has also been part of the LTI plans for the members of the 
Executive Board and global managers since fiscal 2020."
"For more 
information, see the remuneration report on our website  under 
Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Sustainability and Combined Non-Financial Statement

Results of the concept 
The waste for recovery quota was at 87% in fiscal 2023 (PY: 85%)."
"This was mainly due to the successful implementation of local pro-
jects as well as to market conditions, which allowed for increased 
waste recovery."

"Responsible Value Chain 
Our ambition 
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we strive for 100% respon-
sible sourcing and business partnerships by 2050 at the latest, to-
gether with our partners along the value chain."
"Our understanding of a responsible value chain thus refers to our 
supply chain and customer relationships and to our own locations."
"Of central importance for our ambition are the requirements and 
speed of transformation of our customers, industries and markets 
as well as the resulting transformation opportunities and risks."
"Concept 
Continental operates in complex global value chains that are ex-
posed to a variety of risks associated with the violation of protected 
rights."
"Risks within this context are always related to the potential 
negative impact on people and the environment."
"Continental has therefore established a comprehensive manage-
ment system for ensuring its due diligence obligations, in order to 
identify risks in connection with defined protected rights within its 
supply chain and in its own business units."
"For this purpose, re-
sponsibilities, rules and processes have been clearly defined for this 
purpose, including risk-mitigation measures and control mecha-
nisms."
"The responsible value chain due diligence system (RVCDDS) 
focuses on the protected rights defined by us and will be devel-
oped further in line with the development of dynamic economic, 
social and environmental requirements."
"The RVCDDS applies to 
Continental AG and to all subsidiaries in which the Continental 
Group exercises a controlling influence."
"The Executive Board of Continental AG is updated on the current 
status by the Continental Group’s human rights officer at least once 
a year and decides on the system’s effectiveness, appropriateness 
and potential for improvement."
"It then proposes any suitable im-
provements to the RVCDDS where necessary, either to the system 
as a whole or to selected elements."
"The RVCDDS is additionally in-
tegrated into Continental’s overarching internal control system, risk 
management system and compliance management system."
"As a 
key prevention measure at corporate level, Continental has adopted 
responsible value chain commitments (RVC commitments) that are 
accessible online at  www.continental-sustainability.com."
"These 
commitments address the defined risk categories and formulate 
what is expected of the company’s own business units and employ-
ees, as well as of its direct suppliers."
"The RVC commitments surpass 
the minimum legal requirements, especially when it comes to work-
ing conditions."
"On top of this, Continental has anchored further pre-
vention measures in its own business units and with respect to di-
rect suppliers."
"The Business Partner Code of Con-
duct is updated regularly, most recently in fiscal 2023, to reflect 
changes or adjustments to relevant legislation."
"For suppliers of  
natural rubber, our sourcing policy for sustainable natural rubber 
additionally applies."
"The Integrity Hotline is open for information 
on potential violations of human rights and environmental rights, 
among other issues."
"Alongside the whistleblower system, a range 
of other resources are used to investigate potential protected right 
violations and implement preventive and remedial measures, 
where necessary."
"The RVCDDS additionally defines the framework for taking remedial 
measures within the company’s own business units, as well as to-
ward direct suppliers and, should the situation arise, also toward in-
direct suppliers."
"Sustainability aspects are also taken into considera-
tion at various other points in supplier management."
"For example, 
selected suppliers are evaluated based on various criteria using 
self-assessment questionnaires, which we collect via the generally 
accepted sustainability platforms for our industries, such as EcoVa-
dis and NQC."
"These questionnaires are reviewed annually at the 
corporate level."
"Selective local audits or other audit activities are 
also carried out, for example in relation to the existence of manage-
ment systems."
"Here, we have worked in 
particular to cultivate a shared understanding of industry risks and 
due diligence requirements."
"We are also involved in initiatives and 
associations such as econsense, the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA) and the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber 
(GPSNR)."

Responsible sourcing is the responsibility of the relevant purchas-
ing organizations, which are established at Continental by group 
sector, product group and country, for example."
"A corporate pur-
chasing network regularly deals with responsible sourcing topics  
as well."
"The Group Quality group function coordinates the manage-
ment of conflict minerals, including the corresponding reporting 
processes."
"As part of the RVCDDS rollout, training on the RVC commitments 
and on the RVCDDS itself was provided to employees worldwide,  
in particular to staff in management positions and to those per-
forming special functions."
"To further increase transparency and sustainability in Continental’s 
natural rubber supply chain, the activities of the joint venture “Rub-
berway,” which was founded in 2019, were rolled out further for 
the digital risk analysis of the upstream supply chain."
"The joint pro-
ject with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammen-
arbeit (GIZ) in the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan, which 
has been in place since 2018, was also further expanded."
"The aim 
of the project is to jointly drive forward the implementation of a 
digital system for the traceability of natural rubber from the project 
region."
"Optimizing the supply chain and offering training in the sus-
tainable farming of natural rubber helps smallholders to increase 
the quantity, quality and yield of their produce, thus improving their 
income."
"In addition, a cultivation strategy designed around sustain-
ability prevents clearing and deforestation, thereby conserving val-
uable resources."
"As part of a development project with Security 
Matters (SMX), Continental is working on testing a tamper-proof 
means of verification of the geographical origin of natural rubber 
using marker technologies."
"In 2022, field testing was successfully 
completed, and the marker substance could be verified beyond 
doubt throughout the entire tire production process."
"As at December 31, 2023, 1,291 valid supplier self-assessment 
questionnaires were available via the two sustainability platforms 
EcoVadis and NQC (PY: 1,009)."
"This corresponds to a completion 
rate of 71% of suppliers selected for this process (PY: 63%)."
"The  
increase in the number of available valid supplier self-assessment 
questionnaires and the higher completion rate are due to the 
onboarding of ContiTech suppliers in EcoVadis and the follow-up 
activities with suppliers to update and renew their self-assessment 
questionnaires."
"We present further performance indicators for the implementation 
of a responsible value chain with regard to our own locations in the 
sections on good working conditions as well as green and safe fac-
tories in this combined non-financial statement."
"For more information on the responsible value chain, see the inte-
grated sustainability report on our website at  www.continental-
sustainability.com."
"Good Working Conditions 
Our ambition 
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we provide inspiring, 
healthy and fair working conditions."
"Concept 
The Continental Group’s Code of Conduct sets out the foundation 
for good working conditions as the basis of our global collabora-
tion, including respect for human rights and fair working condi-
tions."
"Employees receive training on compliance with the Code of 
Conduct."
"The management system being rolled out for a responsi-
ble value chain also includes the company’s own activities (see the 
Responsible Value Chain section)."
"Our HR strategy is geared toward meeting staffing requirements in 
terms of both quantity and quality."
"We are tackling the impact of our Transformation 2019–2029 
structural program and further measures introduced due to chang-
ing conditions with targeted training measures for the employees 
affected."
"New career prospects and employment opportunities are 
to be opened up on the internal as well as the external employ-
ment markets."
"The HR functions at Continental Group, group sector, business  
area and country level, which work together in a global network, 
are responsible for HR."
"A special network of country coordinators 
for labor relations is also part of this organization."
"We measure the success of HR work against the OUR BASICS Live 
Sustainable Engagement index, which is calculated on the basis of 
the annual employee survey."
"The index measures employee agree-
ment on topics such as whether they personally support the com-
pany values and whether they are proud to work for Continental."
"We also use sickness rate and unforced fluctuation rate as perfor-
mance indicators."
"The OUR BASICS Live Sustainable Engagement index has also 
been part of the LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board 
and global managers since fiscal 2020."
"The sickness rate is also 
part of this, although only for the plans launched in fiscal 2020."
"For 
more information, see the remuneration report on our website  
under Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board."
"Results of the concept 
In fiscal 2023, the Sustainable Engagement index was 81% (PY: 80%), 
slightly above the prior-year level."
"The sickness rate fell to 3.2% in 
the reporting year (PY: 3.7%)."
"The unforced fluctuation rate likewise 
decreased to 6.0% (PY: 7.8%)."
Information about personnel expenses in fiscal 2023 (i.e.
"wages 
and salaries, social security contributions and pension and post-
employment benefit costs) can be found starting on page 122 of 
the notes to the consolidated statement of income in this annual 
report."
"Employee benefits such as pensions, post-employment ben-
efits and long-term bonus payments are broken down in the notes

"Green and Safe Factories  
Our ambition  
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we conduct our business 
processes in a safe and responsible manner based on systematic 
management and the protection of people and the environment."
"Concept 
Our company policy for environment, safety and health protection 
(ESH) defines corporate-wide guidelines for green and safe facto-
ries."
"On this basis, we pursue ESH targets for the Continental Group 
as a whole: all persons in our company are to be protected against 
accidents and work-related sickness, and their health is to be ac-
tively promoted."
"CO2 emissions, energy use, water consumption 
and waste generation at the locations are to be reduced, and the 
waste for recovery quota and energy efficiency at the locations  
increased."
"Local management systems drive forward the implementation of 
these guidelines."
"The concrete organizational and technical require-
ments can be found in the relevant ESH management manuals for 
the group sectors."
"Many locations have additionally undergone  
external certification audits."
"The certified business activities are  
assessed annually to determine how many employees are covered 
by environmental management, energy management, and occupa-
tional safety and health management systems."
"The accident rate – 
the number of accidents per million working hours – is used as an 
effectiveness indicator for occupational safety and health manage-
ment."
"The accident rate has also been part of the LTI plans for the 
members of the Executive Board and global managers since fiscal 
2020."
"Continental had set itself the goal of reducing the accident 
rate to 2.2 accidents per million working hours by 2030."
"For more 
information, see the remuneration report on our website  under 
Company/Corporate Governance/Executive Board."
"Group Environmental and Climate Protection and Group Safety and 
Health are responsible for the related strategic, corporate-wide ESH 
management process, and are supplemented by corresponding 
functions in the individual group sectors."
"Local operational environ-
ment, safety and health protection is the responsibility of the loca-
tions and is coordinated by local ESH managers in each case."
"Results of the concept 
As at December 31, 2023, the majority of our employees through-
out the Continental Group were covered by the management sys-
tems of the certified business activities."
"The environmental man-
agement system certification covered 76% of employees, un-
changed from the previous year."
"Coverage for the energy manage-
ment system certification increased to 43% of employees (PY: 
40%), while coverage for the occupational safety and health man-
agement system certification was also up at 64% of employees (PY: 
62%) – thanks in both cases to optimized internal processes."
2 Definition: number of accidents during working hours per million paid working hours.
"Counted from more than one lost day, i.e."
"with at least one lost day beyond the day of 
the accident."
3 Excluding leasing personnel (i.e.
permanent staff only) and way-to-work accidents.
"For more information on green and safe factories, see the inte-
grated sustainability report on our website at  www.continental-

"Benchmark in Quality 
Our ambition 
As set out in our sustainability ambition, we are recognized by our 
customers and society as being a benchmark in quality by ensur-
ing safe and sustainable products."
"Concept 
The decisive factor in becoming a benchmark in quality is a quality-
oriented company culture."
"Our quality policy sets out guidelines for 
product and process quality at Continental."
"Product recalls, product 
liability claims and proceedings as a result of quality defects repre-
sent a business risk that we want to avoid due to the resulting losses 
of sales, costs, and loss of customer and market acceptance."
"For 
more information, see the report on risks and opportunities in this 
annual report."
"Local management systems drive forward the implementation of 
these guidelines."
"The concrete organizational and technical require-
ments can be found in the relevant quality management manuals 
for the group sectors."
"The extent of the certifications is assessed on 
an annual basis as to how many employees they cover with re-
spect to quality management systems."
"The number of new field 
quality events is used as an effectiveness indicator for our quality 
management."
"A field quality event is a risk-minimizing measure for 
a product manufactured and/or sold by Continental on the basis of 
a safety-related defect and/or non-compliance with regulations that 
was initiated by Continental, a customer and/or an authority."
"Results of the concept 
As at December 31, 2023, certified quality management systems 
covered 85% of our employees throughout the Continental Group 
(PY: 83%)."
"The improved certification rate was achieved thanks to 
optimized internal processes."
"Twenty-nine new field quality events were identified in fiscal 2023 
(PY: 30)."
"2 Definition: a field quality event is a risk-minimizing measure for a product 
manufactured and/or sold by Continental based on a safety-related defect and/or 
non-compliance with regulations that was initiated by Continental, a customer and/or 
an authority."
"Information about the scope of warranty and product liability claims 
in fiscal 2023 can be also found starting on page 211 of the other 
disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"For more information on benchmark in quality, see the integrated 
sustainability report on our website at  www.continental-sustaina-
bility.com."
"Concept 
Group Compliance, which is divided into a central team and regional 
functions, is responsible for preventing violations in the areas of cor-
ruption, antitrust law, money laundering and data protection."
"This 
structure is supplemented by compliance coordinators in the coun-
tries and at the locations."
"The Compliance Manual sets out how the 
compliance management system is designed and implemented."
"The Integrity Hotline is the primary tool for support 
with detecting violations."
"When it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical 
compliance, responsibility lies with the Group Quality, Technical 
Compliance, CBS and Environment group function, together with 
the central functions for quality and technical compliance within 
the group sectors."
"The technical compliance policy as well as the 
technical compliance management system manual and other pro-
cedural standards set out how the compliance management sys-
tem is designed and implemented."
"A network of supporting roles in the various functions within the 
group sectors, business areas, segments and sites is being devised 
and expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identifi-
cation of risks and other technical compliance considerations."
"The appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk and compliance 
management systems are monitored and assessed as part of Conti-
nental’s overarching internal control system."
"On top of this, “Integ-
rity Perception” is measured using a newly defined indicator."
"This new 
indicator was applied for the first time in 2023."
"It is based on specific 
questions asked within the context of the annual OUR BASICS Live 
survey and expresses employees’ perception of key aspects involved 
in implementing our integrity ambition within the organization."
"It is 
therefore characterized by subjective impressions and estimates 
that reveal whether the systems are having the intended impact 
among employees."
"The indicator will constitute a component of 
variable remuneration for the members of the Executive Board, 
senior executives and executives worldwide beginning in fiscal 
2024."
"The aim is to make not only immediate but also sustained 
improvements to the indicator going forward – with the ultimate 
goal of enhancing perceived integrity."
"As a further cornerstone for sustainable management practice, we 
are committed to promoting employee diversity, which we under-
stand as internationality, a balanced gender ratio, and a range of  
experiences and age categories."
"We have set ourselves the corpo-
rate target of increasing the share of female executives and senior 
executives to 25% by 2025 and to up to 30% by 2030."
"We intend to achieve this in particular by using objective diagnos-
tics-assisted appointment procedures, by strengthening our inclu-
sive culture, by expanding women’s networks and by holding diver-
sity workshops and specific events."
"Gender diversity – the share of 
female executives and senior executives – has also been part of the 
LTI plans for the members of the Executive Board and global man-
agers since fiscal 2020."

"Results of the concept 
As at December 31, 2023, Continental had increased its share  
of female executives and senior executives to 19.9% (PY: 19.1%)."
"The increase in the representation of women at management level 
proves that our initiatives and measures to promote gender diver-
sity are having an effect."
"The share excluding the USA amounted  
to 19.8% (PY: 18.8%)."
"For the long-term remuneration of executives, 
separate analysis of the key figure excluding the USA is necessary 
for legal reasons."
"The “Integrity Perception” index, which was reported in this form  
for the first time in fiscal 2023, attained a score of 81% (PY: n.a.)."

The EU Taxonomy is a classification system for determining sus-
tainable economic activities in the real economy."
"The following dis-
closures are the mandatory disclosures of the Continental Group in 
accordance with Art."
8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852.
"In June 2023, 
the Environmental Delegated Act under EU Taxonomy Regulation 
2023/2486 was published, containing the activities and technical 
assessment criteria for the four remaining environmental objectives."
"This affects, among others, the two economic activities of category 
3.18 (“Manufacture of automotive and mobility components”) and 
category 3.19 (“Manufacture of rail rolling stock constituents”)."
"As a result, these regulations and notes are still open 
to interpretation."
"From Continental’s perspective, there is also uncertainty about the 
interaction between the various regulations, delegated acts and of-
ficial answers to frequently asked questions."
"Furthermore, the short 
implementation period granted by the delegated act published in 
2023 means that many questions of interpretation related to im-
plementation have not yet been conclusively clarified."
"In interpret-
ing the regulation, we also take into consideration the assessments 
of industry associations in the supplier and automotive industries, 
the reporting practices of European suppliers for 2022 and unoffi-
cial assessments by various experts."
"With this in mind, we have introduced performance indicators at  
a corporate level as part of our sustainability scorecard, with the 
aim of monitoring our progress."
"It consisted of allo-
cated business with zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles and allocated 
low-carbon business beyond business with zero-tailpipe-emission 
vehicles."
"In the reporting year, we allocated all economic activities involved 
in the manufacture of automotive and mobility systems and com-
ponents for road vehicles – with the exception of tires, but also ex-
tending beyond components for zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles –  
to category 3.18."
"Continental is of the opinion that the manufac-
ture of all components, irrespective of the drive system, is Taxon-
omy-eligible for all vehicles belonging to the vehicle classes listed  
in the category."
"The un-
clearly defined qualification characteristic (criterion) of activity 3.18 
– essential contribution to environmental performance – is, in Conti-
nental’s view, part of the assessment of Taxonomy alignment and 
not Taxonomy eligibility."
"Alternative interpretations were examined 
but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental."
"Furthermore, the activity designation 
does not entail any restrictions on components, for example in  
relation to function or drive system."
"In contrast to the previous year, in the reporting year all activities 
involved in tire manufacturing were classified as Taxonomy-eligible 
under category 3.6."
"In Recital 10 of Delegated Regulation 2023/-
2485 (amending Delegated Regulation 2021/2139), the Commis-
sion made it clear that tire manufacturing has the potential to re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector and can 
contribute to a more circular economy."
"Until specific technical as-
sessment criteria are defined for this activity, tire manufacturing 
shall remain a Taxonomy-eligible activity under category 3.6 (“Man-
ufacture of other low-carbon technologies”)."
"It is Continental’s opin-
ion that this clarification for the purposes of Taxonomy eligibility re-
fers to the manufacture of tires of all kinds, without any restrictions 
in terms of specific properties, label classes or drive system tech-
nologies."
"Based on this clarification, Continental has amended its 
approach compared with the previous year and now allocates the 
manufacture of tires of all kinds, without any restrictions in terms  
of specific properties, label classes or drive system technologies, to 
category 3.6."
"Alternative interpretations were also examined here 
but they were found to be unsuitable by Continental, particularly 
with regard to Recital 10."
"In addition, various Continental industrial businesses will continue 
to be reported as Taxonomy-eligible, as they were in the previous 
year."
"In the reporting year, these primarily comprised the manufac-
ture of components for wind turbines and the manufacture of ma-
terials for industrial plant insulation."
"For these classifications as well, Conti-
nental believes it is irrelevant which functions are fulfilled by the 
supplier technologies in the end products, as long as the end 
product facilitates the goals set out in Art."
"10 (1) of the Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"The activities mentioned are not identified as Taxonomy-eligible  
under Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (climate change  
adaptation)."
"All other economic activities of the Continental Group that are not 
included in the aforementioned economic activities have been clas-
sified as Taxonomy-non-eligible for the reporting year."
"We base the classification on the information publicly available at 
the time the report was prepared."
"Taxonomy-eligible turnover 
The information on turnover is prepared in accordance with sec-
tion 1.1.1 of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure 
Obligations (2021/2178) and in compliance with IFRS accounting 
regulations (see tables at the end of this non-financial statement)."
"The method of determination selected by Continental ensures that 
double counting is avoided."
"Added to this was the first-time classification of other eco-
nomic activities involved in the manufacture of rail rolling stock con-
stituents as Taxonomy-eligible under category 3.19."
"In addition, vari-
ous Continental industrial businesses were reported as Taxonomy-
eligible under category 3.6, as they were in the previous year."
"A  
total sum of €35.9 billion was reported as Taxonomy-eligible turno-
ver in the reporting year (PY: €2.8 billion), equivalent to 86.6% of 
total consolidated sales (PY: 7.1%)."
"The breakdown of Taxonomy-
eligible turnover by category is shown in the table on page 56."
"The figures for Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure and operating 
expenditure under category a are allocations based on the propor-
tion of Taxonomy-eligible turnover."
"For reasons connected to the 
business model, the equipment, machinery and buildings of the 
Continental Group are thus used both for Taxonomy-eligible activi-
ties and for other activities."
"This applies both to capital expenditure 
and operating expenditure for assets or processes associated with 
Taxonomy-eligible activities (category a)."
"The allocation takes place at group sector level, and not according 
to the individual locations, in order to avoid double counting, take 
into account internal business and consolidation effects and reflect 
the Continental Group’s matrix structure."
"This allocation of turnover 
thus reflects the distribution of Continental’s production."
"The Platform 
on Sustainable Finance also recommends such an approach to alloca-
tion in its report to the Commission dated October 2022."
"This states, 
for enabling activities, that capital expenditure and operating ex-
penditure should be reported on the basis of their proportion of 
turnover, provided the activities are Taxonomy-eligible and that 
they not do not include activities that are Taxonomy-non-eligible."
"A total sum of 
€2,140.9 million was reported as Taxonomy-eligible capital expendi-
ture in the reporting year (PY: €183.1 million), equivalent to 87.9% 
of total capital expenditure (PY: 7.5%)."
"The breakdown of Taxonomy-
eligible capital expenditure by category is shown in the table on 
page 57."
"The information on capital expenditure is prepared in accordance 
with section 1.1.2 of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Dis-
closure Obligations (2021/2178) in compliance with IFRS account-
ing regulations."
"Information on the Continental Group’s total capital 
expenditure can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements in the segment reporting (Note 1) of this annual report."
"The information refers to capital expenditure in the intangible assets 
(Note 13), property, plant and equipment (Note 14), leases (Note 
15) and investment property (Note 16) presented in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"Operating expenditure is defined in accordance with section 1.1.3 
of Annex 1 to the Delegated Regulation on Disclosure Obligations 
(2021/2178) and has been calculated on an imputed basis as de-
scribed above."
"For the denominator of the key figure calculation for 
operating expenditure, Continental takes into account direct, non-
capitalized costs incurred in the reporting year as a result of research 
and development (net), building renovation measures, short-term 
leasing, and maintenance and repairs."
"The expanded interpretation of economic activities classified as 
Taxonomy-eligible in the reporting year likewise led to a significant 
increase in Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure."
"A total sum  
of €3,571.9 million was reported as Taxonomy-eligible operating 
expenditure in the reporting year (PY: €220.1 million), equivalent  
to 90.5% of total operating expenditure (PY: 6.1%)."
"The breakdown 
of Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure by category is shown 
in the table on page 58."
"Taxonomy-aligned Economic Activities 
As in the previous year, Continental did not report any economic 
activities as being Taxonomy-aligned."
"For all economic activities that are reported under category 3.6, 
specific comparative life-cycle assessments are required in order to 
also report these as being Taxonomy-aligned."
"These must demon-
strate substantial savings to life-cycle emissions compared with the 
highest-performing alternative technology or solution available on 
the market or the highest-performing alternative product available 
on the market."
"External verification of the life-cycle assessments 
must also take place in accordance with predefined standards."
"A 
simplified life-cycle consideration, as called for by the Taxonomy 
Regulation (2020/852) itself, is no longer sufficient in accordance 
with the Delegated Regulation for Climate Change Mitigation 
(2021/2139) for category 3.6."
"Continental did not have the corre-
sponding life-cycle assessments at its disposal in the reporting year, 
meaning it is currently not possible to allocate Taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities."
"For this reason, the “Do No Significant Harm” 
(DNSH) criteria and the minimum protection requirements along 
the value chain were not assessed according to specific economic 
activities."
"It was not yet mandatory in the reporting year to report Taxonomy-
aligned economic activities if the economic activities are reported 
according to the categories 3.18 and 3.19 which have been newly 
integrated into the Climate Delegated Act."
"Since Continental does not currently report any activities as Taxon-
omy-aligned, no Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure or operating 
expenditure according to categories a and b has been reported."
"Since no Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure or operating ex-
penditure under category c was identified, no Taxonomy-aligned 
capital expenditure or operating expenditure under category c  
has been reported."
"Continental has no economic activities according to the comple-
mentary Delegated Regulation for Gas and Nuclear Activities 
(2022/1214) and therefore does not provide the specific templates."

"According to the January 2024 World Economic Outlook 
Update (WEO Update) published by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF), the global economy grew by 3.1% in fiscal 2023, which slightly 
exceeded the IMF’s forecast of 2.9% growth from January 2023."
"According to statistical office Eurostat, gross domestic product (GDP) 
in the eurozone rose by 0.5% year-on-year in 2023."
"For France and 
Italy, the IMF recorded growth rates of 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively, 
while Spain’s economy grew by 2.4%."
"Conversely, GDP in Germany 
fell by 0.1% according to the Federal Statistical Office."
"The United 
Kingdom achieved growth of 0.5% according to the IMF and was 
therefore on a par with the eurozone."
"For Russia, the IMF estimated 
GDP growth of 3.0%."
"In North America, the USA posted GDP growth of 2.5% in 2023, ac-
cording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis."
"For Canada and Mex-
ico, the IMF recorded GDP growth of 1.1% and 3.4%, respectively."
"Other countries in the Americas also saw continued economic re-
covery in 2023."
"For Brazil, for example, the IMF estimated GDP 
growth of 3.1%."
"Asian countries also recorded a continued economic revival in the 
year under review, according to the IMF."
"High growth rates were 
achieved in 2023 by India’s economy, with GDP growth of 6.7%,  
by China, with growth of 5.2%, and by the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN), with GDP growth of 4.2%."
"According to the 
IMF, lower growth rates were reported for Japan, with GDP growth 
of 1.9%."
"Development of Key Customer Sectors 
and Sales Regions 
With a 64% share of consolidated sales (PY: 61%), the automotive 
industry – with the exception of the replacement business – was 
Continental’s most important customer group in fiscal 2023."
"The 
Automotive group sector accounted for the lion’s share, but the 
Tires and ContiTech group sectors also generated significant sales 
figures in this market segment."
"The second-biggest market segment for Continental was the global 
replacement-tire business for passenger cars and commercial vehi-
cles, with 25% of total sales in fiscal 2023 (PY: 28%)."
"Because pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles make up a considerably 
higher share of the replacement-tire business, their development  
is particularly important to our economic success."
"The third-biggest market segment for Continental was the global 
business with industrial customers and spare parts from the Conti-
Tech group sector, with around 9% of total sales (PY: 9%)."
"Continental’s biggest sales region in the reporting year was still  
Europe, which accounted for 48% of sales (PY: 47%), followed by 
North America at 27% (PY: 27%) and Asia-Pacific at 21% (PY: 22%)."
"Development of new passenger-car registrations 
In 2023, there was a significant rise in the number of newly regis-
tered cars in the major international automotive markets."
"The 
availability of many car models improved compared with the weak 
previous year."
"These positive developments more than offset the 
ongoing subdued demand resulting from geopolitical and macro-
economic uncertainties and high consumer prices."
"According to preliminary data from the German Association of the 
Automotive Industry (Verband der Automobilindustrie, VDA), 12.8 
million new vehicles were registered in the European car market 
(EU27, EFTA and the United Kingdom) in 2023, 14% more than in 
the previous year."
"Passenger car sales rose by 16% in Japan and by 
12% in the USA."
Brazil recorded an increase of 11%.
"In China – the world’s largest car market – the VDA registered record 
sales in 2023."
"The number of newly registered vehicles rose by 11% 
to 25.8 million units, outperforming the overall Chinese economy, 
which lost momentum as a whole."
"In India, sales of new vehicles 
rose by 8% to 4.1 million units in 2023."
"According to preliminary data from car manufacturer Renault, new-
car registrations in 2023 also increased significantly year-on-year."
"Greater semiconductor capacity also contributed to the rise in  
production."
"The strike in the US automotive industry, which lasted 
several weeks, had no significant impact on the development of 
global vehicle production."
"According to preliminary data, Europe recorded a 13% rise in the 
production of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in the 
reporting year."
"North America and China increased their production 
by 10% in 2023."
"According to preliminary figures, global production for 2023 rose 
by 10% to 90.3 million units."
"Production increased in Eastern and Central Europe 
in particular, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine."
"The improved avail-
ability of materials and pent-up demand also resulted in a significant 
increase in production in Western Europe."
"According to preliminary 
data, overall production volumes rose by 14% year-on-year."
"In our other core market of North America, good economic growth 
and pent-up demand led to an ongoing upturn in the production of 
medium and heavy commercial vehicles by 8%, according to pre-
liminary figures."
"Development of replacement-tire markets for passenger cars 
and light commercial vehicles 
In both Europe and North America, demand for replacement tires 
initially declined in the year under review."
"The effects of inflation  
resulted in significant purchasing restraint among consumers in  
the first half of the year in particular, and the levels of stock among 
dealers led to a reduced need for stockpiling."
"In North America, a 
strong second half of the year compensated for the weak start, 
while the replacement-tire markets in Europe were down year-on-
year overall."
"By contrast, the Chinese market grew significantly."
"Sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger cars and light com-
mercial vehicles weighing less than 6 metric tons fell by 4% in Eu-
rope (excluding Russia) for 2023 as a whole."
"In North America, de-
mand in the year under review was on a par with the previous year."
"Conversely, sales volumes in China rose by 12%."
"According to prelim-
inary data, global sales volumes of replacement tires for passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles rose by 1% in the reporting year."
"Development of industrial production 
In addition to vehicle production and the replacement business for 
the automotive industry, the development of various other indus-
tries is crucial to the success of our ContiTech group sector."
"Conti-
Tech products are used in particular in equipment, machinery and 
vehicles for railway transport, mining, agriculture and other key in-
dustries."
"As well as the general development of gross domestic 
product, the development of industrial production is therefore  
regarded as an important indicator for ContiTech’s business with  
industrial customers."
"In the reporting period, industrial production in the eurozone con-
tinued to be affected by increased costs and was down year-on-year 
as a whole."
"In the USA as well, industrial production saw only a 
slight increase in 2023, remaining more or less constant year-on-
year."
"China, on the other hand, recorded significant growth in indus-
trial production compared with the previous year, which was influ-
enced by lockdowns and other factors."
"Development of Raw Materials Markets 
Compared with previous years, the development of raw materials 
markets in the year under review was largely stable due to an over-
all improvement in availability."
"Global supply chains also returned 
to more normal levels."
"This was also reflected in less volatile price 
developments, particularly for metals."
"Although a decline in price 
volatility was observed for products such as crude oil and butadi-
ene, prices still fluctuated significantly in some cases."
"Overall, how-
ever, they were roughly on a par with the level seen at the start of 
2023 at the end of the reporting period."
"Carbon steel and stainless steel are input materials for many of the 
mechanical components such as die-cast parts integrated by Conti-
nental into its products."
"Steel wire is used in particular in tire pro-
duction as steel cord but also in conveyor belts and timing belts to 
increase tensile strength."
"Aluminum is used in particular for die-cast 
parts and stamped and bent components, while copper is used in 
particular in electric motors, mechatronic components and printed 
circuit boards."

changes in the scope of consolidation and exchange-rate effects, 
sales rose by 6.9%."
"Changes in the scope of consolidation had a 
positive impact on sales performance but were more than offset  
by negative exchange-rate effects of €760.8 million."
"In the Automotive group sector, the significant ramp-up in automo-
tive production coupled with the price adjustments introduced to 
compensate for cost inflation bolstered sales performance."
"By  
contrast, growth in the Tires group sector was dampened by weak 
demand in the replacement-tire business and negative exchange-
rate effects."
"In ContiTech, the effects of the slight downturn in the 
industrial and automotive replacement business were offset by 
higher volumes and positive price adjustments in the automotive 
original-equipment business."
"Contract Manufacturing reduced its 
sales in accordance with the contractually agreed procedure be-
tween Continental and Vitesco Technologies."
"EBIT 
EBIT was up by €1,099.0 million year-on-year in 2023 to €1,853.8 
million (PY: €754.8 million), an increase of 145.6%."
"The return on 
sales improved to 4.5% (PY: 1.9%)."
"The cost of sales rose by €785.0 
million to €32,612.6 million (PY: €31,827.6 million), primarily due 
to higher costs for semi-finished products, energy, logistics, and 
wages and salaries."
"While the previous year’s EBIT was encumbered 
by impairment on goodwill and property, plant and equipment, in 
2023 it was restructuring expenses of €295.4 million that had an 
adverse effect."
"Adjusted EBIT in the reporting year improved by 
31.6% year-on-year, as outlined above."
"The amortization of intangible assets from purchase price alloca-
tion (PPA) reduced EBIT by €118.2 million in the reporting year

€26.6 million; Tires €71.9 million) and income of €6.3 million for 
ContiTech."
"Loss allowances on accounts receivable, write-downs on inventories, 
and debt waivers in connection with the discontinuation of Russian

resulted in total consolidated income of €6.6 million."
"The Continental Group immediately reviews intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, investment property and goodwill 
as soon as there is an indication of impairment (triggering event)."
"The rise in the general interest rate level was one such indication  
of impairment."
"This was mainly attributable to increased 
discount rates and updated planning."
"Owing to the sanctions imposed against or by Russia, intangible  
assets and property, plant and equipment were reviewed at the 
Russian companies during the year."
"This led to a full impairment  
of all intangible assets and property, plant and equipment."

the impairment amounted to €86.7 million (Automotive €0.2 mil-
lion; Tires €80.6 million; ContiTech €5.9 million)."

to income of €0.8 million in the Automotive group sector."
"Procurement  
The first half of the reporting year for the Automotive and Contract 
Manufacturing group sectors continued to be shaped by isolated 
bottlenecks for semiconductors."
"High prices coupled with the 
scarce availability of key input materials and various raw materials 
continued to present a challenge for the Tires and ContiTech group 
sectors in the first half of 2023."
"The procurement market eased at 
the beginning of the second half of the year, leading to better avail-
ability and falling prices."
"Energy costs, by contrast, remained at a 
high level."
"The increasing activities in the area of sustainable pro-
curement are also associated with elevated costs."
"Overall, the prices of raw materials that are important for Continen-
tal fell year-on-year, especially in the second half of 2023."
"However, 
this positive effect was negated by higher costs for semi-finished 
products, particularly semiconductors."

"Research and development 
Research and development expenses (net) increased by €133.1 
million or 4.8% year-on-year to €2,896.0 million (PY: €2,762.9 mil-
lion), corresponding to 7.0% of sales (PY: 7.0%)."
"In the Automotive group sector, costs in connection with initial 
product development projects in the original-equipment business 
are capitalized."
"Costs are capitalized as at the time at which we are 
named as a supplier and have successfully achieved a specific pre-
release stage."
"Capitalization ends with the approval for unlimited 
volume production."
"The costs of customer-specific applications, 
pre-production prototypes and testing for products already being 
sold do not qualify as development expenditure that may be recog-
nized as an intangible asset."
"Capitalized development expenses are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to seven 
years and recognized in the cost of sales."
"In the opinion of the Con-
tinental Group, the assumed useful life reflects the period for which 
an economic benefit is likely to be derived from the corresponding 
development projects."
"Of the development costs incurred in 2023, 
including development expenses for internally developed software, 
€17.6 million (PY: €24.4 million) in the Automotive group sector 
qualified for recognition as an asset."
"As in the previous year, the requirements for the capitalization  
of development activities were not met in the Tires, ContiTech or 
Contract Manufacturing group sectors."
"This results in a capitalization ratio of 0.6% (PY: 0.9%) for the Conti-
nental Group."
"Depreciation and amortization 
Depreciation and amortization decreased by €986.1 million to 
€2,225.2 million (PY: €3,211.2 million), equivalent to 5.4% of sales 
(PY: 8.1%)."
"It included impairment totaling €57.3 million in 2023 
(PY: €966.6 million)."
"Financial result 
The negative financial result increased by €37.8 million year-on-
year to €235.8 million in 2023 (PY: €198.0 million)."
"This increase 
was primarily attributable to the global interest rate trend on the 
capital markets."
"Interest income rose by €19.8 million year-on-year to €103.4 million 
in 2023 (PY: €83.6 million)."
"Interest income in connection with in-

€184.6 million higher than the previous year’s figure of €234.8  
million."
"Interest expense from long-term employee benefits and  
expected income from long-term employee benefits and from pen-
sion funds amounted to a net expense of €84.8 million in the re-
porting year (PY: €62.4 million)."
"These interest effects do not in-
clude the interest income from the plan assets of the pension con-
tribution funds or the interest expense from the defined benefit ob-
ligations of the pension contribution funds."
"Interest expense, result-
ing mainly from bank borrowings, capital market transactions and 
other financing instruments, was €334.6 million (PY: €172.4 mil-
lion)."
"Interest expense on lease liabilities accounted for €27.9 mil-
lion of this (PY: €26.7 million)."
"Interest expenses in connection with 
income tax payables amounted to €17.3 million (PY: €3.1 million)."
"The bonds issued by Continental AG and Conti-Gummi Finance 
B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands, resulted in expenses of €97.2 million 
(PY: €52.9 million)."
"The increase was primarily due to the issuance 
of euro bonds by Continental AG."
"A five-year bond with a volume  
of €625.0 million and a fixed interest rate of 3.625% p.a."
"was issued 
in the fourth quarter of 2022."
"Two further bonds were issued in 
2023: a five-year bond with a volume of €750.0 million in the sec-
ond quarter of 2023, and a three-and-a-half-year bond with a vol-
ume of €500.0 million in the third quarter of 2023, both with a 
fixed interest rate of 4.000% p.a."
"An offsetting effect was attributa-
ble to the repayment of a euro bond in the amount of €750.0 mil-
lion with a fixed interest rate of 2.125% p.a."
"in the fourth quarter  
of 2023."
"In addition, a euro bond in the amount of €500.0 million 
with a fixed interest rate of 0.000% p.a."
"was repaid in the third quar-
ter of 2023."
"Effects from currency translation resulted in a positive contribution 
to earnings of €78.8 million in the reporting year (PY: negative con-
tribution to earnings of €59.6 million)."
"Effects from changes in the 
fair value of derivative instruments, and other valuation effects re-
sulted in income of €1.4 million (PY: €12.8 million)."
"Other valuation 
effects accounted for €1.2 million of this (PY: €5.1 million)."
"Taking 
into account the sum of the effects from currency translation and 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, earnings in 2023 
were positively impacted by €78.9 million (PY: negatively impacted 
by €51.9 million)."
"A significant contributor to the year-on-year im-
provement was the development of the Chinese renminbi in rela-
tion to the euro."
"Income tax expense  
Income tax expense in fiscal 2023 amounted to €424.1 million  
(PY: €444.6 million)."
"The tax rate was 26.2%, compared with 47.6% 
in the previous year."
"The prior-year tax rate was presented on an 
adjusted basis before the permanent effects of the recognized 
goodwill impairment."
"As in the previous year, foreign tax rate differences as well as incen-
tives and tax holidays had positive effects in the year under review."
"The tax rate was negatively impacted by non-cash allowances on 
deferred tax assets totaling €63.9 million (PY: €113.2 million), of 
which €41.7 million (PY: €30.1 million) was for previous years."
"Furthermore, as in the previous year, the tax rate was negatively  
affected by non-deductible expenses and non-imputable foreign 
withholding taxes."
"In the year under review, additional tax burdens 
were incurred from internal restructuring."
"Net income attributable to the shareholders of the parent  
Net income attributable to the shareholders of the parent increased 
by €1,089.8 million in 2023 to €1,156.4 million (PY: €66.6 million)."
"Basic earnings per share amounted to €5.78 (PY: €0.33), the same 
amount as diluted earnings per share."
"Employees 
The number of employees in the Continental Group as at Decem-
ber 31, 2023, was 202,763, up 3,725 from 199,038 in the previ-
ous year."
"The number of employees in the Automotive group sector rose by 
4,838 due to adjustments to higher order volumes."
"The number of employees in the Tires group sector declined by 
638."
"This was primarily due to the sale of operations in Russia and 
adjustments to demand-driven production."
"In the ContiTech group sector, the acquisition of Printing Solutions 
Sweden Holding AB, Trelleborg, Sweden, and adjustments to the 
production volume were the main reasons for the increase in the 
number of employees by 151."
"The number of employees in the Contract Manufacturing group 
sector fell by 714 to 1,478 (PY: 2,192)."
"This rise was primarily due to the increase in EBIT of €1,099.0 mil-
lion to €1,853.8 million (PY: €754.8 million)."
"The cash-effective increase in working capital led to a cash outflow 
of €264.4 million (PY: €733.9 million)."
"The lower cash outflow from 
working capital was due on the one hand to a decrease in invento-
ries of €377.9 million (PY: increase of €1,644.9 million)."
"In addition, 
despite higher sales, there was a slight decrease in operating re-
ceivables of €50.6 million (PY: increase of €821.9 million) due to 
higher cash receipts as at the end of the reporting period."
"The  
decrease in operating liabilities of €692.9 million (PY: increase  
of €1,732.9 million) had an offsetting effect."
"Interest payments increased by €127.6 million to €279.5 million

from €2,132.8 million to €2,124.4 million before the capitalization 
of borrowing costs and right-of-use assets from leases."
"The net amount from the acquisition and disposal of companies 
and business operations led to a cash outflow of €133.3 million in 
2023 (PY: €109.1 million)."
"This cash outflow was primarily due to 
an acquisition in the ContiTech group sector."
"These effects resulted in free cash flow of €1,159.0 million (PY: €90.6 
million) for fiscal 2023, corresponding to a year-on-year increase of 
€1,068.4 million."
"Capital expenditure (additions)  
Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment, and soft-
ware amounted to €2,436.9 million in 2023 (PY: €2,426.4 million)."
"The increase of €10.5 million was driven in particular by the Tires 
group sector, while significant savings in the Automotive group sec-
tor had an offsetting effect."
"The capital expenditure ratio was 5.9% 
(PY: 6.2%)."
"Financing and indebtedness 
Gross indebtedness amounted to €7,170.3 million as at the end of 
2023 (PY: €7,694.7 million), down €524.4 million on the previous 
year’s level."
"Based on quarter-end values, 74.4% (PY: 69.5%) of gross indebted-
ness after hedging measures had fixed interest rates on average 
over the year."
"The carrying amount of the bonds increased negligibly from 
€3,949.2 million in the previous year to €3,969.2 million as at  
the end of fiscal 2023."
"Under the Debt Issuance Programme  
(DIP), Continental AG issued two listed euro bonds in June and

"Bank loans and overdrafts amounted to €1,385.7 million (PY: 
€1,579.6 million) as at December 31, 2023, and were therefore 
€193.9 million below the previous year’s level."
"The syndicated loan that was renewed ahead of schedule in De-
cember 2019 consists of a revolving tranche of €4,000.0 million 
and has an original term of five years."
"The margin will also depend 
on the Continental Group’s sustainability performance."
"If the Conti-
nental Group achieves the performance improvements in sustaina-
bility as set out in detail in the loan agreement, this will reduce the 
margin; non-achievement will result in a margin increase."
"Continen-
tal has exercised two options, each extending the term of the loan 
by one year."
"This means that the financing commitment of the 
banks is now available until December 2026."
"As at December 31, 
2023, Continental Rubber of America, Corp., Wilmington, Delaware, 
USA, had utilized €316.3 million of this revolving loan (PY: €300.0 
million utilized by Continental AG)."
"Other indebtedness fell by €350.6 million to €1,815.3 million  
(PY: €2,165.9 million) as at the end of 2023."
"The decrease is pri-
marily attributable to a lower issue volume of commercial paper."
This resulted in liabilities totaling €15.6 million (PY: €367.3 million).

"For further details, please see our  
comments on pages 66 and 67 regarding the special effects in 
2023 and 2022."
The ROCE was 1.1% (PY: 1.5%).
"Procurement  
Procurement in the Contract Manufacturing group sector was char-
acterized by a stabilized supply chain, notwithstanding some iso-
lated shortages."
"Production capacities at suppliers were adjusted to 
annual requirements, and prices followed the general market trend."
"Due to the contractual arrangements with Vitesco Technologies, all 
price changes in the purchasing volume are passed on to Vitesco 
Technologies on a quarterly basis and therefore have no influence 
on the operating result of the Contract Manufacturing group sector."
"Depreciation and amortization 
Depreciation and amortization fell by €11.5 million compared with 
fiscal 2022 to €23.8 million (PY: €35.2 million) and amounted to 
4.6% (PY: 5.3%) of sales."

(PY: €439.0 million)."

€48.9 million (PY: €83.5 million)."
"Operating receivables fell by 
€121.0 million to €389.9 million (PY: €511.0 million) as at the  
reporting date."
"Operating liabilities were down €70.9 million at 
€84.6 million (PY: €155.5 million)."
"Non-current operating assets were down €60.8 million year-on-
year at €88.5 million (PY: €149.3 million)."
"At €87.9 million, prop-
erty, plant and equipment were €60.0 million below the previous 
year’s level of €147.9 million."
"Other intangible assets fell by €0.5 
million to €0.4 million (PY: €0.9 million)."
"Exchange-rate effects increased the total operating assets of the 
Contract Manufacturing group sector by €10.8 million in the  
reporting year (PY: decrease of €1.2 million)."
"Average operating assets in the Contract Manufacturing group sec-
tor fell by €175.5 million compared with fiscal 2022 to €459.7 mil-
lion (PY: €635.2 million)."
"Capital expenditure (additions) 
Additions in the Contract Manufacturing business area decreased 
by €3.2 million year-on-year to €6.7 million (PY: €9.9 million)."
"The 
capital expenditure ratio was 1.3% (PY: 1.5%)."
"The capital expenditure was primarily attributable to production 
equipment for the manufacture of specific products and the imple-
mentation of new technologies."
"Employees 
The number of employees in the Contract Manufacturing group 
sector fell by 714 compared with the previous year, totaling 1,478 
as at December 31, 2023 (PY: 2,192)."
"In the opinion of the Executive Board, Continental achieved 
a solid result in this challenging macroeconomic environment."
"The 
Continental Group’s consolidated sales amounted to €41.4 billion 
in 2023 (PY: €39.4 billion), and the adjusted EBIT margin stood at 
6.1% (PY: 4.9%)."
"Adjusted free cash flow improved significantly to 
€1.3 billion (PY: €0.2 billion), which was slightly above the targeted 
range."
"This was attributable to the operational improvement in 
earnings and lower inventories and receivables."
"In the Automotive group sector, the significant ramp-up in automo-
tive production coupled with the price adjustments introduced to 
compensate for cost inflation had a particularly positive impact on 
organic sales."
"The group sector also maintained its high order in-
take."
"EBIT also improved significantly, in particular due to greater 
production and supply chain efficiency stemming from a more sta-
ble supply of materials and high cost discipline."
"In addition, the 
prior-year figure was encumbered by impairment on goodwill and 
property, plant and equipment."
"Automotive posted sales of €20.3 
billion (PY: €18.3 billion) and an adjusted EBIT margin of 1.9% 
(PY: -0.3%) in 2023."
"Before changes in the scope of consolidation 
and exchange-rate effects, the group sector increased its sales by 
12.3%."
"Negative exchange-rate effects and weak demand, particularly in 
the truck tire-replacement business and to a lesser extent the pas-
senger car tire-replacement business in Europe and North America, 
curbed sales growth in the Tires group sector."
"Nevertheless, Tires 
achieved an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.5% (PY: 13.1%), driven by a 
high share of premium tires and a strong winter tire business in Eu-
rope."
"Sales were unchanged from the previous year at €14.0 billion 
(PY: €14.0 billion)."
"The ContiTech group sector embarked on a strategic realignment 
in May 2023 with the aim of improving customer and market prox-
imity, enhancing efficiency and stepping up its focus on expanding 
its industrial business."
"As part of this realignment, ContiTech strength-
ened its industrial business through acquisitions."
"ContiTech also in-
creased sales in organic terms by 3.7%."
"This improvement was due 
to the positive development in the automotive original-equipment 
business, which saw both increased volumes and favorable price 
adjustments to compensate for cost inflation."
"By contrast, the in-
dustrial and automotive replacement businesses recorded a slight 
decline year-on-year."
"These lower volumes were largely offset by 
adjusting prices."
"ContiTech kept performance stable overall in 2023, 
achieving sales of €6.8 billion (PY: €6.6 billion)."
"The adjusted EBIT 
margin improved to 6.7% (PY: 4.7%)."
"Contributing factors were im-
proved overall prices, weaker inflation and mix effects in selected 
industrial sectors."
"Business in the Contract Manufacturing group sector continued to 
decline in accordance with the contractually agreed procedure be-
tween Continental and Vitesco Technologies."
"Its sales amounted to 
€0.5 billion (PY: €0.7 billion) in 2023, and its adjusted EBIT margin 
was 1.6% (PY: 0.4%)."
"Unlike the consolidated financial statements, the annual financial 
statements of Continental AG are prepared in accordance with  
German commercial law (the German Commercial Code, Handels-
gesetzbuch – HGB) and the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktien-
gesetz – AktG)."
"In addition, the following presentation of the parent company’s 
business performance, including its results, net assets and financial 
position, provides a basis for understanding the Executive Board’s 
proposal for the distribution of retained earnings."
"Continental AG acts solely as a management and holding company 
for the Continental Group."
"Total assets increased by €2,039.1 million year-on-year to €21,011.1 
million (PY: €18,972.0 million)."
"On the assets side, the change re-
sulted primarily from the increase in receivables from affiliated 
companies of €1,933.9 million to €8,897.3 million (PY: €6,963.4 
million) and the increase in cash and cash equivalents of €91.1 
million to €372.3 million (PY: €281.2 million)."
"Investments rose by €10.7 million year-on-year to €11,375.4 mil-
lion (PY: €11,364.7 million), thus corresponding to 54.1% of total 
assets (PY: 59.9%)."
"Property, plant and equipment increased by €21.4 million year-on-
year to €263.6 million (PY: €242.2 million)."
"This resulted primarily 
from additions as part of the construction of the new corporate 
headquarters in Hanover."
"The southern campus was completed in 
July 2023 and the northern campus in November 2023."
"At €81.7 million (PY: €72.7 million), prepaid expenses and deferred 
charges were up €9.0 million."
"The increase resulted from higher 
year-on-year accruals for IT services and the accrual of expenses 
that occurred in connection with the issuance of two euro bonds in 
fiscal 2023."
"This was partially off-
set by the €723.4 million decline in shareholders’ equity and the 
€591.0 million decline in bank loans and overdrafts."
"Bonds increased by €424.7 million year-on-year to €3,358.8 mil-
lion (PY: €2,934.1 million)."
"This was due to the issuance of two euro 
bonds in June and August 2023 with a total nominal volume of 
€1,250.0 million."
"A further euro bond with a nominal volume of 
€500.0 million was repaid in due time by Continental AG on Sep-
tember 12, 2023."
"As at the reporting date, Continental AG had not 
issued any commercial paper (PY: €349.5 million)."
"Bank loans and overdrafts decreased by €591.0 million to €565.3 
million (PY: €1,156.3 million)."
"This was primarily attributable to the 
revolving loan that had not been utilized as at the reporting date 
(PY: €300.0 million)."
"Liabilities to affiliated companies increased by €2,819.3 million 
year-on-year to €8,552.9 million (PY: €5,733.6 million)."
"This was  
primarily attributable to the provision of loans and overnight  
deposits made available to Continental AG by its subsidiaries."
"Other liabilities were comparable with the previous year, having  
declined by €1.7 million to €393.2 million (PY: €394.9 million)."
"Shareholders’ equity decreased by €723.4 million to €7,157.3 mil-
lion (PY: €7,880.7 million)."
"This resulted from the net loss of €423.4 
million generated in the fiscal year and the dividend distribution of 
€300.0 million carried out in fiscal 2023."
"The equity ratio decreased 
from 41.5% to 34.1%."
"Sales for fiscal 2023 rose by €59.2 million to €337.0 million  
(PY: €277.8 million), primarily due to the increase in sales from  
corporate services."
"Net investment income fell by €1,164.1 million year-on-year to 
€51.1 million (PY: €1,215.2 million)."
"As in the previous year, it 
mainly consisted of profit and loss transfers from the subsidiaries."
"The income from profit transfers of €767.0 million (PY: €1,439.9 
million) resulted in particular from Continental Caoutchouc-Export-
GmbH, Hanover (€390.0 million) and from Formpolster GmbH, 
Hanover (€369.5 million)."
"Expenses from the transfer of losses  
of €718.9 million were recorded in the fiscal year, which resulted  
entirely from the transfer of profits from Continental Automotive 
GmbH, Hanover."
"The negative net interest result increased by €183.0 million year-
on-year to €228.5 million in fiscal 2023 (PY: €45.5 million)."
"This in-
crease was primarily attributable to the global interest rate trend on 
the capital markets."
"Interest expense rose by €209.2 million in the fiscal year to €362.0 
million (PY: €152.8 million), with interest expenses to affiliated com-
panies increasing by €125.5 million to €207.6 million (PY: €82.1 
million)."
"Furthermore, the euro bonds issued by Continental AG led 
to expenses of €74.8 million (PY: €28.9 million)."
"A euro bond with a nominal volume of 
€500.0 million was repaid in due time by Continental AG on Sep-
tember 12, 2023."
The bond had an interest rate of 0.000% p.a.
"Interest income rose by €26.2 million in the fiscal year to €133.5 
million (PY: €107.3 million)."
"This was primarily due to interest  
income from affiliated companies."
"Tax expenses of €22.6 million (PY: tax income of €148.4 million)  
resulted mainly from non-imputable withholding taxes for the  
income tax consolidation group of Continental AG as well as addi-
tions to the provision for income tax."
"After taking income tax expense into account, Continental AG gen-
erated a net loss for the year of €423.4 million (PY: net income of 
€983.4 million)."
The after-tax return on equity was -5.9% (PY: 12.5%).
"As announced at the 2023 Capital Market Day, Continental AG has 
adjusted its target range for dividend distribution to between 20% 
and 40% of net income attributable to the shareholders."
"Taking into account the retained earnings brought forward from 
the previous year of €3,134.9 million and from the dividend distri-
bution of €300.0 million, as well as the resulting accumulated prof-
its of €2,834.9 million, retained earnings for fiscal 2023 amounted 
to €2,411.5 million."
"The Supervisory Board and Executive Board 
will propose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting the payment of a 
dividend of €2.20 per share entitled to dividends."
"The total distribu-
tion is therefore €440,013,162.60 for 200,005,983 shares entitled 
to dividends."
"The remaining retained earnings are to be carried for-
ward to new account."
"We expect further income from profit and loss transfers and in-
vestment income from the subsidiaries within the scope of the 
holding activities of Continental AG in fiscal 2024."
"Furthermore, 
Continental AG will continue to provide a financing function for its 
subsidiaries."

Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
93 
The overall situation is analyzed and 
managed corporate-wide using the risk  
and opportunity management system."
"As an integral part of the corporate strategy, Continental’s risk strat-
egy is aligned with the company’s strategic objectives and is cur-
rently being further formalized and developed."
"It aims to create 
long-term value while also taking into account the differentiation 
between the individual group sectors."
"We evaluate risks and oppor-
tunities continually and responsibly to achieve our goal of adding 
value."
"We define risk as the possibility of internal or external events occur-
ring that can have a negative influence on the attainment of our 
strategic and operational targets."
"As a global corporation, Continen-
tal is exposed to a number of different risks that could impair busi-
ness and, in extreme cases, threaten the company’s existence."
"At 
the same time, we aim to resolutely seize opportunities that arise, 
as described in the Strategy of the Continental Group section."
"We 
accept manageable risks if the resulting opportunities are expected 
to result in sustainable growth in value."
"We consider growth in 
value in terms of the Continental Value Contribution (CVC) system 
described in the Corporate Management section."
"Continental’s Internal Control and  
Risk Management System 
The governance systems at Continental comprise the internal con-
trol system (ICS), the risk management system (RMS) and – as a 
subcomponent of these systems – the compliance management 
system."
"The risk management system in turn also includes the 
early risk identification system in accordance with Section 91 (2)  
of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz – AktG)."
"The Executive Board is responsible for the governance systems, 
which include all subsidiaries."
"The Supervisory Board and its Audit 
Committee monitor the effectiveness of these systems."
"Certain aspects of sustainability are also considered and continu-
ously further developed in compliance with the regulatory frame-
work."
"The management and monitoring of the internal control sys-
tem are currently being incorporated into a holistic ICS governance 
system."
"Key elements of the corporate-wide internal control system are the 
clear allocation of responsibilities and system-inherent controls in 
the respective process flows."
"The two-person rule and separation  
of functions are fundamental principles of this organization."
"Conti-
nental’s management also issues guidelines to ensure that all busi-
ness processes are conducted in an economical, orderly and legally 
compliant manner."
"Guidelines specific to the Continental Group 
and to its individual group sectors are managed centrally in the 
“House of Rules” and are thus available to all Continental employees."
"Based on these fundamental principles and the globally applicable 
guidelines, the internal control system at Continental follows the 
Three Lines Model."
"In the first line, system-inherent controls are configured in the 
company’s IT systems to support the orderly and economical exe-
cution of all process flow transactions in accordance with the cor-
porate-wide guidelines."
"At the same time, these transactional con-
trols help to identify risks and deviations that require separate con-
sideration."
"As the controls and process flows established in the first 
line apply to Continental’s operating business, they are generally 
put in place at the level of our operating units, such as our subsidi-
aries, business areas and group sectors."
"In the second line of our internal control system, guidelines for 
process flows are developed, implemented and updated and com-
pliance with controls and guidelines is monitored."
"Responsibility for 
this lies primarily with the group functions, in addition to the busi-
ness areas and group sectors."
"The responsibilities include, for ex-
ample, the risk management system and the compliance manage-
ment system."
"The supervisory and monitoring function is per-
formed on the basis of regular reports and supplemented as needed 
with effectiveness tests as part of self-audits and regular internal 
and external reviews."
"The compliance management system plays an important role 
within the second line of defense by helping to prevent, detect and 
respond to compliance violations."
"The Group Compliance group 
function is responsible for the compliance management system."
"Report on Risks and Opportunities

The chief compliance officer reports directly to the Executive Board 
member responsible for Integrity and Law."
"The work done by Group 
Compliance focuses mainly on preventing and detecting corrup-
tion, fraud and other property offenses, violations of antitrust and 
competition law and money laundering; implementing data protec-
tion; and responding to compliance violations."
An effective culture of compliance is the basis for prevention.
"It be-
gins with setting an appropriate “tone from the top” by the Execu-
tive Board and management and, in addition to risk analysis, includes 
in particular employee training, compliance consulting and the in-
ternal publication of guidelines."
"In the course of risk analysis, the business activities of Continental 
are examined for compliance risks within the scope of top-down as 
well as bottom-up review processes."
"The risk of compliance viola-
tions arises primarily from organizational structures and workflows, 
the given market situation, activities in certain geographical re-
gions, inappropriate incentive systems, conflicts of interest, and 
criminal intent on the part of individual employees."
"Furthermore, 
findings from investigations by the Group Internal Audit group 
function as well as discussions with management and employees 
at all hierarchical levels are taken into account."
"This risk analysis  
is not a one-off procedure, but is performed annually and continu-
ously updated."
"In training events, 
Group Compliance addresses topics directly related to everyday 
compliance issues and challenges."
"Continental introduced the Business Partner Code of Conduct to 
prevent compliance violations by suppliers, service providers, rep-
resentatives or similar third parties."
"This must be recognized as a 
basic requirement for doing business with Continental."
"In the context of detection, Continental has set up an Integrity Hot-
line to give employees and third parties outside the Continental 
Group the opportunity to report violations of legal regulations, its 
fundamental values and ethical standards."
"Information on any kind 
of potential violations, including accounting manipulation, can be 
reported anonymously via this hotline."
"The hotline is available 
worldwide in many different languages."
"The company’s investigat-
ing units rigorously pursue any and all substantiated leads."
"Detection also includes the support of regular and incident-related 
audits conducted by Group Internal Audit."
"Compliance-related is-
sues are regularly the subject of audits by Group Internal Audit."
"Responses are aimed at implementing measures as a consequence 
of identified compliance violations."
"Group Compliance is involved in 
decision-making on measures that may be required, including thor-
ough analysis to ensure that isolated incidents are not symptoms 
of failings in the system."
"In this way, corresponding gaps can be 
closed preventively and the compliance management system, as 
well as the internal control system, can be systematically developed."
"When it comes to preventing violations in the area of technical 
compliance, responsibility lies with the Group Quality, Technical 
Compliance, CBS and Environment group function, supported by 
the central functions within the group sectors."
"The technical com-
pliance policy as well as the technical compliance management 
system manual and other procedural standards set out how the 
compliance management system is designed and implemented."
"A network of supporting roles in the various functions within the 
group sectors, business areas, segments and sites is being devised 
and expanded on an ongoing basis in order to support the identifi-
cation of risks and other technical compliance considerations."
"The third line of our internal control system is our Group Internal 
Audit group function."
"Group Internal Audit serves an independent and objective auditing 
and advisory function, applying a systematic approach to help re-
view, assess and improve the adequacy and effectiveness of the or-
ganization’s governance systems."
"Continental’s Executive Board au-
thorizes Group Internal Audit to conduct audits in all regions, com-
panies or functions of Continental AG and its affiliated, fully consoli-
dated subsidiaries worldwide."
"Group Internal Audit prepares an annual risk-oriented audit plan 
that is submitted to Continental’s Executive Board for review and 
approval."
"In addition to its planned general audits, Group Internal 
Audit also conducts special investigations."
"These are based on tips 
and information about fraudulent acts received from internal or  
external sources such as the Integrity Hotline or the ombudsman’s 
office."
"Group Internal Audit regularly reports its audit and investigation  
results to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee."
"Significant 
risks and potential improvements to internal controls are presented 
as part of the reporting to the aforementioned bodies."
"The imple-
mentation by management of the measures recommended in the 
course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and re-
ported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee."
"All parts of the 
risk management system and internal control system that could 
have a material effect on the annual and consolidated financial 
statements must be included in the reporting."
"The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG are pre-
pared on the basis of standard reporting by the subsidiaries in-
cluded in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)."
"Reporting is per-
formed in compliance with IFRS and with the accounting manual 
applicable throughout the Continental Group."
"The consolidation of 
subsidiaries, debt, income and expenses, and intercompany profits 
is performed at corporate level."
"The effectiveness of the financial reporting internal control system 
(Financial Reporting ICS) is evaluated in major areas by carrying 
out effectiveness tests in the reporting units on a quarterly basis."
"In 
addition, Group Internal Audit reviews the efficiency and effective-
ness of control processes as well as compliance with internal and 
external requirements."
"If any weaknesses are identified, the Conti-
nental Group’s management initiates the necessary measures."
"In addition,  
this also further increases corporate-wide risk awareness and  
establishes the framework for a uniform risk culture."
"The GRC system incorporates all components of risk reporting and 
the examination of the effectiveness of the Financial Reporting ICS."
"Risks are identified, assessed and reported at the organizational 
level that is also responsible for managing the identified risks."
"A 
multi-stage assessment process is used to involve also the higher-
level organizational units."
"The GRC system thus includes all report-
ing levels, from the company level to the top corporate level."
"At the corporate level, the responsibilities of the GRC Committee in-
clude identifying material risks for the Continental Group, based on 
a multi-stage reporting process, as well as complying with and im-
plementing the GRC policy."
"The GRC Committee regularly informs 
the Executive Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory 
Board of the material risks, any weaknesses in the control system 
and measures taken."
"Moreover, the auditor is required to report to 
the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regarding any mate-
rial weaknesses in the Financial Reporting ICS which they have 
identified as part of their audit activities."
"A period under consideration of one year is always applied when 
evaluating risks and opportunities."
"Risks and their effects are as-
sessed using an end-to-end gross and net assessment methodol-
ogy that helps to identify the impact of risk mitigation measures."
"Risks are assessed primarily according to quantitative criteria in 
various categories."
"If a risk cannot be assessed quantitatively, then 
it is assessed qualitatively based on the potential negative effects 
its occurrence would have on achieving corporate goals and based 
on other qualitative criteria such as the impact on Continental’s 
reputation."
Risks and opportunities are not offset.
"Material individual risks for the Continental Group are identified 
from all the reported risks based on the probability of occurrence 
and the potential amount of damage that would be caused in the 
period under consideration."
"Quantified risks are based on EBIT  
effect and free cash flow effect."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
96 
Local management can utilize various instruments for risk assess-
ment, such as predefined risk categories (e.g."
"exchange-rate risks, 
product-liability risks, legal risks) and assessment criteria, centrally 
developed function-specific questionnaires as well as the Financial 
Reporting ICS’s process and control descriptions."
"The key controls 
in business processes (purchase to pay, order to cash, asset man-
agement, HR, IT authorizations, the financial statement closing pro-
cess and sustainability reporting) are thus tested with respect to 
their effectiveness."
"All major subsidiaries carry out a semiannual assessment of busi-
ness-related risks and an annual assessment of compliance risks in 
the GRC system’s IT-aided risk management application."
"Any qual-
ity, legal and compliance cases that have actually occurred are also 
taken into account when assessing these risks."
"The GRC system 
likewise encompasses the tax compliance management system, 
the customs compliance management system and the export con-
trol compliance management system in order to ensure standard 
and regular review and reporting of pertinent risks."
"The quarterly 
Financial Reporting ICS completes regular GRC reporting."
"In the reporting year, Continental redesigned its process for identi-
fying and reporting strategic risks and began implementing these 
procedures in the established GRC process."
"Any new material risks 
arising ad hoc between regular reporting dates have to be reported 
immediately and considered by the GRC Committee."
"These also in-
clude risks identified in the audits performed by group functions."
"In addition to the risk analyses carried out by the reporting units as 
part of integrated GRC, audits are also performed by Group Internal 
Audit."
"Furthermore, the various controlling functions analyze the 
key figures provided as part of this reporting process at corporate 
and group-sector level in order to assess the effects of potential 
risks."
"For each risk identified, the responsible management team initiates 
appropriate countermeasures which, for material risks, are also doc-
umented in the GRC system."
"The GRC Committee monitors and 
consolidates the material risks and suitable countermeasures at the 
corporate level."
"It regularly reports to the Executive Board and rec-
ommends further measures if needed."
"The Executive Board dis-
cusses and resolves the measures and reports to the Supervisory 
Board’s Audit Committee."
"The responsible bodies continually moni-
tor the development of all identified risks and the progress of ac-
tions initiated."
"Group Internal Audit regularly audits the risk man-
agement process, thereby continually monitoring its effectiveness 
and further development."
"The function-specific statements, collected on the basis of a risk-
oriented selection process, included various aspects in accordance 
with the implemented Three Lines model."
"In the first line, docu-
mented processes and controls were checked with respect to 
whether these were in place and had been implemented, as was 
any communication relating to these elements."
"These not only reinforce com-
pliance with regulatory provisions, but also underscore the appro-
priate and effective operation of systems implemented at Continen-
tal in accordance with industry standards."
"Monitoring the internal 
control system and risk management system is one of the core 
tasks of Group Internal Audit, the third line."
"As part of its audits, 
Group Internal Audit assesses the implementation of risk-control 
measures and internal controls, conducted with the help of recog-
nized standards and methods."
"Deviations and weaknesses noted 
are summarized in a report for the relevant persons responsible, 
and any improvement measures initiated."
"Significant risks and po-
tential improvements to internal controls are presented as part of 
the reporting to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee."
"The 
implementation by management of the measures recommended in 
the course of audits is also monitored by Group Internal Audit and 
reported to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee."
"The internal control and risk management system, including the 
compliance management system, of Continental AG is undergoing 
a continuous process of improvement in order to expand existing 
processes and controls and meet new regulatory challenges."
"Cur-
rently, this mainly includes implementing a technical compliance 
management system and improving IT governance and data com-
pliance."
"In addition, the global reorganization of the customs and 
export control functions is currently being driven forward and 
transferred to a comprehensive compliance management system."
"In a cross-domain project, work is also being done on a reinforced 
integrative approach and expansion of the governance functions."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations to any internal control 
or risk management system, including the compliance manage-
ment system."
"Even a system considered appropriate and effective 
does not offer any guarantee that all risks or violations that have 
actually occurred will be uncovered in advance or that any process 
disruptions can be entirely ruled out."
"Opportunity management 
As part of our opportunity management activities, we assess mar-
ket and economic analyses and changes in legal requirements (e.g."
"with regard to fuel consumption and emission standards as well as 
safety regulations)."
"In addition, we deal with the corresponding ef-
fects on the sectors and markets relevant to us, our production fac-
tors and the composition and further development of our product 
portfolio."
"If no quantitative in-
formation on the amount of damage is provided, the assessment  
is carried out on the basis of qualitative criteria."
"Unless the empha-
sis is placed on a specific group sector, the risks apply to all group 
sectors."
"Financial Risks 
Continental is exposed to risks in connection with its financing 
agreements and the syndicated loan."
"Continental is subject to risks in connection with its financing 
agreements."
"Risks arise from the bonds that Continental AG and 
Conti-Gummi-Finance B.V., Maastricht, Netherlands, have issued as 
part of the Debt Issuance Programme (DIP)."
"These financing agree-
ments contain covenants that could limit Continental’s capacity to 
take action as well as change-of-control provisions."
"In order to finance current business activities as well as investments 
and payment obligations, a syndicated loan agreement is in place, 
from which risks may arise."
"Under the terms of the syndicated loan 
agreement, the lenders have the right to demand repayment of the 
loan in the event of a change of control at Continental AG."
"The requirements for and consequences of a change in control in 
accordance with the terms of the bonds or the syndicated loan 
agreement are described in detail in the Additional Disclosures and 
Notes Pursuant to Sections 289a and 315a HGB section on pages 
90 and 91."
"The loans and bonds cited here could also immediately 
become due and payable if other financing agreements of more 
than €75.0 million are not repaid on time or are prematurely called 
for repayment."
"Continental continuously monitors compliance with 
the applicable conditions."
"The committed volume of the syndicated loan consists of a revolv-
ing tranche of €4.0 billion (due in December 2026)."
"As at the end 
of fiscal 2023, €316.3 million of the revolving tranche had been 
utilized."
"Continental is exposed to risks associated with changes in 
currency exchange rates and hedging."
"Continental operates worldwide and is therefore exposed to finan-
cial risks that arise from changes in exchange rates."
"This could re-
sult in losses if assets denominated in currencies with a falling ex-
change rate lose value and/or liabilities denominated in currencies 
with a rising exchange rate appreciate."
"In addition, fluctuations in 
exchange rates could intensify or reduce fluctuations in the prices 
of raw materials in euros, as Continental sources a considerable 
portion of its raw materials in foreign currency."
"As a result of these 
factors, fluctuations in exchange rates can influence Continental’s 
earnings situation."
"Moreover, Continental is exposed to exchange-rate risks arising 
from external and internal loan agreements that result in cash in-
flows and outflows denominated in currencies other than the func-
tional currency of the respective subsidiary of the Continental 
Group."
"These exchange-rate risks are in general hedged against by 
using appropriate derivative instruments, particularly currency for-
wards, currency swaps and cross-currency interest-rate swaps."
"Any 
hedging transactions executed in the form of derivative instruments 
can result in losses."
"Continental is exposed to default risks in connection with cash 
and cash equivalents, derivative instruments and interest-
bearing investments."
"In order to minimize the default risk for cash and cash equivalents, 
derivative instruments and interest-bearing investments, Continen-
tal generally uses banks that it has classified as core banks on the 
basis of defined criteria."
"As a general rule, these banks should have 
at least one investment-grade credit rating from one of the global 
rating agencies."
"The default risk can therefore be considered very 
low."
"The creditworthiness of the core banks – and of other banks 
with which investments are made, loans are granted or derivative 
instruments are traded in derogation from the core bank principle 
for operational or regulatory reasons – is continuously monitored."
"Not only the credit ratings but also in particular the premiums for 
insuring against credit default risks (credit default swaps, CDSs) are 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities

monitored, provided this information is available."
"In addition, Conti-
nental sets investment limits for each bank and trading limits for 
derivative instruments."
"The amount of these limits is based on the 
creditworthiness of the respective bank."
"Compliance with these  
limits is continuously monitored."
"Within the internally defined risk 
groups, the cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing investments 
and positive (net) fair values of derivative instruments held at banks 
assigned to a higher risk group range from €100 million to 
€200 million."
"Risks Related to the Markets in which 
Continental Operates 
Continental could be exposed to material risks in connection 
with a global financial and economic crisis."
"With a 64% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – 
with the exception of the replacement business – is Continental’s 
most important customer group."
"The remainder of its sales are 
generated from the replacement or industrial markets, mainly in 
the replacement markets for passenger-car and truck tires and to  
a lesser extent in the non-automotive end markets of the other 
group sectors."
"The automotive markets recovered in the year under review, despite 
the ongoing high level of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncer-
tainty."
"Should this revival not last in the long term or be dampened 
by a general economic downturn, it would likely adversely affect 
Continental’s sales and earnings."
"In the year under review, Continental’s five largest OEM customers 
(BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and VW) generated approxi-
mately 34% of sales."
"If one or more of Continental’s OEM custom-
ers is lost or terminates a supply contract prematurely, the original 
investments made by Continental to provide such products or out-
standing claims against such customers could be wholly or par-
tially lost."
"Moreover, Continental generated 48% of its 2023 total sales in  
Europe and 19% in Germany alone."
"By comparison, 27% of Conti-
nental’s total sales in 2023 were generated in North America, 21% 
in Asia-Pacific and 4% in other countries."
"Therefore, in the event  
of an economic downturn in Europe, particularly in Germany, for  
example, Continental’s business and earnings situation could be  
affected more extensively than that of its competitors."
"Furthermore, 
the automotive and tire markets in Europe and North America are 
largely saturated."
"To minimize this dependence, Continental is striv-
ing to improve its regional sales balance, particularly by generating 
more sales in emerging markets and especially in Asia."
"Based on a scenario analysis that assumes a 10% decline in sales 
volume in 2024 compared with planning assumptions, and taking 
into account measures required as a result, we anticipate a possible 
decline of around 3 percentage points in the adjusted EBIT margin."
Continental operates in a cyclical industry.
"With a 64% share of consolidated sales, the automotive industry – 
with the exception of the replacement business – is Continental’s 
most important customer group."
"Global production of vehicles and, 
as a result, sales to OEMs are subjected to major fluctuations in 
some cases."
"They depend, among other things, on general eco-
nomic conditions, disposable income and household consumer 
spending and preferences, which can be affected by a number of 
factors, including fuel costs as well as the availability and cost of 
consumer financing."
"As the volume of automotive production fluc-
tuates, the demand for Continental’s products also fluctuates, as 
OEMs generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities 
from their suppliers or to fixed prices."
"It is difficult to predict future 
developments in the markets Continental serves, which also makes 
it harder to estimate the requirements for production capacity."
"As 
Continental’s business is characterized by high fixed costs, it is thus 
exposed to the risk that fixed costs are not fully covered in the event 
of falling demand and the resulting underutilization of its facilities 
(particularly in Automotive)."
"Conversely, should the markets in 
which Continental operates once again grow faster than anticipated, 
there could be insufficient capacity to meet customer demand."
"To 
reduce the impact of the potential risk resulting from this depend-
ence on the automotive industry, Continental is strengthening its 
replacement business and industrial business, including by means 
of acquisitions."
Continental is exposed to geopolitical risks.
"Current geopolitical developments such as the war in Ukraine, the 
conflict in the Middle East and the ongoing conflict between China 
and Taiwan could have significant effects on Continental’s sales and 
procurement markets."
"These include sanctions and other risks in 
supply chains as well as unforeseeable effects on the global econ-
omy."
"Continental constantly monitors current developments and 
derives possible scenarios and necessary measures."
"Continental is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of raw 
materials and electronic components as well as the risk of 
rising logistics costs."
"For the Automotive group sector, higher prices for raw materials 
and electronic components in particular can result in cost increases."
"The Tires and ContiTech group sectors mainly use natural and syn-
thetic rubber as well as oil-based raw materials."
"The prices for these 
raw materials and components are exposed to sometimes consid-
erable fluctuations worldwide, although the situation on the raw 
materials markets has eased compared with the previous year."
"At 
present, Continental does not actively hedge against the risk of  
rising prices of electronic components or raw materials by using 
derivative instruments."
"In addition, increases in logistics costs can 
occur, for example due to the armed conflicts around the Red Sea 
and the resulting changes to transportation routes."
"If the company 
is not able to compensate for the increased costs or to pass them 
on to customers, these price increases could reduce Continental’s 
earnings by €100 million to €200 million."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
100 
Continental is exposed to risks associated with additional or 
higher tariffs."
"Due to the trend toward protectionism and the increase in trade 
conflicts around the world, Continental sees itself at risk from addi-
tional or higher tariffs on automobiles and on the products, compo-
nents and raw materials it supplies or purchases."
"These tariffs could 
cause demand for Continental’s products to drop and costs to in-
crease, which would have an adverse effect on Continental’s busi-
ness and earnings situation."
"Risks Related to Continental’s Business 
Operations 
Continental depends on a limited number of key suppliers for 
certain products."
"Continental is subject to the potential risk of unavailability of cer-
tain raw materials and production materials."
"Continental tries to limit these risks by en-
deavoring to select suppliers carefully and monitor them regularly."
"However, if one of Continental’s suppliers is unable to meet its deliv-
ery obligations (e.g."
"Such developments and events can therefore 
cause delays in the delivery or completion of Continental products 
or projects and could result in Continental having to purchase 
products or services from third parties at higher costs or even to  
financially support its own suppliers."
"Claims for damages on a considerable scale can also not 
be ruled out."
"Furthermore, Continental’s reputation among OEM 
customers could suffer, with the possible consequence that they 
select a different supplier."
Continental is exposed to information-technology risks.
"With regard to its business and production processes, its products 
and its internal and external communication, Continental is highly 
dependent on centralized and standardized information-technol-
ogy systems and networks."
"These systems and networks as well as 
the products themselves are potentially exposed to the risk of vari-
ous forms of cybercrime as well as damage and disruption that can 
have a wide range of other causes."
"In hacker attacks, third parties 
could attempt to gain unauthorized access to confidential information 
and data that is stored, processed or communicated in the systems 
and networks."
"In addition, data, products and systems could be 
blocked, damaged, controlled or destroyed as a result of becoming 
infected with viruses or malware."
"During a cyberattack that was discovered in August 2022, attack-
ers infiltrated parts of Continental’s IT systems and copied several 
terabytes of data before the attack could be stopped."
"Continental 
subsequently received ransom demands from the alleged attack-
ers, who threatened to publish the copied data."
"Continental did not 
respond to the demands."
"The hacker group published a list of the 
data that it claimed to have in its possession."
"With the support of 
external cybersecurity experts, Continental is conducting an inves-
tigation into the incident and the data affected."
"Rights to infor-
mation and claims for damages are also being asserted, both in 
and out of court."
"The number of legal proceedings in connection 
with this incident is currently still manageable."
"The possibility that 
further court proceedings could follow cannot be ruled out."
"No 
fines were imposed against Continental in the context of this cyber-
attack."
"Continental’s business activities were not affected by the at-
tack at any point, and Continental maintains full control over its IT 
systems."
"The measures taken to minimize such risks in-
clude technical and organizational precautions such as duplicated 
data storage and contingency plans, as well as suitable training 
measures that are continuously expanded, particularly to raise 
awareness of the growing threat from cybercrime."
"Should the precautions taken prove insufficient to adequately pro-
tect the systems, networks, products and information, Continental 
could suffer considerable damage and disadvantages as a result of 
outages or the knowledge and use of its information by third parties."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
101 
Continental is exposed to risks in connection with its pension 
commitments."
"Continental provides defined benefit pension plans in Germany, the 
USA, the UK and certain other countries."
"As at December 31, 2023, 
the pension obligations amounted to €5,646.0 million."
"These exist-
ing obligations are financed predominantly through externally in-
vested pension plan assets."
"In 2006, Continental established legally 
independent trust funds under contractual trust arrangements 
(CTAs) for the funding of pension obligations of certain subsidiaries 
in Germany."
"In 2007, Continental assumed additional CTAs in con-
nection with the acquisition of Siemens VDO."
"As at December 31, 
2023, Continental’s net pension obligations (defined benefit obliga-
tions less the fair value of plan assets) amounted to €2,580.4 million."
"Continental’s externally invested plan assets are funded by exter-
nally managed funds and insurance companies."
"While Continental 
generally prescribes the investment strategies applied by these 
funds and takes these into account when selecting external fund 
managers, it does not have any influence over their individual in-
vestment decisions."
"The assets are invested in different asset clas-
ses, including equity, fixed-income securities, real estate and other 
investment vehicles."
"The values attributable to the externally in-
vested plan assets are subject to fluctuations in the capital markets 
that are beyond Continental’s influence."
"Unfavorable developments 
in the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage short-
fall for these pension obligations, resulting in a significant increase 
in Continental’s net pension obligations."
"Any such increase in Continental’s net pension obligations could 
adversely affect Continental’s financial condition due to an in-
creased additional outflow of funds to finance the pension obliga-
tions."
"Also, Continental is exposed to risks associated with longevity 
and interest-rate changes in connection with its pension commit-
ments, as an interest-rate decrease could have an adverse effect on 
Continental’s liabilities under these pension plans."
"Furthermore, cer-
tain US-based subsidiaries of Continental have entered into obliga-
tions to make contributions to healthcare costs of former employ-
ees and retirees."
"Accordingly, Continental is exposed to the poten-
tial risk that these costs may increase in the future."
"How-
ever, this would not affect EBIT."
"Continental is exposed to risks associated with warranty and 
product liability claims."
"In its quality strategy, Continental has defined the framework condi-
tions for all quality-related activities and ascribes the highest prior-
ity to quality."
"However, Continental is constantly subject to product 
liability claims and proceedings alleging violations of due care, viola-
tion of warranty obligations or material defects, and claims arising 
from breaches of contract due to recalls or government proceed-
ings."
"Any such lawsuits, proceedings and other claims could result 
in increased costs for Continental."
"Moreover, defective products 
could result in loss of sales and loss of customer and market ac-
ceptance."
"Such risks are insured up to levels considered economi-
cally reasonable by Continental, but its insurance coverage could 
prove insufficient in individual cases."
"Additionally, any defect in one 
of Continental’s products (in particular tires and other safety-related 
products) could also have a considerable adverse effect on the 
company’s reputation and market perception."
"This could in turn 
have a negative impact on Continental’s sales and income."
"Moreo-
ver, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring a contribution 
from their suppliers for potential product liability, warranty and re-
call claims."
"In addition, Continental is subject to continuing efforts 
by its customers to change contract terms and conditions concern-
ing the contribution to warranty and recall cost."
"Furthermore, Conti-
nental manufactures many products pursuant to OEM customer 
specifications and quality requirements."
"If the products manufac-
tured and delivered by Continental do not meet the requirements 
stipulated by its OEM customers at the agreed date of delivery, pro-
duction of the relevant products is generally discontinued until the 
cause of the product defect has been identified and remedied."
"Un-
der certain circumstances, this could lead to losses of sales and 
earnings."
"Furthermore, Continental’s OEM customers could poten-
tially claim damages, even if the cause of the defect is remedied at 
a later point in time."
"Moreover, failure to fulfill quality requirements 
could have an adverse effect on the market acceptance of Conti-
nental’s other products and its market reputation in various market 
segments."
"The quantifiable risks from warranty and product liability claims as 
at December 31, 2023, taking into account provisions, amounted 
to around €100 million."
"Continental is exposed to risks from trade restrictions, 
sanctions and export controls."
"Due to the global alignment of the economic activity of the Conti-
nental Group, there are business risks with respect to embargoes, 
sanctions and export controls."
"As a global company, Continental 
also has business relations with customers and partners based in 
countries that are – or may be in the future – subject to export re-
strictions, embargoes, economic sanctions or other forms of trade 
restrictions."
"In addition to the fundamental influence that such re-
strictions have on the business activity of the Continental Group,  
violations of relevant provisions may lead to considerable penalties, 
administrative sanctions, damage to the company’s reputation, as 
well as claims for damages."
"Continental may also be forced, through 
new trade restrictions, to limit or put an end to business activity in 
certain countries or regions."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
102 
Continental could be adversely affected by property loss and 
business interruption."
"Fire, natural hazards, terrorism, power failures or other disturbances 
at Continental’s production facilities or within Continental’s supply 
chain – with customers and with suppliers – can result in severe 
damage and loss."
"Such far-reaching negative consequences can 
also arise from political unrest or instability."
"Due to climate change, 
the probability of natural hazards, in particular extreme weather 
events, is expected to continue to rise and the extent of damage to 
increase."
"The risks arising from business interruption, loss of pro-
duction or the financing of facilities are insured up to levels consid-
ered economically reasonable by Continental, but its insurance cov-
erage could prove insufficient in individual cases."
"Furthermore, 
such events could injure or damage individuals, third-party prop-
erty or the environment, which could, among other things, lead to 
considerable financial costs for Continental."
"Continental is exposed to risks in connection with its interest 
in MC Projects B.V."
"Continental and Compagnie Financière Michelin SAS, Clermont-Fer-
rand, France (Michelin), each hold a 50% stake in MC Projects B.V., 
Maastricht, Netherlands, a company to which Michelin contributed 
the rights to the Uniroyal brand for Europe as well as for certain 
countries outside Europe."
"In turn, MC Projects B.V."
"licensed to Conti-
nental certain rights to use the Uniroyal brand on or in connection 
with tires in Europe and elsewhere."
"Under the terms of the agree-
ment concluded in this connection, both the agreement and the 
Uniroyal license can be terminated if a major competitor in the tire 
business acquires more than 50% of the voting rights of Continen-
tal AG or of its tire business."
"Furthermore, in this case Michelin also 
has the right to acquire a majority in MC Projects B.V."
"and to have 
MC Projects B.V."
"increase its minority stake in the manufacturing 
company Continental Barum s.r.o., Otrokovice, Czechia – one of 
Continental’s largest tire plants in Europe – to 51%."
"These events 
could have an adverse effect on the business and earnings position 
of Continental’s Tires group sector."
"Legal, Tax and Environmental Risks 
Continental could be threatened with fines and claims for 
damages for alleged or actual unlawful behavior."
"Despite the compliance management system in place at Continen-
tal, the global nature of the Continental Group’s business activities 
means there is a possibility that unlawful behavior (e.g."
"corruption, 
fraud, violations of antitrust and competition law, money launder-
ing) could occur in individual cases or that Continental could be  
accused of unlawful behavior."
"This alleged or actual unlawful be-
havior could lead to fines or claims for damages."
"Significant pro-
ceedings in this context are outlined below."
"In May 2005, the Brazilian competition authorities opened investi-
gations against Continental’s Brazilian subsidiary Continental Brasil 
Industria Automotiva Ltda., Guarulhos, Brazil (CBIA), following a 
complaint of anticompetitive behavior in the area of commercializa-
tion of tachographs."
"On August 18, 2010, the Brazilian antitrust au-
thorities determined an “invitation to cartel” and imposed a fine of 
BRL 12 million (around €2.2 million) on CBIA, which was then re-
duced to BRL 10.8 million (around €2.0 million)."
"CBIA denies the 
accusation that it has infringed Brazilian antitrust law."
"Although the 
court of first instance appealed to by CBIA upheld the decision, on 
CBIA’s further appeal the next higher court annulled this decision 
and remanded the matter."
"In February 2023, the court of first in-
stance rendered a verdict against CBIA and lifted the ban on the 
enforcement of the financial penalty against CBIA (at that time an 
amount of BRL 34.2 million [around €6.5 million])."
"CBIA filed a mo-
tion for clarification requesting that the preliminary injunction 
against enforcement remain in full force up until a final and unap-
pealable ruling is made."
"This motion was denied, and CBIA filed an 
appeal against this decision."
"In case an infringement of Brazilian  
antitrust law is found, third parties may, in addition, claim damages 
from CBIA."
"On October 2, 2006, South African antitrust authorities received a 
complaint from a third party accusing several South African tire 
manufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior, including Continental 
Tyre South Africa (Pty.) Ltd., Port Elizabeth, South Africa (CTSA), a 
subsidiary of Continental."
"On August 31, 2010, the South African 
antitrust authorities came to the conclusion that CTSA had violated 
South African antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsi-
ble antitrust court for a decision."
"CTSA denies the allegation of in-
fringements of South African antitrust law."
"However, the tribunal 
could impose a fine of up to 10% of CTSA’s sales."
"In addition, third 
parties may also claim damages from CTSA in case of an infringe-
ment of South African competition law."
"In the USA, CAE and Continental Automo-
tive Korea Ltd., Seongnam-si, South Korea, agreed to pay a fine of 
US $4.0 million (approximately €3.6 million) in 2015."
"The risk  
of investigations by other antitrust authorities into this matter and 
claims for damages by further alleged victims remain unaffected by 
the fines imposed."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
103 
As a result of investigations that came to light in 2014, the European 
Commission imposed a fine of €44.0 million on Continental AG; Con-
tinental Teves AG & Co."
"oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; and Conti-
nental Automotive GmbH, Hanover, Germany; on February 21, 
2018, for the unlawful exchange of information."
"This involved spe-
cific brake components."
Continental has paid this fine.
"Customers 
have since approached Continental to claim for damages, in some 
cases for specific amounts."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG filed for de-
claratory judgment action with the Hanover District Court against 
Continental AG and two other companies of the Continental Group 
in December 2022."
"In April 2023, several companies of the Stel-
lantis Group as well as several companies of the Renault Group 
filed a civil lawsuit in each case against Continental AG and three 
other companies of the Continental Group before the High Court  
in London, United Kingdom."
"Both the Stellantis Group and the Re-
nault Group are yet to attach any specific amount to their claims, 
and these are also yet to be delivered to Continental."
"In addition, 
two class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada against Conti-
nental AG and several of its subsidiaries."
"Continental believes that 
these claims and lawsuits are without merit."
"However, should the 
lawsuits lead to a judgment against Continental, the resulting ex-
penses could be substantial and exceed the provision set aside for 
this purpose."
"In accordance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no 
further disclosures will be made with regard to the proceedings 
and the related measures so as not to adversely affect the com-
pany’s interests."
"On March 3, 2021, the Brazilian antitrust authorities (Conselho  
Administrativo de Defesa Econômica, CADE), acting on the basis of 
the issues addressed by the European Commission and described 
above, formally initiated proceedings against Continental Teves 
AG & Co."
"oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and certain former em-
ployees for alleged unlawful exchange of competition-sensitive in-
formation concerning hydraulic brake systems."
"Continental consid-
ers it possible that this proceeding will end with a fine."
"Continental 
is therefore unable to reliably predict in any way what the outcome 
of these proceedings will be."
"If Continental is found responsible for 
any violation, CADE could impose a fine on the company of 0.1% to 
20% of its revenue or that of the Continental Group in Brazil in the 
year prior to when the administrative proceedings were launched 
(2020)."
Non-pecuniary penalties may also be possible.
"Furthermore, 
customers allegedly affected by the alleged exchange of information 
could claim for damages if indeed a violation of Brazilian antitrust 
law is established."
"Continental AG and individual 
companies of the Continental Group are ancillary parties to these 
proceedings."
"The investigations concern activities of the former 
Powertrain business area that were transferred within the scope  
of the spin-off to Vitesco Technologies Group AG, Regensburg,  
Germany, and its subsidiaries in 2021."
"Both the investigations by the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover 
and the company’s internal investigation into the matters covered 
by these proceedings, which involve considerable costs and effort, 
are ongoing."
"Continental AG and the companies of the Continental 
Group are continuing to cooperate with the public prosecutor’s of-
fice in Hanover."
"There is a risk that fines will be imposed as a result 
of the allegations."
"The amount of such fines, which could comprise 
a levy and a penalty component, is currently unknown but collec-
tively could be significant."
"Furthermore, the risk of damage to the 
company’s reputation cannot be ruled out."
"To cover risks of fines arising from the proceedings conducted by 
the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover, a provision amounting to 
a high eight-figure sum had been set aside as at December 31, 
2023."
"This is consistent with the 
agreement between the parties that all opportunities as well as all 
risks arising from the transferred business shall pass to Vitesco 
Technologies Group AG and the companies of Vitesco Technolo-
gies."
"These regulations have not been taken into account in the for-
mation of the provision described above."
"In accordance with IAS 
37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made with  
regard to the proceedings and the related measures and any  
potential claims against Vitesco Technologies Group AG so as  
not to adversely affect the company’s interests."
"In view of the scope of these national and international investiga-
tions against automotive manufacturers and suppliers, further pro-
ceedings by public authorities, civil legal proceedings and claims  
by third parties, along with the related financial risks, cannot be 
ruled out."
"As part of industry-wide searches, the European Commission  
began conducting a search of the premises of Continental AG on 
January 30, 2024, due to alleged antitrust violations."
"On the same 
day, Germany’s Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) searched 
the premises of TON Tyres Over Night Trading GmbH, Schondra-
Schildeck, Germany, a subsidiary of Continental, also due to alleged 
industry-wide antitrust violations."
"Both proceedings are at a very 
early stage."
"Continental is therefore unable to reliably predict in any 
way what the outcome of these proceedings will be."
"In the event 
that Continental is responsible for any such violation, the European 
Commission and the Bundeskartellamt could each impose substan-
tial fines."
"Furthermore, customers allegedly affected by the alleged 
exchange of information could claim for damages."
"In this context, 
class action lawsuits have already been filed in the USA and Can-
ada against Continental and other tire manufacturers."
"Continental 
has not yet been served with the lawsuits."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
104 
There is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial 
property rights of third parties."
"There is a risk that Continental could infringe on the industrial 
property rights of third parties, since its competitors, suppliers and 
customers also submit a large number of inventions for industrial 
property protection."
"It is not always possible to determine with cer-
tainty whether there are effective and enforceable third-party in-
dustrial property rights to certain processes, methods or applica-
tions."
"Therefore, third parties could assert claims (including illegiti-
mate ones) of alleged infringements of industrial property rights 
against Continental."
"As a result, Continental could be required to 
cease manufacturing, using or marketing the relevant technologies 
or products in certain countries, or be forced to make changes to 
manufacturing processes and/or products."
"In addition, Continental 
could be liable to pay compensation for infringements or could be 
forced to purchase licenses to continue using technology from 
third parties."
"Continental, for example, supplies telecommunication modules that 
transmit vehicle data, enable voice and internet functionality, and 
are compatible with cellular communication standards."
"In addition, Continental is subject to 
efforts by its customers to change contract terms and conditions 
concerning the participation in disputes regarding alleged infringe-
ments of intellectual property rights."
"Continental has formed provi-
sions to cover the risks in this regard."
"In accordance with IAS 37.92 
and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made so as not to 
adversely affect the company’s interests."
"Continental could become subject to additional burdensome 
environmental or safety regulations, and new regulations 
could adversely affect demand for the company’s products 
and services."
"This also applies to air, water and soil pollution regulations 
and to waste legislation, all of which have recently become more 
stringent through new laws, particularly in the European Union and 
the USA."
"Continental could be affected in particular by greater re-
strictions on the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)."
"Moreover, Continental’s locations and operations necessitate vari-
ous permits, and the requirements specified therein must be com-
plied with."
"In the past, adjusting to new requirements has necessi-
tated investments, and Continental assumes that further investments 
in this regard will be required in the future."
Continental is exposed to risks from legal disputes.
"Companies from the Continental Group are involved in a number  
of legal and arbitration proceedings and could become involved in 
other such proceedings in the future."
"These proceedings could in-
volve substantial claims for damages or payments, particularly in 
the USA."
"For more information on legal disputes, see Note 36 of 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Continental could be unsuccessful in adequately protecting its 
intellectual property and technical expertise."
"Continental’s products and services are highly dependent upon its 
technological know-how and the scope and limitations of its propri-
etary rights therein."
"Continental has obtained or applied for a large 
number of patents and other industrial property rights that are of 
considerable importance to its business."
"The process of obtaining 
patent protection can be lengthy and expensive."
"Furthermore, pa-
tents may not be granted on currently pending or future applica-
tions or may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide Conti-
nental with meaningful protection or commercial advantage."
"In ad-
dition, although there is a presumption that patents are valid, this 
does not necessarily mean that the patent concerned is effective  
or that possible patent claims can be enforced to the degree neces-
sary or desired."
"A major part of Continental’s know-how and trade secrets is not  
patented or cannot be protected through industrial property rights."
"Consequently, there is a risk that certain parts of Continental’s 
know-how and trade secrets could be transferred to collaboration 
partners, customers and suppliers, including Continental’s machin-
ery suppliers or plant vendors."
"This poses a risk that competitors 
will copy Continental’s know-how without incurring any expenses 
of their own."
"Moreover, Continental has concluded a number of li-
cense, cross-license, collaboration and development agreements 
with its customers, competitors and other third parties under which 
Continental is granted rights to industrial property and/or know-
how of such third parties."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities

Continental could be exposed to tax risks in connection with 
previous assessment periods."
"Continental AG and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are con-
tinuously audited by local tax authorities."
"Tax estimates made for 
the financial statements may differ from how these are interpreted 
by the tax authorities, for example because of changes to tax legis-
lation and the development of case law."
"Tax risks arise in particular 
from the valuation of cross-border, intercompany deliveries and  
services (transfer prices)."
"Through organizational measures, such 
as monitoring transfer prices and where necessary carrying out  
bilateral appeals procedures, Continental AG monitors and controls 
the development of taxation risks and their impact on the consoli-
dated financial statements."
"Tax processes are continuously adapted 
to new tax laws and changes to case law."
"During the reporting period, Italian tax authorities opened criminal 
tax investigations into three Italian companies of the Continental 
Group."
"The investigations relate to a possible failure by the units 
concerned to comply with reporting and declaration requirements 
vis-à-vis the Italian tax authorities."
"Financial charges in the form of 
back taxes, penalties and fines as well as interest payments are not 
implausible."
"Due to the complexity of the facts presented by the 
Italian authorities and the early stage of the investigations, it is not 
possible to reliably estimate the possible financial charges."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
106 
Material Opportunities 
Unless the emphasis is placed on a specific group sector, the  
opportunities apply to all group sectors."
"There are opportunities for Continental if the economy 
performs better than anticipated."
"If the economy in our major sales regions develops better than we 
have anticipated, we expect that demand for vehicles, replacement 
tires and industrial products will also develop better than we have 
anticipated."
"Particu-
lar importance is attached to the European market due to the high 
share of sales that Continental generates in this region (48%)."
"There are opportunities for Continental if prices fall on the raw 
materials markets relevant to us."
"Continental’s earnings situation is affected to a significant extent  
by the cost of raw materials, electronic components, logistics and 
energy."
"For Automotive, this particularly relates to the cost of elec-
tronic components as well as metals and plastics."
"The earnings situ-
ation of Tires and ContiTech is significantly impacted by the cost of 
oil and of natural and synthetic rubber."
"If prices for natural and syn-
thetic rubber in particular decline, this could have a positive impact 
on Continental’s earnings, provided sales prices for rubber products 
remain stable."
"The trend toward automated and autonomous driving 
presents Continental with opportunities."
"The trend from assisted driving to automated and autonomous 
driving is set to continue."
"Several vehicle manufacturers plan to of-
fer new models with partially automated “Level 3” functions over 
the next few years."
"A key requirement for partially automated driv-
ing is that vehicles be equipped with sensors."
"To date, between two 
and seven sensors for assisted driving have been installed per vehi-
cle, depending on their equipment features."
"Even for partially auto-
mated driving, considerably more and also higher-quality radar, 
camera and LiDAR sensors are required, depending on the scope 
of the functionality."
"Since Continental is one of the leading provid-
ers of advanced driver assistance systems, the increasing volume 
of sensors, electronic control units and new software could result  
in considerable sales and earnings opportunities."
"There are opportunities for Continental from strategic 
partnerships, particularly in the Automotive group sector."
"Continental is increasingly focusing on strategic partnerships in or-
der to shape the transformation in the automotive sector as effi-
ciently as possible."
"The latest examples of this are the strategic 
partnerships with the technology companies Ambarella and Aurora."
"Such partnerships allow the companies involved to contribute their 
expertise and optimize research and development costs, for exam-
ple."
"In addition, the strengths of each company can help ensure a 
higher level of innovation and agility when launching products."
"Cost optimization and an improved competitive position – thanks 
to faster time to market, for example – present Continental with  
opportunities."
"The digitalization of vehicles and the services generated as a 
result present Continental with opportunities."
"The massive amounts of data generated by driver assistance sys-
tems and driver information systems as well as the immediate pro-
cessing of this data in vehicles require switching the vehicle archi-
tecture to the most cutting-edge high-performance computers."
"This – together with the new software solutions required for this 
purpose – results in substantial growth potential for Continental 
with positive effects on its future sales and attainable margins."
"Fur-
thermore, the increasing digitalization of our products gives us the 
opportunity to offer our customers software-based services and 
regular software updates in addition to the product itself, and to 
open up new markets for mobility services."
"The implementation  
of generative AI can also lead to growth opportunities and faster 
time to market for new Continental products (e.g."
"partnership  
with Google Cloud; see the Research and Development section)."
"Innovations for vehicle interiors present Continental with 
opportunities."
"For optimum interaction between the driver and the vehicle, more 
and more new products are being used in car manufacturing."
"For 
the user experience of the future, Continental has developed count-
less innovations such as curved digital 3D displays and temporarily 
hidden displays."
"With customer-specific solutions for interior sensor 
technology, Continental is also increasing safety and ease of use 
within the vehicle."
"Since intelligent concepts for new experiences  
in the vehicle interior are becoming more and more important for 
car buyers, and Continental is one of the leading providers of these, 
increasing demand among car manufacturers could result in con-
siderable sales and earnings opportunities."
The tire business presents Continental with opportunities.
"Continental intends to further increase its market share in the 
growth markets of Asia and North America in particular."
"In the pas-
senger-car tire segment, the global business with tires for electric 
mobility and ultra-high-performance tires is to be systematically  
expanded further."
"The truck and bus tire business is to be further 
developed in all regions through the Conti360˚ fleet services."
"Con-
tinental’s specialty tire business, which includes not only two-wheel 
and racing tires but also tires for a variety of industrial applications, 
is expected to grow further as well."
"Smart, digital tire solutions and 
ambitious sustainability goals will also make a significant contribu-
tion to market success and differentiation in the future."
"The market 
launch of the new UltraContact NXT production tire and the presen-
tation of the Conti CityPlus tire concept are important milestones 
(see the Research and Development section)."
"In the area of service-
based digital solutions, the Tires group sector of Continental aims 
to become the leading supplier worldwide by 2030."
"If Continental 
succeeds in increasing its market share in high-growth segments 
and in digital solutions and services even more than planned, this  
is likely to have positive effects on its sales and earnings."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Management Report   Report on Risks and Opportunities 
107 
Digitalization and sustainability in the industrial business 
present Continental with opportunities."
"The growth potential results primarily from the increasing demand 
for sustainable as well as digital and intelligent solutions in the in-
dustrial business."
"In this regard, the ContiTech group sector draws 
on its long-standing and detailed knowledge of the industry and 
materials to open up new business opportunities."
"Various materials 
are thus combined with electronic components and individual ser-
vices."
"Continental also shows, for example, how future mobile interi-
ors might look (e.g."
"SPACE D design concept; see the Research and 
Development section)."
"If these new products become established 
more quickly than planned, this would create corresponding sales 
and earnings opportunities for Continental."
"There are opportunities for Continental from changes in the 
legal framework."
"Legal regulations with the aim of further improving traffic safety 
provide an opportunity for a rise in demand for Continental’s prod-
ucts."
"Based on our broad product portfolio for active vehicle safety, 
we have developed more advanced safety systems over the past 
years."
"Further volume growth is expected as a result of more strin-
gent requirements in various regional safety tests, since an increas-
ing number of safety systems have been recognized as having 
achieved the very highest level of safety."
"In addition, more and 
more legal requirements in individual countries are being expanded 
to include active safety systems."
"Statement on Overall Risk and Opportunities 
Situation
In the opinion of the Executive Board, the overall risk situation of 
the Continental Group has not changed significantly in the past  
fiscal year."
"It remains to be seen to what extent and for how long current geo-
political events, the ongoing uncertainty in supply chains and infla-
tion will continue to affect the automotive industry and the macroe-
conomic situation."
"However, the analysis for the year under review did not reveal any 
risks, either at the end of the reporting period or at the time the an-
nual financial statements were prepared, that individually or collec-
tively pose a threat to the company or the Continental Group as a 
going concern."
"In the opinion of the Executive Board, there are also 
no discernible risks to the Continental Group as a going concern in 
the foreseeable future."
"Considering the material opportunities, the overall risk assessment 
for the Continental Group presents a reasonable risk and opportu-
nities situation to which our risk-containment measures and our 
corporate strategy have been aligned accordingly."

Forecast of Macroeconomic 
Development 
In its World Economic Outlook Update (WEO Update) of January 
2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global 
economy to grow by 3.1% in 2024."
"Its forecast of growth on a par 
with that of 2023 reflects the expectation that inflation will con-
tinue to fall in an overall robust global economy."
"The IMF considers 
the opportunities and risks with respect to this assumption to be 
broadly balanced."
"In Europe, according to the IMF, falling inflation and more stable  
energy prices are expected to lead to a slight recovery in consumer 
demand and a year-on-year rise in real incomes in 2024."
"For the 
eurozone, the IMF expects gross domestic product (GDP) to rise  
by 0.9% in 2024, with GDP for Germany expected to grow by 0.5%."
"For the UK, it expects GDP to rise by 0.6% based on a similar trend."
"For the USA, the IMF predicts a slowdown in GDP growth to 2.1% in 
2024, citing as main reasons the Federal Reserve’s monetary and 
fiscal policy and a softening labor market."
"Japan’s economy is expected to return to lower growth rates in 
2024, after the previous year’s growth was significantly influenced 
by one-off effects."
"The IMF expects Japan’s GDP to grow by 0.9% in 
2024."
"For India, the IMF forecasts a high GDP growth rate of 6.5% in 2024."
"Continued strong development is also expected in China as a result 
of fiscal policy support, with the IMF currently estimating GDP 
growth of 4.6%."
"In other emerging and developing economies, the IMF mostly ex-
pects a slowdown in economic development in 2024."
"In Brazil and 
Russia, for example, the IMF anticipates a rise in GDP of 1.7% and 
2.6%, respectively."
"The IMF’s forecast is based on assumptions that commodity prices 
will decline in 2024 and that interest rates will decline in major 
economies."
The IMF also points toward a number of opportunities and risks.
"Faster disinflation could have a positive effect, as could stronger 
structural reform momentum."
"Significant risks from the IMF’s per-
spective include commodity price spikes, given the tense geopoliti-
cal situation, disruptions in the global supply chain and a slower-
than-expected decline in inflation."
"A worsening of the crisis in the 
Chinese real estate sector and cuts to global public spending could 
also lead to lower growth."
"In the first half of 2024, we expect a global production volume  
of around 44 million units, which should improve slightly in the  
second half of the year, particularly due to the momentum of the 
Chinese market."
"However, this outlook is subject to uncertainty due to the tense  
geopolitical situation and the uncertain development of demand, 
particularly in Europe."

In Europe, we anticipate a decline in the production of passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles of 1% to 3% in 2024."
"In North 
America, however, we expect an increase in production of 0% to 
2%."
"In China, we expect an increase in production volumes for pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles of 1% to 3% in 2024."
"Both in Europe and North America, we currently expect volumes

Forecast process 
Each year, Continental forecasts the values of key performance in-
dicators for the Continental Group for the new fiscal year."
"These in-
clude sales and the adjusted EBIT margin for the Continental Group 
and for the Automotive, Tires, ContiTech and Contract Manufactur-
ing group sectors."
"In addition, we provide information on the assessment of important 
factors influencing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)."
"These in-
clude the expected negative or positive effect of the estimated de-
velopment of material prices and other cost factors for the current 
year, the expected development of special effects and the amount 
of amortization from purchase price allocations."
"We thus allow the 
Continental Group’s expected EBIT to be estimated."
"Furthermore, we give an assessment of the development of interest 
income and expenses as well as the tax rate for the Continental 
Group, which in turn allows the Continental Group’s expected net 
income to be estimated."
"We also publish a forecast of the capital 
expenditures planned for the current year and the adjusted free 
cash flow."
"Our forecast is based on our expectations regarding the 
most important production and sales markets in the new fiscal 
year."
"We publish our forecast as part of our annual press conference and 
the publication of our annual report."
"It is continually reviewed over 
the course of the fiscal year."
"Possible changes to the forecast are 
described at the latest in the report for the respective quarter."
"Comparison of the past fiscal year against forecast 
Our forecast for fiscal 2023, which we published in March 2023, 
was based on a continued recovery in the global production of pas-
senger cars and light commercial vehicles, particularly in our core 
markets of Europe and North America."
"Our expectations took into account the anticipated impact of ongo-
ing supply shortages for semiconductors on production volumes in 
2023."
"We also expected significantly higher costs for materials, wages 
and salaries as well as energy and logistics – amounting to around 
€1.7 billion – to weigh heavily on our earnings position in fiscal 
2023."
"› 
We expected our Automotive group sector to achieve sales of 
around €20.5 billion to €21.5 billion."
"We expected the adjusted 
EBIT margin to be around 2% to 3%."
"This included higher costs 
for materials, wages and salaries as well as logistics of around 
€1 billion."
"› 
We expected our Tires group sector to achieve sales of around 
€14.5 billion to €15.5 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of 
around 12% to 13%."
"This included the expected negative impact 
from higher costs for wages and salaries as well as energy and lo-
gistics of around €400 million."
"› 
We expected our ContiTech group sector to achieve sales of 
around €6.8 billion to €7.2 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin  
of around 6% to 7%."
"This included the expected negative impact 
from higher costs for materials, wages and salaries as well as  
energy of around €300 million."
"› 
In the Contract Manufacturing group sector, we anticipated sales 
of around €400 million to €600 million and an adjusted EBIT 
margin of around 0%."
"› 
As in the previous year, consolidated amortization from purchase 
price allocations was again expected to be below €150 million 
and affect mainly the Automotive and ContiTech group sectors."
"› 
In addition, we expected negative special effects of around 
€150 million."
"› 
In 2023, we expected the negative financial result to be around 
€350 million before effects from currency translation, effects 
from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments, and 
other valuation effects."
"› 
The tax rate was expected to be around 27%."
"› 
The capital expenditure ratio was expected to be around 6% of 
sales in fiscal 2023."
"› 
We were planning on adjusted free cash flow of approximately 
€0.8 billion to €1.2 billion."
"The outlook remained unchanged in the quarterly statement for 
the first quarter of 2023."
"In the half-year financial report, we adjusted our outlook for fiscal 
2023 due to the following factors: 
›

For the Tires group sector, sales were expected to be around 
€14.0 billion to €15.0 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 
around 12% to 13%."
"The adjusted EBIT margin range assumed 
higher costs year-on-year, primarily for wages and salaries, of 
around €200 million."
"› 
We expected the ContiTech group sector to achieve sales of 
around €6.8 billion to €7.2 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin  
of around 6% to 7%."
"The adjusted EBIT margin range assumed a 
year-on-year increase in costs for materials, wages and salaries as 
well as energy of around €200 million."
"› 
In addition, we expected negative special effects of around 
€350 million."
"As before, we again pointed out the anticipated impact of ongoing 
supply shortages in some areas, particularly for semiconductors, on 
production volumes in 2023."
All other parts of the outlook remained unchanged.
"In the quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2023, we adjusted 
the following estimates: 
› 
For 2023, we expected production of passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles to increase by 5% to 7% year-on-year."
"› 
The industrial business showed signs of developing by -2% to 0% 
in the eurozone; in the USA we anticipated a figure of between -1% 
and +1% for the year as a whole; and in China we expected a  
recovery in demand of 4% to 6%."
"With respect to the key financial figures, we made the following 
changes: 
› 
Consolidated sales were expected to be in the range of around 
€41.0 billion to €43.0 billion, and the adjusted EBIT margin was 
expected to be around 5.5% to 6.5%."
"› 
We expected our Automotive group sector to achieve sales of 
around €20.0 billion to €21.0 billion."
"We expected the adjusted 
EBIT margin to be around 2% to 3%."
"This included higher costs 
for materials, wages and salaries as well as logistics of around 
€1 billion."
"› 
For the Tires group sector, sales were expected to be around 
€14.0 billion to €15.0 billion, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 
around 12.5% to 13.5%."
"The adjusted EBIT margin range assumed 
higher costs year-on-year, primarily for wages and salaries, of 
around €200 million."
All other parts of the outlook remained unchanged.
"Owing to our operating performance in the fourth quarter, we 
achieved the adjusted expectations for fiscal 2023 as follows: 
› 
The Continental Group generated sales of €41.4 billion and an 
adjusted EBIT margin of 6.1%."
"› 
The Automotive group sector generated sales of €20.3 billion 
and an adjusted EBIT margin of 1.9% in 2023."
"› 
The Tires group sector generated sales of €14.0 billion and an  
adjusted EBIT margin of 13.5%."
"› 
The ContiTech group sector generated sales of €6.8 billion and 
an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.7%."
"› 
The Contract Manufacturing group sector generated sales of 
€0.5 billion and an adjusted EBIT margin of 1.6%."
"› 
Total consolidated expense from special effects amounted to 
€551.2 million in 2023."
"› 
Amortization from purchase price allocations was €118.2 million."
"› 
In the year under review, the negative financial result amounted 
to €316.0 million before effects from currency translation and  
before effects from changes in the fair value of derivative instru-
ments, and other valuation effects."
"› 
Income tax expense for fiscal 2023 amounted to tax expense of 
€424.1 million."
"› 
The capital expenditure ratio was 5.9%."
"› 
Adjusted free cash flow was €1,292.3 million in 2023 and there-
fore slightly above our forecast range of €0.8 billion to €1.2 bil-
lion in the quarterly statement for the third quarter of 2023."
"Order situation 
The order situation in our Automotive group sector continues to  
be characterized by a volatile market environment and the transfor-
mation of the automotive industry."
"In total, orders amounting to 
around €27 billion were acquired in fiscal 2023 (PY: €23 billion)."
"This figure includes expected sales over the entire duration of the 
delivery, known as lifetime sales."
"These are based primarily on as-
sumptions regarding production volumes of the respective vehicle 
or engine platforms, the expected and agreed cost adjustments, 
and the development of key raw material prices."
"The replacement-tire business accounts for a large portion of the 
Tires group sector’s sales, which is why it is not possible to calcu-
late a reliable figure for order volumes."
"The same applies to the ContiTech group sector, which has busi-
ness areas operating in various markets and industrial sectors, 
each in turn with their own relevant factors."
"Consolidating the or-
der figures from the various business areas of the ContiTech group 
sector would thus be meaningful only to a limited extent."
"Outlook for fiscal 2024 
As mentioned on page 108 of the report on expected develop-
ments, we expect the global production of passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles in 2024 to be roughly on a par with the previ-
ous year, with a negative development expected in our core market 
of Europe."
"This outlook takes into account the current tense geopolitical situa-
tion and its expected impact on production volumes in 2024."
"Higher costs for wages and salaries – amounting to around €0.5  
billion – are expected to weigh heavily on our earnings position in 
fiscal 2024, with around half of these costs attributable to the  
Automotive group sector."

"An effective internal management and control system is employed 
to ensure that the information used for the preparation of the con-
solidated financial statements, including the management report

with the entire Supervisory Board, also in the presence of the auditor, 
at the meeting of the Supervisory Board held to approve the financial 
statements."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our 
audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compli-
ance of the consolidated financial statements and of the consoli-
dated management report."
"Basis for the audit opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the consolidated management report in accordance with 
Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014, re-
ferred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with 
German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement  
Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany 
(Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those 
requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s 
responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the consolidated management report” section of our audi-
tor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accord-
ance with the requirements of European law and German commer-
cial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) (f) of the EU Audit 
Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services 
prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropri-
ate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated  
financial statements, on the consolidated management report and 
on the non-financial statement included in the consolidated man-
agement report."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judg-
ment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated  
financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to De-
cember 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context  
of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole 
and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a  
separate audit opinion on these matters."
"While goodwill must be tested 
for impairment once a year or when there are indications of im-
pairment, non-current assets with finite useful lives only have to 
be tested for impairment if there are indications that they may be 
impaired (triggering events)."
"The impairment test is performed at 
the level of the cash-generating units."
"The carrying amount of the 
relevant cash-generating units (where applicable including good-
will) is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in 
the context of the impairment test."
"The recoverable amount is the 
higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use."
"The 
Company generally determines the recoverable amount using 
the value in use."
"The present value of the future cash flows from 
the respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis 
of valuation."
"Present values are calculated using discounted cash 
flow models."
"For this purpose, the long-term planning for the 
cash-generating units adopted by the executive directors forms 
the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions 
about long-term rates of growth."
"Expectations relating to future 
market developments and assumptions about the development 
of macroeconomic factors, which are currently subject to increased 
uncertainties, are also taken into account."
"The discount rate used 
is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-gen-
erating unit."
"If the value in use falls below the carrying amount of 
the cash-generating unit, it is assessed whether the fair values 
less costs of disposal of the assets exceed their carrying amounts."
"If not, the need for write-downs shall be based on the higher of 
value in use and fair value less costs of disposal."
"The impairment 
test determined that no write-downs were necessary."
"Against this 
background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this 
matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit."
"› 
As part of our audit we assessed the methodology used for the 
purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things, 
with the assistance of our internal specialists from Valuation, 
Modeling & Analytics."
"In addi-
tion, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of 
group functions."
"In the knowledge that even relatively small 
changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact 
on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our 
testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the dis-
count rate applied, and assessed the calculation model."
"In order 
to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated 
the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company on the effect 
of potential changes in revenue, the discount rate and the long-
term rate of growth on the recoverable amount."
"If the value in 
use fell below the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit, 
we assessed whether the fair values less costs of disposal of the 
assets still correctly covered their carrying amounts."
"› 
In addition, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes  
relating to the recoverability of goodwill were appropriate and 
complete."
"› 
Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the 
executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also 
within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable."
"› 
The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and on non-current assets 
with finite useful lives are contained in Notes 2, 13 and 14 of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Accounting treatment of deferred taxes  
› 
Deferred tax assets amounting to €2,440.2 million (6.5% of total 
assets or 17.3% of total equity) after netting are reported in the 
Company’s consolidated financial statements, of which €548.0 
million relates to tax loss carryforwards."
"Deferred tax assets 
amounting to €3,938.1 million were recognized before netting 
with matching deferred tax liabilities."
"These items were recognized 
to the extent that the executive directors consider it probable that 
taxable profit will be available in the foreseeable future which will 
enable the deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses 
to be utilized."
"For this purpose, insofar as sufficient deferred tax lia-
bilities are not available, future taxable profits are projected on  
the basis of the business plan adopted by the executive directors."
"No deferred tax assets were recognized in respect of deductible 
temporary differences, eligible tax credits and unused tax losses 
amounting in total to €2,736.3 million since it is not probable that 
they will be utilized for tax purposes by means of offset against 
taxable profits."
"› 
In our view, the accounting treatment of deferred taxes was of 
particular significance in the context of our audit, as it depends  
to a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by  
the executive directors and is therefore subject to uncertainties."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to 
satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the 
executive directors are substantiated and sufficiently documented."

"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for 
such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e."
"fraudulent  
financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive di-
rectors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, 
as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are 
responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis 
of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or 
to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"Furthermore, the exec-
utive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures 
(systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the prepara-
tion of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstate-
ment, whether due to fraud (i.e."
"fraudulent reporting in the non- 
financial statement) or error."
"The applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are 
subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which 
authoritative comprehensive interpretations have not yet been 
published."
"Accordingly, the executive directors have disclosed their 
interpretations of such wording and terms in the “Information in  
Accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation” section of the non-
financial statement."
"The executive directors are responsible for the 
defensibility of these interpretations."
"As such wording and terms 
may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal 
conformity of these interpretations is uncertain."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements, the consolidated management report and the 
non-financial statement included in the consolidated management 
report."
"Mis-
statements can arise from fraud or error and are considered mate-
rial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be ex-
pected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the 
basis of these consolidated financial statements and this consoli-
dated management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skep-
ticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement 
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, mis-
representations or the override of internal controls."

sales are allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective 
customers; in contrast, capital expenditure and segment assets are 
allocated on the basis of the domicile of the respective companies."
"Viewed across all segments, Continental recorded sales totaling 
€4,706.8 million (PY: €4,068.1 million) with a group of companies 
under common control in the year under review."

"Other than these countries, there were no countries in which 
more than 10% of sales were achieved, as was also the case in the 
previous year."

"General Information and Accounting Principles 
Continental Aktiengesellschaft (Continental AG), whose registered 
office is Continental-Plaza 1, Hanover, Germany, is the parent com-
pany of the Continental Group and a listed stock corporation."
"It is 
entered in the commercial register of the Hanover Local Court 
(Amtsgericht) under HR B 3527."
"The Continental Group is a sup-
plier to the automotive industry, with worldwide operations."
"The ar-
eas of business and main activities in which the Continental Group 
is engaged are described in more detail in the Segment Reporting 
section."
"The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG 
for fiscal 2023 were prepared by resolution of the Executive Board 
of February 27, 2024, and will be submitted to and published in 
the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger)."
"Continental AG is  
included in the consolidated financial statements of INA-Holding 
Schaeffler GmbH & Co."
"KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, which are 
published in the German Federal Gazette."
"The consolidated financial statements of Continental AG as at De-
cember 31, 2023, have been prepared in accordance with Interna-
tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the Euro-
pean Union, pursuant to EU Regulation (EC) No."
"1606/2002 in con-
junction with Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code 
(Handelsgesetzbuch – HGB)."
"All International Financial Re-
porting Standards mandatory for fiscal 2023 have been applied, 
subject to endorsement by the European Union."
"The annual financial statements of companies included in the  
Continental Group have been prepared using uniform accounting 
policies, in accordance with IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
"The reporting date for the individual financial statements  
of companies included in the Continental Group is the same as  
the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements."
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros.
"Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are shown in millions of euros 
(€ millions)."
"Please note that differences may arise as a result of the 
use of rounded amounts and percentages."
"Previously, these 
items were reported under other income and other expenses; as of 
fiscal 2023, they are assigned to the respective functional areas."
"At the same time, research and development expenses de-
creased by €1.7 million, other income by €239.8 million and other 
expenses by €673.7 million."
"In addition, the presentation of specific expenses (primarily person-
nel expenses) incurred in connection with the provision of develop-
ment services to external customers was adjusted in the Automo-
tive segment."
"Previously, these expenses were reported under re-
search and development expenses; now, they are reported under 
cost of sales."
"The adjustment led to a retrospective reduction in re-
search and development expenses of €106.9 million while simulta-
neously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period 
from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022."
"In the Tires segment, the reporting of personnel expenses incurred 
in connection with activities in the workshops of tire companies 
was adjusted in the reporting year."
"Previously, these expenses were 
reported under selling and logistics expenses; now, they are reported 
under cost of sales."
"The adjustment led to a retrospective reduction 
in selling and logistics expenses of €194.9 million while simultane-
ously increasing cost of sales by the same amount for the period 
from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022."
"Companies consolidated 
All major subsidiaries that Continental AG controls in accordance 
with the provisions of IFRS 10 have been included in the consoli-
dated financial statements and are fully consolidated."
"To meet this 
definition, Continental AG must have the decision-making power to 
control the relevant activities and a right to variable returns from 
the associated company."
"Furthermore, it must be able to use its  
decision-making power to determine the amount of these returns."
"The consolidation of subsidiaries is based on the acquisition method 
by offsetting the acquisition cost against the proportion of net assets 
attributed to the parent company at fair value at the acquisition 
date."
"Intangible assets not previously recognized in the separate  
financial statements of the acquired company are carried at fair 
value."
"Measurement at 
the acquisition date is usually provisional only."
"Significant adjustments are presented in the notes 
to the financial statements."
Any positive remaining amount is capitalized as goodwill.
"The share 
of non-controlling interests is measured using the share of (remeas-
ured) net assets of the subsidiary."
"In order to ensure the recovera-
bility of goodwill arising from an as yet incomplete measurement 
and the corresponding purchase price allocation, the goodwill is  
allocated provisionally to the affected cash-generating units (CGUs) 
as at the end of the reporting period."
"This provisional allocation can 
deviate significantly from the final allocation."
"Any negative difference 
that arises is recognized in other income after the fair value of the 
acquired assets and liabilities has again been reviewed."
"Non-controlling interests in the net assets of subsidiaries that are 
not attributable to the Continental Group are shown under “Non-
controlling interests” as a separate component of total equity."
"Once control has been obtained, any differences arising from suc-
cessive purchases of shares from non-controlling interests between 
the purchase price and the carrying amount of those non-control-
ling interests are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Where there are successive purchases of shares resulting in con-
trol, the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value 
at the time of first-time consolidation for those shares already held 
is recognized in profit or loss under other income and expenses."
"Significant investments where Continental AG can exert significant 
influence on the associated companies (associates) are accounted 
for using the equity method."
"The carrying amount of these associ-
ates is adjusted to reflect the share in the associates’ net equity."
"If 
the financial statements of the associates are not available, the share 
of earnings or losses is recognized as necessary based on estimated 
amounts."
"Goodwill arising from first-time consolidation is reported 
using the equity method."
"Goodwill is not amortized, but the carrying 
amount of investments in associates consolidated using the equity 
method is tested for impairment if there are relevant indications."
Joint ventures are accounted for in the same way as associates.
"Companies that are dormant or have only a low level of business 
activity and therefore no significant impact on the earnings, finan-
cial and net assets position of the Continental Group are not included 
in the consolidated financial statements."
"These are accounted for as 
other investments at fair value (FVOCI)."
"Intercompany receivables and payables, in addition to income and 
expenses, are eliminated on consolidation."
"Intercompany profits 
arising from internal transactions and dividend payments made 
within the Continental Group are eliminated on consolidation."
"De-
ferred taxes on the elimination of intercompany transactions are 
carried in the amount derived from the average income tax rate  
for the Continental Group."
"Currency translation 
The statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries with a 
functional currency other than the euro are translated into euros 
using the middle rate at the end of the reporting period (closing 
rate)."
"The income statements are translated at the average exchange 
rate for the year."
"Differences resulting from currency translation are 
recognized in the difference from currency translation in equity until 
the disposal of the subsidiary, without recognizing deferred taxes."
"In the separate financial statements of Continental AG and its sub-
sidiaries, foreign-currency receivables and payables are measured 
on recognition at the transaction rate and adjusted at the end of 
the reporting period to the related closing rates."
"Gains and losses 
arising on currency translation are recognized in profit or loss, ex-
cept for certain loans."
"Goodwill is recognized directly as an asset of the subsidiary acquired 
and therefore also translated into euros for subsidiaries whose 
functional currencies are not the euro at the end of the reporting 
period using the middle rate (closing rate)."
"Differences resulting 
from currency translation are recognized in the difference from  
currency translation in equity."
"In accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Custom-
ers, Continental recognizes as revenue from contracts with custom-
ers the amount that is received as consideration for the transfer of 
goods or services to customers."
"The relevant point in time or period 
of time is the transfer of control of the goods or services to the cus-
tomer (control approach)."
"To determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount, the 
five-step model is applied."
"By applying the five-step model in the 
Continental Group to contracts with customers, distinct perfor-
mance obligations are identified."
"The transaction price is deter-
mined – and allocated to the performance obligations – according 
to the requirements of IFRS 15."
"Variable consideration in contracts 
with customers, such as rebates, bonus agreements or other kinds 
of price concessions, is analyzed, measured and included in the 
revenue recognition."
"The allocation of the transaction price in the 
case of more than one performance obligation at hand would be 
performed by using observable prices if possible."
"Otherwise the  
allocation would be performed using the adjusted market assess-
ment approach or the approach of cost plus a margin."
"For every 
performance obligation that, in accordance with IFRS 15, is distinct 
within the context of the contract, the revenue recognition is deter-
mined to be at a point in time or to be satisfied over time."
"Multi-component contracts that contain distinct performance  
obligations with different timing of revenue recognition are not  
currently material."
"Invoices 
are generally prepared once a month, while the payment terms  
average 60 days and differ mostly depending on the region and/or 
product group."
"Payments are made by bank transfer in the vast 
majority of cases."
"No significant discounts on the invoice amount 
are granted; however, customer bonuses and other price reductions 
are included in the transaction price as variable price components 
in line with expectations."
"The customers do not usually make any 
significant advance payments."
"Invoices are generally prepared once a month, while 
the payment terms for most of the sales average 60 days and differ 
mostly depending on the region and/or product group."
"Payments 
are made by bank transfer in the vast majority of cases, with the  
exception of business with end customers and consumers, who of-
ten pay in cash or by card."
"No significant discounts on the invoice 
amount are granted; however, customer bonuses and other price 
reductions are included in the transaction price as variable price 
components in line with expectations."
"The customers do not usu-
ally make any significant advance payments."
"Revenue is recognized 
at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer,  
taking into account the agreed incoterms."
"There are no significant 
obligations from the right of customers to return products, or from 
reimbursements to customers or similar obligations, or from war-
ranty commitments that include a service component."
"Description of revenue in other business activities 
Revenue in other business activities is included in the sales of the 
automotive original-equipment business, in the sales of the indus-
trial and replacement business, and in other revenues."
"On the one 
hand, services are provided and, on the other, project business is 
conducted in which developments for customers are made, goods 
produced or services provided over a medium-term or longer pe-
riod."
"For this revenue, there are no significant obligations from the 
right of customers to return products, or from reimbursements to 
customers or similar obligations, or from warranty commitments 
that include a service component."
"The largest component of this revenue relates to revenue from  
research and development, which is recognized at a point in time, 
either when the entire development is completed or when identifia-
ble milestones within a development are reached."
"Invoices are gen-
erally prepared after completion of a milestone or an entire devel-
opment and acceptance by the customer."
"Payments are made by 
bank transfer in most cases."
"No significant discounts on the invoice 
amount are granted."
"The customers do not usually make any signif-
icant advance payments."
"In addition, services that are performed alongside the main busi-
ness also lead to revenue recognition over time, though in smaller 
amounts."
"Both input- and output-based measurement methods are 
used and sales are measured either based on the hours or days 
worked or the costs incurred (input), or based on the services ren-
dered (output)."
"Invoices are generally prepared at least once a month, 
and payments are made by bank transfer in most cases."
"No signifi-
cant discounts on the invoice amount are granted."
"The customers 
do not usually make any significant advance payments."
"In addition, project business is conducted, in which generally cus-
tomer-specific goods or services are produced or provided for cus-
tomers over a medium-term or longer period."
"Revenue from this is 
likewise recognized over time and sales are mostly measured using 
input-based measurement methods, taking account of the costs in-
curred."
Invoices are generally issued as contractually agreed.
"Ad-
vance payments averaging 30% are usually made by the custom-
ers before the start of a project."
"Payments are made by bank trans-
fer in most cases."
"No significant discounts on the invoice amount 
are granted."
"Contract assets and contract liabilities 
Contract assets primarily arise in the project business from cus-
tomer-specific goods or services for customers, but are only of  
minor significance in the Continental Group."
"Contract assets must 
be recognized because the goods or services are provided over a 
medium-term or longer period in which goods or services have al-
ready been provided by Continental but there is not yet an uncon-
ditional right against the customer, i.e."
"The right – or 
part of the right – to consideration from the customer is often only 
unconditional once the provision of the services has been com-
pleted and can then be recognized as a receivable and invoiced in 
full."
"The associated payments are generally made on the basis of 
actual invoicing."
"The recognition of receivables and the receipt of 
payments reduce the associated contract assets."
"Contract liabilities include mainly advance payments by customers 
for deliveries of goods and for services to be performed."
"The provision of the correspond-
ing services to the customers by Continental reduces the level of 
the associated contract liabilities."
"Research and development expenses 
Research and development expenses comprise expenditure on re-
search and development and expenses for customer-specific appli-
cations, prototypes and testing."
"Where refunds from customers for 
research and development expenses are agreed, these costs are 
recognized in inventories until control is transferred."
"Once control is 
transferred, the refund amounts are stated under other income."
"This portion of the expenses is cap-
italized as an asset and amortized over a period of three to seven 
years from the date that the developed products become marketa-
ble."
"However, expenses for customer-specific applications, pre-pro-
duction prototypes or tests for products already being marketed do 
not qualify as development expenditure which may be recognized 
as an intangible asset."
"Furthermore, expenses incurred directly in 
connection with the launch of new production operations and 
plants are recognized directly in profit or loss."
"Moreover, 
these release stages serve as the prerequisite to demonstrate the 
technical feasibility of the product, especially given the high de-
mands imposed on safety and comfort technology."
"Accordingly,  
development costs are recognized as an asset only as at the date 
of nomination as supplier and upon fulfillment of a specific pre- 
production release stage."
"The development is considered to be 
completed once the final approval for the unlimited production is 
granted."
"Only very few development projects fulfill the recognition 
criteria."
"For this 
reason, all pre-production expenses – with the exception of the cap-
italized development costs as previously described – are recognized 
immediately in profit or loss."
"Product-related expenses 
Costs for advertising, sales promotion and other sales-related items 
are expensed as incurred."
"Provisions are recognized for possible 
warranty claims on sold products on the basis of past experience, 
as well as legal and contractual terms."
"Additional provisions are rec-
ognized for specific known cases."
"Financial result and investment income  
Interest income and expenses are recognized for the period to 
which they relate."
"Dividends are recognized in profit or loss if legal entitlement to pay-
ment of the dividend is established, the economic benefit associ-
ated with the dividend is likely to be received, and the dividend 
amount can be measured reliably."
"Earnings per share  
Basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted 
average number of shares issued."
"Treasury stock is deducted for 
the period it is held."
"Diluted earnings per share also include shares 
from the potential exercise of option or conversion rights."
"The cor-
responding expenses that would no longer be incurred after the 
conversion or exchange are eliminated."
"Statement of financial position classification 
Assets and liabilities are reported as non-current assets and liabili-
ties in the statement of financial position if they have a remaining 
term of over one year and, conversely, as current assets and liabili-
ties if the remaining term is shorter."
"Liabilities are treated as current 
if there is no unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period."
"Pension 
provisions, provisions for other post-employment benefits, and 
other employee benefits, as well as deferred tax assets and liabili-
ties are accounted for as non-current."
"If assets and liabilities have 
both current and non-current portions, the amounts are classified 
separately and shown as current and non-current assets or liabilities."
"Goodwill 
Goodwill corresponds to the difference between the acquisition 
cost and the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities of the 
business combination."
"Goodwill is not subject to amortization; it is 
tested for impairment at least annually and, if necessary, impaired."
"The details of the annual impairment test are described under  
“Impairment” in this note."
"Once an impairment loss has been  
recognized on goodwill, it is not reversed in subsequent periods."
"Intangible assets 
Purchased intangible assets are carried at acquisition costs and in-
ternally generated intangible assets at their production costs, pro-
vided that the conditions for recognition of an internally generated 
intangible asset are met in accordance with IAS 38, Intangible As-
sets."
"If intangible assets have finite useful lives, they are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to eight years in 
general."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at 
least annually for impairment and, if necessary, impaired."
"The details of the annual impairment test are described under  
“Impairment” in this note."
"Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less straight-line 
depreciation."
"If necessary, additional impairment is recognized on 
the affected items."
"Production cost consists of the direct costs and attributable mate-
rial and manufacturing overheads, including depreciation."
"Under certain conditions, portions of the borrowing costs are capi-
talized as part of the acquisition cost."
"This also applies to finance 
leases and investment property."
"As soon as an asset is available for its intended use, subsequent 
cost is capitalized only to the extent the related modification 
changes the function of the asset or increases its economic value 
and the cost can be clearly identified."
"All other subsequent ex-
penditure is recognized as current maintenance expense."
"Property, plant and equipment is broken down into the lowest level 
of the components that have significantly different useful lives and, 
to the extent integrated in other assets, when they are likely to be 
replaced or overhauled during the overall life of the related main 
asset."
"Maintenance and repair costs are recognized in profit or loss 
as incurred."
"The Continental Group has no property, plant or equip-
ment that by the nature of its operation and deployment can be re-
paired and serviced only in intervals over several years."
"The useful 
lives are up to 25 years for buildings and land improvements; up to 
20 years for technical equipment and machinery; and up to 12 
years for operating and office equipment."
"Government grants 
Government grants are reported if there is reasonable assurance 
that the conditions in place in connection with the grants will be 
fulfilled and that the grants will be awarded."
"Monetary government grants and government subsidies that are 
directly attributable to depreciable fixed assets are deducted from 
the procurement and manufacturing costs of the assets in ques-
tion."
"All other monetary grants and subsidies are recognized as in-
come in line with planning and are presented alongside the corre-
sponding expenses."
"Non-monetary government grants are recog-
nized at fair value."
"Investment property 
Land and buildings held for the purpose of generating rental in-
come instead of production or administrative purposes are carried 
at depreciated cost."
"Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis 
over the useful lives, which correspond to those for real estate in 
use by the company."
"Leases 
A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in ex-
change for consideration."
"A lessee shall recognize a right-of-use as-
set and a corresponding lease liability, which represents the lessee’s 
obligation to make lease payments."
"The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease pay-
ments not yet made."
It is recognized under indebtedness.
"Discount-
ing is determined using the incremental borrowing rates, as the in-
terest rates underlying the leases often cannot be determined reg-
ularly."
"The right-of-use-asset recognized by the lessee is measured 
at cost."
"This amount comprises the corresponding lease liability 
and prepaid lease payments, taking into account any lease incen-
tives received."
"It is recognized in property, plant and equipment."
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis.
"The lease liability is 
subsequently measured according to the effective interest method."
The resulting interest expense is recognized in the financial result.
"Continental utilizes the exemptions for short-term leases and for 
leases in which the underlying asset is of low value."
"Continental leases property, plant and equipment, especially buildings."
"As lessor, Continental classifies leases as operating leases or finance 
leases."
"For this classification, Continental considers whether the 
lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to 
ownership of an underlying asset."
"If this is the case, it is a finance 
lease; otherwise, it is an operating lease."
"If Continental acts as an intermediate lessor, the interests arising 
from the head lease and sublease are accounted for separately."
"The 
sublease is measured based on the value of the right-of-use asset 
resulting from the head lease and not based on the underlying as-
set."
"If the head lease is a short-term lease for which the Continental 
Group applies the exemption provision, it classifies the sublease as 
an operating lease."
"The Continental Group applies IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers, when allocating the consideration in the contract 
to each lease and non-lease component."
"Impairment 
The Continental Group immediately reviews intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, investment property and goodwill 
as soon as there is an indication of impairment (triggering event)."
"Impairment is assessed by comparing the carrying amount with 
the recoverable amount."
"The recoverable amount is the higher  
of the fair value less cost of disposal and the present value of the 
expected future cash flows from the continued use of the asset 
(value in use)."
"If the carrying amount is higher than the recoverable 
amount, the difference is recognized as impairment."
"If the indica-
tions for the prior recognition of impairment no longer apply, the 
impairment losses are reversed for intangible assets, property, plant 
and equipment, and investment property."
"Capitalized goodwill is generally tested for impairment once a year 
as at November 30 at the level of cash-generating units (CGUs)."
"CGUs are units that come below the segments and are the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of as-
sets."
"This represents the level at which goodwill is monitored for in-
ternal management purposes."
"The impairment test is performed by 
comparing the carrying amount of the CGU including its goodwill 
and the recoverable amount of this CGU."
"The recoverable amount 
in this case is the value in use calculated on the basis of discounted 
cash flows before interest and tax."
"Impairment is recognized to the 
extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount for a 
CGU."
"If the reasons for this cease to apply in the future, impairment 
losses on goodwill are not reversed."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
142 
The expected cash flows of the CGUs are derived from long-term 
planning that usually covers the next five years and is approved by 
management."
"For the Autonomous Mobility CGU, expected cash 
flow data is derived from its long-term planning that covers the 
next eight years."
"The plans are based in particular on assumptions 
regarding macroeconomic developments, as well as trends in sales 
prices, raw material prices and exchange rates derived in part from 
external sources."
"In addition to these current market forecasts, past 
developments and experience are also taken into account."
"Further-
more, Continental’s internal CO2 shadow price is also taken into  
account in the assumptions; for further details on its calculation, 
please refer to the consolidated management report."
"For the perpe-
tuity beyond the period of five years, the cash flow is extrapolated 
using the expected long-term growth rates for the individual CGUs."
"The main assumptions when calculating the value in use of a CGU 
are the free cash flows, the discount rate and its parameters, and 
the long-term growth rate."
"Annual impairment testing was performed on the basis of the bot-
tom-up business plan for the next five years approved by manage-
ment in the period under review."
"This pre-tax WACC is based on the capital structure of the respec-
tive relevant peer group on average over the last five years."
"The 
risk-free interest rate is 2.62% (PY: 1.75%) and the market risk pre-
mium 7.0% (PY: 7.5%)."
"Borrowing costs correspond to the interest 
rate on industrial bonds, with the average rating derived via the 
peer group."
"For the annual impairment test, the average growth rate in the de-
tailed planning period was 8.8% (PY: 11.0%) for the CGUs of the  
Automotive segment, 5.6% (PY: 5.6%) for those of the Tires seg-
ment and 4.9% (PY: 5.7%) for those of the ContiTech segment."
"Contract manufacturing for Vitesco Technologies is reported in the 
Contract Manufacturing segment and will conclude by the end of 
the detailed planning period."
"The long-term growth rate was 1.0% 
(PY: 1.0%) for the CGUs of the Automotive segment, 0.5% (PY: 0.5%) 
for those of the Tires and ContiTech segments and 0.0% (PY: 0.0%) 
for those of the Contract Manufacturing segment."
"These growth 
rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the 
markets in which the CGUs operate."
"The annual impairment testing of goodwill determined no require-
ments for impairment for 2023."
"In the Original Equipment CGU of 
the Tires segment, the carrying amount exceeded the value in use."
"This review did not reveal any 
need for impairment, since the fair value less costs of disposal for 
the individual assets exceeds their respective carrying amount."
"Fair 
values were derived on the basis of valuation reports relating to the 
properties and current market values for comparable machinery 
and technical equipment, among other things."
"Assuming a 0.5-percentage-point increase in the discount rate 
would not lead to any goodwill impairment."
"No asset impairment 
would result."
"Reducing the long-term growth rate by 0.5 percent-
age points would not lead to any goodwill impairment."
"No asset im-
pairment would result."
"If sales in perpetuity would decline by 5.0%, 
consequently reducing free cash flow as a key planning parameter, 
this would not lead to any goodwill impairment."
"No asset impair-
ment would result."
"For this to be the 
case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate 
sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual 
and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and  
its sale must be highly probable."
"A non-current asset (or disposal group) held for sale is measured  
at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell 
where it meets the held for sale criteria."
"Depreciation of these assets 
ceases once they are classified as held for sale."
"Immediately before 
the initial classification of the asset (or disposal group) as held for 
sale, the carrying amounts shall be measured in accordance with 
the applicable IFRS."
"A non-current asset (or disposal group) is classified as held for dis-
tribution to owners when the entity is committed to distribute the 
asset (or disposal group) to the owners."
"For this to be the case, the 
assets must be available for immediate distribution in their present 
condition and the distribution must be highly probable."
"A non-current 
asset (or disposal group) held for distribution is measured at the lower 
of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to distribute."
"A discontinued operation can also be classified as held for sale un-
der IFRS 5."
"The 
classification of a component of an entity as a discontinued opera-
tion is also appropriate in the case of classification as held for distri-
bution, provided the criteria are met."
"Financial instruments 
A financial instrument, as defined in IAS 32, Financial Instruments: 
Presentation, is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one 
entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity."
"In the Continental Group, a purchase or sale of financial assets or  
financial liabilities is recognized or derecognized at the settlement 
date."
"Financial assets  
Financial assets are recognized in the statement of financial position 
as at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the finan-
cial instrument."
"At the acquisition date, they must be classified into 
measurement categories that determine the subsequent accounting."
"Receivables from the receivables factoring programs carried out in 
the Continental Group are recognized in the statement of financial 
position when the risks and rewards, in particular credit and default 
risk, have not been essentially transferred."
"The repayment obliga-
tions therefrom are, as a rule, then shown as short-term financial  
liabilities."
"The classification and measurement of financial assets that consti-
tute debt instruments is based on the business model in which the 
assets are managed and on their cash flow characteristics."
"These 
conditions are cumulative criteria whose audit sequence is irrelevant."
"It is therefore necessary to analyze the business model in which 
the asset to be classified is held."
"This relates to the investigation of 
the way in which financial assets held in order to collect cash flows 
are managed."
"The Continental Group reclassifies debt instruments 
if the corresponding business model changes."
"IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, distinguishes between three business 
models: 
› 
Hold-to-collect: The objective of this business model is to hold  
the financial assets and generate the contractual cash flows."
"This 
model is the prevalent business model in the Continental Group."
"› 
Hold-to-collect and sale: This business model aims to collect the 
contractual cash flows or sell the financial assets."
"This business 
model does occur – for example, in connection with notes receiv-
able – but is fundamentally of subordinate importance in the Con-
tinental Group."
"› 
Other: This business model constitutes a catch-all category."
"This 
model occurs in the Continental Group in connection with recog-
nized trade accounts receivable from third parties which will 
probably be sold under a true sale-of-receivables factoring agree-
ment; however, it is fundamentally of subordinate importance in 
the Continental Group."
"In addition to the analysis of the business model, the contractual 
terms applicable on acquisition of the financial instrument must 
also be assessed (SPPI (solely payments of principal and interest) 
criterion)."
"The SPPI criterion is met when the contractual terms of 
the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding."
"Contractual cash flows that are solely payments of 
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are  
consistent with a basic lending arrangement."
"Further-
more, the contractual cash flows can be characterized as pay-
ments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstand-
ing."
"Interest income is recognized in the financial result using the 
effective interest method."
"Gains or losses arising from derecogni-
tion are recognized in profit or loss together with the foreign-cur-
rency gains and losses."
"Impairment losses are likewise recognized 
separately in the income statement."
"› 
Measured at fair value through other comprehensive income with 
reclassification (FVOCIwR): The financial asset, which constitutes 
a debt instrument, is held within a business model whose objec-
tive is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and sell-
ing financial assets."
"Furthermore, the contractual cash flows can 
be characterized as payments of principal and interest on the 
principal amount outstanding."
"Changes in the carrying amount 
are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"Income or ex-
penses from impairment, interest income and foreign-currency 
gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss."
"The cumulative 
gain or loss stated in other comprehensive income is reclassified 
from equity to the income statement when the financial asset is 
derecognized."
"Interest income is recognized in the financial result 
using the effective interest method."
"Foreign-currency gains and 
losses are recognized in other income and expenses."
"However, the Continental Group does not 
currently intend to apply the fair value option to debt instruments."
"Income or expense from a financial asset measured at fair value 
through profit or loss is recognized in the income statement."
"Investments that fall within the scope of IFRS 9, Financial Instru-
ments, and meet the definition of equity must generally be meas-
ured at fair value."
"The cumulative gain or loss in other com-
prehensive income is not reclassified to the income statement 
when the financial asset is derecognized."
"This results in the meas-
urement category of fair value through other comprehensive income 
without reclassification (FVOCIwoR)."
"Dividends are an exception to 
this and continue to be recognized in profit or loss when the legal 
entitlement is established, unless this relates to a partial restitution 
of acquisition costs."
"Dividends are recognized in other income from 
investments."
"Equity instruments held for trading purposes or for which the fair 
value OCI option is not utilized are without exception accounted  
for at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)."
Impairment is recognized using the expected loss model.
"Loss allowances are measured on the basis of 12-month expected 
credit losses or on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses."
"12-
month expected credit losses result from possible default events 
within 12 months after the reporting date."
"Lifetime expected credit 
losses result from all possible default events over the expected life 
of a financial instrument."
"The credit risk of a financial asset has 
increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual 
payments are more than 30 days past due on the reporting date."
"For trade accounts receivable and contract assets with and without 
significant financing components, lease payments receivable and 
current receivables from related parties, only lifetime expected 
credit loss measurement is applied."
"Under this approach, the life-
time expected credit losses must be recognized from the initial 
recognition of the receivable."
"A financial asset is in default or credit-impaired if one of the follow-
ing criteria is met: 
› 
Insolvency or a similar event that indicates significant financial 
difficulty and a probable default of the counterparty."
"› 
A breach of contract that leads to the assumption that it is more 
probable that one or more receivables are not collectible."
"› 
Other reasons in the assessment of credit management that lead 
to the assumption that it is more probable that the receivables 
are not collectible."
"If there is evidence of uncollectibility, the financial asset is derecog-
nized."
"If creditworthiness improves, the allowance is reversed."
"Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are recognized in the statement of financial posi-
tion as at the date Continental becomes a contractual party to the 
financial instrument."
"Financial liabilities are generally measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest method."
"Instruments that are held for trading 
are classified as “financial liabilities measured at fair value through 
profit or loss.” For financial liabilities not held for trading, the fair 
value option can be exercised."
"If the fair value option is used, the 
portion of the change in the fair value due to changes in the credit 
risk of the liability is recognized in other comprehensive income."
"The fair value option is not currently exercised in the Continental 
Group."
"In the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG, 
all non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, 
which as a rule comprises the remaining principal balance and issu-
ing costs, net of any unamortized premium or discount."
"In the case of information reported in accordance with IFRS 7,  
Financial Instruments: Disclosures, classification is in line with the 
items disclosed in the statement of financial position and/or the 
measurement category used in accordance with IFRS 9, Financial 
Instruments."
"Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVPL)."
"The fair value is generally the market or ex-
change price."
"In the absence of an active market, the fair value is 
determined using financial models."
"The value of options is determined by applying recognized option 
pricing models."
"Future cash flows are forecast using in-
terest-rate curves with an appropriate payment tenor."
"When dis-
counting, currency basis spreads or, if applicable, tenor basis 
spreads are taken into account."
"The measurement of derivative instruments takes into account the 
credit spread in general."
"Derivative instruments are recognized at the date when the obliga-
tion to buy or sell the instrument arises."
"For the current status of implementation of the IBOR reform and its 
impact on the consolidated financial statements of Continental, see 
Note 32."
Hedge accounting is currently not applied.
"The accumu-
lated currency effects are not reclassified in profit and loss until the 
foreign operations are sold or liquidated."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
146 
Embedded derivatives 
An embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract along-
side a non-derivative host contract."
"A portion of the cash flows of 
the hybrid contract is therefore subject to similar variability as a 
separate derivative."
"Non-derivative host contracts, with the exception of financial  
assets, are regularly inspected within the Continental Group for  
embedded derivatives."
"If separation is appropriate, the host contract is accounted for in  
accordance with the relevant IFRS requirements."
"The embedded 
derivative is recognized at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)."
"Inventories 
Inventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable 
value."
"Acquisition cost is generally determined using the weighted-
average method."
"Production cost includes direct costs, production-
related material costs, overheads and depreciation."
"Inventory risks 
resulting from decreased marketability or excessive storage periods 
are accounted for with write-downs."
"Other assets  
Other assets are recognized at amortized cost."
"Allowances are  
recognized as appropriate to reflect any possible risk related to  
recoverability."
"Accounting for income taxes 
Income taxes are measured using the concept of the statement of 
financial position liability method in accordance with IAS 12, Income 
Taxes."
"Tax expenses and refunds that relate to income are recog-
nized as income taxes."
"Late payment fines and interest arising from 
subsequently assessed taxes are not reported under the item in-
come tax expense, but rather as interest income and expense."
"Current taxes owed on income are recognized as expenses when 
they are incurred."
"They are determined taking into account the re-
spective local tax laws and relevant case law."
"The complexity of 
these regulations and the possible differences in interpretation be-
tween taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the 
other may lead to uncertainties regarding the handling of individ-
ual facts and circumstances."
"These uncertain tax positions are 
measured in accordance with IFRIC 23 as the mostly likely amount."
"Owing to the lack of an unrestricted market comparison, determin-
ing prices for cross-border intercompany transactions is extremely 
complex and therefore subject to uncertainty."
"In the Continental 
Group, prices are therefore regularly determined on the basis of the 
internationally recognized arm’s length principle, taking into ac-
count the transfer pricing methods specified by lawmakers and the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."
"If there are multiple tax uncertainties and a correlation between 
them and certain tax parameters, they are presented in the finan-
cial statements either individually or as a group, depending on how 
the risk is realized."
"Deferred taxes include expected tax payments and refunds from 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the con-
solidated financial statements and the related tax bases, as well as 
from the utilization of loss carryforwards."
"No deferred tax is recog-
nized for non-tax-deductible goodwill."
"The deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are measured at the applicable tax rates related to the  
period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse."
"Changes in tax rates are recognized once the rate has been sub-
stantially enacted."
"Deferred tax assets are not recognized if it is  
not probable that they will be realized in the future."
"In a country-specific review, the extent to which tax-related risks 
that are likely to occur can or must be offset against losses or loss 
carryforwards in the individual countries or tax groups is analyzed."
"If there is a need for offsetting in the countries or tax groups, the 
probable tax-related risks are offset against the associated losses 
and loss carryforwards."
"As a result, the disclosure of deferred taxes 
on loss carryforwards includes a risk adjustment for the Continen-
tal Group units affected."
"Income tax receivables and liabilities are recognized as current 
items, as they are due immediately and this due date often cannot 
be deferred."
"As at the end of the reporting period, the regulations known as the 
Pillar Two Model Rules of the OECD governing a global minimum 
corporate tax rate had already been carried over into German law 
under the Minimum Tax Act (Mindeststeuergesetz – MinStG) and 
apply from January 1, 2024."
"The Continental Group falls within the 
scope of these regulations."
"The minimum tax is levied at the level of INA-Holding Schaeffler 
GmbH & Co."
"KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, as the parent com-
pany of the IHO Group (ultimate parent entity) and group parent."
"Within the framework of the requirements stipulated by the mini-
mum tax regulations, Continental AG, as the parent company of the 
Continental Group, acts as a partially owned parent entity."
"Conti-
nental AG is included in the consolidated financial statements of 
INA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co."
"KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany, 
and, for this reason, is jointly assessed with the other companies of 
the IHO Group when determining the minimum tax."
"Continental AG 
is obligated in accordance with Section 3 (6) MinStG to compen-
sate INA-Holding Schaeffler GmbH & Co."
"KG, Herzogenaurach, Ger-
many, for the share of the minimum tax attributable to Continental 
AG."
"Owing to the expected introduction of so-called recognized na-
tional top-up taxes, it is possible that the duty to pay the minimum 
tax due may fall on group subsidiaries other than Continental AG."
"INA-Holding 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Schaeffler GmbH & Co."
"KG, Herzogenaurach, Germany."
"In a transi-
tion period for the fiscal years 2024 through 2026, so-called safe 
harbor rules linked to the fulfillment of certain criteria may be uti-
lized that allow companies to dispense with the exact calculation of 
the minimum tax, with the minimum tax being set at zero in such 
cases."
"Continental, together with the IHO Group, has conducted an initial 
indicative analysis to determine the future impact of the regula-
tions governing the global minimum tax."
"In Argentina, Greece, the 
Philippines, Singapore, Spain, South Korea and the United Arab 
Emirates, a tax rate of less than 15% may apply based on the global 
minimum tax regulations."
"The proportional minimum tax expense 
for the Continental Group based on this analysis lies in the mid-
seven-figure range."
"The anticipated impact on the effective corpo-
rate tax rate is therefore insignificant."
"Employee benefits  
The retirement benefits offered by the Continental Group comprise 
both defined benefit and defined contribution plans."
"Pension provisions under defined benefit plans are actuarially 
measured pursuant to IAS 19, Employee Benefits (revised 2011), 
using the projected unit credit method that reflects salary, pension 
and employee fluctuation trends."
"The discount rate to determine 
the present value is based on long-term loans in the respective cap-
ital market."
"Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other com-
prehensive income."
"Expenses from interest cost on pension liabili-
ties and income from pension funds are reported net in the finan-
cial result."
"Accordingly, the interest effects of other long-term employee bene-
fits are reported in the financial result."
"Pension liabilities for some 
companies of the Continental Group are covered by pension funds."
"Furthermore, plan assets comprise all assets, as well as claims from 
insurance contracts, that are held exclusively toward payments to 
those entitled to pensions and are not available to meet the claims 
of other creditors."
"Pension obligations and plan assets are reported 
on a net basis in the statement of financial position."
"The other post-employment benefits also shown under the employee 
benefits relate to obligations to pay for health costs for retired workers 
in the USA and Canada in particular."
"Defined contribution plans represent retirement benefits where the 
company only contributes contractually fixed amounts for current 
service entitlements, which are generally invested by independent, 
external asset managers until the date of retirement of the employee."
"The fixed amounts are partly dependent on the level of the em-
ployee’s own contribution."
"The company gives no guarantees of 
the value of the asset after the fixed contribution, either at the re-
tirement date or beyond."
"The entitlement is therefore settled by the 
contributions paid in the year."
"Provisions for other risks and obligations 
Provisions are recognized when a legal or constructive obligation 
has arisen that is likely to result in a future cash outflow to third par-
ties and the amount can be reliably determined or estimated."
"The 
provisions are recognized as at the end of the reporting period at 
the value at which the obligations could probably be settled or 
transferred to a third party."
"Non-current provisions such as those 
for litigation or environmental risks are discounted to their present 
value."
"The resulting periodic interest charge for the provisions is 
shown under the financial result including an effect from a change 
in interest."
"Non-financial liabilities 
Current non-financial liabilities are carried at their settlement 
amount."
"Non-current non-financial liabilities are measured at  
amortized cost."
"Share-based payments  
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value  
using a Monte Carlo simulation."
"The liabilities are recognized under 
employee benefits until the end of the holding period."
"Equity-settled 
share-based payments are measured at the fair value of the 
granted equity instruments."
"The significant assumptions and estimates in the reporting period 
related to: 
› 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment."
"› 
the impairment testing of goodwill and non-current assets, in  
particular the underlying cash flow forecasts and discount rates 
(determination of the recoverable)."
"› 
the identification of impairment losses or reversals of impairment 
losses on intangible assets."
"› 
the identification of impairment losses or reversals of impairment 
losses on inventories."
"› 
the identification of intangible assets and their measurement 
within the scope of company acquisitions."
"› 
the assessment of the recoverability of receivables and other  
financial assets (impairment amount)."
"› 
the determination of fair values with regard to financial assets 
and liabilities."
"› 
the recognition and measurement of income tax payables and 
deferred taxes on temporary differences, and the recognition of 
deferred tax assets on losses carried forward."
"› 
the assessment of technical and economic feasibility when capi-
talizing development costs."
"› 
the recognition and measurement of leases."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
148 
› 
the measurement of revenue reductions and reimbursement  
liabilities within the scope of revenue recognition."
"› 
the actuarial parameters influencing share-based payments."
"› 
the recognition and measurement of liabilities and provisions,  
in particular the actuarial parameters for pensions and similar  
obligations used to determine defined benefit obligations."
"› 
the point in time at which assets and liabilities are classified as 
held for sale."
"› 
the recognition and measurement of provisions and contingent 
liabilities, in particular with regard to the parameters for measur-
ing restructuring provisions, as well as the probability of occur-
rence and the amount of warranty, litigation and environmental 
risks."
"The assumptions and estimates are based on the information cur-
rently available at the date of preparation of the consolidated finan-
cial statements."
"The underlying information is regularly reviewed 
and updated to reflect actual developments as necessary."
"We again reviewed whether climate-related issues had a significant 
effect on reporting in the year under review."
"Such effects are possi-
ble in a number of different areas."
"Climate-related risk factors were therefore considered in estimates 
and judgments when preparing the consolidated financial statements."
"Climate-related aspects are also considered in the management  
remuneration structure."
"As described in detail in the remuneration 
report, the long-term incentive (LTI) for the Executive Board mem-
bers includes a sustainability score as a second performance crite-
rion in addition to the degree of target achievement of the relative 
total shareholder return (TSR)."
"The tar-
gets are based on the Continental Group’s sustainability ambition, 
the reported sustainability indicators and associated corporate tar-
gets as well as management processes, which are specified in de-
tail in the non-financial statement within the management report."
"The target values for the individual target years of the LTI are de-
rived from the medium and long-term corporate targets."
"For own 
CO2 emissions, for example, the target path of the 2040 carbon 
neutrality target and the corresponding intermediate steps for the 
respective LTI target values are used."
"The basis for measuring the 
target achievement is the measurement of performance in the cor-
responding period or in the last year of the plan."
"For own CO2 emis-
sions, the strategic orientation for the defined target values, where 
necessary with interim steps for the individual tranches in order to 
achieve the long-term goal, is to reduce own CO2 emissions to 0.7 
million metric tons of CO2 by 2030 and to net zero by 2040."
"These 
targets are included in the 2020–2023, 2021–2024, 2022–2025, 
2023–2026 and 2024–2027 LTI plans."
"As in previous years, no significant effects of climate-related risk 
factors on reporting were identified."
"There were also no significant 
effects on individual items in the reporting period."
"Based on available information, the effects of the current macroe-
conomic environment on the accounting of the Continental Group 
were also continuously reviewed over the course of 2023."
"The 
macroeconomic environment continued to be shaped in particular 
by high inflation and the development of interest rates in the re-
porting period."
"This had no material effect 
on the reporting of the Continental Group in the reporting period."
"Overall, as in the previous year, there was a high level of uncer-
tainty when making estimates in the reporting year."
"The development of the geopolitical situation remains difficult  
to predict."
"We cannot foresee the effects that the ongoing war in 
Ukraine and the Middle East conflict which flared up in October, as 
well as the associated disruptions to production, supply chains and 
demand, will have on accounting."
"The level of uncertainty involved 
when making estimates is higher than in previous reporting peri-
ods."
"Continental therefore reviewed the effects of the war on the 
accounting of the Continental Group as at December 31, 2023, on 
the basis of the information available in the reporting period."
"Due 
to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the unclear development of the 
geopolitical situation in the reporting period, Continental AG sold  
all Russian operations in the Automotive and Tires segments and 
some Russian operations in the ContiTech segment."
"For further de-
tails, please refer to the section on acquisition and disposal of com-
panies and business operations in this report."
"Following the sale, 
only immaterial operations in the ContiTech segment remained in 
Russia as at December 31, 2023."
"With respect to further developments concerning the war in Ukraine, 
the conflict in the Middle East, climate-related aspects and the mac-
roeconomic environment, the Continental Group is still continuously 
reviewing the possible effects on accounting."
"This includes all cash and 
cash equivalents and demand deposits."
"Cash equivalents are short-
term, highly liquid financial investments that can be readily converted 
into known cash amounts and are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value."
"The restrictions that may impact the availability of capital are also 
understood to comprise all existing restrictions on the cash and 
cash equivalents."
"In the Continental Group, the cash and cash 
equivalents are restricted with regard to pledged amounts and  
balances in countries with foreign-exchange restrictions or other 
barriers to accessing liquidity."
"Taxes to be paid on the transfer of 
cash assets from one country to another are not usually consid-
ered to represent a restriction on cash and cash equivalents."
"Financial investments are considered to be cash equivalents only  
if they have a remaining original term not exceeding three months."
"New Accounting Pronouncements 
In accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No."
"Accordingly, IFRS are only required 
to be applied following endorsement of the new standards by the 
EU Commission."
"The amendments replace the requirement to 
disclose significant accounting policies with the requirement to  
disclose material accounting policies."
"Furthermore, the amend-
ments add guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality  
in the context of accounting policy disclosures."
"The amendments 
are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 
January 1, 2023."
"The amendments had no significant effect on the 
consolidated financial statements of Continental AG."
"Accounting estimates 
are monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to 
measurement uncertainty."
"The amendments are required to be ap-
plied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"The 
amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of Continental AG."
"The amend-
ments are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or 
after January 1, 2023."
"The amendments had no significant effect on 
the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG."
"The amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes (International Tax Reform 
– Pillar Two Model Rules), introduce a temporary exception to the 
accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar 
Two income taxes."
"The amendments also require an entity to dis-
close that it has applied the temporary exception and to disclose 
separately its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two in-
come taxes."
"To the extent information is not known or reasonably es-
timable, an entity should instead disclose a statement to that effect 
and disclose information about the entity’s progress in assessing its 
exposure."
"The other 
new disclosure requirements of the amendment are required to be 
applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"The amendments had no significant effect on the consolidated  
financial statements of Continental AG."
"In June 2020, 
further amendments and clarifications were made to IFRS 17 in or-
der to simplify the requirements of the standard and facilitate the 
transition to the new regulations."
"The standard and the consequen-
tial amendments to other standards were originally required to be 
applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021."
"The amendments to IFRS 17 deferred the effective date of IFRS 17 
(including the amendments to IFRS 17 and the consequential amend-
ments to other standards) by two years to annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"The standard and the con-
sequential amendments to other standards had no significant ef-
fect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG."
"The amendment to IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts (Initial Application 
of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information), adds a transition 
option (classification overlay) for entities that apply IFRS 17 and 
IFRS 9 at the same time."
"An entity is permitted to apply the option 
for the purpose of presenting comparative information about a finan-
cial asset if the comparative information has not been restated for 
IFRS 9."
"This is the case when the entity chooses not to restate prior 
periods or if the entity restates prior periods but the financial asset 
has been derecognized during those prior periods."
"When applying 
the option, the comparative information should be presented as if 
the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 for finan-
cial assets had been applied."
"For entities that have applied IFRS 9 
before they apply IFRS 17, the option applies to financial assets 
that have been derecognized in the comparative period."
"In this 
case, an entity is permitted to apply the redesignation requirements 
of IFRS 17 based on how the entity expects the asset would have 
been designated at the date of initial application of IFRS 17."
"The 
amendment is required to be applied for annual periods beginning 
on or after January 1, 2023."

effect on the consolidated financial statements of Continental AG."
"For a liability to be classified as 
non-current, the entity’s substantial right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period must exist 
at the end of the reporting period."
"For a liability to be non-current, 
an assessment is required of whether an entity has the right to de-
fer settlement of a liability and not whether the entity will exercise 
that right."
"Furthermore, the amendments clarify the circumstances 
in which counterparty conversion options in relation to issued eq-
uity instruments affect classification as current or non-current."
"The 
2020 amendments also specified how an entity should assess 
whether it has the right to defer settlement of a liability when that 
right is subject to compliance with specified conditions (covenants) 
within 12 months after the reporting period."
"Due to strong con-
cerns about its interpretation, the IASB addressed this point and 
made improvements in further amendments to IAS 1 in 2022."
"Instead, the amend-

nants in the notes to the financial statements."

statement of financial position as at January 1, 2024, the syndicated 
loan utilized at the end of the 2023 reporting period in the amount 
of €316.3 million is reclassified from current to non-current items."
"The amendments to IFRS 16, Leases (Lease Liability in a Sale and 
Leaseback), refine the accounting treatment for sale and leaseback 
transactions."
"The amendments specify the requirements that a seller-
lessee should apply when measuring the lease liability arising from 
a sale and leaseback transaction, to ensure that the seller-lessee 
does not recognize a gain or loss from the right of use retained."

"A currency is 
exchangeable into another currency when an entity is able to ob-
tain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal 
administrative delay and through a market or exchange mecha-

rights and obligations."
"If a currency is not exchangeable at the 
measurement date, an entity is required to estimate a spot exchange 
rate (rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take 
place at the measurement date between market participants under 
prevailing economic conditions)."
"In this case, the entity is required 
to disclose information that enables users of its financial state-

"A significant contributor to the year-on-year im-
provement was the development of the Chinese renminbi in rela-
tion to the euro."

which €41.7 million (PY: €30.1 million) was for previous years."
"Fur-
thermore, as in the previous year, the tax rate was negatively affected

incurred from internal restructuring, which are reported under 
“Other.” Please also refer to Note 19."

on the tax rate."
"In the year under review, local income taxes of 
€45.6 million (PY: €23.4 million) were incurred with a different tax 
base."
"This was attributable primarily to local income taxes in Hun-

initial measurement of lease liabilities, such options are recognized 
once it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised."

"The future scope of obligations arising from leases to which Conti-
nental is committed but that had not yet commenced as at the bal-
ance sheet date amounted to €18.0 million (PY: €33.9 million)."
"The Continental Group estimates the potential cash outflow from 
residual value guarantees, which were not included in the measure-
ment of the lease liability as at the reporting date, at €0.0 million 
(PY: €0.4 million)."
"Contract manufacturing 
In 2018, the Continental Group concluded a framework agreement 
with Vitesco Technologies on contract manufacturing."
"Due to variable lease payments from Continen-
tal to Vitesco Technologies, which are made according to customer 
calls for delivery, no right-of-use assets or corresponding lease liabili-
ties are recognized."
"In the fiscal year under review, the expenses for 
variable lease payments due to contract manufacturing amounted 
to €641.5 million (PY: €863.3 million)."
"In connection with contract 
manufacturing, the Continental Group expects future cash outflows 
from variable lease payments of €201.0 million (PY: €811.7 million) 
for the remaining lease terms."
"Continental Group as lessor 
The Continental Group acts as lessor in some business relation-
ships."
These constitute operating leases as well as finance leases.
"Whereas for operating leases the Continental Group retains the ma-
terial risks and rewards incidental to ownership, for finance leases 
these are transferred to the lessee."
"Operating leases 
Lease income from operating leases in which the Continental 
Group acts as lessor amounted to €3.2 million (PY: €4.1 million)."
These related primarily to the (sub)leasing of land and buildings.
"Such leases are classified as operating 
leases."
"The Continental Group receives variable lease payments  
depending on customer calls for delivery."
"Income in the reporting 
year related to variable lease payments due to contract manufac-
turing amounted to €535.5 million (PY: €696.6 million)."
"Finance leases 
The Continental Group acts exclusively as a sublessor of leased 
land and buildings."
"As these subleases extend beyond the total  
remaining term of the head lease, they are classified as finance 
leases."
"Rental income in 2023 amounted to €2.5 
million (PY: €2.6 million), while associated maintenance costs of 
€1.2 million (PY: €1.4 million) were incurred."

"Since 2008, there has been a limit on the 
deductible interest that can be carried forward in Germany; the 
amount deductible under tax law is limited to 30% of taxable in-
come before depreciation, amortization and interest."
"Deferred tax assets were up €452.5 million at €2,511.8 million  
(PY: €2,059.2 million)."
"This was primarily attributable to an increase 
in deferred tax assets on other intangible assets, employee benefits 
and tax losses carried forward."
"Deferred tax liabilities increased by €14.0 million year-on-year to 
€71.6 million (PY: €57.5 million)."
"As at December 31, 2023, the consolidated tax losses carried  
forward in Germany and abroad amounted to €5,141.4 million  
(PY: €5,397.9 million)."
"The majority of the Continental Group’s tax 
losses carried forward relate to foreign subsidiaries and are largely 
unlimited in terms of the time period for which they can be carried 
forward."
"Of the deferred tax assets on allowable tax 
credits deemed unusable, €236.6 million (PY: €122.1 million) can 
be used indefinitely, €95.7 million (PY: €202.4 million) expire within 
the next 10 years and €53.0 million (PY: —) expire in more than 10

"Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences can 
be used indefinitely."
"Given that future taxable in-
come is expected, it is sufficiently probable that these deferred tax 
assets can be realized."

The temporary differences from retained earnings of foreign com-

"Deferred tax liabilities were not taken into account, since 
remittance to the parent company is not planned in the short or 
medium term."
"Loans to third parties related mainly to loans to customers with  
various maturities and tenant loans for individual properties."
"Amounts receivable from employees related mainly to preliminary

dies for research and development expenses not yet utilized and

"The Continental Group uses several programs for the sale of receiv-
ables."
"When the risks and rewards of receivables, in particular credit 
and default risks, have mostly not been transferred, the receivables 
are still recognized as assets in the statement of financial position."
"Under the existing sale-of-receivables programs, the contractual 
rights to the receipt of payment inflows have been assigned to the 
corresponding contractual parties."
"The transferred receivables have 
short remaining terms."
"As a rule, therefore, the carrying amounts as 
at the reporting date in the amount of €610.8 million (PY: €551.9 
million) are approximately equivalent to their fair value."
"The respec-
tive liabilities with a carrying amount of €321.3 million (PY: €323.9

ceivables."
"As in the previous year, this was approximately equiva-
lent to their fair value."
"The committed financing volume under 
these sale-of-receivables programs amounts to €400.0 million

"Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include all liquid funds and demand de-
posits."
"Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid financial in-
vestments that can be readily converted into known cash amounts 
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value."
"As at 
the reporting date, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 
€2,923.2 million (PY: €2,988.0 million)."
"Of that, €2,683.4 million 
(PY: €2,441.3 million) was unrestricted."
"For information on the interest-rate risk and the sensitivity analysis

"Equity 
The subscribed capital of Continental AG remained unchanged 
year-on-year."
"At the end of the reporting period it amounted to 
€512,015,316.48 and was composed of 200,005,983 no-par-
value shares with a notional value of €2.56 per share."
"The Supervisory Board and Executive Board 
will propose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting the payment of a 
dividend of €2.20 per share entitled to dividends."
"The total distribu-
tion is therefore €440,013,162.60 for 200,005,983 shares entitled 
to dividends."
"The remaining retained earnings are to be carried for-
ward to new account."

"Capital Management  
The aim of the Continental Group is to maintain a strong capital 
base in order to preserve the trust of the capital market, customers 
and employees and to ensure the sustainable development of the 
company."
"To assess the achievement of these goals, the Continen-
tal Group uses the equity ratio (defined as equity reported in the 
statement of financial position, including non-controlling interests, 
divided by total assets) and the gearing ratio as key figures."
"In general, the gearing ratio should be below 40% in the coming 
years."
"If justified by extraordinary financing reasons or specific mar-
ket circumstances, we can rise above this ratio under certain condi-
tions."
The equity ratio should exceed 30%.
"The overall strategy of 
the Continental Group remained unchanged from the previous 
year."
"The Continental Group is not subject to any externally im-
posed capital requirements, and its main loan agreements do not 
currently contain any financial covenants."
"Our pension strategy is focusing on switching from defined benefit 
to defined contribution plans in order to offer both employees and 
the company a sustainable and readily understandable pension 
system."
"Many defined benefit plans have been closed for new employees 
or future service and replaced by defined contribution plans."
"In countries in which defined contribution plans are not possible 
for legal or economic reasons, defined benefit plans have been op-
timized or changed to minimize the associated risks of longevity, 
inflation and salary increases."
"Defined benefit plans  
Defined benefit plans include pension plans, termination indemni-
ties regardless of the reason for the end of employment and other 
post-employment benefits."
"As a result of the significant increase in 
the number of employees in recent years and the high level of ac-
quisition activity, pension obligations essentially relate to active 
employees."
"The defined benefit pension plans cover 158,359 ben-
eficiaries, including 109,713 active employees, 23,545 former em-
ployees with vested benefits, and 25,101 retirees and surviving 
dependents."
"The pension obligations are concentrated in four 
countries: Germany, the USA, the United Kingdom and Canada, 
which account for more than 90% of total pension obligations."
"The weighted average term of the defined benefit pension obliga-
tions is around 16 years."
"This term is based on the present value 
of the obligations."
"Germany 
In Germany, Continental provides pension benefits through the 
cash balance plan, prior commitments and deferred compensation."
"The retirement plan regulation applicable to active members is 
based primarily on the cash balance plan and thus on benefit 
modules."
"When the insured event occurs, the retirement plan as-
sets are paid out as a lump-sum benefit, in installments or as a 
pension, depending on the amount of the retirement plan assets."
"There are no material minimum guarantees in relation to a particu-
lar amount of retirement benefits."
"Pension plans transferred to or assumed by Continental in the con-
text of acquisitions (Siemens VDO, Temic, Teves, Phoenix) were in-
cluded in the cash balance plan."
"For the main German companies, 
the cash balance plan is partly covered by funds in contractual 
trust arrangements (CTAs)."
"In Germany, there are no legal or regu-
latory minimum funding requirements."
"The CTAs are legally independent from the company and manage 
the plan assets as trustees in accordance with the respective CTAs."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
181 
Internal 
Some prior commitments were granted through two legally inde-
pendent pension contribution funds."
"Pensionskasse für Angestellte 
der Continental Aktiengesellschaft VVaG and Pensionskasse von 
1925 der Phoenix AG VVaG have been closed since March 1, 
1984, and July 1, 1983, respectively."
"The investment regulations are in accord-
ance with the legal requirements and risk structure of the obliga-
tions."
"The pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest 
rate of 2.5% or 2.25%."
"Under the German Company Pensions Law 
(Betriebsrentengesetz – BetrAVG), Continental is ultimately liable 
for the implementation path of the pension contribution fund."
"In 
accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, the pension obliga-
tions covered by the pension contribution fund are therefore de-
fined benefit pension plans."
"The pension contribution funds met 
their minimum net funding requirement as at December 31, 2023."
"However, given that only the plan members are entitled to the assets 
and amounts generated, the benefit obligations are recognized in 
the same amount as the existing assets at fair value."
"Continental also supports private contribution through deferred 
compensation schemes."
"Deferred compensation is essentially offered through a fully 
funded multi-employer plan (Höchster Pensionskasse VVaG) for 
contributions up to 4% of the assessment ceiling in social security."
"The pension contribution fund ensures guaranteed minimum inter-
est for which Continental is ultimately liable under the German 
Company Pensions Law."
"The company is not liable for guarantees 
to employees of other companies."
"As Höchster Pensionskasse 
VVaG is a combined defined benefit plan for several companies 
and Continental has no right to the information required for ac-
counting for this defined benefit plan, this plan is recognized as  
a defined contribution plan."
"Entitled employees can use the cash balance plan for deferred 
compensation contributions above the 4% assessment ceiling."
This share is funded by insurance annuity contracts.
"USA 
Owing to its acquisition history, Continental has various defined 
benefit plans in the USA, which were closed to new entrants and 
frozen to accretion of further benefits in a period from April 1, 
2005, to December 31, 2011."
"In 2017, acquisitions also included 
an open defined benefit plan for unionized employees."
"The closed defined benefit plans are commitments on the basis of 
the average final salary and cash balance commitments."
"The de-
fined benefit plans for unionized and non-unionized employees  
are based on a pension multiplier per year of service."
"Closed defined benefit plans were replaced by defined contribu-
tion plans."
"Defined contribution plans apply to the majority of  
active employees in the USA."
"Due to the rise in interest rates, further efforts are currently being 
made to push for additional funding."
"The plan assets of the defined benefit plans are managed in a mas-
ter trust."
"Investment supervision was delegated to the Pension 
Committee, a body appointed within the Continental Group."
"The  
legal and regulatory framework for the plans is based on the US 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)."
"The valuation of the financing level is required on the basis of this 
law."
"The interest rate used for this calculation is the average rate 
over a period of 25 years and therefore currently higher than the 
interest rate used to discount obligations under IAS 19."
"The statu-
tory valuation therefore gives rise to a lower obligation than that in 
line with IAS 19."
"There is a regulatory requirement to ensure mini-
mum funding of 80% in the defined benefit plans to prevent bene-
fit curtailments."
"United Kingdom 
Continental maintains four defined benefit plans as a result of its 
history of acquisitions in the United Kingdom."
"All plans are com-
mitments on the basis of the average or final salary."
"The four plans 
were closed to new employees in the period between April 1, 2002, 
and November 30, 2004."
"Continental offers defined contribution 
plans for all employees who have joined the company since that 
time."
"As at April 5, 2016, the Continental Group Pension and Life Assur-
ance Scheme was frozen to accretion of further benefits."
"It was  
replaced by a defined contribution plan as at April 6, 2016."
"As at July 31, 2017, the Mannesmann UK Pension Scheme was 
frozen to accretion of further benefits."
"It was replaced by a defined 
contribution plan as at August 1, 2017."
"Our pension strategy in the UK focuses on reducing risks and in-
cludes the option of partial or complete funding by purchasing an-
nuities."
"The rise in interest rates and the good funded status cur-
rently present opportunities to push for partial or complete fund-
ing."
The receptivity of the insurance market is currently limited.
"The funding conditions are defined by the UK Pensions Regulator 
and the corresponding laws and regulations."
"The defined benefit 
plans are managed by trust companies."
"The boards of trustees of 
these companies have an obligation solely to the good of the ben-
eficiaries on the basis of the trust agreement and the law."
"Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

The necessary funding is determined every three years through 
technical valuations in line with local provisions."
"The obligations 
are measured using a discount rate based on government bonds 
and other conservatively selected actuarial assumptions."
"Compared with IAS 19, which derives the discount rate from senior 
corporate bonds, this usually results in a higher obligation."
"Three of 
the four defined benefit plans had a funding deficit on the basis of 
the most recent technical valuation."
"The trustees and the company 
have agreed on a recovery plan that provides for additional tempo-
rary annual payments."
"The valuation process must be completed 
within 15 months of the valuation date."

"Canada 
Continental maintains various defined benefit plans as a result of 
its history of acquisitions."
"The pension plans are based mainly on  
a pension multiplier per year of service."
"Fluctuations in the amount of the pension obligation resulting 
from exchange-rate effects are subject to the same risks as overall 
business development."
"These fluctuations relate mainly to the cur-
rencies of the USA, Canada and the UK and have no material im-
pact on Continental."
"For information on the effects of interest-rate 
risks and longevity risk on the pension obligations, please refer to 
the sensitivities described later on in this note."
"The pension obligations for Germany, the USA, Canada, the UK 
and other countries, as well as the amounts for Continental as a 
whole, are shown in the following tables."
"This was primarily due to actuarial losses in all 
countries."
The defined benefit assets increased by €17.6 million year-on-year.
This resulted primarily from the rise in actuarial losses in all countries.
"The €476.0 million increase in the defined benefit obligations com-
pared with December 31, 2022, resulted in particular from actuar-
ial losses from changes in financial assumptions."
"The fund assets in Germany include the CTA assets amounting to 
€1,419.4 million (PY: €1,406.2 million), pension contribution fund 
assets of €175.1 million (PY: €185.7 million) and insurance annuity 
contracts amounting to €140.4 million (PY: €130.4 million)."
"Fund assets increased by €1.2 million in the reporting year to 
€3,065.5 million."
"Actuarial gains and losses on fund assets in Germany resulted from 
actuarial gains of €30.1 million (PY: actuarial losses of €101.2 mil-
lion) from the CTAs."
"In the Continental Group, there are pension contribution funds for 
previously defined contributions in Germany that have been closed 
to new entrants since July 1, 1983, and March 1, 1984, respec-
tively."
"As at December 31, 2023, the minimum net funding require-
ment was exceeded; Continental AG has no requirement to make 
additional contributions."
"The pension fund assets had a fair value of 
€175.1 million as at December 31, 2023 (PY: €185.8 million)."
"The 
pension contribution funds have tariffs with an interest rate of 2.5% 
or 2.25%."
"Under the German Company Pensions Law, Continental 
AG is ultimately liable for the implementation path of the pension 
contribution fund."
"It therefore constitutes a defined benefit pension 
plan that must be reported in line with the development of pension 
provisions."
"However, given that only the plan members are entitled 
to the assets and income generated, the benefit obligations are rec-
ognized in the same amount as the existing assets at fair value."
"Another parameter for measuring the pension obligation is the 
long-term pension trend."
"The following weighted average long-
term pension trend was used as at December 31, 2023, for the 
key countries: Germany 2.20% (PY: 2.20%), Canada 0.0% (PY: 0.0%) 
and the United Kingdom 3.2% (PY: 3.3%)."
"For the USA, the long-
term pension trend does not constitute a significant measurement 
parameter."
"The pension trend increased from 1.75% to 2.20% as at 
December 31, 2022, due to inflation and the associated pension 
increases in Germany."
"The decrease in the discount fac-
tor in all countries in the 2023 reporting period compared with 
2022 resulted in actuarial losses in all countries."
"The actuarial gains 
in the previous fiscal year resulted from a rise in interest rates com-
pared with the prior year."
"If the other assumptions remained constant, the changes in individ-
ual key actuarial assumptions that could reasonably have been 
possible at the reporting date would have impacted the defined 
benefit obligation by the following amounts."
"Although the analysis 
does not take account of the complete allocation of the cash flows 
expected under the plan, it provides an approximation of the sensi-
tivity of the assumptions shown."
"Changes in the discount rate and the salary and pension trends  
do not have a linear effect on the defined benefit obligations (DBO) 
owing to the financial models used (particularly due to the com-
pounding of interest rates)."
"For this reason, the net periodic pen-
sion cost derived from the pension obligations does not change by 
the same amount as a result of an increase or decrease in the actu-
arial assumptions."
"In addition to the aforementioned sensitivities, the impact of a one-
year-longer life expectancy on the value of benefit obligations was 
computed for the key countries."
"In Ger-
many, increased payments in the form of pensions rather than capi-
tal were assumed in the actuarial valuation, which has the effect of 
increasing the benefit obligations."
"For the calculation of pension 
obligations for domestic plans, life expectancy is based on the 2018 
G mortality tables by Prof. Klaus Heubeck."
"For foreign pension plans, 
comparable criteria are used for the respective country."
"Plan assets 
The structure of the Continental Group’s plan assets is reviewed by 
the investment committees on an ongoing basis taking into account 
the forecast pension obligations."
"In doing so, the investment com-
mittees regularly review the investment decisions taken, the under-
lying expected returns of the individual asset classes reflecting em-
pirical values and the selection of the external fund managers."
2 This refers to investment products that aim to achieve a positive return regardless of market fluctuations.
3 Annuities are insurance contracts that guarantee pension payments.
"Furthermore, the earliest eligible date 
for retirement has been assumed when determining future pension 
payments."
The actual retirement date could occur later.
"Therefore, 
the actual payments in future years for present plan members 
could be lower than the amounts assumed."
The amount and entitlement can be altered.
"Certain retirement 
benefits, in particular for pensions and healthcare costs, are pro-
vided in the USA for hourly paid workers at unionized tire plants 
under the terms of collective pay agreements."
"No separate fund

"The weighted average term of the defined benefit pension obliga-
tion is around nine years."
"This term is based on the present value 
of the obligation."
"Although the analysis 
does not take account of the complete allocation of the cash flows 
expected under the plan, it provides an approximation of the sensi-
tivity of the assumptions shown."
"These entitlements are paid out when the employment 
relationship is terminated."
"In the year under review, expenses from 
these obligations amounted to €4.9 million (PY: €4.5 million)."
"Defined contribution pension plans 
The Continental Group offers its employees pension plans in the 
form of defined contribution plans, particularly in the USA, the UK, 
Japan and China."
"Not including social security contributions, ex-
penses from defined contribution pension plans amounted to 
€81.1 million (PY: €80.0 million) in the fiscal year."
"Other employee benefits 
Other employee benefits include provisions for partial early retire-
ment programs and anniversary and other long-service benefits."
"The provisions for partial early retirement are calculated using a 
discount rate of 3.53% (PY: 3.32%)."
"Provisions for anniversary and 
other long-service benefits were calculated using a discount rate  
of 3.20% (PY: 3.77%)."
"In accordance with the option under IAS 19, 
Employee Benefits, the interest component is reported in the finan-
cial result."
"Variable remuneration elements 
Liabilities for payroll and personnel-related costs also include varia-
ble components based on performance."
"The variable components 
that are based on performance comprise a short-term remunera-
tion component (performance bonus without equity deferral) as 
well as long-term remuneration components (long-term incentive 
and equity deferral of the performance bonus)."
"The LTI plans for the years starting from 2014 and the deferral of 
the performance bonus from the 2019 remuneration system are 
classified as cash-settled share-based payments; hence they are 
recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based 
Payment."
"The equity deferral of the performance bonus of the re-
muneration system applicable from 2020 is classified as an equity-
settled share-based payment; hence it is recognized at fair value in 
accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based Payment."

2014 to 2019 LTI plan: From 2014 to 2019, senior executives of

participation in the long-term, sustainable increase in the Conti-

"The LTI bonus depended on 
job grade and degree of target achievement and was issued in 
annual tranches."
"› 
The term of the 2018/21 tranche, which was resolved on March 13, 
2018, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Execu-
tive Board and on May 28, 2018, by the Executive Board for sen-
ior executives, begins retroactively as at January 1, 2018, and is 
four years."
"After the expiry of the 2018/21 LTI tranche in Decem-
ber 2021, the bonus was not paid out in 2022, as the fair value 
of the tranche as at the payment date was €0.0 million."
"› 
The term of the 2019/22 tranche, which was resolved on March 
14, 2019, by the Supervisory Board for the members of the Exec-
utive Board and on May 24, 2019, by the Executive Board for 
senior executives, begins retroactively as at January 1, 2019, and 
is four years."
"After the expiry of the 2019/22 LTI tranche in De-
cember 2022, the bonus was not paid out in 2023, as the fair 
value of the tranche as at the payment date was €0.0 million."
"For each beneficiary of an LTI tranche, the Supervisory Board (for 
the members of the Executive Board) or the Executive Board (for 
senior executives) of Continental AG specified the amount of a tar-
get bonus in euros to be paid out upon 100% target achievement."
"The actual LTI bonus paid out on expiry of the LTI tranche depends 
on the degree of target achievement."
"The LTI bonus can range be-
tween 0% (no payment) and 200% (maximum payment)."
"The degree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the 
payment and amount of the LTI bonus."
"The first target criterion is 
the equally weighted average of the Continental Value Contribution 
(CVC) of the Continental Group over a period of four fiscal years, 
starting from the fiscal year in which the LTI tranche is issued."
"The 
equally weighted average is calculated by adding together 25% of 
the CVC of the four fiscal years of the term of the LTI tranche."
"The 
second target criterion is the total shareholder return (TSR) on Con-
tinental shares as at the end of the term in relation to the beginning 
of the LTI tranche."
"The share price used in calculating the TSR is 
the arithmetic mean of closing prices in Xetra trading on the Frank-
furt Stock Exchange (or a successor system) on the trading days in 
the three months from October to December before the issue and 
expiry of the LTI tranche."
"In addition, all dividends paid during the 
term of the LTI tranche are taken into account for the TSR.  
The scale for determining the degree of target achievement is de-
fined by the Supervisory Board or the Executive Board when the  
respective LTI tranche is issued."
"This key data is identical for the 
members of the Executive Board and senior executives."
"The degree 
of target achievement for the first target criterion can lie between 
0% and 200%."
"Target achievement is calculated on a straight-line 
basis between 0% and the maximum amount."
"There is no cap for 
the second target criterion."
"The ultimate degree of target achieve-
ment used to calculate the LTI bonus to be paid out is determined 
by multiplying the two target criteria."
"The LTI bonus to be paid out 
is determined by multiplying the degree of target achievement by 
the target bonus."
"The total maximum achievable LTI bonus is 200% 
of the target bonus."
"A Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of the TSR 
target criterion."
"This means that log-normal distributed processes 
are simulated for the price of Continental shares."
"The Monte Carlo 
simulation takes into account the average value accumulation of 
share prices in the respective reference period, the TSR dividends 
and the restriction for the payment amount."
"The term of the TIP, 
which the Executive Board adopted for senior executives on Sep-
tember 2, 2019, extends from October 1, 2019, to December 31, 
2021."
"After the expiry of the TIP bonus in December 2021, the 
bonus was paid out in June 2022."
"The Executive Board of Continental AG specified the amount of 
the target bonus (TIP bonus) in euros for each beneficiary of a 
TIP bonus (senior executives)."
"The TIP bonus is calculated based 
on a certain number of virtual shares of Continental AG (basic 
holding), which can increase through two bonus packages, multi-
plied by the payment share price."
"The payment share price is the 
arithmetic mean of Continental AG’s closing share prices in Xetra 
trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a successor system) 
on the trading days in the last month prior to the Annual Share-
holders’ Meeting that follows the end of the term."
"The TIP bonus, 
which can total at most 200% of the initial share price, is paid to 
the respective beneficiary as a gross lump sum at the end of the 
second complete calendar month following the Annual Share-
holders’ Meeting that follows the end of the term."
"Since the basic 
holding can be increased through two bonus packages, the de-
gree of achievement of two target criteria is decisive for the 
amount of the TIP bonus."
"The target criterion of the first bonus 
package is the results of the OUR BASICS Live corporate survey 
in 2021."
"If at least 70% (equally weighted average) of all partici-
pants respond positively to the Sustainable Engagement Index, 
the beneficiary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to 
50% of the basic holding."
"The target criterion of the second bo-
nus package is met if, at the end of the term, the TSR on Conti-
nental shares equals or exceeds the performance of the STOXX 
Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts Index."
"In this case, the benefi-
ciary receives additional virtual shares equivalent to 50% of the 
basic holding."
"The TSR on Continental shares corresponds to the 
sum of the share price performance as at the end of the term and 
all dividends distributed during the term relative to the share 
price at the beginning of the term."

2020 to 2023 LTI plan: From 2020, a new LTI plan was granted 
to the Executive Board, senior executives and executives that 
aims to promote long-term commitment to the company and its 
sustainable growth."
"The second performance criterion is a sus-
tainability score that is multiplied by the degree of target achieve-
ment in order to calculate the LTI to be paid."
"The amount of the 
LTI to be paid is based on the performance of the Continental 
share price over the term of the LTI."
"After the expiry of the 
2020 LTI plan in December 2022, the bonus for executives and 
senior executives was paid out in 2023."
"› 
For each beneficiary of the 2020 to 2023 LTI plan, the Supervisory 
Board (for the members of the Executive Board) or the Executive 
Board (for senior executives and executives) of Continental AG 
agrees an allotment value in euros for the LTI."
"At the start of the first fiscal year of the term of the LTI plan, this 
allotment value is converted into a basic holding of virtual shares."
"The allotment value is divided by the arithmetic mean of Conti-
nental AG’s closing share prices in Xetra trading on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange (or a successor system) in the last two months 
prior to the start of the term of the respective LTI plan (issue 
price)."
"The basic holding is multiplied by a performance index (PI) 
in order to determine the final holding of virtual shares."
"The per-
formance index corresponds to the product from the relative total 
shareholder return (TSR) on Continental shares and a sustainabil-
ity score."
"The relative TSR is calculated from the relative perfor-
mance of the Continental TSR in comparison with the TSR on the 
STOXX Europe 600 Automobiles & Parts (SXAGR)."
"The Continen-
tal TSR corresponds to the sum of the average Continental share 
price in the last month of the term (final share price) and all divi-
dends distributed during the term relative to the average share 
price in the first month of the term (initial share price)."
"The SXAGR 
TSR is determined using the same method."
"Performance criteria and goals of the sustainability score are tar-
gets for CO2 emissions, recycling quotas and the review of good 
working conditions for employees in the Continental Group (e.g."
"based on sick leave, accident rates and employee satisfaction)."
"The payment amount of the 2020 to 2023 LTI plan can total at 
most 200% of the defined initial share price (executives and sen-
ior executives) or issue price (Executive Board)."
"The issue price is 
the average price of the two months before the start of the term."

"Performance bonus (deferral) under the 2019 remuneration 
system  
The performance bonus was based on a target amount that the Su-
pervisory Board determined for each Executive Board member for 
100% target achievement."
"Target criteria were the year-on-year 
change in the CVC and the return on capital employed (ROCE)."
"For 
Executive Board members with responsibility for a particular busi-
ness area, these criteria related to the relevant business area; for 
other Executive Board members, they related to the Continental 
Group."
"The CVC target was 100% achieved if the CVC was un-
changed compared with the previous year."
"If the CVC fell or rose by 
a defined percentage, this element was reduced to zero or reached 
a maximum of 150%."
"In the case of a negative CVC in the previous 
year, target achievement was based on the degree of improvement."
The criteria for the ROCE target were guided by planning targets.
"This component could also be omitted if a certain minimum value 
was not achieved."
"The CVC target was weighted at 60% and the ROCE target at 40% 
in the calculation of the performance bonus."
"In any event, the per-
formance bonus was capped at 150% of the target bonus."
"The immediate payment 
amounted to 60% and the deferral 40%."
"The deferral was con-
verted into virtual shares of Continental AG."
"Following a holding pe-
riod of three years after the end of the fiscal year for which the re-
spective performance bonus was determined, the value of these 
virtual shares was paid out together with the value of the dividends 
that were distributed for the fiscal years of the holding period."
"The 
conversion of the deferral into virtual shares and payment of their 
value after the holding period were based on the average share 
price for the three-month period immediately preceding the Annual 
Shareholders’ Meeting in the year of conversion or payment."
"The 
possible increase in the value of the deferral was capped at 250% 
of the initial value."
"A Monte Carlo simulation is used in the measurement of stock op-
tions."
"This means that log-normal distributed processes are simu-
lated for the price of Continental shares."
"The measurement model 
also takes into account the average value accumulation of share 
prices in the respective reference period and the floor and cap for 
the payment amount."
"The reporting year marked the last time that payments of the de-
ferral were made under the 2019 remuneration system, as the 
three-year holding period for the virtual shares expired."

the term of the loan by one year."
"This means that the financing 
commitment of the banks is now available until December 2026."
"As at December 31, 2023, Continental Rubber of America, Corp., 
Wilmington, Delaware, USA, had utilized €316.3 million of this re-
volving loan (PY: €300.0 million utilized by Continental AG)."
"In the year under review, the Continental Group utilized its com-
mercial paper programs, its sale-of-receivables programs and its 
various bank lines to meet short-term credit requirements."

"Measurement at amortized cost is 
only considered the best estimate of the fair value of financial assets 
if the most recent information available for fair value measurement 
is insufficient."
"Financial instruments accounted for at FVOCIwoR 
are centrally monitored with regard to any changes to the major 
non-observable input factors and continuously checked for 
changes in value."
"Please see Note 18 for information on the changes in carrying 
amounts of other investments."
"For reasons of materiality, a sensitiv-
ity analysis is not required."
"The accounting and measurement methods applied are described 
in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"The other financial instruments 
measured at cost generally have short remaining terms."
"As a result, 
the carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period are, as  
a rule, approximately their fair values and are not shown in the fair 
value hierarchy in the table."
"The change in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income 
(OCI) relates to the depreciation of another participation as a result 
of a weaker business outlook."
"In the previous year, two financial investments were measured on 
the basis of input factors that do not constitute observable market 
data (Level 3)."
"As a reliable quoted market price became available 
for these instruments in the second half of the previous year, they 
were assigned to Level 1."
"Dividend income from financial assets measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income is explained under Income 
from Investments (Note 10)."
"Collateral 
As at December 31, 2023, a total of €665.3 million (PY: €585.0 mil-
lion) of financial assets had been pledged as collateral."
"In the year 
under review, as in the previous year, collateral mainly consisted of 
trade accounts receivable assigned as collateral for liabilities from 
sale-of-receivables programs."
"The remainder related to pledged 
cash or other financial assets."
"Risk management of financial instruments 
Due to its international business activities and the resulting financ-
ing requirements, the Continental Group is exposed to default risks, 
risks from changes in exchanges rates and variable interest rates, 
and liquidity risk."
"The management of these risks is described in 
the following sections."
"In addition, hedging instruments are used in the Continental Group."
"Their use is covered by corporate-wide policies, adherence to which 
is regularly reviewed by internal auditors."
"Internal settlement risks 
are minimized through the clear segregation of functional areas."
"Further information about the risks presented below and about risk 
management can be found in the report on risks and opportunities 
in the consolidated management report."
"Default risks 
Default risks from trade accounts receivable, contract assets or 
other financial assets include the risk that receivables will be col-
lected late or not at all if a customer or another contractual party 
does not fulfill its contractual obligations."
"The total of the positive 
carrying amounts is equivalent to the maximum default risk of the 
Continental Group from financial assets."
"Default risk is influenced 
mainly by characteristics of the customers and the sector and is 
therefore analyzed and monitored by central and local credit man-
agers."
"The responsibilities of the credit management function also 
include pooled receivables risk management."
"Contractual partners’ 
creditworthiness and payment history are analyzed on a regular 
basis."
"Default risk for non-derivative financial receivables is also limited  
by ensuring that agreements are entered into with partners with 
proven creditworthiness only or that collateral is provided or, in in-
dividual cases, trade credit insurance is agreed."
"The Continental 
Group held an immaterial amount of collateral as at December 31, 
2023."
"There are no trade accounts receivable or contract assets for 
which an impairment loss was not recognized due to collateral held."
"However, default risk cannot be excluded with absolute certainty, 
and any remaining risk is addressed by recognizing expected credit 
losses for identified individual risks and on the basis of experience, 
taking account of any relevant future components."
"Financial assets 
that are neither past due nor impaired accordingly have a prime 
credit rating."
"Default risks are calculated on the basis of corporate-
wide standards."
"The methods for calculating loss allowances are 
described in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial state-
ments."
"Trade accounts receivable and contract assets 
If the creditworthiness of receivables is impaired, corresponding ex-
penses are recognized in an allowance account."
"Lifetime expected credit losses are largely calculated using esti-
mates and assessments based on the creditworthiness of the re-
spective customer, current economic developments and the analy-
sis of historical losses on receivables."
"The creditworthiness of a cus-
tomer is assessed on the basis of its payment history and its ability 
to make payments."
"It is regularly reviewed whether there is a need 
to take account of any risks in connection with different customer 
groups, sectors or countries."
"No such allocation of default risk was 
required in 2023."
"Continental calculates the default rates for lifetime expected credit 
losses based on a three-year average, taking account of the histori-
cal defaults allocated to the different periods past due, and gener-
ally also taking account of a forward-looking component."
"Trade ac-
counts receivable and contract assets whose creditworthiness is al-
ready impaired are not taken into account when calculating lifetime 
expected credit losses."
"There were no significant effects on ex-
pected credit losses from the modification of cash flows."
"Of the impaired receivables written down in the reporting period, 
€3.4 million (PY: €0.9 million) is still subject to enforcement 
measures."
"Other financial assets 
Loss allowances equivalent to the gross carrying amount totaling 
€2.7 million (PY: €2.8 million) were recognized for other financial 
assets whose creditworthiness was impaired."
"Other 12-month and 
lifetime expected credit losses on other financial assets are not of 
significance."
"As a general rule, these banks 
should have at least one investment-grade credit rating from one of 
the global rating agencies."
"The default risk can therefore be consid-
ered very low."
"In addition, the Continental Group sets invest-
ment limits for each bank and trading limits for derivative instru-
ments."
"The amount of these limits is based on the creditworthiness 
of the respective bank."
"Compliance with these limits is continuously 
monitored."
"As in the previous year, expected credit losses from 
cash and cash equivalents and other interest-bearing investments 
measured at amortized cost as well as assets measured at amor-
tized cost with impaired creditworthiness are not significant."
"Currency management 
The international nature of the Continental Group’s business activi-
ties results in deliveries and payments in various currencies."
"Cur-
rency-exchange fluctuations involve the risk of losses because as-
sets denominated in currencies with a falling exchange rate lose 
value, while liabilities denominated in currencies with a rising ex-
change rate become more expensive."
"For hedging, it is allowed to 
use only derivative instruments that have been defined in corpo-
rate-wide policies and can be reported and measured in the treas-
ury management system."
"It is generally not permitted to use finan-
cial instruments that do not meet these criteria."
"These cash flows arise mainly 
from receipts and payments from external and intra-corporate 
transactions by the Continental Group’s subsidiaries worldwide."
"A natural hedge approach for reducing currency risks has been 
pursued for several years, meaning that the difference between  
receipts and payments in any currency is kept as low as possible."
"Exchange-rate developments are also monitored, analyzed and 
forecast."
"Their 
amount must not exceed 30% of the 12-month exposure per cur-
rency without Executive Board permission."
"In addition, further risk 
limits for open derivative positions are set, which considerably re-
duce the risks from hedging activities."
"Hedge accounting was not 
used in the reporting year or in the previous year for hedges con-
cluded in this way."
"Their nominal volume came to €48.6 million as 
at December 31, 2023 (PY: —)."
"Of 
these amounts, the positive values constitute net receivables and 
the negative values net liabilities."
"Financial foreign-currency risks 
In addition to operational foreign-currency risk, currency risks also 
result from the Continental Group’s external and internal net indebt-
edness that is denominated in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the respective subsidiary."
"The quantity of these instru-
ments is regularly summarized in the form of a financial foreign-
currency exposure for each transaction currency."
"As at Decem-
ber 31, 2023, the net exposure in the major currencies amounted 
to -€876.3 million (PY: -€1,045.4 million) for the euro and €877.2 
million (PY: €1,240.6 million) for the US dollar."
"These currency risks are gener-
ally hedged against through the use of derivative instruments, par-
ticularly currency forwards, currency swaps and cross-currency in-
terest-rate swaps."
"In the case of highly effective, longer-term and 
significant hedges, Continental usually applies hedge accounting."
"The hedged transactions are not divided into their risk compo-
nents."
"Hedge accounting was not used in the reporting year or  
in the previous year for hedges concluded in this way."
"Hedging against financial foreign-currency risks without using 
hedge accounting 
As at December 31, 2023, there were derivative instruments to 
hedge against financial foreign-currency risks from intra-corporate 
receivables and liabilities."
"Hedge accounting is not used for these 
instruments, hence their assignment to the measurement category 
FVPL."
"Their nominal volume came to 
€1,371.6 million as at December 31, 2023 (PY: €1,533.1 million)."
"In addition, cross-currency interest-rate swaps with a total nominal 
volume of €500.0 million were reported in the previous year under 
short-term indebtedness in the amount of €8.5 million."
"Translation-related foreign-currency risks 
A large number of the subsidiaries are located outside the euro cur-
rency zone."
"As Continental AG’s reporting currency in the consoli-
dated financial statements is the euro, the financial statements of 
these companies are translated into euros."
"With regard to manag-
ing the risks of translation-related currency effects, it is assumed 
that investments in foreign companies are entered into for the long 
term and that earnings are reinvested."
"Translation-related effects 
that arise when the value of net asset items translated into euros 
changes as a result of exchange-rate fluctuations are recognized  
directly in equity in the consolidated financial statements and are 
generally not hedged."
"Sensitivity analysis  
IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, requires a presentation 
of the effects of hypothetical changes in exchange rates on income 
and equity using a sensitivity analysis."
"In the Continental Group, the 
changes in the exchange rates are related to all financial instru-
ments outstanding as at the end of the reporting period, including 
the effects of hedges."
"Forecast transactions and translation-related 
foreign-currency risks are not included in the sensitivity analysis."
"Hedging transactions are valued on the 
basis of a 10% percent change in the underlying forward or spot 
rates from the perspective of the local currency of the hedging 
Continental Group company."
"The following table shows, before income tax expense, the overall effect as measured using this approach, as well as the individual effects 
resulting from the euro and the US dollar, as the major transaction currencies, on net income."
"As in the previous year, there is no effect on 
equity according to this approach."

"Interest-rate management  
Variable interest agreements and, in principle, short-term financial 
instruments result in a risk of rising interest rates for interest-bear-
ing financial liabilities and falling interest rates for interest-bearing 
financial investments."
"The Continental Group’s interest-bearing net indebtedness is the 
subject of these activities based on the reporting date."
"Interest-rate 
hedges serve exclusively to manage identified interest-rate risks."
"Once a year, a range is determined for the targeted share of fixed-
interest indebtedness in relation to total gross indebtedness."
"As in 
the previous year, there were no derivative instruments to hedge 
against interest-rate risks as at December 31, 2023."
"The main effects resulted from 
the changes in the US dollar and euro interest rates."
"As in the previ-
ous year, there were no changes in equity in 2023."
"The effects on 
the financial result are presented below; tax effects were not taken 
into account in the analysis: 
› 
An increase in US dollar interest rates of 100 basis points in 2023 
would not have led to any change in the financial result (PY: a 
change of €4.4 million)."
"› 
A decrease in US dollar interest rates of 100 basis points would 
not have led to any change in the financial result (PY: a change 
of -€4.4 million)."
"› 
An increase in euro interest rates of 100 basis points in 2023 
would not have led to any change in the financial result (PY: a 
change of -€4.4 million)."
"› 
A decrease in euro interest rates of 100 basis points would not 
have led to any change in the financial result (PY: a change of 
€4.5 million)."
"Cash flow sensitivity analysis  
The following table shows the effects an increase or a decrease in 
interest rates of 100 basis points would have had on the financial 
result."
"The effects would essentially result from floating-rate finan-
cial instruments."
"The effects were calculated for individual groups 
of financial instruments taking account of their contractual arrange-
ment and based on the expected changes in the applicable interest 
rates for these financial instruments depending on changes in mar-
ket interest rates."
"As in the previous year, this analysis is based on 
the assumption that all other variables, and in particular exchange 
rates, remain unchanged."
"Currently, the Continental Group does not recognize any derivative 
instruments with variable interest rates."
"In the measurement of derivative instruments, in particular in dis-
counting, no material effects arose as at Continental as at Decem-
ber 31, 2023, as, firstly, the euro interest curve relevant for the 
Continental Group remains referenced to the previously reformed 
EURIBOR."
"Secondly, in June of the reporting year, the discounting 
of the US dollar interest curve – likewise relevant for the Continen-
tal Group over the course of the year – was changed to a risk-free 
US dollar interest curve."
"The measurement effects resulting over 
the course of the year from this changeover in terms of the rele-
vant derivative instruments were of minor significance."
"The 
 
 
 
 
Continental AG   2023 Annual Report   Consolidated Financial Statements   Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

Internal 
relevant derivative instruments expired in November of the report-
ing year."
"The discounting for further Level 2 measurements of long-term  
financial instruments in particular, which are presented in the table 
at the beginning of this note, was switched to risk-free rates (RFRs) 
for some currencies during the reporting year."
"The resulting transi-
tion effect in the measurement of corresponding financial instru-
ments is of minor significance."
"Further transition effects for future 
switching of discounting to interest curves based on RFRs are like-
wise estimated to be immaterial."
"As no hedge accounting is currently applied within the Continental 
Group, there are no effects on hedge accounting."
"There have been 
no changes to the interest risk management strategy induced as a 
result of interest rate benchmark reform."
"Liquidity risks 
Cost-effective, adequate financing is necessary for the subsidiaries’ 
operating business."
"The central cash management unit therefore 
prepares a rolling liquidity forecast."
"This includes short-term de-
tailed planning of incoming and outgoing payments in the immedi-
ate days to come as well as a long-term calculation of forecast data 
based on a time series analysis that is supplemented with updated 
information on an ongoing basis."
"Various marketable financial instruments are used to meet the  
financial requirements."
"These comprise overnight money, term  
borrowing, the issue of commercial paper, sale-of-receivables pro-
grams, the syndicated loan with a committed nominal amount of 
€4.0 billion (PY: €4.0 billion) and other bilateral loans."
"Furthermore, 
approximately 55% (PY: 51%) of gross indebtedness is financed on 
the capital market in the form of long-term bonds."
"Capital expendi-
ture by subsidiaries is primarily financed through equity and loans 
from banks or subsidiaries."
"There are also cash-pooling arrange-
ments with subsidiaries to the extent they are possible and justifia-
ble in the relevant legal and tax situation."
"If events lead to unex-
pected financing requirements, the Continental Group can draw 
upon existing liquidity and fixed credit lines from banks."
"For infor-
mation on existing liquidity, please refer to Note 24."
"For information 
on the existing utilized and unutilized loan commitments, please re-
fer to Note 31."
"In order to minimize risks with regard to the availa-
bility of existing liquidity, investment limits are in place, which are 
explained under “Default risks for cash and cash equivalents as well 
as derivative instruments and interest-bearing investments” in this 
note."
"The financial liabilities without lease liabilities of €14,522.2 million (PY: €15,863.2 million) result in the following undiscounted cash out-

ros using the current closing rate as at the end of the reporting pe-
riod."
"For floating-rate non-derivative financial instruments and float-
ing-rate interest payments from derivative financial instruments, 
the future interest payment flows are generally forecast using the 
most recently contractually fixed interest rates."
"The analysis only in-
cludes cash outflows from financial liabilities."
"For derivative instru-
ments that are liabilities at the end of the reporting period, the un-
discounted net payments are shown given a contractually specified 
net settlement; if gross settlement is contractually specified, the un-
discounted payment inflows and outflows are presented separately."
Cash inflows from financial assets were not included.
"Global netting agreements and similar agreements 
Continental AG concludes business in the form of derivative instru-
ments on the basis of the German Master Agreement on Financial 
Derivatives Transactions (Deutscher Rahmenvertrag für Finanz-
termingeschäfte)."
"Fundamentally, there is the option to combine 
the amounts owed by each counterparty under such agreements 
on the same day in respect of all outstanding transactions in the 
same currency into a single net amount to be paid by one party to 
another."
"The German Master Agreement on Financial Derivatives Transac-
tions does not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of  
financial position."
"This is due to the fact that Continental AG has no 
legal right to the netting of the amounts recognized at the current 
time."
"According to the regulations of the German Master Agree-
ment, the right to netting can be enforced only when future events 
occur, such as the insolvency of or default by a contractual party."
"In such cases, all outstanding transactions under the agreement 
are ended, the fair value is calculated as at this time, and just a  
single net amount is paid to settle all transactions."
"At two Brazilian subsidiaries there are local framework agreements 
on the basis of which these companies have concluded derivative 
instruments."
"These agreements also do not meet the criteria for off-
setting in the statement of financial position."

"Litigation and Compensation Claims 
Continental AG and its subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits, regula-
tory investigations and proceedings worldwide."
"Such lawsuits, in-
vestigations and proceedings could also be initiated or claims as-
serted in other ways in the future."
"Product liability 
In particular, Continental is constantly subject to product liability 
and other claims in which the company is accused of the alleged 
infringement of its duty of care, violations against warranty obliga-
tions or defects of material or workmanship."
"Claims from alleged 
breaches of contract resulting from product recalls or government 
proceedings are also asserted."
"Among other cases, claimants in the 
USA file lawsuits for property damage, personal injury and death 
caused by alleged defects in our products."
"Claims for material and 
non-material damages, and in some cases punitive damages, are 
asserted."
"The outcome of individual proceedings, which are gener-
ally decided by a jury in a court of first instance, cannot be pre-
dicted with certainty."
"No assurance can be given that Continental 
will not incur substantial expenses as a result of the final judgments 
or settlements in some of these cases, or that these amounts will 
not exceed any provisions set up for these claims."
"Some subsidiar-
ies in the USA are exposed to relatively limited claims for damages 
from purported health injuries allegedly caused by products con-
taining asbestos."
"The total costs for dealing with all such claims and 
proceedings have amounted to less than €50 million per year 
since 2006."
"Disputes over industrial property rights 
Continental could be liable to pay compensation for infringements 
or could be forced to purchase licenses to continue using technol-
ogy from third parties."
"Continental, for example, supplies telecom-
munication modules that transmit vehicle data, enable voice and in-
ternet functionality, and are compatible with cellular communica-
tion standards."
"Continental 
has formed provisions to cover the risks in this regard."
"In accord-
ance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will  
be made so as not to adversely affect the company’s interests."
"On August 18, 2010, the Brazilian antitrust au-
thorities determined an “invitation to cartel” and imposed a fine of 
BRL 12 million (around €2.2 million) on CBIA, which was then re-
duced to BRL 10.8 million (around €2.0 million)."
"CBIA denies the 
accusation that it has infringed Brazilian antitrust law."
"Although the 
court of first instance appealed to by CBIA upheld the decision, on 
CBIA’s further appeal the next higher court annulled this decision 
and remanded the matter."
"In February 2023, the court of first 
instance rendered a verdict against CBIA and lifted the ban on the 
enforcement of the financial penalty against CBIA (at that time an 
amount of BRL 34.2 million [around €6.5 million])."
"CBIA filed a mo-
tion for clarification requesting that the preliminary injunction 
against enforcement remain in full force up until a final and unap-
pealable ruling is made."
"This motion was denied, and CBIA filed an 
appeal against this decision."
"In case an infringement of Brazilian an-
titrust law is found, third parties may, in addition, claim damages 
from CBIA."
"On October 2, 2006, South African antitrust authorities received

manufacturers of alleged antitrust behavior, including Continental 
Tyre South Africa (Pty.) Ltd., Port Elizabeth, South Africa (CTSA), a 
subsidiary of Continental."
"On August 31, 2010, the South African 
antitrust authorities came to the conclusion that CTSA had violated 
South African antitrust law and referred the matter to the responsi-
ble antitrust court for a decision."
"CTSA denies the allegation of in-
fringements of South African antitrust law."
"However, the tribunal 
could impose a fine of up to 10% of CTSA’s sales."
"In addition, third 
parties may also claim damages from CTSA in case of an infringe-
ment of South African competition law."
"In the USA, CAE and Continental Automo-
tive Korea Ltd., Seongnam-si, South Korea, agreed to pay a fine of 
US $4.0 million (approximately €3.6 million) in 2015."
"The risk  
of investigations by other antitrust authorities into this matter and 
claims for damages by further alleged victims remain unaffected by 
the fines imposed."

ary 21, 2018, for the unlawful exchange of information."

"However, should 
the lawsuits lead to a judgment against Continental, the resulting 
expenses could be substantial and exceed the provision set aside 
for this purpose."
"In accordance with IAS 37.92 and GAS 20.154,  
no further disclosures will be made with regard to the proceedings 
and the related measures so as not to adversely affect the com-
pany’s interests."
"On March 3, 2021, the Brazilian antitrust authorities (Conselho Ad-
ministrativo de Defesa Econômica, CADE), acting on the basis of 
the issues addressed by the European Commission and described 
above, formally initiated proceedings against Continental Teves AG 
& Co."
"oHG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and certain former em-
ployees for alleged unlawful exchange of competition-sensitive in-
formation concerning hydraulic brake systems."
"Continental consid-
ers it possible that this proceeding will end with a fine."
"Continental 
is therefore unable to reliably predict in any way what the outcome 
of these proceedings will be."
"If Continental is found responsible for 
any violation, CADE could impose a fine on the company of 0.1% to 
20% of its revenue or that of the Continental Group in Brazil in the 
year prior to when the administrative proceedings were launched 
(2020)."
Non-pecuniary penalties may also be possible.
"Furthermore, 
customers allegedly affected by the alleged exchange of information 
could claim for damages if indeed a violation of Brazilian antitrust 
law is established."
"Continental AG and individual 
companies of the Continental Group are ancillary parties to these 
proceedings."
"The investigations concern activities of the former 
Powertrain segment that were transferred within the scope of the 
spin-off to Vitesco Technologies Group AG, Regensburg, Germany, 
and its subsidiaries in 2021."
"Both the investigations by the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover 
and the company’s internal investigation into the matters covered 
by these proceedings, which involve considerable costs and effort, 
are ongoing."
"Continental AG and the companies of the Continental 
Group continue to cooperate with the public prosecutor’s office in 
Hanover."
"There is a risk that fines will be imposed as a result of the 
allegations."
"The amount of such fines, which could comprise a levy 
and a penalty component, is currently unknown but collectively 
could be significant."
"Furthermore, the risk of damage to the com-
pany’s reputation cannot be ruled out."
"To cover risks of fines arising from the proceedings conducted by 
the public prosecutor’s office in Hanover, a provision amounting to a 
high eight-figure sum had been set aside as at December 31, 2023."
"This is consistent with the 
agreement between the parties that all opportunities as well as all 
risks arising from the transferred business shall pass to Vitesco 
Technologies Group AG and the companies of Vitesco Technolo-
gies."
"These regulations have not been taken into account in the for-
mation of the provision described above."
"In accordance with IAS 
37.92 and GAS 20.154, no further disclosures will be made with  
regard to the proceedings and the related measures and any po-
tential claims against Vitesco Technologies Group AG so as not to 
adversely affect the company’s interests."
"In view of the scope of these national and international investiga-
tions against automotive manufacturers and suppliers, further pro-
ceedings by public authorities, civil legal proceedings, and claims 
by third parties along with the related financial risks cannot be 
ruled out."
"As part of industry-wide searches, the European Commission be-
gan conducting a search of the premises of Continental AG on Jan-
uary 30, 2024, due to alleged antitrust violations."
"On the same day, 
Germany’s Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt) searched the 
premises of TON Tyres Over Night Trading GmbH, Schondra-
Schildeck, Germany, a subsidiary of Continental, also due to alleged 
industry-wide antitrust violations."
"Both proceedings are at a very 
early stage."
"Continental is therefore unable to reliably predict in any 
way what the outcome of these proceedings will be."
"In the event 
that Continental is responsible for any such violation, the European 
Commission and the Bundeskartellamt could each impose substan-
tial fines."
"Furthermore, customers allegedly affected by the alleged 
exchange of information could claim for damages."
"In this context, 
class action lawsuits have already been filed in the USA and Can-
ada against Continental and other tire manufacturers."
"Continental 
has not yet been served with the lawsuits."

"To the best of our 
knowledge, the underlying obligations will be fulfilled in all cases."
Utilization is not anticipated.
"Risks from taxation and customs constitute potential future burdens 
arising from matters related to income tax, sales tax and customs 
law."
"During the reporting period, Italian tax authorities opened 
criminal tax investigations into three Italian companies of the Conti-
nental Group."
"The investigations relate to a possible failure by the 
units concerned to comply with reporting and declaration require-
ments vis-à-vis the Italian tax authorities."
"Financial charges in the 
form of back taxes, penalties and fines as well as interest payments 
are not implausible."
"Due to the complexity of the facts presented 
by the Italian authorities and the early stage of the investigations,  
it is not possible to reliably estimate the possible financial charges."
"The other financial obligations relate in part to the acquisition of 
companies now owned by the Continental Group."
"The Continental Group could be subject to obligations relating to 
environmental issues under governmental laws and regulations,  
or as a result of various claims and proceedings that are pending  
or that might be made or initiated against it."
"In connection with the carve-out of Vitesco Technologies, individual 
customers of the Vitesco Technologies Group were granted contract 
performance guarantees valid until December 31, 2024."
"To the best 
of our knowledge, the companies concerned will be able to fulfill the 
underlying obligations in all cases."
Utilization is not anticipated.
"Open purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment 
amounted to €676.3 million (PY: €652.4 million)."
"Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per share increased in 2023 to €5.78 (PY: €0.33), 
the same amount as diluted earnings per share."
"In both the period 
under review and the previous year, there were no dilutive effects 
such as interest savings on convertible bonds or warrant-linked 
bonds (after taxes)."
"There were also no dilutive effects from stock 
option plans or the assumed exercise of convertible bonds."
"Events After the End of the Reporting Period 
Continental announced a restructuring measure in the Automotive 
segment after the reporting period."
"This is expected to result in ad-
ditions to personnel restructuring provisions amounting to a low 
nine-figure sum."
"The agreed measure is to be initiated from 2024 
onward and will be carried out gradually until the end of 2025."
"Other than this, there were no significant events after Decem-
ber 31, 2023."
"Other assurance services 
primarily comprise statutory and non-statutory audits as well as 
non-statutory assurance services performed in the context of IT

"These include  
a remuneration component that is unrelated to performance, in-
cluding specific additional benefits and entitlement to a company 
pension, and a variable component that is based on performance, 
consisting of a short-term remuneration component and long-term 
remuneration components."
"In accordance with their future benefit rights, each member of the 
Executive Board is granted post-employment benefits that are paid 
starting at the age of 63, but not before they leave the service of 
Continental AG (hereinafter “insured event”)."
"From January 1, 2014, 
the company pension for the members of the Executive Board was 
changed to a defined contribution commitment."
"A capital compo-
nent is credited to the Executive Board member’s pension account 
each year."
"To determine this, a fixed contribution, agreed by the  
Supervisory Board in the Executive Board member’s service agree-
ment, is multiplied by an age factor that represents an appropriate 
return."
"For members of the Executive Board who were already in of-
fice prior to January 1, 2014, the future benefit rights accrued until 
December 31, 2013, have been converted into a starting compo-
nent in the capital account."
"When the insured event occurs, the 
benefits are paid out as a lump sum, in installments or – as is nor-
mally the case due to the expected amount of the benefits – as a 
pension."
"Post-employment benefits must be adjusted after com-
mencement of such benefit payments by 1% p.a."
"in accordance 
with Section 16 (3) No."
"1 of the German Company Pensions Law 
(Betriebsrentengesetz – BetrAVG)."
"The variable components that are based on performance comprise 
a short-term remuneration component (performance bonus with-
out equity deferral) as well as long-term remuneration components 
(long-term incentive and equity deferral of the performance bonus)."
"The Supervisory Board may take the function and area of responsi-
bility of the individual members of the Executive Board into account 
with regard to the amount of the total target-based remuneration."
"As part of this, shares of the individual remuneration component 
for the total target-based remuneration are indicated below in per-
centage ranges."
"The precise proportions therefore vary depending 
on the functional differentiation as well as a possible change within 
the framework of the yearly remuneration review."
"The fixed annual salary comprises 22% to 28% of the target remu-
neration, the performance bonus (excluding equity deferral) be-
tween 17% and 22%, and the equity deferral and long-term incen-
tive between 33% and 38%."
"Future benefit rights make up between 
17% and 23% of the target remuneration, and additional benefits 
make up approximately 1%."
"For a more detailed description of the remuneration system’s varia-
ble components based on performance as well as the obligations 
due, please see Note 28."
"Provisions for defined benefit obligations of current members of 
the Executive Board amount to €23.0 million (PY: €15.0 million)."

"That total remuneration also in-
cluded, in addition to short-term benefits of €10.2 million (PY: €5.7 
million), a newly granted long-term incentive plan totaling €5.7 mil-
lion (PY: €4.7 million) and the equity deferral of the performance 
bonus of €2.9 million (PY: €0.6 million)."
"The fair value of the 2023 LTI plan as at the grant date, assuming 
full vesting, was €3.8 million (PY: €3.9 million for the 2022 LTI 
plan)."
"Moreover, former members of the Executive Board and their surviv-
ing dependents received payments totaling €9.5 million (PY: €9.4 
million)."
"Provisions for pension obligations for former members of 
the Executive Board and their surviving dependents amounted to

"Remuneration paid to the members of Continental AG’s Supervisory 
Board, including meeting fees, totaled €5.0 million in the past fiscal 
year (PY: €5.0 million)."
