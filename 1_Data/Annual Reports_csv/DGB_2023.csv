"We delivered very good figures and significantly 
exceeded the targets that we set at the beginning of the year."
"And with the 
decisions taken as part of Horizon 2026, the most recent update to our 
strategy, we have created a strong basis from which to develop in the years 
ahead."
"For the market participants that operate in this world, we at Deutsche 
Börse Group are not only a pillar of stability, but also an engine of change."
"Because we create trust in the markets of today and tomorrow, and we enable 
innovation through investment by creating access to capital markets."
"Despite this environment, the price fluctuations on the securities markets 
organised by us were lower last year than they have been for a long time: they 
were down by more than a third on the previous year, as measured by the 
VSTOXX® index."
"In the past, this would necessarily have resulted in lower 
revenues and profits for us, but that is no longer the case today."
"And that is 
not only good news for our workforce, but also – and especially – for you, our 
shareholders."
"We have consistently increased the 
share of our recurring income in recent years, taking it to 63 per cent last year."
"This is an achievement I am proud of, and on behalf of the entire Executive 
Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the employees of 
Deutsche Börse sincerely for their dedication."
"In particular, I would like to express my gratitude for the success we had in 
initiating and completing the biggest transaction in our company’s history by 
taking over the global software business SimCorp last year."
"It contributed 
5 percentage points to our net revenue growth."
"This is almost one third of our 
total growth in net revenue."
"And with an increase of 17 per cent overall in 
2023, this growth was gratifyingly strong."
"The increase was also driven by organic growth with a strong secular – which 
means long-term – component."
Here we reported an increase of 5 per cent.
"This secular growth was particularly marked in energy trading, where we 
gained additional market share and new customers."
"Then there were the 
strong tailwinds from rising interest rates."
"They benefit interest rate derivatives, 
but above all our net interest income."
"A total of 7 percentage points of our 
growth was due to these cyclical influences."
"Since we had our costs under control at the same time, despite higher capital 
expenditure, our pre-tax profits – or EBITDA – rose sharply by 17 per cent, the 
same amount as net revenues."
"We have adjusted the range 
within which we distribute a dividend, which is now set at 30 to 40 per cent 
of profits."
"This leads on seamlessly from our performance in recent years and 
takes the further expected significant profit growth into account."
"And for the 
first time, we are also promising you that the dividend per share will go up 
every year."
"So for 2023, we are proposing a dividend of €3.80 per share."
"This 
is 6 per cent more than in the previous year and represents around 40 per 
cent of our profits."
"Share buybacks are now also part of our capital allocation 
strategy again."
"We already started in early 2024 and will be returning the 
record sum of €1 billion to you this year: €700 million via the dividend and 
€300 million via share buybacks."
"We expect our net revenues to go up to more 
than €5.6 billion."
And our forecast for EBITDA is more than €3.2 billion.
"This 
already includes the possibility of moderate interest rate cuts by central banks."
Further sustainable growth is now on the horizon.
"Our new Horizon 2026 
strategy consists of three elements."
"First: we are banking on strong growth of 
10 per cent per year; of which 7 per cent p.a."
"will come from our existing 
businesses, and our acquisition of SimCorp has already contributed another 
3 per cent p.a."
"Second: we have created a new segment: 
Investment Management Solutions (IMS)."
"This comprises the software and 
analytics business of SimCorp and Axioma, as well as the index, data and 
sustainability business of ISS STOXX."
"IMS is our new strategic cornerstone, 
with great potential for organic growth and strong recurring revenues."
"It 
enables us to address the buy side, i.e."
"institutional investors, as direct 
customers."
"This is a market with above-average, secular growth."
"Third: we 
are expanding our digital platforms for existing and new asset classes."
"The 
partnership with Google Cloud that we also initiated last year plays a crucial 
role here."
"I am certain that with this strategy, Deutsche Börse is well equipped for more 
successful years of strong growth."
We know where we want to go.
"And I 
promise you this on behalf of the entire Executive Board – we will not be 
resting on our past successes."

Report of the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG had three outstanding priorities 
in 2023."
"The first was to provide intensive support for the development of the 
new Group strategy, Horizon 2026."
"Secondly, we were involved at an early 
stage in the full acquisition of SimCorp A/S (SimCorp) by Deutsche Börse AG, 
provided regular advice on the transaction and approved it."
"SimCorp provides 
integrated investment management solutions for the financial industry."
"To-
gether, the merged businesses of SimCorp, Axioma, Inc."
"(Axioma) and ISS 
STOXX form the new Investment Management Solutions segment – a key step 
in the implementation of the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026."
"Thirdly, we 
prepared the CEO succession and other important personnel decisions within 
the Supervisory Board."
"In Stephan Leithner, we have found a convincing suc-
cessor for Theodor Weimer, whose appointment expires at the end of 2024."
"By this time, Mr Weimer will have reached the age of 65."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG dealt in depth and 
regularly with the company’s position, prospects and fundamental strategic op-
tions."
"The Supervisory Board was also involved in an advisory capacity in 
Deutsche Börse Group’s activities to buy and sell companies and parts thereof."
"We performed the tasks assigned to us by law and the company’s Articles of 
Association and bylaws."
"We have advised the Executive Board regularly on its 
management of the company and monitored its work."
"We were involved in all 
decisions of fundamental importance."
"We continued our overarching work on environmental, social and governance 
matters (ESG)."
"In the reporting year, we concentrated on the social aspects of 
ESG."
Our work in 2023 was dominated by a difficult ongoing geopolitical situation.
"Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continued into its third year and 
the attack on Israel by the terrorist organisation Hamas was followed by inten-
sive military operations and armed conflicts."
"This is accompanied by ongoing 
uncertainty about future inflation rates worldwide and slow economic growth, 
particularly in industrialised countries."
"Our global economic and financial sys-
tem therefore remains faced with great challenges."
"At our meetings, the Executive Board provided us with comprehensive and 
timely information in accordance with the legal requirements."
"The high fre-
quency of plenary and committee meetings and workshops ensured an inten-
sive exchange of information between the Supervisory Board and the Executive 
Board."
"In addition, the CEO kept the Chair of the Supervisory Board continu-
ously and regularly informed concerning the current developments affecting 
the company’s business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the 
long-term outlook and discussed these issues with him."
"The Supervisory Board meetings in 2023 were held at the company’s head-
quarters and in Cork, Ireland."
"In the reporting year, we held a total of seven 
plenary meetings, including one extraordinary meeting on the planned takeover 
of SimCorp."
"In another 
workshop we dealt with the subject of artificial intelligence (December)."
"The 
workshops were carried out by internal and external experts."
"This virtual format was chosen particularly for meetings convened at short no-
tice."
"The average attendance rate for all Supervisory Board members at the plenary 
and committee meetings (including those held solely as video or conference 
calls) was 100 per cent during the year under review."
"An average of 24 per 
cent was in the form of virtual attendance."
2) Attending workshops is optional for Supervisory Board members.
"Workshop attendance is therefore not 
taken into account in the determination of the average attendance rate."
"The Executive Board consulted the Supervisory Board 
at an early stage about the development of the new Group strategy, Horizon 
2026."
"This defines the strategic framework for Deutsche Börse Group until 
2026 and also includes an updated climate strategy."
"We advised the Executive 
Board on all relevant aspects of the strategy."
"For details on the Group Horizon 
2026 strategy, please refer to the “Strategy and steering parameters” section in 
the combined management report."
"Another core element of our Supervisory Board work in the reporting year was 
the strategic expansion and reinforcement of our pre-trading business."
"Deutsche Börse AG acquired all the shares in the Danish company SimCorp, 
having successfully completed a public takeover offer."
"SimCorp is an interna-
tional software company that provides integrated front-to-back investment 
management solutions for asset managers and other buy-side businesses."
"The 
business of the newly acquired SimCorp was merged with the data and analyt-
ics business of Axioma."
"The businesses of ISS, Inc."
"A new segment, Investment Management Solutions, was created for 
the SimCorp, Axioma and ISS STOXX businesses in order to reflect the size 
and strategic importance of the pre-trading unit."
"At the Supervisory Board, we 
accompanied these structural changes and the expansion of our business and 
approved the necessary measures."
"Another key focus of our Supervisory Board activities was the careful and  
early preparation of the upcoming change at the head of the Executive Board."
"With Stephan Leithner, we were able to ensure a convincing succession for 
Theodor Weimer."
He will take up office on 1 October 2024.
"Mr Leithner and  
Mr Weimer will each exercise the function of Co-CEO until Mr Weimer’s 
scheduled departure at the end of 2024."
"The Supervisory Board has thus cre-
ated the conditions for an orderly change of leadership at an early stage."
"The Supervisory Board would expressly like to thank Theodor Weimer, who 
took office at the beginning of 2018."
"He initially made a significant contribu-
tion to stabilising Deutsche Börse AG and from then on decisively and actively 
drove forward the strategic development of Deutsche Börse Group."
"Under his 
leadership, Deutsche Börse Group has grown steadily and sustainably and has 
seen extremely positive economic development."
"The Supervisory Board also dealt with its future composition in the reporting 
year."
"Representatives of shareholders and employees will be elected for a pe-
riod of office of three years in 2024."
"Please refer to the “Personnel matters” 
section for details."
"In the field of information technology, we discussed the partnership with a 
well-known global provider of cloud infrastructure and the main projects to de-
velop the digital settlement platform D7 and an exchange for digital assets."
"Ar-
tificial intelligence and other new technologies, and the opportunities they rep-
resent for Deutsche Börse Group, were another key area of our work in this 
field."
"In view of their great importance for the Group and the infrastructure ser-
vices it provides to financial and capital markets, we again discussed the sub-
jects of information security and cyber resilience in depth."
"One overarching focal area of our work was again the discussion of different 
topics relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters."
"We dis-
cussed the updated climate strategy in detail, which is integrated into the new 
Group strategy, Horizon 2026."
"The Supervisory Board also examined in detail 
sustainability regulations and reporting and their implementation at Deutsche 
Börse Group."
"Furthermore, we gained an overview of the future world of work 
in the areas of information technology and financial services, which are im-
portant for us."
"In the context of the financial state-
ments, we adopted the 2022 remuneration report, which was approved by a 
majority of 91.69 per cent of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 
16 May 2023."
"The Supervisory Board also supported the Executive Board’s 
proposal to hold the Annual General Meeting online in the reporting year."
"This 
was based, in particular, on the experience of online Annual General Meetings 
held by Deutsche Börse AG in prior years and the concrete form of the online 
Annual General Meeting as defined in the new legislation governing stock cor-
porations."
"Based on the positive experience of online general meetings to date, 
the amended company’s Articles of Association, which have been approved by 
the 2023 Annual General Meeting, enable a corresponding decision to be 
taken for the Annual General Meetings in the next two years."
"In the reporting year, we again dealt with various legal matters, such as the 
current status of litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream Banking 
S.A."
"in the USA and Luxembourg, and the ongoing investigation by the Public 
Prosecutor’s Office in Cologne regarding the conception and settlement imple-
mentation of securities transactions by market participants over the dividend 
date (cum-ex transactions)."
"Market participants used such transactions to 
make unjustified tax refund claims."
"In this context, the Supervisory Board also 
dealt with investigations into such transactions by the stock exchange regulator 
in the German state of Hesse."
"Other important litigation and legal proceedings concerning Deutsche Börse 
Group were also a key aspect of our work on the Supervisory Board."
"The effi-
ciency, suitability and effectiveness of the internal control system and the han-
dling of findings by internal control functions as well as external auditors and 
regulatory authorities were another important area of our work."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board Chair held meetings with institutional inves-
tors and proxy advisers in November and December 2023 to discuss current 
governance topics affecting the Supervisory Board."
"These meetings focused on 
the Supervisory Board’s work in the reporting year, the outlook for 2024, the 
upcoming personnel decisions for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, 
as well as a proposed increase in Supervisory Board remuneration."
"The Supervisory Board Chair summarised his dialogue with investors in the 
plenary meetings and the meetings of the Nomination Committee."
"Our plenary meetings and workshops during the reporting period focused par-
ticularly on the following issues: 
At our ordinary meeting on 8 February 2023, the Executive Board reported in 
a regular cycle on the status of the cross-divisional client relationship manage-
ment."
"We also discussed the preliminary result for the 2022 financial year and 
the Executive Board’s dividend proposal for 2022."
"After in-depth discussion, 
we set the amount of the variable remuneration for the Executive Board for 
2022."
"We also adopted the 2022 corporate governance statement and ap-
proved the Executive Board’s resolution to hold the 2023 Annual General 
Meeting in a new online format."
"The Executive Board informed us in detail 
about succession planning for the senior management level, the targets set 
and achieved in terms of gender diversity, and the steps taken to build a global 
pool of female talent."
"A status report was also given on the current status of 
the public takeover offer for the Danish software company SimCorp, and the 
further measures to build a new Investment Management Solutions segment 
including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo."
"The Executive Board also informed us 
about the structure of the partnership with a well-known global provider of 
cloud infrastructure."
"We also adopted measures following the effectiveness re-
view in 2022."
"At the ordinary meeting on 9 March 2023, the Executive Board again in-
formed us at length and in detail about the planned voluntary public takeover 
offer for SimCorp and the further measures to build a new Investment Manage-
ment Solutions segment including ISS, STOXX and Qontigo."
"We discussed the financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG for 
2022, the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuner-
ation report in the presence of the auditors."
"We approved the annual and con-
solidated financial statements for 2022 and the 2022 remuneration report, 
having carried our own detailed examination, in line with the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee, which had previously carried out an in-depth prepara-
tory examination of the documents."
"The meeting also gave us the opportunity 
to discuss matters with the auditors without the presence of the Executive 
Board."
"In addition to the Supervisory Board report for 2022, we also adopted 
the agenda for the 2023 Annual General Meeting and elected Barbara Lambert 
as the deputy chair of the meeting."
"The Executive Board in-
formed us of the personnel situation in Deutsche Börse Group."
"A strategy workshop 
 also took place on 9 March 2023, in which the Execu-
tive Board presented the baseline for the new Group strategy, Horizon 2026, 
and explained the strategy process and timetable."
"In an IT workshop on 9 March 2023, we also dealt with the topic of cyberse-
curity and had the current overall threat level explained to us from the per-
spective of the federal government."
"In an extraordinary meeting on 25 April 2023, we approved the announce-
ment of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp and the other transac-
tion steps to create an Investment Management Solutions segment."
"At our ordinary meeting on 16 May 2023, we discussed the upcoming An-
nual General Meeting with the Executive Board."
"The ordinary meeting on 21 June 2023 was held at one of Deutsche Börse 
Group international offices again for the first time since the outbreak of the 
Covid-19 pandemic."
"At the meeting in Cork, Ireland, we examined in detail 
and discussed the Horizon 2026 Group strategy devised by the Executive 
Board."
"The Strategy and Sustainability Committee had previously discussed 
the new Group strategy and the updated climate strategy in detail."
"The Execu-
tive Board also informed us about the status of various legal matters, including 
the current status of the litigation and legal proceedings involving Clearstream 
Banking S.A."
"in the USA and Luxembourg, and a hearing by the Hesse Ex-
change Supervisory Authority on establishing the risk management system for 
the stock market operations of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange."
"We also dis-
cussed the investigations by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Cologne into se-
curity transactions by market participants over the dividend date (cum-ex 
transactions)."
"The Executive Board also notified us of the status of a project to 
optimise internal processes."
"A corporate governance workshop 
 on the subject of sustainability regulations 
was held on 27 September 2023."
"We dealt particularly with the current re-
quirements for sustainability reporting and the implementation of the Supply 
Chain Due Diligence Act at Deutsche Börse Group."
"In another workshop on human resources on 27 September 2023, we ex-
plored how the world of work would look in future and found out about current 
and future developments on the national and global labour market for IT and 
financial services."
"In the ordinary meeting on 28 September 2023, the Executive Board in-
formed us about the result of the voluntary public takeover offer for SimCorp, 
the further steps towards a complete acquisition of the company, its subse-
quent delisting and the planned integration steps."
"The Executive Board also 
explained the status of the transaction steps to create an Investment Manage-
ment Solutions segment."
"We dealt with the effectiveness review to be carried 
out in the reporting year and with the forthcoming Supervisory Board elections 
in 2024."
"Ahead of these elections and the annual suitability review, we re-
viewed and specified the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board 
as scheduled."
"Finally, the Executive Board presented an overarching Group 
programme to address the regulatory findings in the field of information tech-
nology."
"In an IT workshop for the Supervisory Board on 7 December 2023, we dealt 
extensively with the fundamentals, current developments and use cases of arti-
ficial intelligence, in order to provide a basis for the further discussions of this 
topic planned for 2024."
"In the ordinary meeting on 7 December 2023, we adopted the budget for 
2024 and set the Executive Board targets for the 2024 financial year."
"The Ex-
ecutive Board informed us about the results of the annual employee survey, 
the implementation status of the personnel strategy and the revisions that had 
been made to the strategy for 2024."
"We gained an impression of the perfor-
mance of recently acquired companies and equity investments and the invest-
ments made in the context of Deutsche Börse Group’s corporate venturing ac-
tivities."
"We also adopted the declaration of conformity in accordance with sec-
tion 161 Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act) for the 2023 fi-
nancial year, which can be viewed at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor 
Relations > Corporate Governance > Declaration of Conformity."
"Furthermore, 
we resolved to propose an adjustment to Supervisory Board remuneration at 
the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"The Executive Board informed us of the 
current status concerning the Investment Management Solutions segment."
"Martin Jetter, the Supervisory Board Chair, presented the agenda before each 
Supervisory Board meeting and informed the Supervisory Board about current 
matters."
"Theodor Weimer, the CEO, also informed us about the current devel-
opments affecting the company’s business and significant transactions at the 
start of every meeting."
"At the end of each meeting the Supervisory Board 
members talked openly and extensively among themselves, without Executive 
Board members, about the meeting itself and general topics."
"A similar discus-
sion also took place at the Supervisory Board meeting on 8 March 2024 in 
which we approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for 
2023, and which was also attended by the auditors."
"From 2021 onwards, the 
members of the Audit Committee have had regular talks with the external audi-
tors without the Executive Board members."
"The committees are responsible primarily for preparing the decisions to be 
taken by, and topics to be discussed in, the plenary meetings."
"Additionally, the 
Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the 
committees, to the extent that this is legally permissible."
"The individual com-
mittee chairs reported in detail to the plenary meetings on the work performed 
by their committees."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board chairs the Nomination 
Committee, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, the Chairman’s Com-
mittee and the Mediation Committee."
"Details on the members and duties of 
the Supervisory Board committees in 2023 can be found in the “Corporate 
governance statement” section of the combined management report."
"There was no need for the 
Chairman’s Committee to hold a meeting during the year under review."
"Mediation Committee (no meetings during the reporting period) 
 The Mediation Committee is set up by law."
"Pursuant to section 31(3) Mit-
bestG, it submits proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment or 
dismissal of Executive Board members when a two-thirds majority has not 
been reached."
The Mediation Committee only convenes as required.
"There 
was no need for the Mediation Committee to hold a meeting during the year 
under review."
"The con-
densed financial statements and interim management report contained in the 
half-yearly financial report for the first six months of 2023 were reviewed by 
PwC."
"The documents relating to the financial statements and the reports by 
PwC were submitted to us for inspection and examination in good time."
"The 
auditors responsible were Marc Billeb and Michael Rönnberg."
"The auditors at-
tended the relevant meetings of the Audit Committee and the meeting of the 
full Supervisory Board to discuss the financial statements – in all cases, also 
without the Executive Board members, they reported on the key results of their 
audit."
"In particular, they explained the net assets, financial position and result 
of operations of the company and the Group and were available to provide fur-
ther information."
"They had regular exchanges with the Chair of the Supervisory 
Board and the Chair of the Audit as well as the Risk Committee, also outside 
the meetings."
"The audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements 
and the combined management report and non-financial declaration did not 
give rise to any objections."
"There were also no objections raised as a result of the non-
mandatory audit of the form and content of the remuneration report."
"The Su-
pervisory Board discussed the services provided by PwC on a regular basis in 
addition to their statutory auditing services."
"There were no grounds for sus-
pecting that the auditor’s independence might be impaired."
"It 
is satisfied that the reports meet the statutory requirements under sections 317 
and 321 HGB, in particular."
"The committee reported to the Supervisory Board 
on its examination and recommended that it approve the annual financial 
statements and consolidated financial statements."
"Our own examination – during a plenary meeting – of the 2023 annual finan-
cial statements, consolidated financial statements and the integrated combined 
management report did not lead to any objections."
"We therefore approved the 
result of the audit."
"We approved the annual financial statements prepared by 
the Executive Board and the consolidated financial statements at our meeting 
on 8 March 2024, in line with the Audit Committee’s recommendation."
"As a 
result, the annual financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG have been 
adopted."
"The Audit Committee discussed the Executive Board’s proposal for 
the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus (Bilanzgewinn) with the Exec-
utive Board."
"The discussion covered company liquidity, its financial planning 
and shareholders’ interests."
"Following this discussion and its own examina-
tion, the Audit Committee concurred with the Executive Board’s proposal for 
the appropriation of the unappropriated surplus."
"After examining this our-
selves, the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board also approved the Execu-
tive Board’s proposal."
"Personnel matters 
There were no personnel changes in the Supervisory Board during the report-
ing period."
"Michael Rüdiger decided not to stand again for election to the  
Supervisory Board."
"He will therefore leave the board when his term of office 
ends at the close of the Annual General Meeting in 2024."
"The Supervisory 
Board discussed his succession in the reporting year and will propose  
Sigrid Kozmiensky for election by the Annual General Meeting in 2024."
No personnel changes were made with regard to the Executive Board in 2023.
"One Supervisory Board member did not take part in discussions 
or decisions on the subject of cum-ex transactions in order to avoid any poten-
tial conflict of interest."
"The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Board and all em-
ployees for their great commitment and good work in 2023, which remained 
challenging due to the ongoing geopolitical situation and its economic effects."
"Wir danken dem Vorstand sowie allen Mitarbeiterinnen und Mitarbeitern für ihr großes Engagement und 
die gute Arbeit im Jahr 2020, das aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie überaus herausfordernd war."
"Frankfurt am Main, den 5."

it rules on equity issuance and other matters governed by the Aktiengesetz 
(AktG, German Stock Corporation Act)."
"The Supervisory Board appoints, supervises, and advises the members of the 
Executive Board, and is involved directly in decisions of fundamental im-
portance to the Group."
"Additionally, it approves the annual financial state-
ments as well as the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Execu-
tive Board."
"Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a period of 
three years, although the Annual General Meeting may determine a shorter 
term of office when electing members."
"The composition of the Supervisory 
Board is governed by the provisions of the German Co-determination Act (Mit-
bestimmungsgesetz)."
"It is made up of eight shareholder representatives and 
eight employee representatives."
"Further details are provided in the “Corporate 
governance statement”."
"The Executive Board is responsible for the management of the company, 
whereby the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) coordinates the activities of the Ex-
ecutive Board members."
"In the 2023 financial year, the Executive Board of 
Deutsche Börse AG comprised six members."
"The remuneration system and the 
remuneration paid to individual members are explained in more detail in the 
“Remuneration report”."
"Trust is essential for functioning markets and sustainable econo-
mies."
"We provide fair and transparent, reliable and stable infrastructures that 
ensure safe and efficient capital markets around the globe."
"According to the terminology used by the International Integrated Reporting 
Council (IIRC), we essentially need four capitals (input factors) to implement 
our business model."
"We deploy these capitals within a binding regulatory 
framework: intellectual capital, human capital, financial capital and partner-
ships."
They enable us to create value with our business model.
"The impact 
that we have with our business model can be thought of in the following four 
outcome dimensions: 
Economic situation: As a fast-growing company we create financial value, 
substance and returns on which our investors, employees, customers and soci-
ety can build."
"Employees: As an employer, we take wide-ranging measures to enable our 
employees to fully realize their development potential."
"We also work to boost 
the satisfaction of our employees and their loyalty to our Group."
"All this helps 
to build our employer brand, which is the main reason why talented people 
choose us."
"Customers and markets: Our products and services contribute to increase 
transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and inte-
grate market developments, changes and transformations."
"In this way we ena-
ble our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions."
"Social environment: Our value creation also goes far beyond the areas of di-
rect concern to us as a company."
"We thus focus on the environment and hu-
man rights aspects of our supply chain and are involved in initiatives to 
strengthen the local financial industry."
"As 
a fully integrated end-to-end provider we offer our customers a broad value chain with innovative solutions."
The market environment in which we operate is very dynamic.
"This applies 
not only to the markets themselves, which we organise and operate via our 
platforms."
"Our competitive environment as a market infrastructure operator is 
also permanently in flux."
"The provider landscape has consolidated drastically 
in the past decades, which has strengthened the remaining operators of mar-
ket infrastructure and enabled them to extend their business in various direc-
tions."
"New business activities and new customer groups beyond the core busi-
ness have moved to the foreground."
"Today, market infrastructure providers not 
only service the sell-side, like banks and financial service providers, but rather 
have extended and diversified their customer target group."
"We too have continued to expand our market leadership in the European Un-
ion as a fully integrated end-to-end provider in the financial markets."
"By this 
gradual expansion of our business model we are now also able to cater to the 
buy-side as a new customer group."
"Our broad value chain now includes solu-
tions for investment management, trading and clearing through to securities 
services."
"We have achieved this by both organic growth and targeted acquisi-
tions."
"We see ourselves as a hybrid of technology company and financial ser-
vices provider, with a value chain that has a high degree of integration and di-
versification."
"As a result, our business model is characterised by great scalabil-
ity, a low risk profile and low capital intensity, with a high affinity for technol-
ogy at the same time."
"This is not only a unique sales proposition in interna-
tional competition, but also forms the basis for attractive growth opportunities 
and also makes our business model more robust and resilient to market fluctu-
ations or secular shifts."
"All this has enabled us to exceed the financial targets we set ourselves as part 
of our Strategy Compass 2023."
"We achieved the original guidance for 2023 
back in 2022."
"And we revised the 2023 targets upwards several times during 
the course of the year."
"It defines the strategic direction and financial targets for the years 
ahead through to 2026 and thus secures our outstanding market position and 
continued viability."
"The core of Horizon 2026 is the business strategy that we 
have mapped out comprehensively and in detail at a Group and segment level."
"The relevant strategic aspects of human resources, information technology, en-
vironment, social and governance, and particularly climate action, are integral 
parts of our business strategy."
"Further information on these topics can be 
found in the chapter “Non-financial declaration”."
"The relevant financial strat-
egy for our Group is reflected in the adjusted framework for capital allocation."
"It backs up our business strategy and forms the basis for our further corporate 
growth."
"In our strategy we make a fundamental distinction between organic growth, 
generated from existing operations, and inorganic growth by means of focused 
acquisitions to expand or deepen our value chain."
"Organic growth consists 
mainly of secular initiatives such as product innovation, additional market 
share or new customer gains, as well as cyclical growth due to interest rate ef-
fects or higher trading volumes due to market fluctuations."
"Our growth course as defined in Horizon 2026 is built on three strategic pil-
lars."
" Strong o
organic growth: As in the past, organic growth forms the foundation 
for Horizon 2026."
"We benefit from long-term industry trends in attractive 
markets and strive for profitable organic growth of around 7 per cent per year 
on average."
"Secular growth is intended to account for by far the largest share 
of this."
" Investment Management Solutions: With the acquisition of SimCorp we com-
plement our former activities in the area of data and analytics with a holistic 
offering for institutional investors by pooling end-to-end solutions for invest-
ment management and high-quality data in a new segment."
"In addition, we 
expect the acquisition of SimCorp completed in 2023 to deliver an average of 
around 3 per cent inorganic growth per year, and so increase the share of re-
curring revenue."
" Digital leadership: We intend to keep expanding our leading role in the digi-
talisation of assets."
"With D7 we already operate in the Securities Services 
segment one of the leading digital infrastructures globally in the post-trade 
area with more than 7,000 digital issuances."
"Cloud technologies and artifi-
cial intelligence also help us to increase our effectiveness and efficiency, and 
to open up new business areas at the same time."
Deutsche Börse is aiming for overall growth in net revenue of 10 per cent p.a.
The reference year for this is 2022.
"Earnings before in-
terest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) should increase to an av-
erage of 11 per cent p.a."
"Earnings per share before the effects of purchase 
price allocations (cash EPS) should increase over the same period by an aver-
age of 11 per cent a year."
"In addition, targeted acquisitions may 
also contribute to future growth if they are strategically and financially attrac-
tive."
"We capitalize particu-
larly on the expansion in secular growth markets and asset classes."
"At the 
same time we always focus on the needs of our customers and technological 
advances."
"Key initiatives and growth drivers are also described in more detail 
in the “Report on opportunities” section."
"The “Report on expected developments” section describes expected develop-
ments in the 2024 financial year."
"Additionally, the remuneration system for the Executive Board and executive 
staff has also created a number of incentives for growth in the individual busi-
ness divisions."
"The “Remuneration report” provides a detailed description of all 
targets."
"Financial steering parameters 
The most important key performance indicators to manage of our economic sit-
uation are net revenue and EBITDA, since these are vital for the successful ex-
ecution of our growth strategy and set incentives for profitable growth."
"The ba-
sis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements."
"This 
consists of sales revenue, plus net treasury income from banking business and 
similar business, plus other operating income, less volume-related costs."
"One 
of the most important pillars of the corporate strategy, in addition to absolute 
growth, is the profitability of this growth."
"EBITDA stands for earnings before in-
terest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and as such is a gauge of our opera-
tive earning power."
It is a common indicator for measuring profitability.
"An-
other key financial control criterion is earnings per share before purchase price 
allocations (Cash EPS), since all profit and loss effects are reflected in this in-
dicator, and it can therefore be used to measure the successful implementa-
tion of the growth strategy."
We increased our net revenue significantly again in 2023.
We benefited from both organic growth and the acquisition of SimCorp.
"In the following section we look at the macroeconomic and sector-specific en-
vironment, the course of business, our earnings, the development of profitabil-
ity and other financial performance indicators."
"Macroeconomic and sector-specific environment  
Secular growth factors and M&A are a core element of our strategy."
"We can 
plan them, manage them and adjust them to external circumstances."
"Our busi-
ness performance is also influenced by macroeconomic and sector-specific 
factors that are beyond our direct control, however."
"It expects the euro area to grow by 0.5 per cent (2022: +3.5 per cent) 
and for the economy in Germany to even contract by 0.3 per cent (2022: 
+1.8 per cent)."
"Business developments  
The 2023 financial year was dominated by the activities of central banks to 
combat high inflation rates."
"Inflation declined over the course of the year in 
both the USA and Europe, but rates were still too high, making a looser mone-
tary policy impossible."
"The ECB raised its deposit rate in several stages, most recently to 4.00 per 
cent in September, while the Federal Reserve increased its target range for the 
federal funds rate to 5.25-5.50 per cent in July and has left it at this level 
since."
"Both central banks said that any change in their restrictive monetary 
policies depended on the future development of key economic indicators."
"Higher interest rates mean on the one hand that we profit from higher net in-
terest income in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments."
"At the 
same time there were phases in which higher interest rates increased market 
participants’ hedging requirements and led to greater trading activity in fixed 
income products in the Trading & Clearing business."
"Central banks’ withdrawal 
from the money market also caused higher demand for repo products."
"This was the result of lower and more 
stable power prices, which reduced the margin requirements."
"Volatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, was significantly 
lower than the previous year."
"Higher trading volumes were only seen briefly in 
March following the insolvency of several US banks and the consolidation on 
the Swiss banking market."
"The VSTOXX stood at an average of 18 points, 
which was 35 per cent lower than the average for the previous year."
"Trading 
activity in securities and equity index derivatives in the Trading & Clearing unit 
was correspondingly lower."
"Results of operations 
Against this backdrop, the results of operations in financial year 2023 were af-
fected significantly by both secular and cyclical growth factors."
"Higher interest rates and a downwards trend in the money supply had a posi-
tive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo products in the fi-
nancial derivatives business within the Trading & Clearing segment."
"In this 
context the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared over-
the-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives had a 
positive influence on net revenue."
"In addition, lower margin requirements as a 
result of reduced volatility on power and gas markets, and new customer 
gains, increased trading volumes for power derivatives in the commodities 
business in the Trading & Clearing segment, which was in turn reflected in 
higher net revenue."
"The Investment Management Solutions segment profited 
from both continuous product demand in Governance Solutions, Corporate So-
lutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the Analytics 
business."
"The acquisition of SimCorp, which was fully consolidated into the 
Group in the fourth quarter, also made a decisive contribution to M&A growth 
in this segment."
"In contrast to the previous year, which saw a positive one-off 
effect of €63 million in total in net revenue, there were no significant non-re-
curring effects on the revenue side in the reporting year."
"Our net revenue therefore increased to €5,076.6 million in the financial year 
2023 (2022: €4,337.6 million)."
"The net revenue increase of 17 per cent con-
sisted partly of 5 per cent secular growth, which came largely from new cus-
tomer gains and gains in market share, the expansion of customer relation-
ships and product innovations."
"Cyclical growth effects accounted for a further 
7 per cent."
The global increase in interest rates deserves particular mention.
"Another 5 per cent comes from M&A growth in connection with the acquisition 
of SimCorp."
"Operating costs rose by 16 per cent to €–2,118.3 million in financial year 
2023 (2022: €–1,822.2 million)."
"Around 5 per cent resulted from organic 
cost growth, which also includes an increase in the headcount compared with 
the previous year, inflation effects and investments in secular growth 
measures."
"10 per cent of the increase is due to the SimCorp acquisition effect, 
related transaction costs of €22 million and the costs of realising potential syn-
ergies in the new Investment Management Solutions segment of €56 million."
"The 
result from financial investments, which is included in EBITDA, came to  
€–14.0 million (2022: €10.2 million)."
"In the course of the purchase of minor-
ity interests in ISS and the bundling of expertise in our Investment Manage-
ment Solutions segment, one-off adjustments to the valuation of a contingent 
purchase price component resulted in losses of €9 million."
"The decline was 
also due to valuation effects from minority interests."
"Amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses came to €418.4 million 
(2022: €355.6 million)."
"The change stems mainly from purchase price alloca-
tions for the acquisition of SimCorp in the Investment Management Solutions 
segment, as well as a €25 million write-down on intangible assets at Crypto 
Finance AG in the Trading & Clearing segment."
"Our Group’s financial result of €–74.1 million (2022: €–63.5 million) was 
mainly determined by the issue of new corporate bonds with medium and long 
maturities, and short-term debt instruments for a total volume of €4 billion to 
finance the acquisition of SimCorp."
"The Group’s tax ratio of around 27 per 
cent was slightly higher than the previous year."
"Overall, the net profit for financial year 2023 attributable to Deutsche Börse 
Group shareholders was €1,724.0 million (2022: €1,494.4 million), which 
represents a year-on-year increase of 15 per cent."
"Undiluted earnings per 
share were €9.35 (2022: €8.14) for an average of 185.1 million shares."
"Earnings per share before purchase price allocations (cash EPS) stood at 
€9.98 (2022: €8.61)."
"Net profit for the period attributable to non-controlling interests amounted to 
€72.8 million (2022: €68.8 million) and comprised mainly earnings attributa-
ble to non-controlling shareholders of EEX and ISS STOXX."
"Comparison of results of operations with the forecast for 2023 
For financial year 2023 we originally forecast an increase in net revenue to 
within a range of €4.5-4.7 billion."
"We increased this forecast several times 
over the course of the financial year, and at the time the results of the third 
quarter were published we were predicting net revenue, now including 
SimCorp, of around €5.0 billion."
"In line with our strategy we also anticipated 
an increase in secular net revenue growth of at least 5 per cent."
"Given the very 
good cyclical performance in financial year 2022, which was characterised by 
much higher market volatility and a global rise in interest rates, we assumed 
that the cyclical net revenue contribution in 2023 would be lower, or even 
negative."
"However, as inflation rates increased significantly in both the USA 
and Europe, the central banks moved to intervene quickly, resulting in another 
significant interest rate hike."
"Net interest income from the banking business 
rose accordingly in the Securities Services and Fund Services segments to a to-
tal of €702.4 million (2022: €260.0 million)."
"In addition, the acquisition of 
SimCorp, which was not included in the original forecast for 2023, contributed 
another €198.0 million to the Group’s net revenue."
"With net revenue of 
€5,076.6 million we therefore significantly exceeded our original forecast."
"Net 
revenue growth of 17 per cent includes 5 per cent secular growth."
"This means 
we also delivered on our forecast for secular net revenue growth."
"Over the course of the financial year this forecast was also raised, to around 
€2.9 billion."
"Our operating costs were mainly affected by the acquisition of 
SimCorp and went up by 16 per cent."
"They include both transaction expenses 
and the costs to achieve potential synergies in the new Investment Manage-
ment Solutions segment totalling €79 million."
"Despite this, EBITDA rose by 17 
per cent to €2,944.3 million and so was at the upper end of our forecast."
"As ex-
pected, our ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 2.19 at year-end was just below the 
new maximum figure of 2.25 for rating purposes, due to the acquisition of 
SimCorp."
"The ratio of free funds from operations to net debt of 36 per cent 
was slightly below the now minimum target of 40 per cent, as expected, 
which was also due to temporarily higher borrowing for the SimCorp transac-
tion."
The cash flow from operating activities was again significantly positive.
"Based on a dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting of €3.80 per 
share, the distribution quota of 40 per cent is within the range of 30 to 40 per 
cent communicated as part of our redeveloped capital management."
"The divi-
dend of €3.60 proposed the previous year was paid as planned in May."
"The 
cash flow from operating activities was significantly positive."
"Investment in in-
tangible assets and property, plant and equipment of €264.0 million was not 
completely in line with the budget of €300 million."
"Development of profitability 
Deutsche Börse Group’s return on shareholders’ equity expresses the ratio of 
net income after taxes to average equity available to the Group during the 
course of 2023."
"In the reporting year, it was at 19.5 per cent (2022: 18.8 per 
cent)."

n.a."
"It is divided into the Software Solu-
tions and the ESG & Index units."
"In the Software Solutions unit we report on the activities of SimCorp, which 
now also includes the analytics business of Axioma."
"SimCorp is a renowned 
provider of investment management software and offers a market-leading front-
to-back investment management platform."
"As a Software-as-a-Service-(SaaS) 
and Business-Process-as-a-Service-(BPaaS) player for global asset owners, as-
set managers and asset servicers, our open platform provides both flexibility 
and operating efficiency for our customers in all asset classes."
"In today’s fast-
moving markets the top priority is also a comprehensive and agile approach to 
portfolio and risk management."
"For this reason we have bundled the portfolio 
construction and risk management solutions from Axioma (Analytics) with our 
investment management platform."
"By combining our strengths we can make 
more effective use of our respective assets and resources and offer our custom-
ers even more added value."
"Net revenue in this unit is made up of licensing, 
update and service revenue for on-premise and SaaS solutions, as well as rev-
enue from the analytics business."
"Revenue from professional services activities 
is recognised under Other."
"In the ESG & Index unit we report on both the ESG and Index business gener-
ated by our ISS STOXX subsidiary."
"Under the umbrella of ISS STOXX are the 
STOXX Index business (also comprising STOXX® and DAX® indices) as well as 
the four existing business units of ISS: ISS Governance, ISS ESG, ISS Corpo-
rate Solutions and ISS Market Intelligence."
"The combination of robust and di-
verse ESG and governance datasets from ISS with the all-round expertise of 
STOXX in producing benchmarks and customer-specific indices, as well as in 
index production and settlement, enables ISS STOXX to operate effectively on a 
global basis."
"Net revenue in this business is made up of ETF, exchange and 
other licence revenue."
"While ETF licence revenue depends on the volume in-
vested in exchange-traded index funds (ETFs) based on STOXX® and DAX®, 
exchange licence revenue are derived mainly from the volume traded in index 
derivatives on STOXX and DAX indices on Eurex."
"By licensing sustainable in-
dex solutions that mirror the entire index product portfolio, we contribute to the 
ESG trend."
"Net revenue at ISS is made up of ESG revenue, which comprises 
corporate and governance solutions, ESG data, research and ESG ratings."
"Mar-
ket intelligence activities are presented under Other."
"In the financial year the Software Solutions unit of the segment profited partic-
ularly from higher net revenue thanks to new customer gains and contract re-
newals by existing customers, which are mainly linked to the timing of trans-
actions."
"This relates both to the performance in the existing analytics business 
and to that of SimCorp."
"Net revenue from SimCorp was consolidated for the 
first time in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was somewhat above our original 
expectations due to a higher number of new contracts for software solutions."
"The ESG & Index unit saw sustained a stable for ESG products, which institu-
tional investors and banks use to develop sustainable investment strategies 
and for ESG reporting."
"The corporate solutions offered by ISS for companies 
also continued to experience interest."
"Compared with the previous year, the 
exchange rate effects of a weaker US dollar on average had a slightly negative 
impact on net revenue."
"In the Index business, lower trading activity in equity index derivatives on our 
derivatives exchange Eurex had an impact on Index net revenue."
"It declined 
year on year by 10 per cent."
"By contrast, the trend towards exchange-traded 
index funds and correspondingly higher investment volumes support business 
with ETF licences."
It increased by 5 per cent compared with the previous year.
Net revenue in the Index unit was therefore slightly up on the previous year.
"However, Index net revenue the previous year included a one-off, volume-
based licence fee reimbursement of €19 million from the Trading & Clearing 
segment."
"In the financial deriv-
atives asset class, we report on the performance in the financial derivatives 
trading and clearing business at Eurex exchange."
"Performance is driven mainly 
by the trading activities of institutional investors and other professional market 
participants and depends, to a large extent, on our clients’ hedging needs and 
market volatility."
"Revenue is also generated from marketing data and manag-
ing collateral."
"The EEX Group operates 
marketplaces and clearing houses for energy and commodity products, con-
necting more than 800 participants around the world."
"The product portfolio 
comprises contracts on power, environmental, freight and agricultural prod-
ucts."
"The EEX Group’s most important revenue drivers are the power spot and 
derivatives markets, and the gas markets."
"These include products such as 
green power derivatives, emissions trading and certificates of origin."
"The cash equities asset class shows the development of our trading venues in 
the cash market (Xetra® and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange)."
"Besides trading 
and clearing services income, revenue stems from the ongoing listing of com-
panies’ securities and exchange admissions, the marketing of trading data, in-
frastructure services and from services provided to partner exchanges."
"The segment also includes the foreign exchange asset class, which reports on 
business performance on the trading platforms operated by our subsidiary 
360T."
"Net revenue is generated mainly by the trading activities of institutional 
investors, banks and internationally active companies."
"Uncertainty among market participants declined noticeably year on year in 
2023, which was reflected in lower volatility on equities and commodities 
markets."
"Market volatility on stock markets, as measured by the VSTOXX, fell 
by 35 per cent."
"Hedging requirements fell as a result, and so trading activities 
in equity index derivatives were down by 9 per cent in the Financial deriva-
tives unit."
"It was offset by an increase of 6 per cent in trading with interest 
rate derivatives due to higher interest rates."
"Changes in the interest rate envi-
ronment also had a positive impact on the outstanding notional volume of 
over-the-counter (OTC) and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives in cen-
tral clearing, which were up year on year by 19 per cent."
"Combined with the 
central banks’ more restrictive monetary policy, repo transactions in the Finan-
cial derivatives, Other unit in particular saw strong demand from market par-
ticipants and contributed €86 million to net revenue (2022: €51 million)."
"The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting uncertainty concerning the 
security of European gas and broader energy supplies dominated the financial 
year 2022, but the gas and power markets were calmer in the reporting pe-
riod."
"Prices of the respective reference products for power and gas in the C
Com-
modities unit therefore fell significantly from their record highs in 2022."
"This 
reduced the margin required for trading in derivatives substantially, which had 
a distinctly positive effect on the futures markets."
"The trading volume in power 
derivatives climbed year on year by 38 per cent and in gas derivatives by 18 
per cent."
"The unit also profited from new customer gains, which stemmed 
partly from the fact that centrally cleared offerings are highly competitive com-
pared with the OTC market."
"Commodities, Other, reported a higher net reve-
nue contribution from collateral management fees resulting from the significant 
increase in interest rates in both Europe and the USA."
"As with our European competitors, in addition to a decline in market volatility, 
the high interest rate environment also weighed on equity trading in C
Cash eq-
uities."
"It was only towards the end of the year that key indices like the DAX 
picked up sharply, reaching all-time highs in some cases."
"This was only partly 
able to offset a general decline in the order book volume of 31 per cent, how-
ever."
"Xetra’s market share as the reference market for trading in DAX shares 
was again over 60 per cent, as in the previous year."
"In Foreign exchange we increased the average daily trading volume on our 
platform by 6 per cent in the reporting year, despite lower volatility in the 
EUR/USD exchange rate."
"Net revenue in this unit performed correspondingly 
well."
"Clients can settle and manage 
their entire fund portfolio across all asset classes on the Vestima® fund pro-
cessing platform."
"The fund distribution business consists of the distribution 
platform at Clearstream Fund Centre."
"Fund Services therefore offers one of the 
leading fund services platforms in the European market for distribution part-
ners, banks, asset managers and fund providers."
"Net revenue in this segment 
is largely a function of the volume and value of assets under custody and the 
number of orders and settlements processed."
"In addition, Other net revenue in 
the Fund Services segment includes the net interest income from the fund set-
tlement business and net revenue from fund data management, which largely 
stems from the acquisition of Kneip S.A."
The financial year 2023 was challenging for the European fund industry.
"On 
the one hand, fund prices profited from higher European equities indices than 
in the previous year."
"On the other hand, higher interest rates resulted in out-
flows from actively managed funds."
"On balance, the value of assets under cus-
tody was roughly the same as the previous year."
"The market environment also 
had a slightly negative impact on the number of securities settled."
"Net revenue 
from fund settlement was therefore only slightly up on the previous year."
"The fund distribution business was also faced with the same market trends de-
scribed above in the financial year."
"New customer wins and the transfer of 
new customer portfolios could not fully make up for a slight decline in average 
fund distribution assets."
"Net revenue in this unit fell slightly year on year as a 
result."
In April 2023 we announced that Clearstream Fund Centre S.A.
"had received 
its own banking licence in Luxembourg and so was independent in the market, 
but will remain closely linked with Clearstream’s national and international 
central depositories (CSD, ICSD) in order to exploit synergies between the units 
for the benefit of our customers."
"Due to the increased independence of our 
fund services business from the securities business, the relevant portion of the 
net interest income from banking business of €57 million was reclassified 
from Securities Services to Fund Services (Other)."
"At the same time, the sepa-
ration resulted in a transfer of net revenue of €16 million from Fund Services 
to Securities Services (Custody, Settlement and Other)."
"Other net revenue also includes the fund data business of Kneip, which was 
consolidated in the second quarter 2022."
"Our settlement and custody activities are reported under the Securities Services 
segment."
"In providing the post-trade infrastructure for Eurobonds and other se-
curities markets, our subsidiary Clearstream is responsible for the issuance, 
settlement, management, and custody of securities from 60 domestic markets 
worldwide, plus the international market."
"Net revenue in this segment is 
driven mainly by the volume and value of assets under custody, which deter-
mine the custody fees."
"The settlement business depends primarily on the 
number of settlement transactions processed by Clearstream via stock ex-
changes as well as over-the-counter (OTC)."
"The segment also includes net in-
terest income from banking business, which represents a significant portion of 
the segment’s net revenue due to the steep rise in global interest rates."
"Net revenue in the Securities Services segment was affected most in 2023 by 
the monetary policy measures taken by central banks around the world in re-
sponse to higher inflation."
"Net interest income from banking business, which 
in the Securities Services segment stems from cash deposits by our clients, 
profited significantly from higher base rates in both the USA and Europe."
"The 
volume of cash balances fell by 6 per cent, by contrast, which indicates more 
active liquidity management by our customers."
"Since the first quarter of 2023 
around €90 million of the net interest income from banking business has been 
segregated as assets under sanctions held by us, of which €14 million relates 
to prior periods."
This is therefore not shown in net revenue.
"When the fund 
business was spun out of Clearstream, the relevant portion of net interest in-
come from banking business and other effects were reclassified from Securities 
Services to Fund Services (Other), as described in the Fund Services segment."
"Ongoing high issuance by companies and the public sector, as well as the 
general increase in share prices as a result of buoyant markets, led to growth 
of 6 per cent in assets under custody in 2023."
"The principal contribution 
came from the year-on-year change in the volumes of debt instruments held by 
our national and international central securities depositories (CSD, ICSD)."
These also rose by 6 per cent on average.
"The custody unit also reports on col-
lateral management and the securities lending business."
"A more restrictive 
monetary policy and higher interest rates caused a significant increase of 14 
per cent in outstanding volume compared with the previous year."
"The securi-
ties settlement business also saw solid growth of 6 per cent in the financial 
year."
"The key driver in this area was an increase in the settlement of OTC se-
curities."
"Net revenue the previous year included a disposal gain of some €50 million 
from the sale of our stake in the European transaction register REGIS-TR."
"This 
was recognised in Other net revenue."
"its liquidity, com-
prise cash and bank balances – to the extent that these do not result from rein-
vesting current liabilities from cash deposits by market participants – as well 
as receivables and liabilities from banking business with an original maturity of 
three months or less."
"Change in other cash and bank balances was affected by 
cash used for acquisitions, as well as cash outflows from operating activities."
"Cash flow from operating activities was €2,482.5 million (2022: 
€2,141.6 million) before changes in CCP positions on the reporting date and 
was made up primarily of net income for the period of €1,796.8 million 
(2022: €1,563.2 million) and from changes in working capital."
"Cash outflows for investing activities amounted to €3,997.2 million in 2023 
(2022: €1,406.5 million) and were largely driven by the acquisition of 
SimCorp and fluctuations between short and long-term investments of cus-
tomer funds."
"The acquisition of SimCorp led to a cash outflow of €3,887.3 
million."
"Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment of €264.0 million (2022: €323.5 million) was slightly below the 
planning framework of around €300 million and related primarily to IT and 
growth investments."
"Cash flow for 2023, which is the sum of all inflows and outflows of cash from 
operating, investing and financing activities, came to €845.2 million (2022: 
€126.0 million) and was dominated by cash flow from operating activities."
"The positive cash flow from operating activities, sufficient credit lines and our 
flexible management and planning system meant that we were again ade-
quately supplied with liquidity in 2023."
"For further details of cash flow, see the consolidated cash flow statement and 
note 21 to the consolidated financial statements."
"Our aim is to hold sufficient liquidity to be able 
to meet all our payment obligations as they fall due."
"We have an intra-Group 
cash pool to aggregate our surplus cash as far as regulatory and legal provi-
sions allow."
"Generally speaking, we invest cash on a short-term basis, in order 
to ensure rapid availability, and it is largely secured by liquid bonds from 
prime-rated issuers."
"Moreover, we have access to external sources of financ-
ing, such as bilateral and syndicated credit lines, as well as a commercial pa-
per programme (see note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for de-
tails of financial risk management)."
"In recent years, we have leveraged our ac-
cess to the capital markets to issue corporate bonds in order to meet our struc-
tural financing needs."
"We are aim-
ing to maintain our strong rating at Group level, which was changed to AA- af-
ter the SimCorp takeover."
"Furthermore, we endeavour to maintain the strong 
AA credit ratings of our subsidiaries Clearstream Banking S.A."
"and Clearstream 
Banking AG, in order to ensure their long-term success in securities settlement 
and custody."
"The activities of our Eurex Clearing AG subsidiary also require 
strong credit quality."
" To determine EBITDA for rating purposes, reported EBITDA is adjusted by 
the result from financial investments, as well as by unfunded pension obliga-
tions."
"EBITDA for rating purposes in 2023 was €2,970 million."
" FFO for rating purposes is calculated by deducting interest and tax payments 
from EBITDA for rating purposes."
"FFO for rating purposes in 2023 was 
€2,307 million."
" The Group’s net debt for rating purposes is reconciled by first deducting 
50 per cent of the hybrid bond, as well as the surplus cash as at the report-
ing date, from gross debt (i.e."
from interest-bearing liabilities).
"Liabilities 
from operating leases and unfunded pension obligations are then added."
"Net 
debt for rating purposes in 2023 was €6,493 million."
" Interest expenses for rating purposes are calculated on the basis of interest 
expenses for financing, less interest expenses of Group entities which are 
also financial institutions."
"These include Clearstream Banking S.A., Clear-
stream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG."
"Interest expenses which are not 
related to our financing are not included in the calculation of interest ex-
penses."
"Only 50 per cent of the hybrid bonds are counted towards interest 
expenses."
"Interest expenses for rating purposes in 2023 came to €86 mil-
lion."
"The following table “Relevant parameters” illustrates our calculation methodol-
ogy and shows the values for the reporting year."

As expected, the acquisition of SimCorp in September 2023 meant that the 
target for FFO in relation to net debt was undershot slightly."
"Since we generate 
significant cash flow from our operating business, we expect to reduce debt 
quickly and achieve the ratings targets in 2024."
"to fall below €1,100 million."
"achieved this during the year under review, with a figure of €1,648 million."
"S&P Global Ratings bases the calculation of key performance indicators on the 
corresponding weighted average of the reported or expected results of the pre-
vious, the current and the following reporting period."
"To ensure the transpar-
ency of the key performance indicators, we report them based on the current 
reporting period."
"Dividends and share buy-backs 
We aim to distribute dividends equivalent to between 30 and 40 per cent of 
net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders."
"Within 
this range, we manage the actual payout ratio mainly in relation to our busi-
ness performance and based on continuity considerations."
"In addition, we plan 
to invest the remaining available funds primarily in our external development."
"Should the Group not be able to invest these funds, additional distributions, 
particularly in the form of share buy-backs, would be another possible use for 
them."
"At the Annual General Meeting we will be proposing to pay a dividend of 
€3.80 per no-par value share for the financial year 2023 (2022: €3.60)."
"This 
dividend is equivalent to a distribution ratio of 40 per cent of net profit for the 
period attributable our shareholders."
"Given 185.1 million no-par shares bear-
ing dividend rights, this would result in a total dividend payment of 
€703.4 million (2022: €661.6 million)."
"The number of shares with dividend 
rights is produced by deducting 4.9 million treasury shares from our ordinary 
share capital of 190.0 million shares."
"In November 2023 we announced a share buy-back programme for 2024 on 
the basis of the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 8 
May 2019."
"Company shares are to be bought back for a total cost of up to 
€300.0 million (without incidental expenses) in the period to 3 May 2024."

Our credit quality is reviewed regularly by S&P Global Ratings, while Clear-

"is rated by Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings, and 
Clearstream Banking AG by S&P Global Ratings."
"On 21 December 2023, Fitch Ratings affirmed the AA credit rating of Clear-
stream Banking S.A."
"The rating reflects Clearstream 
Banking’s leading position in the post-trade business, its diligent liquidity 
management as well as its impeccable capitalisation."
"After the transaction and the related additional borrowing 
were completed on 20 September 2023 it then downgraded the credit rating 
from AA to AA-, also as expected."
"This did not affect the credit ratings for 
Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A."
"S&P Global Ratings 
confirmed its AA- credit rating for Deutsche Börse AG and its AA credit rating 
for Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s rating reflects the assumption that the Group will 
continue its growth strategy."
"Clearstream Banking S.A.’s rating reflects its 
strong risk management, minimal debt levels and strong position on the inter-
national capital markets – especially through its international custody and 
transaction business."
"Net assets 
Significant changes to net assets are described below."
"The full consolidated 
statement of financial position can be found in the consolidated financial state-
ments."
"The in-
crease in non-current assets resulted mainly from the SimCorp acquisition, 
which is reflected in higher intangible assets, and from exchange rate-related 
fluctuations in goodwill."
"The decline in current assets was particularly due to 
the volatility of restricted bank balances and financial instruments of the cen-
tral counterparties at the reporting date."
Group equity rose by 11 per cent compared with the previous year.
"This was 
due mainly to the net profit for the reporting year 2023, less the dividend pay-
ment for the previous financial year 2022."
"Deutsche Börse Group invested a total of €264.0 million in the reporting year 
(2022: €323.5 million) in intangible assets and property plant and equipment 
(capital expenditure, CapEx), mainly in connection with IT and growth invest-
ments."
"Working capital 
Working capital comprises current assets less current liabilities, excluding 
technical closing-date items."
"Current assets, excluding technical closing-date 
items, amounted to €2,298.9 million (2022: €2,588.6 million)."
"As Deutsche 
Börse Group collects fees for most of its services on a monthly basis, the trade 
receivables of €1,832.2 million included in current assets as at 31 December 
2023 were relatively low compared with net revenue (31 December 2022: 
€2,289.2 million)."
"The decline in trade receivables was particularly due to 
open items as at the reporting date from the market volatility of the sports mar-
kets within EEX Group, which were offset by a decline in trade payables at the 
same time."
"The current liabilities of the Group, excluding technical closing-
date items, amounted to €2,312.6 million (2022: €2,763.3 million, exclud-
ing technical closing-date items)."
"For this reason the Group had slightly nega-
tive working capital of €13.8 million at year-end (2022: negative working cap-
ital of €174.7 million)."
"Technical closing-date items 
The “financial instruments of the central counterparties” item relates to the 
function performed by Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG 
as well as Nodal Clear, LLC."
"Since they act as the central counterparties for 
Deutsche Börse Group’s various markets, their financial instruments are car-
ried in the balance sheet at their fair value."
"The financial instruments of the 
central counterparties are described in detail in the section “Risk report” of the 
combined management report and in notes 12 and 24 to the consolidated fi-
nancial statements."
"Market participants linked to the Group’s clearing houses partly provide collat-
eral in the form of cash deposits, which are subject to daily adjustments."
"The 
cash deposits are generally invested on a secured basis overnight by the cen-
tral counterparties and reported in the balance sheet under “restricted bank 
balances”."
"The total value of cash deposits at the reporting dates relevant for 
the reporting period (31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December) 
varied between €46.8 billion and €58.9 billion (2022: €53.4 billion and 
€119.5 billion)."
"The resulting rapid interest rate rises boosted market participants’ need for 
hedging with interest rate derivatives, but also had a significantly positive ef-
fect on growth in net interest income from banking business in the Securities 
Services and Fund Services segments."
"Fears of recession and uncertainty con-
cerning the future direction of interest rates subdued share trading and also led 
to outflows from fund assets under management."
"It was only as inflation rates 
began to recede sustainably and with the prospect of an end to further interest 
rate increases that equity indices picked up again strongly in the fourth quarter 
of 2023."
"Compared with the record highs in 2022, price volatility and the re-
lated volumes of capital committed to power and gas markets declined signifi-
cantly."
"Trading activity rose accordingly, particularly in power derivatives."
"With 
net revenue of €5,076.6 million, we achieved year-on-year growth of 17 per 
cent for the Group, which was above our expectations."
"Of the total, 5 per cent 
is due to secular growth and 7 per cent to cyclical growth effects."
"The acquisi-
tion of SimCorp, which was consolidated in the Group for the first time in the 
fourth quarter of the financial year, contributed another 5 per cent from M&A 
growth."
"The increase in costs was also mostly related to the acquisition of 
SimCorp, and included extraordinary transaction expenses and the costs of re-
alising potential synergies (costs to achieve) in the new Investment Manage-
ment Solutions segment totalling €79 million."
"Earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased year on year by 17 per cent 
to €2,944.3 million, which was slightly higher than our expectations in view 
of the effects mentioned above."
"Additional borrowing to finance the acquisition 
also affected the financial result, which changed accordingly to €74.0 million."
"On this basis we consider that Deutsche Börse Group’s financial position re-
mained very solid during the reporting period."
"As in prior years we reported 
strong cash flow from operating activities."
"The ratio of net debt to EBITDA, 
which is important for the credit rating, came to 2.19 and was thus below the 
now applicable limit of 2.25."
"As in recent years, we are again offering shareholders a higher dividend for the 
2023 financial year."
"The proposed dividend is €3.80 (2022: €3.60), repre-
senting a year-on-year increase of 6 per cent."
"We also decided in 2023 to 
carry out a share buyback programme with a volume of €300 million, which 
began on 2 January 2024 and should be completed by 3 May 2024 at the 
latest."
"The proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit reflects treasury 
shares held directly or indirectly by the company that do not carry dividend 
rights under section 71b Aktiengesetz (AktG, the German Stock Corporation 
Act)."
"The number of shares carrying dividend rights can change until the An-
nual General Meeting through the repurchase or sale of further treasury shares."
"In this case, with a dividend of €3.80 per eligible share, an amended resolu-
tion for the appropriation of distributable profit will be proposed to the Annual 
General Meeting."
3) The ratios for the years 2019–2020 have been adjusted.
The dividend payout ratio is determined using reported net profit.
4) Amount based on the proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2024.
"We report on the core aspects of our value creation process on the basis of our comprehensive mate-
riality analysis."
"For the mandatory disclosure on our business 
model and the involvement of company management we refer to the chapters 
“Deutsche Börse: Fundamental information about the Group” and “Strategy 
and steering parameters”."
"In terms of the materiality analysis, description of management approaches 
and selected KPI the combined non-financial declaration follows the GRI 
(2021) standards."
"A detailed overview of all GRI indicators (GRI index) is 
available on our homepage."
"Further detailed information that is referenced in 
this report does not form part of the combined management report itself unless 
explicitly stated."
"To the extent that no explicit statements are made for the par-
ent company, qualitative information within the meaning of the combined 
management report applies equally to Deutsche Börse Group and the parent 
company Deutsche Börse AG."
"In some cases, quantitative details concerning 
the parent entity and subsidiaries consolidated for the first time are disclosed 
separately."
"In the course of our materiality analysis we continuously determine and evalu-
ate the expectations and requirements of relevant internal and external 
stakeholders."
"In the year 2023 we surveyed several internal stakeholders in 
order to validate the results from 2021."
This did not give rise to any changes.
"ESG governance 
Sustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche 
Börse Group."
"It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at 
the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"The Executive 
Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustaina-
bility matters at Deutsche Börse Group."
"It was supported in the reporting year 
by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the 
CFO."
"The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sus-
tainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group."
"It deals with company initiatives 
relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG)."
"This includes 
advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate plan-
ning and controlling."
"The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the 
Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024."
"The Group Sustainabil-
ity Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and 
supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability."
"The 
Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of 
effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines."
"Responsibility for ESG reporting was transferred 
from Group ESG Strategy to the section Sustainability Reporting, which is part 
of the CFO function, on 1 October 2023."
"At the Supervisory Board level, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee has 
dealt, in particular, with sustainable corporate governance and activities in the 
field of ESG at Deutsche Börse Group since 2021."
"In addition to embedding 
ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly im-
portant for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board commit-
tees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination 
Committee."
"Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the train-
ing programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt 
with in workshops and seminars."
"The second indicator 
is used to calculate the percentage of women in leadership positions on an an-
nual basis."
"In terms of employee satisfaction, we have defined a result of more than 71.5 
per cent approval in the annual People Survey as the target."
"With regard to the 
proportion of women in management positions, the Executive Board has set it-
self the target of achieving a proportion of over 23 per cent in upper manage-
ment at global Group level by the end of 2023 as part of a voluntary commit-
ment (see “Employees”)."
"Customers and markets: As a provider of market infrastructure we maintain 
impartial, transparent and secure marketplaces."
"In this context we use our sys-
tems availability as a key performance indicator."
"A value of more than 99.5 
per cent is the target for our systems availability (see section “System stability 
and availability”)."
(see section “ESG ratings”).
"Deutsche Börse Group updated its climate strategy and the relevant ESG tar-
gets in the financial year 2023 as part of the further development of its strat-
egy “Horizon 2026” (see “Social environment“)."
"For this reason, the non- 
financial performance indicators described the previous year, ESG net revenue 
growth and CO2 emissions per workspace, are no longer considered by the  
Executive Board as relevant for management as of financial year 2023."
"For other sustainability indicators that are not explicit ESG targets as defined in 
our Horizon 2026 growth strategy, such as our emissions of greenhouse gases 
and ESG products, we also refer to our GRI Index on our homepage."
The ESG risks are integrated into our Group-wide risk management approach.
(see chapter “Risk report”).
"Employees 
The commitment and skills of our employees are a vital cornerstone for 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"Together with our core corporate values of perfor-
mance, reliability, integrity, openness and responsibility they define our corpo-
rate culture."
At the same time they form the basis of our commercial success.
"For this reason we have an active People strategy, promote diversity, equity 
and inclusion, and systematically measure how attractive we are as an em-
ployer."
"People strategy  
Working in its four strategic dimensions (Attract, Develop, Engage, Lead), our 
People strategy aims to attract the best talents, to develop them, to enable 
them to engage effectively and to continue their personal and professional de-
velopment."
"These four dimensions form the foundation for four multi-year initi-
atives."
"With these initiatives we want to create a flexible, sustainable working 
environment that offers our employees excellent working conditions."
"We successfully put our hybrid working model into practice in the framework 
of Trust@Work."
"With this hybrid working model that spans teams and projects 
we create the conditions for effective cooperation and focus particularly on im-
portant moments at work, mental health and well-being."
"This process is 
backed up by DigitizeHR, an initiative to fully digitise our operating HR pro-
cesses and provide actionable analytics."
"is our initiative for im-
proving development opportunities for our employees."
"We have revised our ca-
reer model to increase transparency, offer equality of opportunity and create a 
culture of continuous feedback."
"The initiatives were 
launched in 2020 for a period of three years."
"Most of the milestones have 
been reached, and the remaining topics were transferred to the line organisa-
tion as part of continuous improvement."
"In this spirit, we are continuously working on the implementation of 
our talent attraction strategy by considering the market situation and adjust it 
accordingly."
"Our strategy conveys the message that with us new talents be-
come part of an international team that drives positive change and is charac-
terised by curiosity and an open mind."
"We welcome people from all different 
origins, age groups and personal backgrounds, and want to give them the op-
portunity to grow with us."
"We achieve this via a number of employee develop-
ment programmes."
"Internal training courses – on cloud technology, digital in-
frastructure and agile development methods, for example – are the logical con-
tinuation of these programmes and form the basis for structured retraining and 
further training."
"They are supplemented by mentoring programmes and per-
sonality-related training courses; on communication, taking responsibility or 
becoming a team player, for instance."
We expanded our existing range of development programmes in 2023.
"In par-
ticular we introduced activities for a structured programme intended to in-
crease mobility between countries, locations and legal entities."
"events for managers that were launched the previous 
year, which focus on refreshing competences and on expectations of modern 
managers."
"Taken as a whole, these formats strengthen our people develop-
ment offering."
"Further information about participation by employees and managers in training 
and development measures can be found in the table “Key data on Deutsche 
Börse Group’s workforce as of 31 December 2023”."
"In our annual staff survey, the People Survey, which also deals with subjects 
such as pervading strategy and teamwork, we got very satisfying marks for our 
attractiveness as an employer (82 per cent approval)."
"The largely positive 
feedback underlines how Deutsche Börse Group stands for a working environ-
ment which makes it easy for staff to reconcile their career and their private 
life, with flexible models for working hours, allowances for childcare, part-time 
degree courses and part-time work."
"We also measure the average value of the 
two topics Strategic Alignment & Organisational Framework and Team Effec-
tiveness & Collaboration annually."
"Our goal is to achieve an average value of 
more than 71.5 per cent in both topics."
"In 2023 we achieved a value of 73.0 
per cent (without SimCorp)."
"The following graph “Results of our annual People 
Survey 2023” shows what employees think about the subjects of understand-
ing strategy and teamwork."
"At our 56 locations around 
the world we have over 14,000 employees from the most diverse cultural 
backgrounds."
"Our diversity is not only apparent in the origins of our employ-
ees, however, but also in the breadth of professional expertise and the many 
other differences that make up each individual personality in our team."
We are convinced that this diversity is decisive for our global success.
"We see 
the wealth of individual characteristics and strengths as the key to fulfilling our 
corporate purpose."
"For this reason, we strive to create an inclusive working en-
vironment in which everyone feels welcome and where they feel comfortable 
about contributing their ideas."
"We are a signatory of the “Diversity Charter” and “Women’s Empowerment 
Principles (WEPs)” and acknowledge our corporate social responsibility as ex-
pressed in the Code of Conduct that applies throughout the Group."
"A public 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion statement, in which we express our appreciation 
of all present and future employees and a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion policy 
constitute further elements of our diverse and inclusive working environment."
"We were also certified as a Fair Pay Analyst in 2023 for our successful en-
deavours to pay our staff regardless of their gender."
"We do not tolerate any discrimination, whether on the grounds of age, gender, 
physical or health disability, sexual orientation and identity, ethnic origin or 
belief and irrespective of whether behaviour among employees or the placing 
of orders with third parties is concerned."
"We have therefore implemented pro-
cesses designed to take equal treatment into consideration in the selection of 
staff and enable the Group to take prompt action whenever discrimination is 
suspected."
"Relevant cases were reported in 2023 either by our whistleblower 
system, to the respective Line Management or directly to the local Human Re-
sources Department."
"Furthermore, we deliberately decided against the centralised management of 
our diversity, equity and inclusion programmes."
"The members of our Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion council represent our global workforce and our different mi-
norities; they inform and advise the Executive Board on initiatives and act as 
trusted third parties and personal contacts for the employees."
"The council 
strives to ensure that our everyday workspace continues to be a place where 
everyone feels appreciated and gets the opportunities they deserve."
"We also in-
troduced the function of Chief Sustainability and Chief Diversity Officer in our 
Group in 2023, who is responsible for our diversity, equity and inclusion en-
deavours."
"The responsibilities of this dual role complement one another and 
underline the priority that we at Deutsche Börse Group give to all dimensions 
of environmental, social and governance policy."
"It remains a particular aspira-
tion for us to increase the proportion of women at the management level."
"Our 
various programmes for promoting talent, and so also for qualifying women for 
management positions, contribute to the long-term advancement of women."
"In 
addition to our programmes, other measures include focused succession plan-
ning, as well as internal and external mentoring and training programmes."
"Ex-
changes among female colleagues are encouraged by an internal women’s net-
work."
"We provided special support for applicants and our employees directly 
and indirectly affected by the military conflict in Ukraine."
"We are also commit-
ted to providing better opportunities for underprivileged people through dedi-
cated programmes."
"For details regarding targets for female quotas, please refer 
to the section entitled “Corporate governance statement – target figures for the 
proportion of female executives beneath the Executive Board” and the “Com-
parison with the forecast for 2023”."
"This positive feedback reaffirms our intention to keep expanding our 
programme for diversity, equity and inclusion, in the spirit of creating a fully 
inclusive working environment."
"Staff developments 
As at 31 December 2023, Deutsche Börse Group employed a total of 14,502 
staff (women: 5,836; men: 8,643; other: 23; 31 December 2022: 11,078), 
drawn from 131 nationalities at 56 locations worldwide."
"The average number 
of employees in the reporting period was 12,187 (2022: 10,675)."
"At Group 
level, this corresponds to an increase of around 14.2 per cent compared with 
the previous year."
Our fluctuation rate was 10.9 per cent (31 December 2022: 14.8 per cent).
"At the end of the year under review, the average length of service for the com-
pany was 6.7 years (2022: 6.8 years)."
"The number of Deutsche Börse AG’s employees rose by 885 during the year 
under review to 2,657 as at 31 December 2023 (comprising 980 women and 
1,677 men; 31 December 2022: 1,772)."
"The average number of employees 
at Deutsche Börse AG in the 2023 financial year was 2,219 (2022: 1,752)."

"gender), headcounts of subcategories do not always add up to the total."
"Our products and services contribute to increase 
transparency for market participants and to enable them to price in and inte-
grate market developments, changes and transformations."
"In this way, we en-
able our customers and market participants to make better-informed decisions."
"System stability and availability  
The availability of our customer-facing trading systems is an important indica-
tor of the overall quality that we achieve when developing and operating our 
systems."
"Deutsche Börse AG operates its trading systems for the cash and de-
rivatives markets as redundant server installations, distributed across two geo-
graphically separated, secure data centres."
"Should a trading system fail, it 
would be operated from the second data centre."
"Together with clients, 
Deutsche Börse successfully simulated this scenario again in 2023 – as well 
as the impact of local disruptions – within the scope of the FIA Test (the an-
nual disaster recovery exercise conducted by the Futures Industry Association)."
"This kind of disaster recovery test was also carried out after every larger soft-
ware release."
"Other disruptions, such as technology malfunctions at individual 
workstations or personnel failures, were also tested."
"Our multiple testing of software, its verified roll-out and the seamless monitor-
ing of servers, networks and applications has brought availability up to over 
99.9 per cent in the reporting year."
"The plan is to introduce further technical 
measures to gain greater independence from providers of critical infrastructure 
technologies."
"Information security 
Security in all its facets has a high priority and is a strong focus of our Group."
"This does not just involve ensuring the availability of all services, but also the 
confidentiality of all information and the integrity of data."
"The range of threats 
increased again in 2023, not least due to geopolitical challenges and addi-
tional conflicts."
"Deutsche Börse Group is faced with the reality that cyber 
threats continuously adopt the latest technologies and so develop at high 
speed, and we adapt our systems and processes accordingly."
"Global regulation 
also continues to develop in order to meet the challenges."
"Deutsche Börse 
Group uses an extensive framework of policies and processes, supplemented 
by specific controls and technical abilities based on the international security 
standard ISO/IEC 27001."
"Deutsche Börse Group invests continuously in new security solutions, pro-
cesses and projects, in order to address effectively the growing number of 
threats with state-of-the-art security technologies."
"Security measures are im-
plemented at several levels (defence-in-depth), to reduce the risk of security 
incidents from individual error sources."
"To strengthen abilities to defend and 
protect against cyber-attacks, regular improvements are made to cyber-analy-
sis, cyber-security automation, identification and prevention of attacks, vulner-
ability management, penetration testing and professional “white hat” attacks 
on the Group’s own IT."
"A key building block is the networking and recon-
naissance of attack vectors in order to counter them without delay."
"Furthermore, we are a 
member of the ECB’s Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European financial 
infrastructures (ECRB) and are in close contact with the DAX40 CERT/CISO 
working group and the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)."
"The information security function checks that the information security and in-
formation security risk management requirements are adhered to; it also moni-
tors the systemic integration of, and compliance with, security policies in the 
context of product and application development."
"We operate a situation centre 
(Cyber Emergency Response Team, CERT) to detect and assess threats from 
cybercrime at an early stage, and coordinate risk mitigation measures in coop-
eration with the business units."
"The security of Deutsche Börse Group is also 
defined via its ecosystem of suppliers and outsourcing partners, which are in-
tegrated into the security concept."
"These partners are also benchmarked 
against Group requirements and integrated into the risk assessment."
"The effectiveness of physical security is also permanently reviewed, with simi-
lar assessments and measures."
"A new security system was implemented in the 
offices at the individual locations around the world in 2023."
"For a description of the risks in connection with information security we refer 
to the section in the chapter “Risk report”."
"For an 
overview of our ESG products, we refer to the GRI index."
"Compliance  
Responsible business operations imply adherence to laws and regulations; 
they are also based on the principle of integrity and ethically irreproachable 
conduct at all times."
"We have implemented a compliance management system 
(CMS), which aims to prevent misconduct and avoid liability and reputational 
risks for the Deutsche Börse Group, its legal representatives, executives and 
staff."
"Beyond business-related and regulatory compliance requirements, the fo-
cus is on continuously strengthening compliance awareness throughout the 
Group."
"It is communicated to all employees in the Group and is available on the inter-
net and intranet sites."
"Our code of business conduct summarises our core val-
ues and principles, which are intended to act as support for decision-making 
and enforce market integrity, transparency, efficiency and security."
"As a mem-
ber of the AG Global Compact, Deutsche Börse AG is also committed to its 
principles, notably to support human and labour rights, to protect the environ-
ment and to work against corruption in all its forms, which includes extortion 
and bribery."
"Objectivity and integrity are the guiding principles for employees of Deutsche 
Börse Group."
"Our management is fully aware of their function as role models 
and the importance of the “tone from the top”, which makes it possible to 
draw the attention of every individual employee towards managing compliance 
risks, both within the Group and among market participants."
"In order to sus-
tainably anchor these guiding principles, and to prevent the Group and its staff 
from legal sanctions and reputational damage, Group Compliance has imple-
mented risk-based compliance and preventive measures."
"Compliance management system 
An effective compliance management system (CMS) constitutes an indispensa-
ble element of good corporate governance."
"The Group Compliance function 
manages the CMS as a second line of defence function and ensures compli-
ance with legislation, regulations and internal rules, and promotes best prac-
tice within the Group."
"In addition, the Group Compliance function monitors, 
controls and implements risk-based measures to mitigate risks with negative 
impacts (e.g."
"direct or indirect financial losses, regulatory penalties or reputa-
tional damage)."
"The appropriateness and effectiveness of the CMS are evaluated at least once 
a year on the basis of the individual CMS elements."
"The results are then pre-
sented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The CMS elements particularly comprise: 
 Compliance risk analyses – Identified and assessed risks provide the basis 
for determining the scope and focus of compliance activities and the man-
agement of the compliance risk profile."
" Policies – Compliance requirements that are regularly updated in accordance 
with applicable legislation, regulations and defined compliance targets."
" Controls – Regular and ad hoc controls are carried out to detect any compli-
ance deficits."
" Training – Creation of a compliance mindset and appreciation by means of 
compliance training."
 Reporting – Regular and ad hoc reporting to the relevant stakeholders.
" Internal & external audits – Independent and objective review of the CMS in 
terms of its suitability and effectiveness, and identification of improvement 
potential."
" Ongoing development of the CMS – Projects and internal initiatives for the 
continuous development of the CMS."
"When determining the focus and improvements of the CMS, we are 
guided by applicable prudential legislation and regulatory requirements, as 
well as by the recommendations of internationally accepted standards."
"Based 
on these standards, Group Compliance identifies fields of action and measures 
to continuously adapt the CMS to changing requirements."
"Compliance organisational structure 
The Group Chief Compliance Officer reports directly to the Executive Board of 
Deutsche Börse AG."
"Compliance reporting comprises the relevant compliance 
risks in the context of the compliance mandate, as well as other compliance-
relevant information and activities."
"The Group Compliance Committee is an interdisciplinary committee at man-
agement level that aims to support and advise the respective Executive Boards 
and Compliance functions within Deutsche Börse Group on compliance topics."
"Committee members are the senior managers of the business units, the Chief 
Compliance Officers and representatives of the relevant control functions for 
the Group as a whole."
"In the context of the current geopolitical events and the resulting potential eco-
nomic and political consequences, Deutsche Börse continues to analyse which 
risks could have an impact in the individual business areas and which 
measures need to be taken and implemented."
"Data protection/protection of personal data 
Data protection serves to protect the personal data of individuals."
"It aims to 
protect the privacy of employees and customers, but also of third parties, such 
as service providers."
"To guarantee data protection, personal data may only be 
processed on the basis of a corresponding justification and in compliance with 
the principles of data protection."
"We again took steps to comply with data protection legislation in 2023, partic-
ularly in terms of appropriate and transparent processing of personal data, and 
continuously developed our processes."
"The Executive Board appointed a data 
protection officer years ago and established the Group data protection function, 
which helps to ensure compliance with the data protection framework, itself 
based on the EU General Data Protection Regulation."
"It also drives the sus-
tained development of a data protection culture in Deutsche Börse Group, 
which takes current commercial requirements and legislative changes into ac-
count by means of training courses and awareness activities."
"The Group data protection function assumes the role of data protection officer 
for Group companies, insofar as this is required by law and it has been given 
the mandate as a central function."
"In this regard, the data protection function 
in-forms and advises the individual legal entities on data protection require-
ments."
"The data protection function also serves as a contact for data protection 
authorities, and supports the business units in their assessments of the data 
protection risks."
"The data protection function’s framework, as a second line of defence, is in-
corporated into the structure of our compliance safeguards."
"The data protection 
officers inform the respective Executive Boards annually and in an event- 
related manner on the status of data protection within the company and the 
measures to expand the data protection framework."
"The training 
was revised in 2023, which is why the number of participants is significantly higher than in 2022."
2) The information is based on the employees that are connected to the central HR system.
"Group companies 
that are not connected to the HR system carry out compliance training on their own responsibility and not via 
the Group function."
"Social environment 
Our value creation also goes far beyond the areas of direct concern to us as a 
company."
"Accordingly, for example, the environment, human rights issues in 
the supply chain or participation in financial centre initiatives fall within our 
focus."
"Environment 
We endeavour to contribute to the Paris Climate Agreement with our business 
activities."
"In 2023, we have adapted our climate targets in line with current 
market standards towards a long-term climate strategy."
"To achieve our targets, we will develop a transition plan 
in 2024, which will contain dedicated emission reduction measures."
"We provide our stakeholders with transparent information about our environ-
mental performance in our annual GRI Index."
"Last year we also published a 
progress report on the basis of the TCFD recommendations."
"This report sum-
marises the information about how we deal with climate risks and opportuni-
ties and our science-based targets."
"Further information can be found on our 
homepage."
"At the 
same time, we permanently and systematically seek dialogue with our internal 
and external stakeholders and thus determine the focus topics of our work."
"To 
do so we use investor days, employee and customer surveys, discussions with 
rating agencies and society at large, involvement in various initiatives and our 
regular materiality analysis, in which we ask our stakeholders about our com-
pany and our impact on society and the economy."
"Regarding the initiatives 
that we support, we refer to our homepage."
"ESG ratings 
We use this external validation of our own ESG efforts through ESG ratings to 
continuously improve and sharpen our ESG profile."
"Insights from the ESG rat-
ing processes were also factored into our materiality analysis."
"We have therefore published a Deutsche Börse Group Statement on Hu-
man Rights."
"It relates to Deutsche Börse AG and its subsidiaries and covers 
our relationships with employees, suppliers and customers."
"For this purpose, 
Deutsche Börse AG and centrally-serviced Group companies require their sup-
pliers to comply with ethical standards of conduct in their dealings with em-
ployees, suppliers, customer and other third parties."
"This takes place in ac-
cordance with our Code of conduct for suppliers, the Code of business conduct 
and the policy statement on the human rights strategy of Deutsche Börse AG 
in accordance with section 6 (2) Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG)."
"Principles for determining the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible  
environmentally sustainable economic activities  
Turnover 
The Taxonomy-eligible turnover is divided by the Group’s total turnover to de-
termine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible turnover."
"The denominator is 
based on sales in accordance with IAS 1.82(a) as presented in the consoli-
dated statement of comprehensive income."
"For further details, please refer to 
note 4, table “Composition of our net revenues” (Part 1-2)”), column “Net rev-
enues 2023”)."
"For financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible turnover 
within the scope of application of the delegated acts."
"Capital and operating expenditure 
The proportion of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure (CapEx) is determined 
by dividing the Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure by total additions to in-
tangible and tangible assets."
"For further details, see note 10, table “Intangible 
assets” and note 11, table “Property, plant and equipment (incl."
"right-of-use 
assets)”, lines “Additions”."
"Likewise, to determine the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible operating expendi-
ture (OpEx), the Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure is divided by the 
Group’s total operating expenditure."
"For further details, see note 6, table 
“Composition of other operating expenses”."
"For financial year 2023 we have not identified any Taxonomy-eligible capital 
or operating expenditure within the scope of application of the delegated acts."
"Energy production from nuclear energy and fossil gas 
For financial year 2023 we have not identified any economic activities at 
Deutsche Börse Group involving energy production from nuclear energy and 
fossil gas."

"Risk profile Deutsche Börse Group 
Overview of the risk profile and material changes compared 
with the previous year 
DBAG is the Group parent company and thus the parent of all the companies 
that form part of Deutsche Börse Group."
"In key aspects its risk profile therefore 
represents risks at the level of its subsidiaries, which include providers of 
strictly regulated financial market infrastructure."
"Risk at Deutsche Börse Group 
is expressed in terms of required economic capital (REC), which is calculated 
on the basis of assumptions."
"Required economic capital as at 31 December 
2023 amounted to €1,619 million (2022: €1,754 million)."
"It is covered by a 
risk-bearing capacity, derived from shareholders’ equity, of €8,898 million 
(2022: €7,742 million)."
"The risks of Deutsche Börse Group are therefore cov-
ered by its risk-bearing capacity."
"Looking at the Group companies it can be 
said that DBG has a conservative risk profile and that it monitors and limits 
risks closely."
"The required economic capital is made up of operational risks, financial risks 
(including credit and market risks), business risks and pension risks."
"The fol-
lowing chart shows the specific breakdown of risks as at 31 December 2023:  
 
 
There have been no material changes in the DBG risk profile compared to the 
previous year."
"The reduction of the required economic capital is partly due to a 
revision of scenarios at Clearstream Securities Services (€-81 million) and for 
non-banks."
"Including Crypto Finance in full caused credit risk to increase by 
€27 million and market price risk by €10 million."
"Methodological changes re-
sulted in an increase of €57 million in the pension risk."
"Regulatory classification 
Within Deutsche Börse Group it is mainly the subsidiaries of Deutsche Börse 
AG (DBAG) that are subject to strict regulatory requirements."
"DBAG itself is not 
a bank and has not been classified as a financial holding company by the 
Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, so it is not itself subject to su-
pervision as a bank."
"DBAG aligns its risk management with the standards for 
companies, and parts of the standards for banks are applied if they are appro-
priate."
"In view of their economic importance we particularly discuss the banks 
in our Group, namely Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, 
Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"Further details are also 
provided for European Commodity Clearing AG as a central counterparty (CCP) 
according to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)."
"Material developments compared with the previous year 
Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., a separate legal entity, was established at the 
beginning of 2023 for the fund business of Clearstream Banking S.A."
"and 
Clearstream Banking AG."
This is a subsidiary of DBAG.
"Business activities in 
the fund business are reported in the Fund Services segment."
"Clearstream 
Fund Centre S.A."
is a bank and must meet CRR requirements in this respect.
"It is also regulated under MiFID, and one of its main purposes is to support 
customers to meet their regulatory fund requirements in accordance with  
MiFID."
"DBAG acquired 100 per cent of the shares in SimCorp A/S in late October after 
a public takeover offer."
"The risks related to the acquisition of SimCorp have 
been examined and as at 31 December 2023 it was found that it does not 
materially change the overall risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group."
"The current 
integration of Axioma with SimCorp entails an increased operational risk in 
connection with the successful completion of the integration project."
Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A.
"have to meet com-
bined capital requirements (Complementary Approach Ratio) as from April 
2023."
"These result from the capital requirements of the Central Securities De-
positories Regulation (CSDR) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR, 
for details see “Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios”)."
"remained affected in 2023 by Russia’s large-scale 
invasion of Ukraine, which required a considerable amount of management at-
tention."
"Developments continue to be monitored closely in order to analyse the 
various impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war."
"The main focus was on adapting 
processes and controls to the countermeasures that Russia has taken in re-
sponse to western sanctions."
"started to reduce its 
customer relations to Russian state actors massively following the first invasion 
of Ukraine in 2014."
"Notes on material changes in substantial litigations as well as tax risks are de-
scribed in more detail in note 25 “Financial liabilities and other risks” in the 
consolidated financial statements and are an integral part of this combined 
management report."
"Relevant regulations  
Our banks follow international standards and comply with the minimum capi-
tal requirements set by the CRR."
"Our banks Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream 
Fund Centre S.A."
"and Eurex Clearing AG calculate their regulatory capital re-
quirements in line with the applicable CRR, which conforms to the first pillar 
of the Basel Standard for Bank Supervision."
"Eurex Clearing AG and European 
Commodity Clearing AG meet the CRR requirements and also the capital re-
quirements of European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR)."
"Clearstream 
companies must also comply with the Minimum Requirements for Own Funds 
and Eligible Liabilities (MREL)."
"The central securities depositories Clearstream 
Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A."
"are also subject to the Central Se-
curities Depository Regulation (CSDR)."
"For details see the section “Regulatory 
capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios”."
"Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG are authorised as 
central coun-terparties (CCPs) and are subject to the requirements of EMIR 
and the Recovery and Resolution of Central Counterparties (CCP RR) regime."
"By contrast, recovery and resolution plans for the Clearstream companies and 
Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"are ensured by their compliance with the EU 
Banking Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD)."
"Other subsidiaries have different licences to provide services in the financial 
industry, which means they too are governed by extensive statutory require-
ments, including for risk management."
"Clearstream Banking AG maintains a 
central register within the meaning of the Electronic Securities Act (eWPG), for 
example."
"Eurex Repo GmbH and 360 Treasury Systems AG are also subject to 
specific provisions applicable to investment firms."
"Nodal Clear, LLC is a Deriv-
atives Clearing Organisation (DCO) subject to regulation by the US Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)."
"Both are subject to supervision by the Swiss  
Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA)."
"Our recently acquired subsid-
iary SimCorp is basically a non-regulated company."
"It was subject to the Dan-
ish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) only because it was listed on the 
stock exchange."
"It was delisted from Nasdaq Copenhagen on 30 October 
2023 following the takeover by Deutsche Börse AG."
"For further details, see the section “Regula-
tory capital requirements and regulatory capital ratios”."
"The Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) and Bundesbank

stream Holding AG."
"The CSSF and Banque Centrale du Luxembourg (BCL) su-
pervise Clearstream Banking S.A."
and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A.
"The pub-
lic exchanges are the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB) and Eurex Deutsch-
land (futures exchange) (ED)."
"Deutsche Börse AG is responsible for the opera-
tion of the Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (Frankfurt Stock Exchange)."
"Eurex 
Deutschland is operated by Eurex Frankfurt AG."
"The exchanges are supervised 
by the Hesse Exchange Supervisory Authority."

sory Authority is responsible for operating and legal supervision."
"It is part of

"Goals and principles of risk management 
Deutsche Börse Group strives for a leading role in all our business areas."
"We pro-
vide the infrastructure for dependable and secure capital markets and are in-
volved constructively in its regulation."
"We align our risk management approach 
with our business model and our corporate strategy."
"Our risk management approach is based on the following principles: risk limita-
tion, implementation of the business strategy in line with the risk appetite, and a 
reasonable relationship between risk and return."
In the course of growth by the business segments (e.g.
"organic growth, M&A 
activities, extension of the leading position in digital platforms for existing and 
new asset classes), risk management supports implementation of the strategy 
in line with the risk appetite by identifying risks, communicating clearly, limit-
ing risks and monitoring."
"The aim is make well-founded strategic decisions 
within the boundaries of the defined risk appetite."
"Embedded cross-cutting 
risks such as ESG risks are also considered."
We aim to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return.
"Internal 
risk management is based on the Group-wide detection and management of 
risk, see the chart “Interlocking business strategy and risk management strat-
egy”."
"For the banks that are the focus of the following comments – particularly in-
cluding Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A."
"Clearstream Bank-
ing AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"and Eurex Clearing AG – and the securi-
ties firms - in the Group, this is supplemented by the normative perspective, 
which is discussed in more detail in the section “Regulatory capital require-
ments and regulatory capital ratios (normative perspective)”."
"The value at risk 
(VaR) model is the main tool for quantifying risks."
"The purpose of the VaR 
model is to determine the amount of economic capital – given a confidence in-
terval of 99.9 per cent defined ex ante – required to cover very unlikely but 
possible losses incurred within twelve months."
"Moreover, we carry out stress 
tests in order to simulate extreme, yet plausible, events and their impact upon 
the Group’s risk-bearing capacity."
"Complementary risk metrics have been es-
tablished as an additional approach to risk monitoring, which serve as an early 
warning system for in-house risks."
"These risk metrics are based on operational 
risks (including IT and security risks, potential losses), credit, liquidity and 
business risks, as well as the indicators defined for recovery plans."
"Stress tests are carried out in order to simulate separately and in aggregate ex-
treme but plausible events for all material types of risk."
"They simulate the oc-
currence of extreme losses or the accumulation of large losses within a single 
year."
"Both hypothetical and historical scenarios are used and calculated for the 
banks and securities firms in the Group."
"Reverse stress tests are also carried 
out."
"They calculate which loss scenarios or liquidity squeezes would have to 
materialise for the risk-bearing capacity to be exceeded from a capital or li-
quidity perspective."
"Additional adverse scenarios are simulated for the relevant 
supervisory perspective (normative perspective) by the banks and securities 
firms."
The recovery plans for the banks include additional recovery stress tests.
"Risk monitoring 
We use quantitative and qualitative approaches and methods for risk monitor-
ing, with the objective of providing as complete a picture as possible of our 
risk situation."
"To this end, the Group continuously reviews internal events with 
regard to their risk properties, whilst also considering regional as well as global 
developments."
"We are thus able to recognise and analyse existing risks; at the 
same time, it is able to swiftly and adequately respond to emerging risks, as 
well as to changes in the market or in the business environment."
"Risk metrics are used to quantify the most important internal risks against set 
limits."
"These supplement the risk quantification from the economic perspective 
and serve to monitor management indicators other than the capital require-
ment, and non-quantifiable risks."
"Any under- or overshoot of the defined limits 
serves as an early warning signal, which is reported to the Executive Board on 
a monthly basis."
"Furthermore, any such breach immediately triggers the nec-
essary analysis and risk mitigation processes."
"Our risk management approach also includes a sustainable, long-term compo-
nent."
"In addition to the current existing risks, additional risks are also consid-
ered over a horizon of twelve months."
"For this purpose, we have developed so-
called risk maps tailored specifically for expected or upcoming regulatory re-
quirements and IT and information security risks."
"In addition, other opera-
tional, business and financial risks are also assessed beyond a twelve-month 
period."
"The risk maps categorise risks according to their probability of occur-
rence, and their potential financial impact, and show how the results relate to 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects."
"Economic and normative perspective 
The economic perspective assesses risk positions arising from business opera-
tions."
The normative perspective includes inputs from regulatory models.
"The 
economic perspective is used to derive the minimum required economic capi-
tal (REC), so that our risk-bearing capacity based on the statistical model ap-
plied is not exhausted more than once in 1,000 years."
"From a normative perspective, regulatory capital requirements are the relevant 
management metrics."
"This means that risk management aims to meet the reg-
ulatory capital requirements for the banks and regulated securities companies 
in the Group."
"The economic and normative perspectives are used for risk man-
agement."
"The aim is therefore not only to meet the regulatory capital require-
ments, but also to ensure financial stability by means of the additional eco-
nomic approach."
"The risk management function measures the amount of economic capital regu-
larly and compares this with the risk-bearing capacity to produce a manage-
ment indicator."
The regulated entities also use the normative perspective.
"The 
economic capital for the banks includes Clearstream Banking S.A., Clear-
stream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
The intention is to include SimCorp completely in 2024.
"The ratio of required risk capital to risk-bearing capacity remained below the 
defined maximum throughout the reporting period."
"Operational risks 
Most of the risks in the Deutsche Börse Group are operational in nature."
"Oper-
ational risks comprise the unavailability of systems, service deficiency, damage 
to physical assets as well as legal offences and business practices (see the 
chart below: “Operational risk at Deutsche Börse Group”)."
"Operational risks are 
measured using scenarios."
Existing risks have been classified.
"ESG risks have been analysed 
and quantified in this context as far as possible."
"In the course of this analysis 
the effects of ES-G risks were classified as immaterial and no new risks were 
identified."
We measure the availability of the systems as an important risk indicator.
"As 
an international exchange operator and innovative provider of market infra-
structure, state-of-the-art IT is of the utmost importance for the Group to en-
sure that it can deliver its services smoothly and continuously."
"Special IT risk 
indicators for system availability have been defined in accordance with a de-
fined risk appetite, to monitor the uptime and performance of the main IT sys-
tems in all units and business segments and to ensure that they remain within 
the defined parameters."
"Yellow and red limits are defined for this purpose, to 
enable the timely and transparent escalation and reporting of breaches to sen-
ior management."
"Since availability risk is the biggest operational risk for the 
Group, it is the subject of regular testing."
"This simulates the impact of a failure 
of our own systems or those of suppliers."
"Risks can also arise if a service provided to a customer is inadequate and 
leads to complaints or legal disputes."
"For example, errors in the settlement of 
securities transactions due to product or process deficiencies or faulty manual 
input."
The related processes are tested at least annually.
"Other sources of er-
rors may lie with suppliers or defective products."
"We register complaints and 
formal objections as a key indicator of deficient processing risk."
"Busi-
ness continuity processes are intended to avert significant financial losses."
Losses can also result from ongoing legal proceedings.
"These can occur if 
Deutsche Börse Group breaches laws or other stipulations, enters into inade-
quate contractual agreements or fails to monitor and observe the case law to a 
sufficient degree."
"Legal risks also include losses due to fraud and labour law 
issues."
"Furthermore, losses resulting from insufficient anti-money-laundering controls, 
violations of competition law or of banking secrecy are included."
"Such risks 
can also arise if government sanctions are not observed, e.g."
"in case of con-
flicting requirements of different states, or in the event of breaches of other na-
tional or international regulations."
We take specific organisational measures to mitigate operational risks.
"Among 
them are emergency plans, measures to ensure information security and the 
physical safety of employees and buildings, insurance coverage, as well as 
compliance regulations and procedures."
"Comments on compliance require-
ments can be found in the section “Compliance”."
"Contingency plans 
It is vital for our Group to be able to provide our products and services with the 
greatest possible reliability, in order to retain the trust of customers and mar-
kets, and to meet our contractual obligations."
"We have to maintain our busi-
ness operations and take precautions against failures."
"If our core processes 
and resources are not available, this represents not only a substantial risk for 
the entire Group but also even a potential systemic risk for the financial mar-
kets in general."
"A system of contingency plans has therefore been established 
throughout the Group (Business Continuity Management System, BCMS)."
"This 
covers all processes designed to ensure continuity of operations in the event of 
an emergency and reduces unavailability risk."
"Our Group has introduced and tested a management process for emergencies 
that enables us to respond quickly and in a coordinated manner."
"This is in-
tended to minimise the effects on business processes and on the market and 
to enable a quick return to regular operations."
"All business units have ap-
pointed emergency managers to act as central contacts and take responsibility 
during emergencies."
"The emergency managers inform the Executive Board or 
raise the alarm with them in the case of severe incidents."
"If the incident esca-
lates, the Executive Board member responsible acts as the crisis manager or 
delegates this role."
"Our emergency plans are tested regularly by rehearsing crit-
ical situations as realistically as possible."
"Such tests are generally carried out 
unannounced."
"Information security 
As digitalisation advances, the financial sector as a whole continues its tech-
nological development, which increases the risks of cyber-attacks."
"Attacks on 
company IT systems and on financial infrastructure are increasing worldwide 
and the Federal Office for IT Security (BSI) estimates the threat is greater than 
ever."
"Attacks with malware or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks rep-
resent major dangers, for instance."
"As al-
ready described in the section on information security in the chapter “Custom-
ers and markets”, an extensive framework of policies and processes is used, in 
line with the international security standard ISO/IEC 27001, and is supple-
mented by specific inspections and technical abilities."
"Security solutions are 
continuously refined and monitored by an independent control function with a 
link to operational risk management."
"Physical security 
Physical security is a high priority for us due to continuously changing global 
security risks and threats."
"Deutsche Börse AG has developed an integral risk 
management process to protect the company, its employees and values from 
internal and external attacks and threats – in a proactive as well as reactive 
manner."
"Multi-level security processes and controls en-
sure physical security at our locations."
"Physical access to buildings and values 
is monitored permanently; it is based on the access principle of “least privi-
lege” (need-to-have basis)."
"Insurance contracts 
Operational risks that we do not wish to bear ourselves are transferred to in-
surance companies, if this is possible at a reasonable price."
"All insurance con-
tracts are reviewed individually and regularly to identify potential for optimisa-
tion."
"Financial risk 
We divide financial risk into credit, market price and liquidity risks."
"The 
Group’s credit risks result from the specific business models of our subsidiaries 
and DBAG’s treasury investments."
"Various risk metrics are used to measure and manage the credit risk of our 
subsidiaries."
"To derive the credit risk, the required economic risk capital is 
measured using Monte Carlo simulations and regulatory capital requirements 
as well as stress tests are used."
"Among other things the indicators include the 
extent to which individual clients make use of their credit facility and the con-
centration of credit."
"The measurement criteria also include the credit rating of 
the counterparties and the collateral provided."
"Reverse stress tests for banks 
show how many clients would have to default for the losses to exceed the risk-
bearing capacity."
Both Clearstream Banking S.A.
"and Clearstream Banking AG extend credit to 
their customers to make securities settlement more efficient."
"This lending busi-
ness may give rise to short-term receivables from counterparties of several bil-
lion euros, but differs fundamentally from the traditional bank lending business 
and the associated risk profile."
"Credit risk can also arise from cash invest-
ments, which are the responsibility of the Treasury function."
"Treasury invests 
both the company’s own funds and those that our customers deposit with 
Clearstream Banking S.A."
"and Clearstream Banking AG; the funds are mostly 
invested on a secured basis."
"Finally, there may be short-term unsecured credit balances at correspondence 
banks in the course of securities settlement."
"To manage and monitor the coun-
terparty risk in the Group, the credit score of potential customers and counter-
parties to an investment is assessed before our subsidiaries enter into business 
relations."
"Our subsidiaries define safety margins for the collateral depending on the risk 
involved and review them continuously."
"We reduce our risk when investing 
funds belonging to Group companies and client deposits by distributing invest-
ments across multiple counterparties, all with a high credit quality, and by in-
vesting funds primarily in the short term and in secured form if possible."
"In-
vestment limits are established for each counterparty on the basis of at least 
annual credit checks and using ad hoc analyses, as necessary."
"In accordance with their terms and conditions, Eurex Clearing AG and Euro-
pean Commodity Clearing AG only enter into transactions with their clearing 
members."
"Clearing mainly relates to defined securities, rights and derivatives 
that are traded on specific stock exchanges."
"Eurex Clearing AG also offers this 
service for over-the-counter (OTC) products such as interest rate swaps and 
forward rate agreements."
"It acts as a central counterparty between the busi-
ness parties."
"It reduces the resulting credit risk by offsetting receivables and by 
requiring clearing members to post collateral."
"These processes are part of an 
EMIR-compliant security system, which the central counterparties in the Group 
have implemented."
"This backup system consists of different levels that prevent one or even several 
customer defaults from affecting the functioning of the central counterparties."
"As a first step, each clearing member must demonstrate a minimum amount of 
liable capital or, in the case of funds, assets under management."
"It should be 
noted that the underlying risk measurement already factors in changes in 
prices and positions over the course of the day."
"In the third stage, all clearing 
participants are obliged to pay additional collateral into a default fund on a pro 
rata basis according to their individual risk profile."
"A maximum of €600 million is 
available, from which own equity payments can already be used on a pro rata 
basis in the security scheme described above."
"Third parties have no rights un-
der this comfort letter."
"The contribution from Eurex Clearing AG to the overall 
payment waterfall in the event of a liquidation is €200 million."
"Before the col-
lateral in the default fund is used, European Commodity Clearing AG provides 
prefinanced allocated own funds of €35 million."
"If all these funds are not suffi-
cient, European Community Clearing AG can call up additional contributions to 
the default fund from non-defaulting clearing participants up to three times 
within 90 days."
"Before doing so, European Commodity Clearing AG must pro-
vide additional prefinanced allocated own funds of €15 million."
"In addition, Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG can use 
the facilities of the Deutsche Bundesbank and so hold most of the customer 
funds without any default risk."
"The maximum amount payable by Eurex Clearing AG 
and European Commodity Clearing AG is capped at €50 million for Eurex 
Clearing AG and €15 million for European Commodity Clearing AG."
As with Clearstream Banking S.A.
"and Clearstream Banking AG, Treasury also 
invests its own funds and client deposits for Eurex Clearing AG; here too, most 
of the investments are secured."
"To date, no default by one of our customers 
with a secured credit line has resulted in a financial loss for us."
"Market risk 
Market risk include risks of an adverse development of interest rates, exchange 
rates or other market prices, which may occur when investing own or cus-
tomer funds, on open risk positions in foreign currencies or on pension liabili-
ties."
"We measure these risks using Monte Carlo simulations based on histori-
cal price data, as well as corresponding stress tests."
"Clearstream Fund Centre 
S.A."
"measures market risks based on historical developments in interest rates, 
exchange rates and other market prices, and with additional stress tests."
"To 
minimise foreign currency risks, we avoid open currency positions whenever 
possible."
"Market risk exposure only results from relatively small open foreign 
currency positions."
"Derivative financial instruments are used across the Group solely for hedging 
purposes."
"This relates to interest rate or currency swaps, for instance, which 
are used as part of a conservative investment policy for Clearstream Banking 
S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Eurex Clearing AG, or futures to reduce the 
market risk of existing positions at Crypto Finance AG."
"They are actively managed in line with a defined invest-
ment policy and so have a limited exposure to market risk."
"We also reduced 
the risk of extreme losses by deciding to invest the bulk of the CTA on the ba-
sis of a value preservation mechanism."
We did not sustain any significant losses from market price risks in 2023.
"Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk arises if a Group company is unable to meet its upcoming pay-
ment obligations in time and in full or if it can only do so at a higher refinanc-
ing cost."
"Liquidity risks arise primarily at our subsidiaries Eurex Clearing AG,  
Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Fund 
Centre S.A., since these are credit institutions."
"Furthermore, liquidity risks 
arise at European Commodity Clearing AG as it is classified as a credit institu-
tion under the German Banking Act."
"Short-term operating liquidity is mainly covered internally, by retaining earn-
ings."
"The aim is to hold sufficient liquidity to be able to meet all our obliga-
tions as they fall due."
"An intra-group cash pool is used to pool surplus cash 
from our subsidiaries with Deutsche Börse AG, as far as regulatory and legal 
provisions allow."
"Liquid funds are invested on a short-term basis to ensure 
that they are available."
"Short-term investments are also largely secured by liq-
uid bonds from first-class issuers."
"In addition, we have access to short-term 
external sources of financing, such as agreed credit lines with individual com-
mercial banks or consortia, and a commercial paper programme."
"In recent years, we have used our access to the capital markets to issue corpo-
rate bonds in order to meet our structural financing needs."
"Deutsche Börse Group’s liquidity risk management objective is two-fold: we 
aim to cover short-term liquidity needs while safeguarding the long-term fi-
nancing of our Group and thereby reducing liquidity risks."
"For the early identification of risk, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream 
Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European 
Commodity Clearing AG calculate daily the liquidity requirement using various 
stress tests that would occur in the event of client defaults."
"The companies 
hold sufficient liquidity to cover the requirement as determined by these calcu-
lations."
"Furthermore, potential risks that are identified in the course of stress 
tests are analysed, and corresponding risk-reduction measures initiated."
"Aggregated across all currencies, the companies always had sufficient liquidity 
to cover their actual liquidity needs in 2023."
"Liquidity risks are not quantified in the REC (see note 24 to the consolidated 
financial statements)."
"Pension risk is the risk of rising costs from the current measurement of 
pension provisions due to higher life expectancies, salary increases and higher 
inflation rates."
"It is calculated with the support of actuaries during the first 
quarter of the financial year."
"The methods used to measure pension risk were 
modified in 2023 which led to an increase of €57 million in the pension risk."
"Business risk 
Business risk is the unexpected residual loss which arises when the Earnings 
at Risk exceed the anticipated net income after tax, which can be due to the 
competitive environment (e.g."
"customer behaviour, investment failure, industry 
trend), macro-economic and geopolitical developments or erroneous strategic 
management decisions."
"Factors influencing this residual loss could be lower 
revenues or higher costs than planned."
"Business risk is reported when the cal-
culated value at risk is higher than the budgeted net income for the next four 
quarters."
"This approach is based on the use of historic actuals as well as an-
ticipated data and the expenses and income actually reported."
"Since historic 
actuals are not yet available for Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., an approach 
based on business risk scenarios is used there."
"Business risks are continu-
ously monitored by the business units."
"There was no disclosable business risk 
for the Group on the basis of the simulation model as at 31 December 2023."
"The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regularly considers 
whether to classify Deutsche Börse AG as a financial holding company."
"It has 
currently come to the conclusion that Deutsche Börse AG is not a financial 
holding company."
"Classification as a financial holding company could have an 
impact on our capital requirements."
"Regulatory capital requirements and regulatory  
capital ratios (normative perspective) 
Operational risk, credit risk and market risk are used to determine the capital 
requirements from a normative perspective."
"Regulatory capital requirements 
are not determined for Deutsche Börse Group, but separately for each regu-
lated entity."
"However, the risk profile from a normative perspective is compara-
ble to the risk profile derived from economic capital."
"and Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing 
AG and European Commodity Clearing AG used the standard approach for an-
alysing and evaluating credit and market risk."
"The institutions have adopted 
different approaches regarding operational risk: Clearstream uses the consider-
ably more complex Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) in all business 
units, which has been approved and is regularly audited by BaFin."
"In contrast, 
Eurex Clearing AG, European Commodity Clearing AG and Clearstream Fund 
Centre S.A."
"employ the basic indicator approach in order to calculate regula-
tory capital requirements."

"2) As at 31 December 2022, the profit and loss transfer agreement between Eurex Clearing AG and Eurex 
Frankfurt AG did not comply with the discretion under Art."
"For this reason, the regulatory 
capital equivalent to the subscribed capital of €25.0 million was not taken into account for regulatory pur-
poses as at 31 December 2022."
"Eurex Frankfurt AG also contributed capital of €50 million to Eurex Clear-
ing AG as at 25 September 2023."
"In February and March 2023, Clearstream Banking AG carried out two capital 
increases for a total of €110.0 million."
"The reason for strengthening its capital 
base was primarily a change in the interpretation of the CRR and CSDR capital 
requirements by the supervisory authority, resulting in both requirements being 
applied cumulatively."
"The reduction in equity at Clearstream Holding AG is 
due to the new legal entity Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"Own funds  
decreased mainly due to the carve-out of Clear-stream Fund Centre Holding 
and its subgroup."
"Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG 
and Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"have Minimum Requirements for Own 
Funds and Eligible Liabilities, MREL, which were met at all times."
"The Mini-
mum Requirements for Own Funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) result from 
the recovery and resolution planning for the Clearstream entities as well as 
Clearstream Fund Centre S.A."
"on compliance with the Banking Recovery and 
Resolution Directive (BRRD)."
"and Clearstream Bank-
ing AG as central depositories are subject to the capital requirements of CSDR, 
whereas Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clearing AG as central 
counterparties are subject to the specific capital requirements of EMIR, which 
were met at all times in the reporting year."
"As of April 2023, Clearstream 
Banking AG and Clearstream Banking S.A."
"must meet the combined capital re-
quirements (complementary approach ratio) defined in CRR and CSDR. They 
have satisfied the complementary approach ratio since it came into effect."
"Organisational structure and reporting lines 
for risk management  
Organisational structure and reporting lines 
Our risk management approach applies to the entire Deutsche Börse Group."
"Risk management functions, processes and responsibilities are binding for all 
our employees and organisational units."
"To ensure that all employees are risk-
aware, risk management is firmly anchored in the Group’s organisational struc-
ture and workflows, see chart, “Risk management - organisational structure 
and reporting lines”."
"In addition, regular training sessions are held that were 
developed to strengthen the risk culture of all employees."
"The Executive Board 
is responsible for overall risk management, whereas within the subsidiaries it 
is the responsibility of the management."
"The boards and committees listed be-
low receive regular information on the risk situation."
"The 
Supervisory Board has delegated the evaluation to its Audit Committee."
"Addi-
tionally, the Risk Committee is notified annually of the risk appetite frame-
work."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s Executive Board determines the Group-wide risk manage-
ment approach as well as the risk appetite and allocates the latter to the com-
pany’s individual business segments and business units, respectively."
"It en-
sures that the Group’s risk appetite is and remains compatible with its short 
and long-term strategy, business and capital planning, risk-bearing capacity 
and remuneration systems."
"It ensures that the 
requirements for the risk management approach and risk appetite are met."
"The Chief Risk Officer leads the development of proposals for the risk manage-
ment framework, risk appetite, approaches and methods for risk monitoring 
and control, capital allocation and the necessary processes."
"Risks are continu-
ously analysed, evaluated and reported: once a month or as needed to the Ex-
ecutive Board, four times a year to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory 
Board and once a year to the Supervisory Board."
"Likewise, the CRO reports to 
the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the risk management system on 
an annual basis."
"This system ensures that the responsible bodies can check 
whether the defined risk limits are complied with."
"Our subsidiaries act in the same way, always ensuring that they meet the re-
quirements of the Group."
"In particular, they adhere to the risk appetite frame-
work allocated to them by Deutsche Börse Group."
"The banks and European 
Commodity Clearing AG have independent executive boards and supervisory 
boards."
"The relevant supervisory boards and their committees are involved in 
the process."
"The same applies to the executive boards and the corresponding 
risk management functions."
"Clearstream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking 
S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clearstream Fund Centre S.A., European Com-
modity Clearing AG and Eurex Clearing AG implement the risk management 
approach with specific features derived for their own businesses."
"They equally 
use metrics and reporting formats adjusted to the overarching Group structure."
"As a rule, the management of the respective subsidiary is responsible for struc-
turing the risk management approach and for compliance with the relevant le-
gal requirements."
"Centrally coordinated risk management process 
Our risk management is implemented in a five-stage, centrally coordinated 
process."
"All potential losses should be identified in a timely manner, centrally 
recorded and, whenever possible quantitatively measured."
"Measures for man-
aging them are to be recommended as necessary and their implementation en-
sured (see chart “Five-stage risk management process”)."
"A further component 
of our risk management approach is the three lines of defence (3LoD) model, 
which is established at Deutsche Börse AG and at the banks and securities 
companies in our Group."
"This model defines a clear segregation of functions 
and responsibilities between the operating business units (first line of de-
fence), risk management (second line of defence) and internal audit (third line 
of defence)."
"In the second stage, the business areas (first line of de-
fence) regularly – or immediately, in urgent cases – report the risks that they 
have identified and quantified."
"The report goes to the risk management func-
tion (part of the second line of defence), which evaluates the potential threat 
in a third stage."
"In the fourth stage the business units manage the risks by 
avoiding, mitigating or transferring them, or by actively accepting them."
"The 
fifth and final stage involves monitoring different risk metrics and, where nec-
essary, informing the responsible Executive Board members and committees of 
significant risks, their assessment and possible emergency measures."
"In addi-
tion to its regular reports, the CRO division compiles ad hoc reports for the Ex-
ecutive and Supervisory Boards."
"The risk management functions at Clear-
stream Holding AG, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking AG, Clear-
stream Funds Centre S.A., Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity Clear-
ing AG submit reports to the respective executive boards and supervisory 
boards."
"The internal audit function (third line of defence) is an independent 
function and monitors both the business units and the risk management func-
tions."
"Structure of the internal control system 
Deutsche Börse has a Group-wide internal control system (ICS) that defines a 
framework with minimum requirements for all entities in the Group."
"The 
framework provides the basis for the risk-based implementation of the ICS."
"It 
supports the effective and efficient implementation and operation of the ICS re-
gardless of the degree of regulation, or the size of the entity, for example."
"The ICS helps to manage risks and particularly covers risks at the process 
level."
"This entails defining rules for the uniform recording and assessment of 
process risks, in aggregate and at the individual risk level."
"It should be empha-
sised that both financial and non-financial effects are taken into account when 
assessing the materiality of risks."
"A control cycle carried out at least once a 
year defines minimum requirements for continuous improvements and ICS re-
porting."
"This also includes an assessment of the appropriateness and effective-
ness of the measures taken by the business units as the first line of defence."
"A particular emphasis in the ICS implementation is on steps to manage mate-
rial risks in connection with financial and non-financial reporting."
"The central unit Financial Accounting and Controlling (FA&C), which reports 
directly to the CFO, and decentralised units working to standards defined by 
FA&C are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with 
the statutory requirements."
Group Tax is responsible for determining tax items.
"The relevant department heads are responsible for the related processes, in-
cluding effective security and control measures."
"The aim is to ensure that risks 
relating to the accounting process are identified early on, so that remedial ac-
tion can be taken in good time."
"FA&C provides the subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial state-
ments with accounting guidelines that are intended to support consistent and 
correct accounting across the Group."
"Moreover, we continuously monitor and 
analyse changes in the accounting environment and adjust our processes ac-
cordingly."
"Incompatible tasks – such as modifying master 
data on the one hand and issuing payment instructions on the other – are 
strictly segregated at a functional level."
"An independent control unit grants in-
dividual employees access rights to the accounting system and continuously 
monitors these permissions using a so-called incompatibility matrix."
"Subsidiaries of Deutsche Börse Group maintain and consolidate their general 
ledgers in the same system."
"Accounting data from other companies is up-
loaded for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements."
"The processes, systems and controls described above aim to provide reasona-
ble assurance that our accounting system complies with the applicable princi-
ples and laws."
"In addition, Compliance and Internal Audit act as a further line 
of defence, performing risk-based, process-independent controls on whether 
the ICS is appropriate and effective."
"The accounting-based internal control system (ICS) was strengthened and ex-
panded in 2023."
"A Control Over Financial Reporting (COFR) policy was intro-
duced and adopted by all the subsidiaries included in the consolidated finan-
cial statements."
"The COFR policy is intended to manage the risks associated 
with financial reporting across the Group, deliver end-to-end transparency in 
the financial processes and ensure the reliability of financial reporting."
"FA&C 
has provided a standardised process catalogue for accounting processes, in-
cluding standardised risk-control matrices and documentation requirements."
Compliance is regularly monitored by FA&C.
"These measures are to be 
strengthened and expanded again in 2024."
"The Executive Board and the Audit Committee established by the Supervisory 
Board receive regular reports on the effectiveness of the ICS with respect to the 
financial reporting process."
"Overall assessment of the risk situation by the  
Executive Board  
Summary 
The risk profile of Deutsche Börse Group did not change significantly in the 
2023 financial year."
"All known impacts of the geopolitical and macroeconomic 
developments were actively managed within the Group and potential new risks 
were analysed on an ongoing basis."
"The aggregate total risk of Deutsche Börse 
Group comprising all risk types (operational, financial, pension and business 
risk) was always matched by sufficient covered funds."
"Group risk management 
and the internal control system (ICS) were further strengthened and expanded 
in 2023, as described above."
"No significant change in the risk situation of the 
Group has been identified by the Executive Board at the present time."
"Outlook 
Deutsche Börse Group continually assesses its risk situation."
"From stress tests, 
the economic capital requirements as calculated and based on the risk man-
agement system, Deutsche Börse AG’s Executive Board concludes that the 
available risk coverage amount and liquidity are sufficient."
"There is currently 
no indication that the risk coverage amount has to be adjusted for 2024."
"Fur-
thermore, it cannot identify any risk that would endanger the Group’s existence 
as a going concern."
"Group risk management and the internal control system 
(ICS) are to be strengthened and expanded further in 2024."
"SimCorp will also 
be fully included in the measurement of economic capital."
"In addition, the im-
plementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) across 
the Group for aspects relevant to risk management will be driven forward."
"We pursue both organic growth and focused M&A  
activities."
"Organisation of opportunities management 
We evaluate the organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the individual 
business areas continuously, i.e."
over the course of the year.
"With our oppor-
tunity management, we can identify, evaluate and seize opportunities for the 
Group as early as possible – and turn them into business successes."
"At Group 
level these opportunities are systematically assessed as part of the annual 
budgeting process and strategic reviews."
"The process begins with a careful 
analysis of the market environment, which considers both what the customer 
wants, as well as market developments, competitors and regulatory changes."
"Ideas for growth initiatives are developed further using uniform, Group-wide 
templates and subjected to a profitability analysis."
"On this basis, our Executive 
Board decides which initiatives are to be implemented."
"In the course of preparing our Horizon 2026 strategy we validated our oppor-
tunities again and adjusted them accordingly."
"Organic growth opportunities 
We have a very broad portfolio of products and services with which we cover 
all areas of a market infrastructure provider’s value chain."
"In order to maintain 
and expand this position we are pursuing a growth strategy called Horizon 
2026 (see section “Strategy and steering parameters”)."
"We are focusing pri-
marily on organic growth opportunities."
"These consist largely of secular oppor-
tunities that we can influence ourselves."
"There are also cyclical opportuni-
ties that are beyond our direct control and result from changes in the macroe-
conomic environment."
"Apart from that, we see long-term growth opportunities 
resulting from the technological transformation."
"With the help of distributed 
ledger technology, public cloud solutions for operating IT infrastructure and ar-
tificial intelligence, we not only want to become efficient in our existing busi-
ness, but also see opportunities for new products and services related to digital 
assets, for example."
"With the merger of 
SimCorp and Axioma we have created an end-to-end offering along the entire 
process chain for institutional investors."
"This also enables us to realise revenue 
and cost synergies."
"It opens up significant, sustainable and long-term growth 
opportunities and enables us to diversify our business and further increase the 
proportion of our recurring revenue."
"One-stop shop for global indices and data (combination of ISS and STOXX): 
Our objective in the index business is to give the already established European 
index provider STOXX an even more global profile, in order to develop and 
market other indices worldwide."
"By combining our index provider STOXX with 
the ESG and data business of ISS we have created the foundation for offering 
our customers an integrated range of indices and ESG data."
"This gives us an 
advantage over our global competitors and helps us to give new and existing 
customers the best possible service."
"In addition, Deutsche Börse’s index busi-
ness will continue to take advantage of the structural trend towards passive in-
vestment products (ETFs)."
"An increasing number of private clients and asset 
managers now follow this trend; not only are the costs lower, but many active 
investment strategies have been returning under-average performance."
"We are 
also realising revenue and cost synergies by merging ISS and STOXX under 
joint management."
"Trading & Clearing 
New interest rate derivatives: Higher interest rates and wider fluctuations in 
expectations on future rates increase demand for interest rate products as in-
vestments and speculative opportunities, and to hedge interest rate risks."
"To 
support this, we use our leading position in long-term interest rate derivatives 
in order to win short-term business in interest rate derivatives for our platforms 
too."
"Customers profit from efficiencies in margin requirements if they pool their 
short-term interest rate business as well as their long-term interest rate busi-
ness on our platforms."
"We offer an additional incentive by expanding our part-
nership programme, which enables market participants to share in our eco-
nomic success."
"Clearing of OTC derivatives: We have used political and regulatory develop-
ments, along with our expertise in building liquid markets, and expanded our 
market share in the clearing of OTC derivatives to around 20 per cent in recent 
years."
"In the years ahead we want to profit from overall market growth and in-
crease our market share at the same time."
"To achieve these goals we use our 
improved risk model and efficiencies in cross-margining, i.e."
"offsetting margins 
for OTC trades with those for exchange-traded business."
"The current obligation 
being discussed by the EU supervisory authorities to use an active cross-mar-
gining account within the EU could also contribute to gaining additional mar-
ket share."
"Rising demand for repo products: 
 The retreat by central banks from the 
money market and higher interest rates have caused demand for secured 
money market products to rise."
"We anticipate that we will profit from overall 
market growth and win new customers for our products at the same time."
"These new products reflect changes in customer preferences 
and regulatory requirements, and we therefore expect to see further significant 
growth here in the years ahead."
"Rising demand for power derivatives: 
 The increasing share of renewable ener-
gies in the energy mix causes wider price fluctuations on European power mar-
kets."
"At the same time, industries with high energy requirements are obliged to 
include future energy costs in their calculations well in advance when pricing 
their final products."
"Their hedging requirement and demand for power deriva-
tives is correspondingly high."
"Liquidity in the European power markets oper-
ated by us is now high, which has attracted new market participants, such as 
algorithmic and quant traders."
"They have no physical need, but use power as 
an asset class for trading."
"We want to use this momentum to increase liquidity 
on our platforms even further and open up new customer groups."
"Tokenisation: 
 We are at the beginning of a new technology and digital assets 
will increase the range of investable and tradable instruments significantly."
"With the Digital Asset Business Platform we want to make tokenised assets 
fungible for institutional customers and profit from this trend over the long 
term."
"Fund Services 
Cross-border settlement and distribution of investment funds: 
Our clients can use Clearstream’s settlement, custody and distribution services 
for their entire fund portfolio – covering traditional investment funds, ex-
change-traded funds (ETFs) as well as hedge funds."
"Given that supervisory au-
thorities are also calling for more efficient settlement and custody solutions in 
order to guarantee maximum security for client assets under custody, we ex-
pect to acquire additional client portfolios in the future by means of outsourc-
ing agreements."
"We are also continuously expanding our range of products 
and services."
"So, for example, we have significantly expanded our range of 
fund services to include the management of distribution agreements, as well 
as data compilation through acquisitions."
"Securities Services 
Expand fixed-income securities services: 
 With new offerings for our customers 
in the Securities Services segment we intend to use our presence and range in 
fixed-income securities services in a more normal interest rate environment."
This includes expanding the repo and securities lending business.
"Both prod-
ucts are currently seeing stronger demand due to central banks’ withdrawal 
from the money market and increased demand for high-quality collateral."
"Digital value chain in custody: Clearstream customers can already issue as-
sets the same-day in a digital value chain via our D7 platform."
"We want to 
build on this success and enable our customers to manage and settle positions 
and accounts digitally in future – and to do so for all their asset classes."
"In ad-
dition to economies of scale and cost savings, we anticipate further long-term 
growth from a larger number of transactions."
"Cyclical opportunities 
In addition to secular growth opportunities, we have cyclical opportunities, for 
instance as a result of macroeconomic developments or unexpected market 
events."
"We do not have any direct control over these cyclical opportunities, but 
they do have the potential to increase our net revenue significantly."
"They in-
clude high trading volumes on our markets, on the one hand, which could be 
caused by a change in interest rate expectations or global events."
"On the other 
we benefit from rising interest rates, because they increase the net interest in-
come we receive on cash balances."
"They include 
cloud services, artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technology 
(DLT)."
"These technologies can help to harmonise markets, open up new busi-
ness potential, boost efficiency and reduce risks."
"We continuously and system-
atically observe and evaluate new technological developments and trends in 
terms of their impact and importance for our business model and our pro-
cesses."
"Together with external partners we deliberately build and extend our 
expertise in selected technological areas."
"Cloud 
We work continuously to migrate our services and processes to the cloud and 
to optimise them."
"In addition to the flexible use of computing capacities, this 
has other advantages for us."
"For instance, the introduction of new functionali-
ties and updating of existing software might be tested faster and better by cli-
ents in the cloud."
"This makes our processes significantly more agile, as new 
releases can be introduced at more frequent intervals, allowing us to respond 
better to clients’ requirements."
"We have been following a hybrid multi-cloud strategy with great success for 
years."
"Via agreements with leading international cloud providers we have al-
ready positioned ourselves at the summit of cloud use in the European finan-
cial services sector."
"In addition, on 9 February 2023, we announced a new 
strategic partnership with Google Cloud."
"It is intended to cover 10 years and 
allows us to profit from the technical performance and robust security mecha-
nisms of a respected cloud provider."
"As part of our partnership with Google Cloud we are concentrating on four ar-
eas: 
1."
"Increase cloud use: we are planning to move up to 70 per cent of the pro-
cesses within our Group to the cloud."
"The migration is planned for completion 
by late 2026 and will comprise both cloud-to-cloud migrations and on-prem-
ise-to-cloud migrations."
"We are also working with other cloud providers in ad-
dition to Google."
"Data mesh: We are developing a data mesh that enables the shared use of 
data across different data storage devices and companies within the Group."
"Building on this, the aim is to create a market place where we can make data 
and analytics products and services available to external customers."
"Digital Assets Business Platform: We are planning to build an ecosystem 
for digital assets that is operated on the basis of an institutional value chain, 
using native digital infrastructure components in the cloud."
"The platform would 
conform to recognised standards in the finance industry and service a variety 
of asset classes and use cases on and off the blockchain."
"Digital Securities Platform D7: D7 is our contribution to a European eco-
system for digital assets."
"With D7 we want to enable market participants the 
settlement of their digital assets on an institutionalised platform."
"This will drive 
digitisation and efficiency in post-trading and create a next-generation digital 
securities platform."
"The aim is to digitise the entire value chain from issuance 
to administration, repayment and archival."
"It will make it possible to create, 
record, settle and manage digital securities and digital assets in centralised 
and decentralised ledgers."
"Distributed ledger technology (DLT)  
The use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) represents another technologi-
cal opportunity."
"It is sometimes considered a disruptive technology, and at 
present, the financial services sector is increasingly exploring its opportunities."
"Thanks to its decentralised nature, it facilitates direct interaction between par-
ticipants, thus offering the potential for simplifying complex processes."
"The 
challenge in the financial industry is to make use of distributed ledger technol-
ogy while meeting high security standards and taking risk limitation and cost 
efficiency aspects into account."
"As an established provider of market infrastructure with an integrated value 
chain, we are in a good position to exploit the potential of distributed ledger 
technology."
"Our experience of applicable industry standards and legal and reg-
ulatory requirements is a decisive advantage here."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) 
Well-known use cases have increasingly brought artificial intelligence into the 
public eye."
"As a provider of market infrastructure in the financial industry we 
are particularly evaluating artificial intelligence from the perspective of effi-
ciency gains and scalability across the Group."
"Artificial intelligence is already 
being used in initial applications – for our customers (OSCAR collateral man-
agement, settlement prediction tool) and for our employees (chatbots)."
"We al-
ways keep an eye on technological and regulatory developments, in order to 
evaluate and implement the best new use cases for artificial intelligence."
"To do 
so we make use of both internal and external know-how, in the context of stra-
tegic partnerships for instance."
"In the long term we intend to continue consistently on our 
growth path, in order to make Deutsche Börse Group the preferred global market infrastructure provider."
"The forecast describes Deutsche Börse Group’s expected performance for the 
2024 financial year."
"It contains statements and information on events in the 
future and is based on the company’s expectations and assumptions at the 
time of publication of this corporate report."
"In turn, these are subject to known 
and unknown opportunities, risks and uncertainties."
"Numerous factors, many 
of which are outside the company’s control, influence the Group’s success, its 
business strategy and its financial results."
"Developments in the operating environment 
Macroeconomic environment 
Global economic growth slowed again over the course of 2023, as a result of 
much more restrictive monetary policies by central banks."
"The escalation of 
the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East in the second half-
year also caused uncertainty among market participants."
"We expect the eco-
nomic situation to remain tense in 2024 due to high interest rates."
"Interest 
rate cuts by central banks following further falls in inflation could have a posi-
tive impact on the economic environment, on the one hand."
"On the other, a 
sharper decline in economic growth than expected or a recession could lead to 
uncertainty among market participants."
"Future development of results of operations 
For the year 2024 we are expect revenue to increase again to more than  
€5.6 billion."
"In addition to organic growth on the basis of our secular growth 
opportunities, the consolidation of SimCorp will make a significant contribu-
tion."
"We are also currently anticipating slight secular headwinds if central 
banks should reduce their base rates."
"If market volatility goes up or interest 
rates stay at least at their current level, this would have a positive effect."
"In 
terms of operating costs we are planning an increase for investment in our or-
ganic growth opportunities, and the additional contribution from SimCorp."
"On 
this basis we anticipate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amor-
tisation (EBITDA) of more than €3.2 billion in 2024."
"As far as the forecast development of non-financial performance in-
dicators for 2024 is concerned, system availability was brought back into line 
with the high targets by means of additional back-up measures, which became 
part of everyday operations."
"We therefore expect that the system availability of 
customer facing IT will remain high in the forecast period."
Being an attractive employer is important for our sustained success.
"We want 
to attract top talents and retain them for the long term."
"The measures de-
scribed in the chapter “Employees” have put us in a good position and we are 
confident that we can maintain or improve on our employee satisfaction of 
more than 71.5 per cent."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s Executive Board has defined target quotas for women on 
the two management levels beneath the Executive Board, in accordance with 
section 76 (4) of the AktG, in each case referring to Deutsche Börse AG."
"By 
31 December 2024, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and 
second management levels beneath the Executive Board is planned to reach 
15 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively."
"Moreover, on a global Group level 
the Executive Board has adopted a voluntary commitment to increase the 
share of women holding upper management positions to 24 per cent by the 
end of 2024, and of women holding lower management positions to 33 per 
cent during the same period."
"We have extended the scope of our voluntary 
commitment over and above the legal requirements."
"The assessment of independent ESG rating agencies is an important bench-
mark for our ESG efforts."
"We continuously analyse our performance and take 
action accordingly."
"Over the forecast period we expect that we will be able to 
maintain our good position above the 90th percentile of the ESG ratings."
"Future development of the Group’s financial position 
We expect that cash flow from operating activities, which is our primary source 
of financing, will remain significantly positive in future."
"We expect that three 
significant factors will influence changes in liquidity in the forecast period: 
firstly, we plan to invest around €350 million in intangible assets and prop-
erty, plant and equipment at Group level."
"These investments will serve primar-
ily to develop new products and services in our growth areas and to enhance 
existing ones."
"We also launched a share buy-back programme with a volume 
of €300 million in January 2024."
"In May 2024 we will propose a dividend of 
€3.80 per share to the Annual General Meeting."
"This would represent a cash 
outflow of about €703.4 million."
"Apart from the above, we did not expect any 
other material factors to impact the Group’s liquidity at the time the combined 
management report was prepared."
"As in previous years, we assume that we 
will have a sound liquidity base in the forecast period due to positive cash flow 
from operating activities, adequate credit lines (for details see note 24 to the 
consolidated financial statements), and our flexible management and planning 
systems."
"In future we 
will aim to distribute dividends equivalent to 30-40 per cent of the net profit 
for the period attributable to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The divi-
dend per share is planned to increase going forward."
"In addition, available li-
quidity can be invested in the Group’s further inorganic development, as in the 
past."
"In the event of any surplus liquidity, the company intends to supplement 
the dividend with share buy-backs."
"To maintain its strong credit ratings at Group level, we aim for a ratio of net 
debt to EBITDA of no more than 2.25, and a ratio of free funds from opera-
tions to net debt of at least 40 per cent."
"Financing the takeover of SimCorp 
temporarily caused the ratio of free funds from operations to net debt to not 
fulfil the target at year-end 2023."
"We expect to be within the limit for this indi-
cator again in 2024 thanks to positive cash flow from operating activities."
"Overall assessment by the Executive Board 
We believe the Group remains very well positioned in terms of international com-
petition, thanks to its broadly diversified offering along the securities trading value 
chain and its innovative strength."
"This being the case, we expect to see a positive 
trend in the results of operations over the long term."
"Our new corporate strategy 
and the resulting measures should further accelerate this growth."
"In this context 
the Group aims to become more agile and effective and sharpen its client focus, 
in order to become the global market infrastructure provider of choice, with a top 
ranking in all its business areas."
"Taking the conditions for organic growth into ac-
count, the Executive Board is planning an increase in net revenue to more than 
€5.6 billion in the forecast period."
"The Executive Board expects EBITDA to go up 
to more than €3.2 billion in the forecast period."
"Overall, on this basis the Execu-
tive Board assumes that cash flow from operating activities will be clearly positive 
and that, as in previous years, the liquidity base will be sound."
"The overall as-
sessment by the Executive Board is valid as at the publication date for this com-
bined management report."
"Report on post-balance sheet  
date events 
There were no significant events after the end of the reporting period."
"In this statement, we report on corporate governance at Deutsche Börse AG in accordance with principle 23 
of the Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex (German Corporate Governance Code)."
"The statement contains 
the corporate governance statement pursuant to section 315d in conjunction with section 289f Han-
delsgesetzbuch (HGB, German Commercial Code)."
"The declarations of conformity for the past five 
years are also available there."
"Recommendation D.4 GCGC states that the Supervisory Board shall 
form a Nomination Committee composed exclusively of shareholder represent-
atives."
"In accordance with section 4 b of the German Stock Exchange Act, 
however, the Nomination Committee also assists the Supervisory Board of 
Deutsche Börse AG in selecting candidates for the Executive Board."
"As this 
task shall not be performed exclusively by shareholder representatives of the 
Supervisory Board, and in line with the practice to date, the Nomination Com-
mittee also includes employee representatives."
"Disclosures on suggestions of the GCGC 
The GCGC consists of both recommendations (denoted in the text by the use of 
the word “shall”), which are reported in the Declaration of Conformity in ac-
cordance with section 161 AktG, and suggestions (denoted in the text by the 
use of the word “should”)."
Deutsche Börse AG fully complies with them.
"Information on corporate governance practices 
Conduct policies 
Deutsche Börse Group’s global orientation means that binding policies and 
standards of conduct must apply at all of the Group’s locations around the 
world."
"Specifically, the main objectives of these principles for collaboration are 
to ensure responsibility, respect and mutual esteem."
"The Group also adheres 
to these principles when implementing its business model."

specifying concrete rules, the code of business conduct provides general guid-
ance as to how employees can contribute to implementing the defined values

provide guidance on working together in the company on a day-to-day basis, 
to help resolve any conflicts and to resolve ethical and legal challenges."
"All 
newly hired employees receive the code of business conduct as part of their 
employment contract documentation."
"The code of business conduct is an inte-
gral part of the relationship between employer and employees at Deutsche 
Börse Group."
Breaches may lead to disciplinary action.
"The document is avail-
able at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Responsibility > Sustainability > Our 
policies and guidelines."
"The code of conduct for suppliers as applicable to Deutsche Börse AG and the 
central purchasing department requires suppliers, among other things, to re-
spect human rights and environmental regulations and to comply with mini-
mum standards in these areas."
"The minimum standards also incorporate the 
requirements of the German Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (Supply Chain 
Due Diligence Act) and the UK Modern Slavery Act."
"Service providers and sup-
pliers must sign this code of conduct or enter into an equivalent voluntary

Deutsche Börse Group’s business activities are based on the legal frameworks 
and ethical standards of the different countries in which the Group operates."
"A 
key way in which we underscore the values we consider important for the 
Deutsche Börse Group is by joining initiatives and organisations that advocate 
generally accepted ethical standards."
"Relevant memberships are as follows: 
U
UN Global Compact www.unglobalcompact.org: this voluntary business initia-
tive established by the United Nations aims to achieve a more sustainable and 
more equitable global economy."
"At the heart of the compact are ten principles 
covering the areas of human rights, labour, environment protection and anti-
corruption."
"Deutsche Börse Group has submitted annual communications on 
progress (COPs) on its implementation of the UN Global Compact since 2009."
"I
International Labour Organization www.ilo.org: this UN agency is the interna-
tional organisation responsible for drawing up and overseeing international la-
bour standards."
"It brings together representatives of governments, employees 
and employers to promote the joint development of policies and programmes."
"Deutsche Börse Group has signed up to the ILO’s labour standards and hence 
has agreed to abide by them."
"Sustainability in corporate governance 
Sustainability is of significant importance for the corporate strategy of Deutsche 
Börse Group."
"It is therefore an essential element of corporate governance at 
the level of both the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"The Executive 
Board of Deutsche Börse AG takes all strategic decisions concerning sustaina-
bility matters at Deutsche Börse Group."
"It was supported in the reporting year 
by the interdisciplinary Group Sustainability Board, which is chaired by the 
CFO."
"The Group Sustainability Board is the central management board for sus-
tainability topics in Deutsche Börse Group."
"It deals with company initiatives 
relating to environmental, social and governance topics (ESG)."
"This includes 
advising on and monitoring the integration of sustainability into corporate plan-
ning and controlling."
"The Group Sustainability Board has been replaced by the 
Group Sustainability Committee as of 1 January 2024."
"The Group Sustainabil-
ity Committee is the new central management unit for sustainability topics in 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"It is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer and 
supports and advises the Executive Board on all aspects of sustainability."
"The 
Group Sustainability Committee is intended to ensure the implementation of 
effective ESG practices in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines."
"Responsibility for ESG reporting was transferred 
from Group ESG Strategy to the section Sustainability Reporting, which is part 
of the CFO function, on 1 October 2023."
"At the Supervisory Board level, the Strategy and Sustainability Committee has 
dealt, in particular, with sustainable corporate governance and activities in the 
field of ESG at Deutsche Börse Group since 2021."
"In addition to embedding 
ESG in the work of the Supervisory Board in this way, it is particularly im-
portant for the board as a whole and in the other Supervisory Board commit-
tees, especially the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the Nomination 
Committee."
"Current, relevant sustainability aspects also form part of the train-
ing programme for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and are dealt 
with in workshops and seminars."
"To promote the sustainable development of the Deutsche Börse Group, ESG 
targets are an integral part of the remuneration system for the Executive Board."
"Details of the Executive Board remuneration system can be found in the  
“Remuneration report”."
"Further information on this subject can be found online at www.deutsche-bo-
erse.com > Responsibility > Sustainability."
"More information about the Super-
visory Board committee, Strategy and Sustainability, can be found in the chap-
ter Supervisory Board committees."
"Details of the work carried out by the Strat-
egy and Sustainability Committee are included in the “Supervisory Board Re-
port”."
"Control and risk management systems 
Deutsche Börse Group’s pivotal role in the financial sector requires that it han-
dles information and risks responsibly."
"The Group has a number of rules and 
processes for this purpose."
"They comprise both statutory and internal rules 
that can be adapted specifically to individual industry segments."
"They include 
policies on whistleblowing, risk management and the internal control system."
"Whistleblower system 
Deutsche Börse Group plays an active role in the fight against breaches of 
rules and regulations."
"One example is Deutsche Börse Group’s whistleblowing 
system, which provides a channel to report non-compliant behaviour."
"Reports can be made in their own name or anonymously and 
can be made around the clock."
"Further information regarding the whistleblower system can be found at 
www.deutsche-boerse.com > Our Company > Contact > Whistleblower sys-
tem."
"Deutsche Börse Group’s enterprise-wide control systems are 
embedded in an overarching framework."
"This comprises, among other things, 
the legal requirements, the recommendations of the German Corporate Govern-
ance Code, international regulations and recommendations and other com-
pany-specific policies."
"The executives responsible for the different elements of 
the control system are in close contact with each other and with the Executive 
Board."
"Key aspects of its design and implementation are also reported regu-
larly to the Supervisory Board or its committees."
"Equally, the Group has an en-
terprise-wide risk management system that covers and provides mandatory 
rules for functions, processes and responsibilities."
"The internal control system 
and risk management system also cover sustainability-related targets."
"Details 
of the internal control system and risk management at Deutsche Börse Group 
can be found in the “Risk report” section."
"Working practices of the Executive Board and the  
Supervisory Board 
An important fundamental principle of the German Stock Corporation Act is the 
dual board system – which assigns separate, independent responsibilities to 
the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"These responsibilities and 
their implementation at Deutsche Börse AG are set out in detail in the follow-
ing paragraphs."
"Both boards perform their duties in the interests of the company and with the 
aim of achieving a sustainable, long-term increase in value."
"Their actions are 
based on the principle of responsible corporate governance."
"The Executive 
Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG therefore work closely to-
gether in a spirit of mutual trust."
"The Executive Board provides the Supervisory 
Board with comprehensive information on the company’s and the Group’s po-
sition and the course of business in a regular and timely manner."
"In addition, 
the Executive Board informs the Supervisory Board regularly concerning issues 
relating to corporate planning, the risk situation and risk management, compli-
ance and the company’s control systems."
"The strategic orientation of the com-
pany is examined in detail and agreed upon with the Supervisory Board."
"Im-
plementation of the relevant measures is discussed at regular intervals."
"The 
Chief Executive Officer reports to the Supervisory Board without undue delay, 
orally or in writing, on matters that are of special importance to the company."
"In addition, the CEO keeps the Chair of the Supervisory Board continuously 
and regularly informed of the current developments affecting the company’s 
business, significant transactions, upcoming decisions and the long-term out-
look and discusses these issues with him or her."
"The Supervisory Board may 
also request reports from the Executive Board at any time, especially on mat-
ters and business transactions at Deutsche Börse AG and subsidiaries that 
have a significant impact on Deutsche Börse AG’s position."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s Executive Board  
The Executive Board manages Deutsche Börse AG and the Deutsche Börse 
Group."
The Executive Board had six members in the reporting year.
"The main 
duties of the Executive Board include defining the Group’s corporate goals and 
sustainable strategic orientation, managing and monitoring the operating units, 
as well as establishing and monitoring an efficient risk management system."
"The Executive Board is responsible for preparing the annual and consolidated 
financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG, as well as for producing financial 
information during the course of the year."
"In addition, it must ensure the com-
pany’s compliance with legal requirements and official regulations."
"The members of the Executive Board are jointly responsible for all aspects of 
management."
"Irrespective of this collective responsibility, the individual mem-
bers manage the company’s business areas assigned to them in the Executive 
Board’s schedule of responsibilities independently and are personally responsi-
ble for them."
"In addition to the business areas, the functional areas of respon-
sibility are that of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), the Chief Information Officer/Chief Operating Officer (CIO/COO) and 
Governance, People & Culture."
"For details, see  
“Deutsche Börse: Fundamental information about the Group” section and  
www.deutsche-boerse.com > Company > Deutsche Börse Group > Business 
areas."
"Further details of the Executive Board’s work are set out in the bylaws that the 
Supervisory Board has adopted for the Executive Board."
"Among other things, 
these list issues that are reserved for the entire Executive Board, special 
measures requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board, other procedural de-
tails and the arrangements for passing resolutions."
"The Executive Board holds 
regular meetings."
"They are convened by the CEO, who coordinates the work of 
the Executive Board."
"Any Executive Board member can require a meeting to be 
convened."
"In accordance with its bylaws, the entire Executive Board normally 
takes decisions on the basis of resolutions passed by a simple majority of the 
members voting on them in each case."
"If a vote is tied, the CEO has the cast-
ing vote."
"More information on the Executive Board, its composition, members’ individual 
appointments and biographies can be found at www.deutsche-boerse.com > 
Investor Relations> Corporate Governance > Executive Board."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s Supervisory Board  
The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Executive Board in its man-
agement of the company."
This also covers sustainability matters.
"The Supervi-
sory Board supports the Executive Board in significant business decisions and 
provides advice on strategically important issues."
"In the Rules of Procedures 
for the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board has defined transactions of fun-
damental importance which require its approval."
"In addition, the Supervisory 
Board is responsible for appointing the members of the Executive Board, de-
ciding on their total remuneration and examining Deutsche Börse AG’s annual 
and consolidated financial statements and the combined management report."
"Details of the Supervisory Board’s work during the 2023 financial year can be 
found in the “Report of the Supervisory Board”."
"The 
term of office of the current members ends at the Annual General Meeting in 
2024."
The Supervisory Board holds at least six regular meetings every year.
"In addi-
tion, extraordinary meetings are held as required."
"Executive Board members 
attend the meetings unless the Supervisory Board decides otherwise in any 
particular case."
"The Supervisory Board also meets regularly without the Execu-
tive Board."
Exchanges also take place as necessary with the annual auditors.
The committees also hold regular meetings.
"Unless mandatory statutory provi-
sions or the articles of incorporation call for a different procedure, the Supervi-
sory Board passes its resolutions by a simple majority."
"If a vote is tied, the 
Chair has the casting vote."
"Further details of how the Supervisory Board and 
its committees work are defined in particular in the Rules of Procedure for the 
Supervisory Board, which can be downloaded at www.deutsche-boerse.com > 
Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Rules of 
procedure."
"The Supervisory Board reviews both the knowledge, skill and experience of the 
Executive Board and Supervisory Board as a whole and of their members regu-
larly, at least once a year, and examines the structure, size, composition and 
performance of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board."
"Its review is based 
on a catalogue of specific targets, including qualification requirements, which, 
in turn, are reviewed regularly by the Supervisory Board."
"As a result of this re-
view the qualification matrix was amended in the reporting year to show the 
competences “Strategy” and “Sustainability” separately."
"In this way, the Super-
visory Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent."
"The Su-
pervisory Board also regularly, at least once a year, reviews the effectiveness of 
its work, discusses opportunities for improvement and decides on suitable 
measures if necessary."
"The concrete targets are described in the chapter Tar-
gets for composition and qualification requirements of the Supervisory Board 
and the annual effectiveness review is described in the chapter Examination of 
the effectiveness of Supervisory Board work."
"The Chair of the Supervisory Board consults, on a regular basis, with the 
shareholder and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board, also out-
side the meetings, and arranges talks to prepare for the Supervisory Board 
meetings as necessary."
"Separate pre-meetings of shareholder and employee 
representatives also take place regularly before the ordinary meetings of the 
full Supervisory Board."
"Additionally, the 
Supervisory Board has delegated individual decision-making powers to the 
committees, to the extent that this is legally permissible."
"The Supervisory 
Board had seven committees in the reporting period."
"For details of the commit-
tees, please refer to the tables Supervisory Board committees in the reporting 
year: composition and responsibilities."
"Their individual responsibilities are gov-
erned by the Supervisory Board’s bylaws."
"The committees’ rules of procedure 
correspond to those for the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board."
"Details 
of the current duties and members of the individual committees can be found 
online at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Corporate Governance > Investor Re-
lations> Supervisory Board > Committees."
"The chairs of the individual committees report to the plenary meeting about 
the subjects addressed and resolutions passed in the committee meetings."
"Outside the meetings the Chair of the Audit Committee also reports regularly to 
the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board on her regular exchanges 
with the annual auditor."
"Information on the Supervisory Board’s concrete work 
and meetings during the reporting period can be found in the Report of the Su-
pervisory Board."

members and their appointments and biographies, can be found at:

2) Barbara Lambert has the expertise in auditing and Michael Rüdiger has the expertise in financial reporting required by section 100 (5) AktG.
"For details see the chapter Targets for composition and qualification requirements 
of the Supervisory Board."
"The targets 
include qualification requirements as well as diversity targets."
"Furthermore, 
members shall have sufficient time, as well as the personal integrity and suita-
bility of character, to exercise their office."
"In addition, more than half the 
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be independent."
"The targets, including the qualification requirements, are reviewed by the Su-
pervisory Board regularly, at least annually, and modified as necessary."
"The 
status of implementation can be seen in the qualification matrix at the end of 
this statement."
"In the reporting year, the Supervisory Board reviewed the specific targets at the 
recommendation of the Nomination Committee and refined them, so that the 
competences “Strategy” and “Sustainability” are shown separately in the quali-
fication matrix from this reporting year onwards."
"In this way, the Supervisory 
Board has made the qualification matrix even more transparent, and in partic-
ular it also shows in which ESG areas the respective Supervisory Board mem-
bers have sustainability experience."
"The Supervisory Board, supported by the 
Nomination Committee, also examined the targets for the overall board and for 
the individual members and confirmed that they had been met."
"Qualification requirements 
Given their knowledge, skills and professional experience, members of the  
Supervisory Board shall have the ability to perform the duties of a supervisory 
board member in a company with international business activities."
"The Super-
visory Board has determined necessary basic competencies and particular 
competencies."
"The particular competences are derived from the business 
model, the corporate targets, as well as from specific regulations applicable to 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"The requirements of the German Stock 
Corporation Act and the GCGC for professional knowledge of accounting and 
auditing in the Audit Committee are also met."
"Barbara Lambert, the Chair of 
the Audit Committee, has the necessary professional knowledge of both audit-
ing and accounting."
"The same applies to Michael Rüdiger, a member of the 
Audit Committee, who also has the necessary specialist knowledge of both au-
diting and accounting."
"Barbara Lambert studied economics in Switzerland, where she also obtained 
her diploma as an auditor."
"As an active auditor of financial statements and 
banks over many years, she can draw on extensive experience of conducting 
and managing audit activities, particularly in the financial sector."
"She contin-
ues to update her auditing knowledge on a regular basis to this day."
"In these functions, she regularly attends the training sessions of-
fered by the respective companies."
"Her membership of these 
associations and networks serves not only the professional exchange but also 
her further professional training."
"Her full curriculum vitae is available at 
www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > 
Supervisory Board > Barbara Lambert."
"Michael Rüdiger has a degree in business studies and specialised in finance 
and controlling."
"He has many years of experience in the finance industry and 
until 2019 was CEO of DekaBank Deutsche Girozentrale."
"In these 
functions he regularly attends the training sessions offered by the respective 
companies."
"Michael Rüdiger is a member of relevant networks, such as the 
German Audit Committee Chair Network of the Audit Committee Institute e.V., 
where he discusses professional issues and receives ongoing training."
"He also 
regularly attends individual training courses on aspects of auditing and ac-
counting, where he makes use of the expertise offered by large auditing firms."
"His full curriculum vitae is available at www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor 
Relations > Corporate Governance > Supervisory Board > Michael Rüdiger."
"The shareholder representatives on the Supervi-
sory Board therefore decided that at least half the shareholder representatives 
on the Supervisory Board shall be independent."
"Supervisory Board members 
are considered to be independent within the meaning of C.6 GCGC if they are 
independent of the company and its Executive Board and independent of any 
controlling shareholder."
"In particular, Supervisory Board members are no 
longer to be considered independent if they have a personal or business rela-
tionship with the company or its Executive Board that may cause a substantial 
(and not merely temporary) conflict of interest."
"According to recommendation 
C.7 GCGC, more than half the shareholder representatives shall be independ-
ent of the company and the Executive Board."
"In the opinion of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, all 
of them are independent."
"Diversity concept for the Executive Board and the  
Supervisory Board 
The diversity concept for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, as 
adopted by the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 289f (2) no."
"6 
HGB, has the objective of ensuring a wide range of perspectives and experi-
ence through the composition of both bodies."
"The concept is implemented 
within the scope of selecting and appointing new Executive Board members or 
regarding proposals for election of new Supervisory Board members."
"Flexible age limit and term of office 
The Supervisory Board considers the flexible age limit stipulated in its bylaws 
(generally 70 years) when nominating candidates for election by the Annual 
General Meeting."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board’s bylaws provide for a 
general limitation to members’ maximum term of office to twelve years, which 
the Supervisory Board shall also consider in its nominations of candidates to 
the Annual General Meeting."
"The flexible age limit for members of the Executive Board provides for the term 
of office to expire at the end of the month during which a member reaches the 
age of 60 years."
"An Executive Board member may be reappointed for one year 
at a time from the month in which they reach the age of 60."
"The last period of 
office should, nevertheless, end at the close of the month in which the Execu-
tive Board member turns 65."
"When appointing members of the Executive 
Board, the Supervisory Board pursues the objective of achieving an optimal 
composition of the Executive Board from the company’s perspective."
"In this 
context, experience and industry knowledge, as well as professional and per-
sonal qualifications, play a major role."
"Depending on the Executive Board posi-
tion to be filled, it is not just the scope and depth of skills that is decisive, but 
also whether the specific skills are up to date."
"The flexible age limit has been 
deliberately worded to preserve the Supervisory Board’s flexibility in taking de-
cisions on appointments."
"At present, no Executive Board member has passed the age limit of 65 years."
"Theodor Weimer’s term of office as Chairman of Deutsche Börse AG’s Execu-
tive Board runs until 31 December 2024."
"Theodor Weimer will reach the age 
of 65 in 2024."
"Gregor Pottmeyer’s term of office as CFO of Deutsche Börse AG 
runs until 30 September 2025."
"Gregor Pottmeyer will reach the age of 63 in 
2025."
"Share of women holding management positions 
Deutsche Börse Group is an international company."
"Working at our company 
means collaborating with colleagues across over 56 locations from 131 na-
tions."
"We are proud of the diverse cultural, professional and personal back-
grounds of our colleagues around the globe."
"We are committed to maintaining, 
supporting and fostering the diverse and inclusive culture of Deutsche Börse 
AG across all diversity dimensions."
"Regulations require us to consider one aspect of this diversity in particular de-
tail in this report: the share of women holding management positions."
"Deutsche Börse AG meets the statutory requirements for the proportion of 
women on the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"This applies partic-
ularly to the diversity requirements for the Executive Board that have been in 
force since 2021."
"Some 37.5 per cent of the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory 
Board are women and the Supervisory Board is determined to further increase 
this share."
"The Supervisory Board is also determined to increase the proportion of women 
on the Executive Board, taking the current appointments into consideration."
"Currently, there is one female member on the board."
Future personnel decisions will take this into account.
"In detail: with regard to the Supervisory Board, the legally binding gender 
quota of 30 per cent in accordance with section 96 (2) AktG applies."
"Thus, the minimum quota of 30 per cent is to be com-
plied with for each gender both with regard to the shareholder representatives 
and to the employee representatives."
"Based on the statutory calculation 
method, this means that at least two women and two men from both the 
shareholder representatives and the employee representatives must be on the 
Supervisory Board."
"There are currently six women on the Supervisory Board: 
three women among the shareholder representatives and three women among 
the employee representatives."
The statutory gender quota is therefore fulfilled.
"A statutory minimum quota for the Executive Board was introduced in the Act 
to Extend and Amend the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in 
Management Positions in the Private and Public Sectors (FüPoG II) of 10 June 
2021."
"Executive Boards of listed companies with more than three members 
must include at least one woman and one man (section 76 (3a) AktG)."
"This 
statutory minimum participation requirement replaces the obligation of compa-
nies to set a legally non-binding target quota."
"Deutsche Börse AG meets these 
statutory requirements and reports on them in accordance with section 289f 
(2) No."
"With Dr Andreas Gottschling, Shannon 
A."
"Johnston, Barbara Lambert, Charles Stonehill, Clara-Christina Streit and 
Chong Lee Tan, there are six shareholder representatives on the Supervisory 
Board who are not, or not exclusively, German citizens."
"In addition, many of 
the members of the Supervisory Board have long-term professional experience 
in the international field or are working abroad on a permanent basis."
"The Su-
pervisory Board will therefore continue to meet the objectives concerning its 
international composition."
"The same applies to the Executive Board, where Stephan Leithner holds non-
German citizenship, and whose members have gained long-standing interna-
tional working experience as well."
"Educational and professional background 
The Supervisory Board has set itself the objective of considering an appropriate 
range of educational and professional backgrounds regarding its own composi-
tion, as well as regarding the composition of the Executive Board."
"In addition 
to possessing professional experience in the financial services industry, mem-
bers of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board also have a profes-
sional background in consultancy, the IT sector, auditing, administration and 
regulation."
"In terms of professional education, most members have business, 
economics or legal degrees, in addition to backgrounds in IT, engineering and 
other areas."
"Education and professional experience thus also contribute to ful-
filling the previously mentioned qualification requirements for Supervisory 
Board members."
"The composition of both Deutsche Börse AG’s Supervisory Board and Execu-
tive Board is in line with the objectives stated above."
"The following qualification matrix provides an overview of how the main tar-
gets for the composition of the Supervisory Board are met, and of the extent to 
which the particular competencies defined in the qualification requirements 
are present."
"For further information con-
cerning the members of the Executive Board, please see www.deutsche-bo-
erse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Governance > Executive Board."
"In addition to the basic knowledge of sustainability topics acquired partly from 
training sessions for the whole Supervisory Board, 8 of the 16 Supervisory 
Board members have more in-depth experience and knowledge of sustainabil-
ity-related topics."
"Martin Jetter 
Markus Beck 
Nadine Brandl 
Achim Karle 
Barbara Lambert 
Michael Rüdiger 
Charles Stonehill 
Clara-C."
"Michael 
Rüdiger has decided not to stand again for election to the Supervisory Board."
"In a resolution dated 6 February 2024, the shareholder representatives on the 
Nomination Committee proposed eight candidates for election as shareholder 
representatives by the Annual General Meeting."
"Seven of the eight proposed 
candidates are currently Supervisory Board members; one candidate has not 
been a member to date."
"The targets for the composition of the Supervisory 
Board and the qualification requirements were taken into account when select-
ing this candidate."
"To this end, the shareholder representatives on the 
Nomination Committee began by drawing up a long list of suitable individuals."
"After interviewing the candidates on the long list, the shareholder representa-
tives on the Nomination Committee agreed on a new candidate for the Super-
visory Board elections in 2024."
"Information about all the candidates, including 
their CVs, will be sent with the invitation to the Annual General Meeting of 
Deutsche Börse AG to be held on 14 May 2024, and can also be viewed be-
fore the Annual General Meeting at www.deutsche-boerse.com/agm."
"Deutsche Börse AG follows recommen-
dation D.11 GCGC and the guidelines of the European Securities and Markets 
Authority (ESMA) on management bodies of market operators and data report-
ing services providers, and supports Supervisory Board members in this en-
deavour."
"For example, it organises targeted introductory events for new Super-
visory Board members and workshops on selected strategy, sustainability and 
current issues or on topics of fundamental importance."
"In addition to a specific 
workshop on the Horizon 2026 strategy process, two technology workshops 
on artificial intelligence and cybersecurity were held in the reporting year."
"An-
other two workshops were held on sustainability topics, which dealt with sus-
tainability regulation and the future world of work in sectors relevant to 
Deutsche Börse AG."
"One workshop took place on the role of Deutsche Börse 
Group in the capital markets."
"Deutsche Börse AG covers the costs of work-
shops and basic training organised by itself for new Supervisory Board mem-
bers."
"They also comprise training events from the Qualified Supervisory Board 
educational programme that the company designed itself."
"Deutsche Börse AG 
also covers the costs of third-party training activities in individual cases."
"Fur-
ther information about the Supervisory Board workshops can be found in the 
Report of the Supervisory Board."
"Examination of the effectiveness of  
Supervisory Board work 
Deutsche Börse AG regards regular reviews of the effectiveness of Supervisory 
Board work – in accordance with recommendation D.12 GCGC – as a key 
component of good corporate governance."
"The annual effectiveness review is 
supported by an external service provider every third year, most recently in 
2022."
"In addition, topics relating to the discussion and working cul-
ture and how current matters are dealt with by the Supervisory Board were ad-
dressed."
"The review yielded positive results, both in terms of overall effective-
ness as well as regarding the audited subject areas."
"The Supervisory Board 
discussed the suggestions for improvement that were made, such as giving 
greater weight to the perspectives of external stakeholders of Deutsche Börse 
Group and developing the opportunities for exchange within the Supervisory 
Board, and initiated steps to implement them."
"Long-term succession planning for the Executive Board 
Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board ensures that long-
term succession planning takes place."
"For this purpose the Supervisory Board, 
or its Nomination Committee, regularly – at least once a year – concerns itself 
with potential candidates for the Executive Board."
"The Chair of the Executive 
Board is involved in these considerations, provided that the discussions do not 
refer to their own succession."
"The Supervisory Board prepares an applicant 
profile for vacant Executive Board positions."
"It takes care to ensure that the 
knowledge, expertise and experience of all Executive Board members is diverse 
and well balanced and adheres to the adopted diversity concept."
"Moreover, the 
Supervisory Board ensures it is informed regularly about the succession plan-
ning at the first level beneath the Executive Board, and provides advice to the 
Executive Board in this regard."
"By 31 De-
cember 2023, the proportion of women holding positions in the first and sec-
ond management levels beneath the Executive Board was planned to reach 15 
per cent and 27 per cent, respectively."
"As of 31 December 2023, the share of 
women holding positions on the first and second management levels beneath 
the Executive Board at Deutsche Börse AG in Germany was 15 per cent and 
24 per cent, respectively."
"Changes at the second management level had an impact on the number of fe-
male executives and the achievement of the target percentage at this level."
"The Deutsche Börse Group is highly international, which means that for the 
development of female managers and appointments to management positions 
the consideration of a cross-company and cross-country perspective plays an 
important role."
"In fact, this voluntary commitment went further than the statu-
tory obligation."
"Firstly, the target figures determined in this context relate to 
Deutsche Börse Group worldwide."
"Secondly, the definition of management lev-
els/positions was expanded to include heads of teams, for example."
"On a 
global level, as at 31 December 2023, these quotas stood at 23 per cent for 
upper management levels and 33 per cent for lower management positions."
"Shareholder representation, transparent reporting and 
communication 
Shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)."
"Among other things, the AGM elects the shareholder representatives to the Su-
pervisory Board and decides on formal approval for the actions of the Execu-
tive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"Ordinary AGMs – at which the Executive 
Board and the Supervisory Board give an account for the past financial year – 
take place once a year."
"In the spirit of good corporate governance, Deutsche Börse AG aims to make it 
as easy as possible for shareholders to exercise their shareholder rights and ex-
change views directly with one another."
"For instance, Deutsche Börse AG shareholders may follow the AGM live over 
the internet and can be represented at the AGM by proxies nominated by 
Deutsche Börse AG, also by means of electronic communication."
"The proxies 
exercise voting rights solely in accordance with shareholders’ instructions and 
can also be reached during the AGM."
"There is also a postal voting option, 
which includes electronic communication."
"When casting their vote, the share-
holders have the choice of approving individual agenda items, rejecting them 
or abstaining."
"A more in-depth discussion takes place particularly if the results are not 
within the range expected by the Supervisory Board, so for example if the vot-
ing differs significantly from that of comparable companies on fundamentally 
comparable topics."
"This was not the case in the reporting year for the resolu-
tions taken at the AGM, including the temporary authorisation to hold virtual 
AGMs."
"Section 118a (1) AktG establishes that a company’s articles of incorporations 
may stipulate that the Annual General Meeting is to be held online, without 
the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies, or may authorise the Ex-
ecutive Board to adopt the corresponding resolutions."
"In the reporting year the Executive Board decided, with the approval of the Su-
pervisory Board, on the basis of the transitional provisions of section 26n (1) 
of the Introductory Act to AktG that the AGM should take place online, without 
the physical presence of shareholders or their proxies."
"Shareholders were able 
to follow the entire Annual General Meeting live online and exercise their vot-
ing rights, also via electronic communications, by means of postal voting or 
appointing the company proxies."
"They also had the opportunity to exercise 
their rights to speak and obtain information during the AGM by means of a 
video link, and to submit comments beforehand."
"Additionally, the company 
voluntarily published the speeches by the Chairs of the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board ahead of the Annual General Meeting."
"In the reporting year, the AGM of Deutsche Börse AG also decided to amend 
the company’s articles of incorporation and authorise the Executive Board for a 
limited period of two years to hold the AGM virtually, without the physical 
presence of shareholders or their proxies."
"For future AGMs, a decision will be 
taken individually, and taking the particular circumstances as well as the inter-
ests of the company and its shareholders into account, as to whether the AGM 
should be held virtually, and use made of the authorisation."
"Past experience, 
as well as the time and expense involved, may also be taken into 
consideration."
"The Executive Board decided on this basis to hold the AGM vir-
tually again in 2024."
"The company currently intends to structure future virtual AGMs in a similar 
way to the ordinary Annual General Meeting in the reporting year."
"In particu-
lar, it intends to refrain from accepting and answering questions ahead of the 
AGM."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members will attend the venue in 
person for the virtual AGM 2024."
"To maximise transparency and ensure equal access to information, Deutsche 
Börse AG’s corporate communications generally follow the rule that all target 
groups should receive all relevant information simultaneously."
"Deutsche Börse 
AG’s financial calendar informs shareholders, analysts, shareholders’ associa-
tions, the media and interested members of the public of key events such as 
the date of the AGM, or publication dates for financial performance indicators."
"Ad hoc disclosures, information on directors’ dealings and voting rights notifi-
cations, corporate reports and interim reports, and company news can all be 
found on Deutsche Börse’s website www.deutsche-boerse.com."
"Deutsche 
Börse AG provides information about its annual and consolidated financial 
statements as well as interim reports in conference calls for analysts and in-
vestors."
"Furthermore, a regular investor day is held and Deutsche Börse con-
tinuously outlines its strategy and business developments to everyone who is 
interested, abiding by the principle that all target groups worldwide must be 
informed at the same time."
"Additional information is pub-
lished in its half-yearly financial report and two quarterly statements."
"Following preparations by the Audit Committee, the annual and consol-
idated financial statements are discussed by the entire Supervisory Board and 
with the external auditors, examined and then approved."
"The Executive Board 
discusses the half-yearly report and the quarterly statements for the first and 
third quarters with the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee prior to their pub-
lication."
The half-yearly financial report is reviewed by the external auditors.
"PwC was also 
engaged to perform a review of the form and contents of the remuneration re-
port during the 2023 financial year."
"The auditors responsible are Marc Billeb 
and Michael Rönnberg."
"They have both been responsible for the audit since 
2021."
"The Supervisory Board’s proposal was based on a corresponding rec-
ommendation by the Audit Committee, which had obtained the necessary 
statement of independence from PwC before the election."
"The Audit Committee 
checked that this continued to be the case during the reporting period."
"It also 
oversaw the financial reporting process in 2023."
"The Supervisory Board was 
informed in a timely manner of the committee’s work and the insights gained; 
there were no material findings."
"Information on audit services and fees is pro-
vided in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements."
They are the underlying basis for the notes that follow.
"Business and operating environment 
Business model and general position of the company 
Deutsche Börse AG is the parent company of Deutsche Börse Group."
"The par-
ent company’s business activities include, first and foremost, the cash and de-
rivatives markets, which are reflected in the Trading & Clearing segment."
"Deutsche Börse AG also operates essential parts of the Group’s information 
technology."
"The performance of the Securities Services segment (formerly 
Clearstream) is primarily reflected in Deutsche Börse AG’s business perfor-
mance via the profit and loss transfer agreement with Clearstream Holding AG."
"The business and the operating environment of Deutsche Börse AG are largely 
the same as for the Group."
"They are described in the section “Macroeconomic 
and sector-specific environment”."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s course of business in the reporting period 
Deutsche Börse AG’s sales revenue increased by 3.0 per cent in the 2023 fi-
nancial year, which was in line with the company’s expectations."
"By contrast, 
total costs (staff costs, amortisation of intangible assets and depreciation of 
property, plant and equipment and other operating expenses) rose by 6.7 per 
cent."
"EBITDA was €2.7 billion in the 2023 financial year and so was signifi-
cantly above the forecast for the 2023 financial year of €1.4 billion."
"Net profit 
was up by 142.1 per cent compared with the previous year."
"The financial year 
was mainly defined by the ongoing geopolitical situation and the resulting mar-
ket risks, rising inflation and interest rate increases by the central banks."
"Vola-
tility on stock markets was lower overall than in the previous year, however."
"The increase in net income is primarily due to non-recurring effects within the 
result from equity investments."
"This stems partly from the fact that for the first 
time profits were recognised at Clearstream Holding AG in the period in which 
they originated, and partly from reorganisation of Deutsche Börse AG’s share-
holdings."
"On the basis of these developments, the Executive Board of 
Deutsche Börse AG considers its performance in 2023 to be positive in con-
text."
"This is 
largely due to an increase in sales revenue of €22.9 million in the Trading & 
Clearing Segment."
"For more information on the development of the Trading & 
Clearing segment, please refer to the “Trading & Clearing segment” section."
The other segments mainly relate to the provision of central functions.
"By con-
trast, these segments have a material impact on the company’s investment in-
come."
"The breakdown of income by the company’s individual segments is 
shown in the table “Sales revenue by segment”."
The company’s total costs were up 6.7 per cent year on year.
"For a break-
down, please refer to the table “Overview of total costs”."
"Staff costs rose by 
16.2 per cent year on year during the year under review, to €341.4 million."
"The increase in staff costs is mainly due to the larger number of employees fol-
lowing the opening of new offices in Czech Republic and Ireland."
"Amortisation 
of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment in-
creased by 0.4 per cent in the year under review."
"Other operating expenses 
were up 4.0 per cent year on year."
"This stems from the opening of new offices 
and general price increases."
"The result of equity investments at Deutsche Börse AG rose year on year by 
236.5 per cent in 2023."
"It consisted partly of dividend income of €261.7 mil-
lion (2022: €161.6 million) and income from the transfer of profits of 
€1,474.1 million (2022: €412.2 million)."
"The higher income from profit 
transfers is due to the fact that for the first time profits were recognised in the 
year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Holding AG and its 
net income for the year increased as a result."
"An internal reorganisation within 
Deutsche Börse Group, which included the contribution and the sale of the in-
vestment in ISS HoldCo Inc."
"to ISS STOXX GmbH and the transfer of the in-
vestment in Axioma Inc."
"to SimCorp A/S as a capital contribution, resulted in 
an overall positive effect of €26.8 million in financial year 2023."
"Impairment 
losses of €35.9 million were recognised on financial assets, along with write-
ups of €37.3 million."
"Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) went 
up by 122.1 per cent due to the effects mentioned above."
"Net income for the 
period amounted to €2,118.4 million, an increase of 142.1 per cent."
"Return on equity rose from 21.9 per cent in 2022 to 49.1 per cent in the year 
under review."
"The increase is particularly due to the one-off effect of recognis-
ing profits in the year in which they originated at the level of Clearstream Hold-
ing AG for the first time."
"Financial position of Deutsche Börse AG 
As at 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to  
€150.4 million (2022: €442.0 million)."
"This includes balances on current ac-
counts, fixed-term deposits and other short-term investments, whereby the ma-
jority is held in cash."
"Deutsche Börse AG has external credit lines available of €600.0 million 
(2022: €600.0 million), which were unused as at 31 December 2023."
"More-
over, the company has a commercial paper programme in place, which allows 
for flexible and short-term financings of up to €2.5 billion, in various curren-
cies."
"Commercial paper with a nominal value of €590.0 million (2022:  
€60.0 million) was in circulation at year-end."
"Through a Group-wide cash-pooling system, Deutsche Börse AG ensures an 
optimum allocation of liquidity throughout Deutsche Börse Group; in this way, 
the parent entity makes sure that all subsidiaries are in a position to honour 
their payment obligations at all times."
"Deutsche Börse AG has issued ten corporate loans with a total nominal vol-
ume of €6.8 billion."
"For more details concerning these bonds, please refer to 
the “Financial position” section."
"In the 2023 financial year, Deutsche Börse AG generated cash flow from oper-
ating activities of €832.1 million (2022: €1,209.4 million)."
"Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €–3,819.5 million (2022:  
€–392.5 million)."
"The change is primarily due to the acquisition costs of  
€3.9 billion for SimCorp A/S."
"A dividend of €661.5 million was paid 
for the 2022 financial year."
"Bonds were issued for a total of €3 billion to fi-
nance the acquisition of SimCorp A/S."
"Commercial papers were also issued in 
the reporting year with a nominal value of €530.0 million."
"Cash and cash 
equivalents amounted to €–866.1 million as at the reporting date 31 Decem-
ber 2023 (2022: €–756.5 million)."
"It is made up of liquid funds of €150.4 
million (2022: €442.0 million), less cash-pooling liabilities of €1,016.6 mil-
lion (2022: €1,198.5 million)."
"At €12,522.3 mil-
lion, most of the non-current assets consisted of shares in affiliated companies 
(2022: €8,024.7 million)."
"The increase in financial year 2023 is primarily 
due to the acquisition of SimCorp A/S for €3.9 billion."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s investments in intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment totalled €37.6 million during the year under review (2022: €128.2 
million) and were thus lower than in the previous year."
"Depreciation and 
amortisation in 2023 amounted to €73.9 million (2022: €73.6 million)."
"1 Employees do not include the company’s legal representatives, apprentices and employees on parental leave."
"Receivables from and liabilities to affiliated companies include invoices for in-
tra-Group services and amounts invested by Deutsche Börse AG within the 
scope of cash-pooling arrangements."
"The receivables from affiliated companies 
relate to invoices for intra-Group services, but primarily to Clearstream Holding 
AG for the company’s profit transfer of €1,474.1 million."
"Liabilities to affiliated 
companies resulted mainly from cash-pooling amounting to €1,025.0 million 
(2022: €1,199.6 million) and trade liabilities of €80.8 million (2022: €84.8 
million)."
"Concerning the change in treasury shares we refer to the more detailed com-
ments in the notes to the financial statements of Deutsche Börse AG in accord-
ance with Section 315 (2) sentence 2 HGB."
"Deutsche Börse AG employees 
The number of employees (as defined by HGB)1 at Deutsche Börse AG rose by 
860 in the reporting year and totalled 2,570 as at 31 December 2023 (31 
December 2022: 1,710)."
"The average number of employees at Deutsche 
Börse AG in the 2023 financial year was 2,158 (2022: 1,701)."
Deutsche Börse AG has employees at eight locations around the world.
"Two

staff turnover rate of 6 per cent."
"Deutsche Börse AG employees are 41 years 
old on average and have been with the company for an average of 8 years."
"Corporate governance statement in accordance with 
section 289f HGB 
The corporate governance statement in accordance with section 289f HGB is 
the same as that for Deutsche Börse Group."
"Reference is therefore made to the 
section “Corporate governance statement”."
"Opportunities and risks facing Deutsche Börse AG 
The opportunities and risks of Deutsche Börse AG and the activities and pro-
cesses to manage these are largely the same as for Deutsche Börse Group, so 
reference is made to the “Risk report” and the “Report on opportunities”."
"As a 
rule, Deutsche Börse AG shares the opportunities and risks of its equity invest-
ments and subsidiaries in accordance with its equity interest."
"Risks that could 
potentially threaten the existence of the Eurex Clearing AG subsidiary would 
also have a direct influence on Deutsche Börse AG based on a letter of comfort 
issued by Deutsche Börse AG."
"As at the reporting date, there were no risks 
jeopardising the company’s existence."
"Further information on the letter of 
comfort issued to Eurex Clearing AG is available in the section Other financial 
obligations and off-balance sheet transactions in the notes to the annual finan-
cial statements of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The description of the internal control 
system (ICS), required by section 289 (4) HGB, is provided in the Risk report 
section."
"Report on expected developments for  
Deutsche Börse AG 
The expected developments in Deutsche Börse AG’s business are largely sub-
ject to the same factors as those influencing Deutsche Börse Group."
"However, 
the revenue of Deutsche Börse AG is largely determined by the Trading & 
Clearing segment, whereby this is mostly generated via Eurex Frankfurt AG 
(EFAG) and Eurex Clearing AG (ECAG) in the form of revenue transfers (opera-
tional management structure)."
"Additional factors affecting future earnings at Deutsche Börse AG are the in-
vestment income from affiliated companies and income from profit transfer 
agreements."
"Deutsche Börse AG expects sales of more than €1.7 billion and EBITDA of 
more than €1.6 billion for 2024."
"Further comments on Deutsche Börse AG can be found in the “Report on ex-
pected developments"" section."
"There are no other classes of shares besides these or-
dinary shares."
"The share capital has been contingently increased by up to €17.8 million by 
issuing up to 17.8 million no-par value registered shares (contingent capital 
2019)."
"More details can be found in Arti-
cle 4 (7) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The Executive Board is only aware of those restrictions on voting rights that 
arise from Aktiengesetz (AktG, German Stock Corporation Act)."
"Those shares 
affected by section 136 AktG are therefore excluded from voting rights."
"Fur-
thermore, shares held by Deutsche Börse AG as treasury shares are exempted 
from the exercise of any rights according to section 71b AktG."
"The lowest 
threshold for this disclosure requirement is 3 per cent."
"Deutsche Börse AG is 
not aware of any direct or indirect equity interests in its capital exceeding 
10 per cent of the voting rights."
There are no shares with special provisions granting the holder control rights.
"Employees holding shares in Deutsche Börse AG exercise their rights in the 
same way as other shareholders in accordance with the statutory provisions 
and the Articles of Association."
"Members of the Executive Board are appointed and dismissed in accordance 
with sections 84 and 85 AktG and with Article 6 of the Articles of Association 
of Deutsche Börse AG."
"Amendments to the Articles of Association of Deutsche 
Börse AG are adopted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting in accord-
ance with section 119 (1) No."
"Under Article 12 (4) of the Articles of 
Association of Deutsche Börse AG, the Supervisory Board has the power to 
make changes to the Articles of Association that relate to the wording only."
"In 
accordance with Article 18 (1) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse 
AG, resolutions of the Annual General Meeting are passed by a simple majority 
of the votes cast, unless otherwise required by the Aktiengesetz."
"Insofar as 
AktG additionally prescribes a majority of the share capital represented at the 
time of a resolution, a simple majority of the share capital represented is suffi-
cient where this is legally permissible."
Shareholders must be granted pre-emptive rights.
"How-
ever, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board may 
exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights with respect to fractional amounts."
"However, according to the authorisation, the Executive Board may only ex-
clude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights if the total number of shares that are is-
sued during the term of authorisation and that exclude shareholders’ pre-emp-
tive rights does not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital."
"Full authorisation, 
and particularly the conditions under which shareholders’ pre-emptive rights 
can be excluded, is derived from Article 4 (3) of the Articles of Association of 
Deutsche Börse AG."
"Shareholders must be granted pre-emptive rights, which the Execu-
tive Board can exclude in certain cases, subject to the approval of the Supervi-
sory Board in each case."
"However, ac-
cording to the authorisation, the Executive Board may only exclude sharehold-
ers’ pre-emptive rights if the total number of shares that are issued during the 
term of authorisation and that exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights does 
not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital."
"Full authorisation, and particularly 
the conditions under which shareholders’ pre-emptive rights can be excluded, 
is derived from Article 4 (4) of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse 
AG."
"Shareholders must be granted pre-emptive rights, which the Execu-
tive Board can exclude, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, only 
for fractional amounts."
"However, according to the authorisation, the Executive 
Board may only exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights if the total number of 
shares that are issued during the term of authorisation and that exclude share-
holders’ pre-emptive rights does not exceed 10 per cent of the share capital."
"The exact content of this authorisation is derived from Article 4 (5) of the Arti-
cles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG."
"Shareholders must be granted pre-emptive rights un-
less the Executive Board makes use of the authorisation granted to it to ex-
clude such rights, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board."
"The Execu-
tive Board is authorised to exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights for frac-
tional amounts with the approval of the Supervisory Board."
"According to the 
authorisation, the Executive Board may only exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive 
rights if the total number of shares that are issued during the term of authori-
sation and that exclude shareholders’ pre-emptive rights does not exceed 10 
per cent of the share capital."
"The full authorisation is derived from Article 4 (6) 
of the Articles of Association of Deutsche Börse AG."
"However, the acquired shares, together with any 
treasury shares acquired for other reasons that are held by the company or at-
tributed to it in accordance with sections 71a et seq."
"AktG, may at no time ex-
ceed 10 per cent of the company’s share capital."
"The authorisation to acquire 
treasury shares is valid until 7 May 2024 and may be exercised by the com-
pany in full or in part on one or more occasions."
"However, it may also be exer-
cised by dependent companies, by companies in which Deutsche Börse AG 
holds a majority interest or by third parties on its or their behalf."
"The full and exact wording of the authorisation to acquire treasury 
shares, and particularly the permissible uses to which the shares may be put, 
can be found in items 6 and 7 of the agenda for the Annual General Meeting 
held on 8 May 2019."
"The following material agreements of the company are subject to a change-of-
control clause following a takeover bid: 
 On 21 March 2023, Deutsche Börse AG and its subsidiary Clearstream 
Banking S.A."
"entered into a facility agreement with a banking syndicate for a 
working capital credit totalling up to €750.0 million."
"If there is a change of 
control, the credit relationship between Deutsche Börse AG and the lenders 
can be reviewed in negotiations within a period of no more than 60 days."
"In 
this process, each lender has the right, at its own discretion, to terminate its 
credit commitment and demand partial or full repayment of the amounts ow-
ing to it."
"A change of control occurs if Deutsche Börse AG no longer directly 
or indirectly holds the majority of Clearstream Banking S.A."
"or if a person or 
a group of persons acting in concert acquires more than 50 per cent of the 
voting shares of Deutsche Börse AG."
"If Deutsche Börse AG does not 
exercise this termination right, the affected bonds’ coupon will increase by an 
additional 500 basis points per annum."
"In addition, the relevant bond terms require that 
the change of control must adversely affect the long-term rating given to 
Deutsche Börse AG by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., S&P Global Ratings 
or Fitch Ratings Limited."
"Further details can be found in the applicable bond 
terms."
"If these termination rights are exercised, the bonds are repayable 
at par plus any accrued interest."
"In addition, the respective bond terms require that the change of 
control must adversely affect the rating given to one of the preferential unse-
cured debt instruments of Deutsche Börse AG by Moody’s Investors Services, 
Inc., S&P Global Ratings or Fitch Ratings Limited."
"Further details can be 
found in the applicable bond terms."

and services along the value chain of financial market transactions."
"Their offer-
ing ranges from portfolio management software, analytics solutions, the ESG 
business and index development, via services for trading, clearing and settling

cation of international accounting standards."
"The disclosures required in accordance with Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB, Ger-
man Commercial Code) section 315e (1) have been presented in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"The consolidated income statement is structured using the nature of expense 
method."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
euros, the functional currency of Deutsche Börse AG."
"Unless stated otherwise, 
all amounts are shown in millions of euros (€m)."
"Due to rounding, actual 
amounts may differ from unrounded or disclosed figures."
"Information about capital management, which is also part of these consoli-
dated financial statements, is included in the chapter Regulatory capital re-
quirements and regulatory capital ratios in the Risk report section in the com-
bined management report."
"All accounting policies, estimates, measurement uncertainties, and discretion-
ary judgements referring to specific subject matter are described in the corre-
sponding note."
"Such disclosures are focused on applicable accounting options 
under IFRS."
"Deutsche Börse Group does not present the underlying published 
IFRS guidelines, unless this is considered crucial to enhance transparency."
"The annual financial statements of subsidiaries included in the consolidated fi-
nancial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Group-wide ac-
counting policies based on IFRS that are described in the following."
"They were 
applied consistently to the periods shown."
"Assets and liabilities and items in the consolidated statement of comprehen-
sive income and any mandatory disclosures are listed separately if they are 
material."
"We define as material a proportion of around 10 per cent of the rele-
vant total."
"New accounting standards – implemented in the year under review 
All the mandatory standards and applications endorsed by the European Com-
mission were applied by us in the reporting year 2023."
"They were not applied 
earlier than required."
"These amendments have 
no material effect on the Group’s financial performance or financial position."
"The 
amendment makes it clear that the non-recognition of deferred taxes when an 
asset or liability is recognised for the first time outside a business combination 
does not apply to these transactions."
"IAS 12 Pillar II Model Rules 
In October 2021, more than 135 countries agreed to introduce a global mini-
mum tax rate for multinational groups with consolidated annual sales of at 
least €750 million as part of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Ero-
sion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)."
"The reform project known as Pillar II Model 
Rules pursues the goal of ensuring effective minimum taxation of profits of af-
fected multinational corporations at 15 per cent per jurisdiction."
"The aim is to 
limit international tax competition and ensure fair and appropriate taxation."
"The Pillar II Model Rules were published by the OECD in December 2021 and 
on 12 December 2022 the EU member states agreed on a directive for the ef-
fective minimum taxation of multinational corporations that has to be trans-
posed into national law by 31 December 2023."
"The German parliament 
passed the Minimum Taxation Directive - Transposition Act on 10 December 
2023 with effect for financial years starting on or after 01 January 2024; cor-
responding rules also apply in the great majority of jurisdictions outside the EU 
that are relevant for us."
"Since our subsidiaries and permanent establishments are predominantly domi-
ciled in jurisdictions whose nominal tax rate is above the minimum tax rate of 
15 per cent, we do not expect any material tax impact for 2024, the first year 
of application."
"The amendments to IAS 12 provide for a temporary exemption from the obliga-
tion to recognise deferred taxes in connection with the introduction of the 
global minimum tax rate."
"IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” 
The new accounting standard IFRS 17 (Insurance Contracts) was published in 
May 2017 and replaces the IFRS 4 standard."
"Generally speaking, the new 
standard is not only relevant to insurance companies, but to all entities that is-
sue insurance contracts within the scope of the standard."
"It is not relevant for 
accounting by the insured party, however."
"IFRS 17 aims for the consistent, 
rules-based accounting treatment of insurance contracts and provides for in-
surance liabilities to be measured at their current settlement value."
"Further-
more, the objective is to form a uniform basis regarding the recognition, meas-
urement and presentation of insurance contracts, including the notes."
"The 
standard is applicable in the EU for financial years beginning on or after 
1 January 2023 The standard was endorsed by the EU on 23 November 
2021."
"The revised version of IFRS 17 has no impact on the Group’s financial 
performance or financial position."
"New accounting standards – not yet implemented 
The IASB issued the following new or amended standards and interpretations, 
which were not applied in the consolidated financial statements, because en-
dorsement by the EU was still pending or the application was not mandatory."
"The new or amended standards and interpretations must be applied for finan-
cial years beginning on or after the respective effective date."
"Even though early 
application may be permitted for some standards, Deutsche Börse Group does 
not usually use any early application options."
"The 
IASB clarified that covenants that have to be met before or on the reporting 
date may have an effect on classification as current or non-current."
"Covenants 
that only have to be met after the reporting date do not affect the classification, 
however."
"Rather than being considered as part of the classification, any such 
covenants should be disclosed in the notes."
"This is intended to enable users of 
financial statements to judge whether non-current liabilities could become due 
within twelve months."
"These amendments have no material effect on the 
Group’s financial performance or financial position."
"Amendments to IFRS 16 concerning accounting by the seller-lessee for lia-
bilities under sale and leaseback transactions."
"The new examples explain various different procedures, particularly for varia-
ble lease payments."
"The amendments are applicable to financial years begin-
ning on or after 1 January 2024."
"The IASB permits the amendments to be ap-
plied earlier, subject to an EU endorsement."
"These amendments are not ex-
pected to have an impact on the Group’s financial performance or financial po-
sition."
"02 Consolidation principles 
Intra-Group assets and liabilities are eliminated."
"Income arising from intra-
Group transactions is netted against the corresponding expenses."
"Intercom-
pany profits or losses arising from deliveries of intra-Group goods and services, 
as well as dividends distributed within the Group, are eliminated."
"Deferred 
taxes for consolidation adjustments are recognised where these are expected to 
reverse in subsequent years."
"Interests in equity attributable to non-controlling shareholders are presented 
under “non-controlling interests” within equity."
"Where these are classified as 
“puttable instruments”, they are reported under “liabilities” at cost."
"Monetary balance sheet items in foreign 
currencies are measured at the exchange rate on the reporting date."
"Non-mon-
etary balance sheet items recognised at historical cost are measured at the ex-
change rate on the transaction date."
"By contrast, non-monetary balance sheet 
items measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at 
the valuation date."
"Exchange rate differences for monetary balance sheet items 
are recognised either as other operating income or expenses, or as the result of 
banking and similar business or as result from financial investments in the pe-
riod in which they arise, unless the underlying transactions are hedged."
"In the 
case of equity instruments designated at FVOCI, the exchange rate differences 
are recognised in other comprehensive income."
"Balance sheet items of entities whose functional currency is not the euro are 
translated into the reporting currency as follows: assets and liabilities are 
translated into euros at the spot rate and equity items at historical rates."
"The 
positions in the consolidated income statement are converted at average ex-
change rates for the reporting period."
"Resulting exchange differences are rec-
ognised directly in “revaluation surplus”."
"Resulting exchange differences are 
recognised without effect on profit or loss in the revaluation reserve."
"When the 
relevant subsidiary is sold, these exchange rate differences are recognised in 
the net profit for the period in which the deconsolidation gain or loss is real-
ised."
"Deutsche Börse AG controls a company if it is exposed to variable returns re-
sulting from its involvement with the company in question or has rights to 
such returns and is able to influence them by using its power over the com-
pany."
"Initial consolidation of subsidiaries in the course of business combinations 
uses the purchase method."
"The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities are recognised at their acquisition date fair values."
"Any 
excess of cost over the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the subsidiary’s 
net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill."
"Goodwill is reported in subse-
quent periods at cost less accumulated impairment losses."
"Non-controlling in-
terests are measured at the acquisition date by the corresponding proportion of 
the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity."
"Deutsche Börse AG’s equity interests in subsidiaries and associates included in 
the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 are presented 
in the list of shareholdings in note 34."
"Material acquisitions 
Acquisition of SimCorp A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp) 
On 22 September 2023 Deutsche Börse announced the final result of the pub-
lic takeover offer for SimCorp A/S , Copenhagen, Denmark (SimCorp)."
"Includ-
ing the shares bought directly on the market, Deutsche Börse held more than 
90 per cent of all SimCorp shares (not including treasury shares held by 
SimCorp)."
"After the successful completion of the public takeover on Friday, 29 September 
2023, Deutsche Börse AG exercised its right to acquire all the SimCorp shares 
from the remaining minority shareholders (Squeeze-out)."
"Since 31 October 
2023 Deutsche Börse AG holds 100 per cent of the outstanding shares in 
SimCorp."
"SimCorp and its subsidiaries have been fully consolidated in Deutsche Börse 
Group since 29 September 2023."
"The SimCorp business was allocated to the 
new Investment Management Solutions segment from the fourth quarter of 
2023 onwards, where the activities of the previous Data & Analytics segment 
are also reported."
"Initial consolidation of SimCorp in the consolidated financial statements took 
place using the purchase method."
"Significant revenue and cost synergies are 
expected from the transaction, which are reflected in the goodwill resulting 
from the transaction."
"The identifiable assets and liabilities of SimCorp are recognised at fair value on 
the acquisition date."
"Any excess of cost over the acquirer’s interest in the fair 
value of the subsidiary’s net identifiable assets is recognised as goodwill."
"Goodwill is reported in subsequent periods at cost less accumulated impair-
ment losses."
"The purchase price allocation was based on a preliminary basis, as it was not 
yet possible to make a final determination, particularly with regards to taxes 
and intangible assets."
"The full consolidation of SimCorp resulted in an increase in net revenues of 
€198.0 million as well as in an increase in profit after tax of €12.3 million."
"If the company had been consolidated as at 1 January 2023, this would have 
resulted in an increase in net revenues of €544.1 million as well as in an de-
crease of profit after tax of €– 69.3 million, including the financing costs."
"03 Adjustments 
As at 31 December 2023 Deutsche Börse Group made various changes in 
presentation and reclassifications in the consolidated statement of financial po-
sition and the consolidated statement of changes in equity."
"The published fig-
ures as at 31 December 2022 have been adjusted accordingly."
"These are 
purely changes in presentation, which had no effect on net income for the pe-
riod or total comprehensive income."
"We also brought the presentation 
within Group equity into line with the current market standard, in order to 
make the financial information more comparable."
"The presentation of certain 
liabilities from clearing transactions was also sharpened."
"Equity 
 The currency translation reserve previously reported as part of retained earn-
ings will henceforth be reported as part of the revaluation surplus."
"This re-
sulted in a reclassification to equity of €–145.5 million as at 1 January 
2022 and of €–352.1 million as at 31 December 2022."
"This resulted in a reclassification to equity of €–133.2 
million as at 1 January 2022 and of €–36.3 million as at 31 December 
2022."
" Shares granted as part of stock option programmes and settled in equity in-
struments were not presented uniformly within equity hitherto."
"Certain pro-
grammes were previously presented within retained earnings and will now be 
presented on a uniform basis in the revaluation surplus."
"This resulted in a 
retrospective reclassification of €–3.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of 
€–5.5 million as at 31 December 2022."
"Employee benefits 
We have introduced a new non-current and current balance sheet item, “Em-
ployee benefits” (see note 17) to pool pension obligations, other non-current 
employee benefits and non-current termination benefits."
"A reclassification from 
the previous item “Provisions for pensions and other employee benefits” of 
€149.0 million was made retrospectively as at 01 January 2022 and of 
€23.9 million as at 31 December 2022."
"Obligations from early retirement 
benefits, share-based payments and variable remuneration were also reclassi-
fied from other non-current provisions."
"This resulted in a retrospective reclassi-
fication of €14.8 million as at 01 January 2022 and of €95.9 million as at 
31 December 2022."
"€30.6 million as at 1 January 2022, and €38.0 million 
as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospectively from other 
current liabilities for holiday entitlements, flexitime and overtime credits to the 
new item “Current employee benefits”."
"€186.9 million as at 1 January 2022 
and €224.9 million as at 31 December 2022 was also reclassified retrospec-
tively from other current provisions for share-based payment, bonus and sever-
ance payments."
"Reclassification of clearing liabilities 
Liabilities in connection with the processing of clearing transactions that were 
settled in cash were previously presented in other current liabilities."
"This differ-
ence was identified in the course of the SAP S/4 HANA migration and they 
were reclassified to “Other financial liabilities at amortised cost”."
"This resulted 
in a reclassification of €74.2 million as at 1 January 2022 and of €15.1 mil-
lion as at 31 December 2022."
"The consolidated statement of financial position 
as at 31 December 2022 was restated accordingly."
"Reclassifications of financial assets and liabilities under sanctions 
In prior years, current financial assets and the corresponding current liabilities 
to which the Group had no access because of international sanctions were 
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position."
"The accounting 
treatment for these items was revised on the basis of a legal analysis."
"This re-
duced the financial assets and financial liabilities in the consolidated state-
ment of financial position by €188.0 million as at 1 January 2022 and by 
€203.8 million as at 31 December 2022."
"Revenue recognition 
This section comprises details on revenue from contracts with customers."
"They 
particularly include performance obligations and methods of revenue recogni-
tion."
"Revenue is measured on the basis of the consideration agreed in a cus-
tomer contract."
"The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over 
goods or services to the customer."
"For information on contract assets and lia-
bilities, see note 13."
"Sales revenue 
We report our sales revenue on the basis of our segment structure."
"The index offering ranges 
from blue-chip to benchmark to strategy to sustainability to smart-beta indices."
"The recognition of revenue for index licences is based on fixed payments, vari-
able payments (usage-based volumes; mostly assets under management) or a 
combination of the two."
"The customer simultaneously receives and consumes 
the benefits provided by the entity’s performance during the contract term."
Revenue is revised when warranted by the circumstances.
"Increases and de-
creases in estimated revenue are reflected in the consolidated income state-
ment in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision be-
come known by the management."
"For two fee components (minimum fee and 
usage-based fee), a contract liability is recognised and reduced each month 
based on the usage that has been recognised each month."
"Software solutions offers its clients risk-analytics and portfolio-construction 
tools."
Customers receive the right to use the intellectual property.
"The intellec-
tual property licences are granted for software products, which are subse-
quently referred to as “SaaS Front Office” and “SaaS Middle Office”(Software 
as a Service)."
"Revenue generated with SaaS Front Office fees is recognised at 
a specific point in time because all contractual obligations are fulfilled, and the 
customer obtains control of the asset as soon as the licence key is transferred 
to the customer."
"SaaS Middle Office fees are recognised over time, i.e."
"Fees are also charged for the maintenance and servicing 
(summarised as “Maintenance”) of the software products, which are realised 
over the contract term."
"Additional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating 
a contract."
"ESG’s product portfolio includes Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Gov-
ernance Solutions."
"Most of this revenue stems from fixed-term contracts and 
recurring services."
"Revenue is recognised on a pro rata basis over the term of 
the contracted services to customers."
"Fees are generally charged in advance, 
either before the licence starts or periodically over the term of the licence."
"Proxy voting services are provided at a specific point in time and revenue is 
recognised accordingly when the contractually agreed service is provided."
"Fees 
for exceeding the minimum volumes for proxy research and services in con-
nection with the exercise of voting rights are also variable consideration."
"Since 
neither the volume that will be used nor the price of these services can be de-
termined with reasonable certainty when the contract starts, the variable por-
tion of the consideration can only be recognised when the transaction price 
can be determined."
"Consideration is generally due 30 days after the invoice 
date."
"Upon commencement of the contract, there is an expectation that the 
period between providing the service and receiving the consideration from the 
client will be no more than one year, so there is no significant financing com-
ponent."
"For multi-year contracts, additional costs of obtaining a contract are 
capitalised."
"SimCorp primarily generates revenues in three categories: revenue from cus-
tomers that operate and service their SimCorp solution on their own servers 
(on-premise), revenues from SaaS solutions, and professional services."
"The 
on-premise revenues come from licence fees, software updates and support 
services."
"The SaaS revenues come from fees for SaaS licences and SaaS ser-
vices, which comprise services and software updates, operating services, in-
cluding Platform-as-a-Service/hosting fees, and BPaaS fees (business pro-
cesses as a service)."
"Generally speaking, licence fees may stem from subscrip-
tions or open-ended licensing agreements."
"Subscriptions entitle the customer 
to use the software for a particular period, whereas open-ended software li-
cences give the customer the right to use the software for as long as the con-
tract for software updates and support is in effect."
"Revenue from licences is 
recognised as soon as all the contractual obligations have been satisfied, i.e."
"the licence has been transferred to the customer and the customer has gained 
control over the software."
"Revenue for software updates and support is recog-
nised on a linear basis of the term of the contract."
"SaaS services, which in-
clude infrastructure services, operating services, digital portal services, invest-
ment accounting services, investment operational services, data management 
services and regulatory reporting platform services, are recognised over the 
term of the contract."
"Fees for professional services result primarily from imple-
mentation; revenues are recognised on the basis of work completed for time 
and service contracts."
"Fixed fee agreements are recognised on the basis of per-
centage of completion, unless the customer is obliged to take delivery."
"Addi-
tional costs are capitalised for multi-year contracts when initiating a contract."
"Revenue is also generated with clearing and settlement services for over-the-
counter (OTC) transactions."
"This mainly comes in the form of booking and 
management fees."
"Fees, as well as any reductions are specified in price lists 
and circulars."
"Rebates depend mainly on monthly volumes or the monthly ful-
filment of liquidity provisioning obligations in certain products or product 
groups."
"Revenue for transactions in listed derivatives is recognised as soon as con-
tracts are matched/registered and there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the 
customer."
"In the case of OTC transactions, posting fees are recognised at no-
vation on a monthly basis."
These fees are recognised at a point in time.
"Fees 
for the administration of financial derivative positions are recognised over time 
as the service is provided until the transaction has been closed, terminated or 
has matured."
"Commodities 
Its product portfolio comprises contracts on power, natural gas and emission 
allowances, as well as freight rates and agricultural products."
"Revenue is gen-
erated primarily from fees that are charged for exchange trading and clearing of 
commodities products."
Transaction fees are specified in the price list.
"Rebates 
are granted primarily in the form of monthly rebates for the provision of a cer-
tain volume or level of liquidity."
"These types of rebates are dependent upon 
the total monthly volume or the monthly fulfilment of certain liquidity provision 
obligations."
"Revenue for transactions is recognised as soon as contracts are 
matched/registered, i.e."
there is no unfulfilled obligation towards the customer.
"Cash equities 
Contracts for trading and clearing of cash market products in securities are ac-
counted for in the same way as described in the Financial derivatives section."
"As a general rule, securities intended for trading on the regulated market of 
Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange) are subject 
to the admission and listing, or inclusion, resolved by FWB’s Exchange Man-
agement."
"Deutsche Börse AG, as the operator of the public-sector exchange, 
charges fees for the admission, listing, inclusion and quotation of securities on 
the regulated market."
"Fees charged for the admission and inclusion of securi-
ties with definite maturities on the regulated market are realised using the pro-
jected useful lives of the underlying securities."
"Accordingly, the fees charged 
for the listing of securities on the regulated unofficial market are realised using 
the projected useful lives of the underlying securities."
"The method for measur-
ing the percentage of completion of the performance obligation on the basis of 
projected useful lives is considered appropriate within the meaning of 
IFRS 15."
"Listing fees are levied for the activity of all bodies of FWB, which su-
pervise the trading and the settlement of trades as well as ensure the proper 
functioning of all trading activities (permanent possibility to make use of ex-
change facilities)."
"Listing fees are recurring fees, which are charged for a ser-
vice that is delivered over time."
"Accordingly, revenue is realised on a pro-rata 
basis."
"Revenue from fees for listings on the regulated unofficial market is real-
ised in a similar manner."
"Revenue is recognised when the contractually 
agreed service is provided to customers."
"The fees include discounts on a 
monthly basis."
"Such discounts are considered accordingly in the month in 
which the services are rendered and reduce the sales revenue of the respective 
period."
"Fund Services 
The Fund services segment provides services to standardise fund processing 
and to increase efficiency and safety in the investment fund sector."
"The ser-
vices offered include order routing, settlement, asset management, custody 
services and distribution and placement of investments."
"Processing fees for 
fund custody and the management of distribution agreements are recognised 
over time."
"Transaction-related fees are recognised at the time the agreed ser-
vice is provided."
"This occurs when instructions are received and the transac-
tions are processed."
The service has been fulfilled at this point in time.
"Reve-
nue is recognised based on the price specified in the price list and reduced by 
the corresponding rebates."
"Securities services 
The Group generates revenues from infrastructure services and post-trading 
services, the settlement of securities transactions as well as the custody and 
administration of securities."
"The fees are calculated in accordance with the 
prices set in the price list as well as with any relevant discounts granted."
"Cus-
tomers in the custody business receive the benefit from the service provided 
and consume it at the same time as the performance is fulfilled during the 
contract period."
"Fees collected for administrative services, such as corporate 
events for securities, are recognised when the agreed service is provided to cli-
ents."
"This occurs when instructions are received and the transactions are pro-
cessed."
The service has been fulfilled at this point in time.
"In accordance with 
the general terms and conditions, customers authorise direct debiting and con-
sequently no financing component has been identified."
"Result of treasury activities in banking and similar business 
The treasury result of banking and similar business stems mainly from invest-
ing surplus liquidity and from the fair value measurement of foreign exchange 
transactions."
"It also includes income from exchange rate differences resulting 
from finance instruments in the banking business."
"As a result of interest rate 
policies, we also generate interest income from customer balances held with 
us (in a negative interest rate environment)."
"Furthermore, this item comprises 
interest payments made on customer balances (positive interest rate environ-
ment) as well as cash investments (negative interest rate environment) and 
fees for providing customer credit lines."
"Interest income and interest expenses 
are calculated, allocated and realised when due, with the applicable effective 
interest rate on a daily basis."
"In addition, impairment losses from financial in-
struments as well as income from the reduction of liabilities relating to the 
banking business are recognised in this item."
"Other operating income is usually realised when all opportunities 
and risks have been transferred."
"Other operating income comprises, for in-
stance, income from subleasing property and income from agency agreements, 
as well as the reversal of impairments recognised on trade receivables."
"In ad-
dition, valuation effects, such as income from exchange rate differences from 
non-banking business, are reported under other operating income."
"Volume-related costs are not incurred if the corresponding revenue is no longer 
generated."
"2) Reallocation of margin fees to the business areas, which are originally included in interest rates and other."
"These costs also include 
expenses for strategic consultancy and legal advice, as well as for auditing."
"Audit-integrated reviews 
of interim financial statements were performed."
"Other assurance services 
mainly relate to business reviews of internal systems and controls required by 
law or contract, the voluntary review of the remuneration report and the issu-
ance of comfort letters."
"The fee for other services mostly relates to project-re-
lated advisory services for non-regulated subsidiaries."
"Gains and losses on financial investments at FVPL 
are recognised on a net basis in the period in which they arise."
"Distributions 
from funds and dividends are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s 
right to receive payments is established and to the extent that such dividends 
are not capital repayments."
"08 Financial result 
The financial result comprises interest income and expenses which are not at-
tributable to the Group’s banking business and are therefore not recognised in 
net revenue."
"Interest income and expense are recognised using the effective 
interest method over the respective financial instrument’s term to maturity."
"In-
terest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits as-
sociated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the income can be 
measured reliably."
"Interest expense is recognised in the period in which it is 
incurred."
"Measurement effects from interest rate derivatives, including interest 
rate hedges, are also shown in this item."
"The position also includes measure-
ment effects from foreign exchange derivatives to the extent that they relate to 
treasury activities in the non-banking business."
"Such interest rate hedges are 
concluded to hedge the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes."
"In order to reflect this 
economic purpose more accurately, the resulting amount was adjusted retrospectively as at 31 December 
2022 by €–4.8 million."
"This led to a reduction of €–4.8 million in financial income in the consolidated 
income statement as at 31 December 2022 and a corresponding reduction in financial expenses."
"2) This includes €7.8 million (2022: €4.8 million) time value gains from interest rate swaps designated as 
hedging instruments to hedge cash flow risk from bond issues."
"09 Income taxes 
Deutsche Börse Group is subject to the tax laws of those countries in which it 
operates and generates income."
"If it is probable that the tax authorities will not 
accept the disclosed amounts or the legal assessments on which the Group’s 
tax declarations are based (uncertain tax positions), tax liabilities are recog-
nised based on the best possible estimate of expected cash outflows."
"Tax as-
sets are recognised if it is considered almost certain that they will be realised."
"The recognition of uncertain tax positions is reassessed if there is a change in 
the underlying facts or their legal assessment (e.g."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the balance sheet liabil-
ity approach."
"The deferred tax calculation is based on temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the IFRS financial 
statements and their tax base that will lead to a future tax liability or benefit 
when assets are used or sold or liabilities are settled."
"These differences are 
used to calculate deferred tax assets or liabilities."
"The deferred tax assets or li-
abilities are measured using the tax rates that are currently expected to apply 
when the temporary differences reverse, based on tax rates that have been en-
acted or substantively enacted by the reporting date."
"Deferred tax assets are 
recognised for the unused tax loss and interest carryforwards only to the extent 
that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available."
"Deferred tax as-
sets and deferred tax liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right to 
set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities exists, and the deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same 
taxation authority."
"These reflect trade income tax at rates of 11.6 to 16.1 per cent (2022: 
11.6 to 16.1 per cent), corporation tax of 15 per cent (2022: 15 per cent) 
and the 5.5 per cent solidarity surcharge (2022: 5.5 per cent) on corporation 
tax."
"Tax rates of 24.9 to 27.2 per cent (2022: 24.9 to 27.7 per cent) were used 
for the Group companies in Luxembourg."
"Tax rates of 11.8 to 31.4 per cent 
(2022: 9.1 to 34.6 per cent) were applied to the Group companies in the re-
maining countries; see Note 34."
"Current income tax expense was reduced by €2.6 million in the reporting year 
by the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax loss carryforwards (2022: 
€2.6 million)."
"Deferred tax assets of €1.0 million were created by previously 
unrecognised tax losses (2022: €1.7 million)."
"Changes in loss allowances for 
deductible temporary differences also gave rise to deferred tax expenses of 
€0.2 million (2022: nil)."
"These unused tax losses are attributable to domestic losses total-
ling €1.5 million and to foreign tax losses totalling €103.1 million (2022:  
Germany €0.2 million, foreign tax losses €40.3 million)."
Tax losses may be carried forward for up to 7 years in Switzerland.
"Tax losses 
arising before 1 January 2018 may be carried forward in the USA for up to 20 
years."
"Losses incurred after 31 December 2017 may be carried forward indefi-
nitely, taking into account the minimum taxation rules."
"Losses generated as of 
1 January 2017 will only be able to be carried forward in Luxembourg for a 
maximum period of 17 years."
"Losses that arose before 1 January 2017 are 
not affected by this limitation."
"Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely in 
Singapore."
"There were no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities on future dividends of sub-
sidiaries and associates or on gains from the disposal of subsidiaries and asso-
ciates in the reporting period (2022: none)."
"As at 31 December 2023, the reported income tax rate was 26.7 per cent 
(2022: 25.8 per cent)."
"The useful life of internally developed software releases is generally assumed 
to be seven years; a useful life of ten years is used as the basis in the case of 
newly developed systems."
Purchased software is generally amortised based on the projected useful life.
"The expected useful life is 3 to 7 years, depending on the individual purchase."
"The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed 
at a minimum at the end of each financial year."
"If the expected useful life of 
an asset differs from previous estimates, the amortisation period is adjusted 
accordingly."
"The other intangible assets were largely acquired within the context of busi-
ness combinations and refer to exchange licences, trade names,customer rela-
tionships and order backlog."
"The acquisition costs correspond to the fair val-
ues as at the acquisition date."
"Depending on the relevant acquisition transac-
tion, the expected useful life is 5 to 20 years for trade names with finite useful 
lives, 4 to 24 years for participants, customer relationships and order backlog, 
and 2 to 20 years for other miscellaneous intangible assets."
Stock exchange licences and certain trade names have an indefinite useful life.
The intention is also to keep them as part of the general company strategy.
Their useful lives are therefore assumed to be indefinite.
"Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal or when no further economic 
benefits are expected to flow from them."
"Impairment tests 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications 
that an intangible asset may be impaired."
"If this is the case, the carrying 
amount is compared with the recoverable amount (the higher of value in use 
and fair value less costs of disposal) to determine the amount of any potential 
impairment."
"Value in use is estimated on the basis of the discounted estimated future cash 
flows from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal, before 
taxes."
"For this purpose, discount rates are estimated based on the prevailing 
pre-tax weighted average cost of capital."
"If no recoverable amount can be de-
termined for an asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit 
(CGU) to which the asset can be allocated is determined."
"Irrespective of any indications of impairment, intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use must be tested for 
impairment at least once a year."
"Impairment tests on CGUs with allocated 
goodwill are carried out on 1 October every financial year."
"If the estimated re-
coverable amount of the asset or CGU is lower than the respective carrying 
amount, an impairment loss is recognised and the net carrying amount of the 
asset or CGU, respectively, is reduced to its estimated recoverable amount."
"If 
changes arise in the structure of CGUs, for example through a new segmenta-
tion, goodwill is allocated taking into account the relative fair values of the 
newly defined CGUs."
"Irrespective of any indications of impairment, these items 
must be tested for impairment at least annually at the lowest level of impair-
ment at which we monitor the respective goodwill."
"An impairment loss is rec-
ognised if the carrying amount of the CGU, or groups of CGUs, to which good-
will is allocated (including the carrying amount of that goodwill) is higher than 
the recoverable amount of this group of assets."
"The impairment loss is first al-
located to the goodwill, then to the other assets in proportion to their carrying 
amounts."
"The recoverable amount of the (groups of) CGUs was determined based on the 
fair value less costs to sell."
"The value in use was only determined if the fair 
value less costs to sell did not exceed the carrying amount."
"Given that no ac-
tive market was available for the (groups of) CGUs, the determination of fair 
value less costs to sell was based on the discounted cash flow method (level 3 
input factors)."
"The detailed planning period generally covers a time period of 
five years; for (groups of) CGUs, which have been allocated an asset with an 
indefinite useful life, such time period ends in perpetuity."
"Individual costs of 
capital are determined for each (group of) CGU(s), for the purpose of discount-
ing projected cash flows."
"These capital costs are based on data incorporating 
beta factors, borrowing costs, as well as the capital structure of the respective 
peer group."
"Pricing, trading volumes, assets under custody, market share as-
sumptions or general business development assumptions are based on past 
experience or market research."
"Other key assumptions are mainly based on ex-
ternal factors and generally correspond to internal management planning."
"Sig-
nificant macroeconomic indicators include, for instance, equity index levels, 
volatility of equity indices, as well as interest rates, exchange rates, GDP 
growth, unemployment levels and government debt."
"When calculating value in 
use, the projections are adjusted for the effects of future restructurings and 
performance investments, if appropriate."
"At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there are any indications 
that an impairment recognised for non-current assets in previous years (except 
goodwill) no longer applies."
"If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset 
is increased and the difference is recognised in profit or loss."
"The maximum 
amount of this reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have re-
sulted if no impairment loss had been recognised in previous periods."
"Deut-
sche Börse Group does not reverse any goodwill impairments."
"Development costs for internally developed intangible assets are only 
capitalised when the definition and recognition criteria for intangible assets ac-
cording to IAS 38 are met and development costs can be separated from re-
search costs."
"Interest expense that cannot be allocated di-
rectly to one of the development projects is recognised through profit or loss in 
the reporting period."
"Total development costs in the reporting year 2023 came to €323.9 million 
(2022: €274.5 million), of which €201.5 million were capitalised (2022: 
€181.8 million)."
"This resulted in an impairment loss in the Trading & Clearing segment (re-
coverable amount: negative) of €24.6 million (customer relations €14.1 mil-
lion, software €7.6 million and trade name €2.9 million)."
" Impairment losses of €8.7 million were also recognised for internally devel-
oped software in the Securities Services segment and of €0.2 million in the 
Fund Services segment (recoverable amount: negative) in the fourth quarter 
of 2023."
"The reasons for the impairment were that existing functionalities 
were no longer used and that significant revenues can no longer be gener-
ated."
"The change in the internal reporting structure related to the introduction of the 
new Investment Management Solutions segment (IMS) also caused (groups of) 
CGU to which goodwill had been allocated to be divided up."
"Deutsche Börse 
Group reallocated the corresponding carrying amounts based on the relative 
fair values."
"The goodwill, that was allocated to the former group of CGUs Qon-
tigo was partially allocated to the group of CGUs ISS STOXX (80.7 per cent) as 
well as SimCorp Axioma (19.3 per cent) in the current financial year."
"The 
goodwill allocated to the CGU ISS was fully allocated to the group of CGUs ISS 
STOXX."
"As a result, where applicable individual disclosures for the cost of capital parameters for the separate impairment tests 
included in the group of CGUs, are provided."
"Even in case of a reasonably possible change of one of the parameters, under 
the condition that all the other parameters remain constant, none of the above-
mentioned CGUs or groups of CGUs, with the exception of the SimCorp Axi-
oma CGU, would be impaired."
"In the annual impairment test the recoverable amount for the CGU SimCorp 
Axioma exceeded the carrying amount by €330.1 million."
The straight-line depreciation method is used.
"The car-
rying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if the car-
rying amount is higher than its recoverable amount."
"Costs of an item of prop-
erty, plant and equipment comprise all costs directly attributable to the pro-
duction process, as well as an appropriate proportion of production overheads."
"No borrowing costs were recognised in the reporting period or in the previous 
year as they could not be directly allocated to any particular development pro-
ject."
"If it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with an item 
of property, plant and equipment will flow to the Group and the cost of the as-
set in question can be reliably determined, expenditure subsequent to acquisi-
tion is added to the carrying amount of the asset as incurred."
"The carrying 
amounts of any parts of an asset that have been replaced are derecognised."
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Measurement of right-of-use assets 
We lease a large number of different assets."
"These mainly include buildings 
and cars."
Right-of-use assets are measured at cost.
"Any accumulated depreci-
ation and impairment amounts are deducted from the cost of right-of-use as-
sets as part of subsequent measurement."
"This does not apply to short-term 
leases with a term of not more than 12 months and leases for low-value as-
sets."
"Expenses in the reporting year resulting from the above-mentioned short-
term and low-value assets are reported in other operating expenses."
"The lease instalments received during the period are shown under other 
operating income."
"For details re-
garding the corresponding lease liabilities, please see note 12."
"12 Financial instruments 
Financial assets 
Additions and disposals 
Financial assets are recognised when the Group or one of its companies be-
comes party to a financial instrument."
"Regular way purchases and sales of fi-
nancial assets are generally recognised and derecognised at the trade date."
"Purchases and sales of debt instruments classified as “at amortised cost” and 
of equities eligible for clearing via the central counterparties (CCPs) of 
Deutsche Börse Group are recognised and derecognised at the settlement date."
"Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash 
flows expire or when the company transfers these rights in a transaction that 
transfers substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial as-
sets."
"acts as a principal in securities borrowing and lend-
ing transactions in the context of the ASLplus securities lending system and is 
an intermediate between lender and borrower without becoming a contracting 
party from an economic perspective."
"Consequently, these transactions are not 
recognised in the consolidated balance sheet."
"First-time measurement and classification 
Financial assets are first recognised at fair value."
"For financial assets not at fair 
value through profit or loss the recognised amount also includes transaction 
costs that can be allocated directly to the acquisition of this asset."
"Transaction 
costs of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed."
"Financial assets are classified at the acquisition date, from which subsequent 
measurement is derived."
"Debt in-
struments are only reclassified if the business model for managing them is 
changed."
"We do not make use of the option to designate debt instruments at 
fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option)."
"The classification of investments in equity instruments not held for trading de-
pends on whether the option of designating the corresponding financial assets 
as at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI option) is used on 
initial recognition."
"Each individual equity instrument can be allocated sepa-
rately and may not be changed in subsequent periods."
"Interest income from these financial assets is 
measured using the effective interest method."
"Gains and losses from derec-
ognition, impairment and exchange rate movements are recognised through 
profit or loss."
"Measurement effects are shown in banking business or non-
banking business depending on how the financial assets are allocated."
"For 
financial assets from banking business all measurement effects are shown in 
the treasury result of banking and similar business."
"Interest income from the 
non-banking business is shown in the financial result."
"All other effects of 
non-banking business are presented in result from financial investments."
"All 
effects relating to the measurement of trade receivables are shown in other 
operating income and expenses."
" Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Investments in 
debt instruments allocated to the “hold and sell” business model and whose 
cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest are measured 
as at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"Impairments on these 
debt instruments are recognised as result from financial investments through 
profit or loss."
"On disposal of these debt instruments all the balances in the 
revaluation surplus are reclassified to result from financial investments 
through profit or loss."
"Interest income from fixed income debt securities in 
this category are shown in the financial result."
" Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL): Financial assets that do not meet 
the criteria for measurement at amortised cost or at FVOCI, are measured at 
FVPL and their measurement effects are shown in result from financial  
investments."
"Distributions from fund interests are also shown in result from 
financial investments."
"Interest income from fixed income bonds in this cate-
gory are shown in the financial result."
"Subsequent measurement of equity instruments 
As a rule, equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVPL)."
"For certain equity instruments we used the irrevocable 
FVOCI option on acquisition, so that gains and losses there are recognised in 
other comprehensive income."
"When the item is derecognised the gains and 
losses are not recycled through profit or loss, but reclassified to retained earn-
ings."
"Dividends from these financial assets are shown in result from financial 
investments."
"The losses represent a forward-looking measurement of  
future losses that are generally subject to estimates."
" Stage 2: If a financial asset's credit risk has increased significantly, the ex-
pected credit loss is determined over the entire term."
"A significant increase in 
credit risk is determined individually using internal ratings."
"A significant in-
crease in the credit risk is assumed if an asset is downgraded by three levels 
within the internal rating system."
" Stage 3: Credit-impaired financial assets are allocated to Stage 3 and the im-
pairment is based on the full lifetime expected credit losses."
"This is the case 
if there are observable data of significant financial difficulties and there is a 
high risk of default, even if the definition of a default has not yet been met."
"We have the following two triggers to identify a default event and which cause 
a transfer to Stage 3 of the model: 
 Legal default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable to fulfil its 
contractual obligations due to its insolvency."
" Contractual default event: A contracting party of the Group is unable or un-
willing to fulfil its contractual obligations in a timely manner."
"The non-fulfil-
ment of the contractual obligation could result in a financial loss for us."
"We measure the expected credit losses for trade receivables using a simplified 
approach, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognised from initial 
recognition of a receivable."
"Due to the high recovery rate for trade receivables 
with a due date of less than 360 days, a default is assumed for amounts 
which are overdue for more than 360 days."
A detailed list of expected credit losses is shown in note 24.
"Financial liabilities 
Additions and disposals 
Financial liabilities are recognised when a Group company becomes a party to 
the financial instrument."
"Purchases and sales of equities via the central coun-
terparty Eurex Clearing AG are recognised at the settlement date analogous to 
financial assets."
"Financial liabilities are derecognised when the contractual ob-
ligation has been extinguished because it has been discharged or cancelled or 
has expired."
"Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost 
Financial liabilities not held for trading are accounted for at amortised cost."
"The borrowing costs associated with the placement of financial liabilities are 
included in the carrying amount and accounted for using the effective interest 
method if they are directly attributable."
"Discounts are amortised over the term 
of the liabilities using the effective interest method."
"Liabilities for the acquisi-
tion of non-controlling shares settled in cash or another financial asset are rec-
ognised at the present value of the future purchase price."
"The effect of the pre-
sent value of accrued interest on the financial obligation and all measurement 
changes in the obligation is subsequently measured through profit or loss."
"The 
equity interest attributable to non-controlling shareholders underlying the 
transaction is accounted for as if it had already been acquired at the time of 
the transaction."
The resulting financial liabilities are recognised at fair value.
"With a contingent 
purchase price component the purchaser is obliged to transfer additional as-
sets or shares to the seller if certain conditions are met."
"Subsequent measure-
ment is at fair value through profit or loss."
"We do not make use of the option to designate financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss upon initial recognition (fair value option)."
"Our exposure to various risks associated with the financial instruments is dis-
cussed in note 24."
"The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the re-
porting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets men-
tioned above."
"Presentation and netting of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position are divided 
into non-current and current."
"They are presented as non-current if the remain-
ing term is more than twelve months as at the reporting date."
"They are pre-
sented as current assets if the remaining term is less than twelve months."
"Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The derivative financial instruments we use include interest rate swaps, foreign 
exchange swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options."
"Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative con-
tract is taken out."
"The Group applies the provisions of IFRS 9 to account for 
hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting."
"When a hedging transac-
tion takes place the economic relationship between the hedging instrument 
and the hedged item is documented in accordance with the requirements of 
IFRS 9."
"All other derivative transactions serve mainly to hedge foreign exchange risks 
in economic hedging relationships."
"They are classified as “held for trading” for 
accounting purposes and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period 
at fair value through profit or loss."
"Depending on the type of transaction, gains 
and losses from the subsequent measurement are either recognised in the re-
sult of treasury activities in banking business and similar business, in result 
from financial investments or in the financial result."
"The cash 
flow hedge used the previous year to hedge the interest rate risk of a planned 
security issue was terminated when the bond issue was completed."
"The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is assessed at the beginning and 
over the entire duration of the hedging relationship to ensure that there is an 
economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item."
"This entails establishing hedging transactions in which all the relevant contrac-
tual parameters of the hedging instrument exactly match those of the hedged 
item."
"Hedging of planned transactions may be ineffective if the timing of the 
planned transaction differs from the original estimate."
"Ineffectiveness due to 
changes in our default risk or that of the counterparty to the hedging transac-
tion is deemed to be negligible."
"Effectiveness is measured regularly as at the 
reporting dates."
"The Group uses the hypothetical derivative method for this 
purpose."
"Gains or 
losses on the ineffective portion are recognised directly through profit or loss 
either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in result from 
financial investments."
"The ineffective portion of interest rate hedges is recog-
nised either in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the fi-
nancial result."
"If forward contracts are used to hedge planned transactions we 
designate the entire change in the fair value of the forward, including the for-
ward component, as a hedging instrument."
"In this case the gains or losses 
from the effective portion of the change in fair value for the entire future trans-
action are recognised in the reserve for cash flow hedges as a component of 
equity."
"If the Group uses futures to hedge existing receivables and liabilities, 
only the spot component of the future is designated."
"Gains or losses from the 
effective portion of the change in the spot component of the future are shown 
in the reserve for cash flow hedges."
"Changes in the forward component of the hedging instrument that relates to 
the hedged item are considered to be hedging costs and shown separately in 
the reserve for hedging costs in other comprehensive income."
"The fair value of 
the forward component not included in the hedging relationship at the time it 
is designated is written off pro rata temporis over the period of the hedging re-
lationship."
"The amount written down is recycled from the reserve for hedging 
costs to profit or loss."
" For cash flow hedges of existing receivables and liabilities, the amount that 
has accumulated in the reserve for cash flow hedges is reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods in which there are changes in the hedged future cash 
flows recognised through profit or loss."
" If this amount is a loss, however, and the assumption is that all or part of 
this loss cannot be recouped in future periods, then this amount is recog-
nised immediately through profit or loss."
"For interest rate hedges recognition is ei-
ther in the treasury result of banking and similar business or in the financial 
result."
"When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge 
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discon-
tinued."
"However, the hedging relationship continues if it was designated as a 
rolling hedge from the outset."
"To the extent that the expected transaction is 
still considered to be highly probable, the expiring positions are replaced by 
new hedging instruments."
"When the forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were 
reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss."
"Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income 
This item comprises strategic investments which we have irrevocably elected 
to recognise at fair value through other comprehensive income in this category 
at initial recognition."
"The carrying amount as at 31 December 2023 was 
€222.7 million (2022: €182.8 million)."
None of these financial assets was pledged as collateral.
"There was an in-
crease of €9.3 million in strategic equity investments in 2023 due to new in-
vestments."
"The amount of long-term listed debt securities includes collateral with 
a nominal volume of €2.0 million (2022: €5.0 million)."
"Amounts reported separately under liabilities as cash deposits by market par-
ticipants are restricted."
"Such amounts are mainly invested via bilateral or 
triparty reverse repurchase agreements and in the form of overnight deposits at 
central banks and other banks and shown as restricted bank balances."
"Gov-
ernment and government-guaranteed bonds with an external credit rating of at 
least AA– are accepted as collateral for the reverse repurchase agreements."
"It also guarantees the settlement of all 
transactions for Eurex Repo (repo trading platform) and certain exchange 
transactions in equities on Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse (FWB, the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange)."
"Eurex Clearing AG also guarantees the settlement of off-or-
der-book trades entered for clearing in the trading systems of the Eurex ex-
changes, Eurex Bonds, Eurex Repo and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange."
"In ad-
dition, Eurex Clearing AG clears over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate deriva-
tives and securities lending transactions, where these meet the specified no-
vation criteria."
" European Commodity Clearing AG guarantees the settlement of spot and de-
rivatives transactions at the trading venues of EEX group and the connected 
partner exchanges."
" Nodal Clear, LLC, as part of the Nodal Exchange Group, is a Derivatives 
Clearing Organisation (DCO) registered in the United States and is the central 
counterparty for all transactions executed on Nodal Exchange."
"Purchases and sales of equities 
and bonds via the Eurex Clearing AG central counterparty are recognised and 
simultaneously derecognised at the settlement date."
"For products that are 
marked to market (futures, options on futures, as well as OTC interest-rate de-
rivatives), the clearing houses recognise gains and losses on open positions of 
clearing members on each exchange day."
"By means of the variation margin, 
profits and losses on open positions resulting from market price fluctuations 
are settled on a daily basis."
"The difference between this and other margin 
types is that the variation margin does not comprise collateral, but is a daily 
offsetting of profits and losses in cash."
"Therefore, futures and OTC interest rate 
derivatives are not reported in the consolidated balance sheet."
"“Traditional” op-
tions, for which the buyer must pay the option premium in full upon purchase, 
are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value."
"Receivables and lia-
bilities from repo transactions and from cash-collateralised securities lending 
transactions are classified as held for trading and carried at fair value."
"The fair values recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are based on 
daily settlement prices, which the clearing houses determine and publish ac-
cording to the rules defined in the contract specifications."
"Financial liabilities of €563.0 million were eliminated 
because of intra-Group GC Pooling transactions (31 December 2022: €364.0 
million)."
"As of 31 December 2023 there were foreign currency deriva-
tives not designated as part of a hedging relationship with a term of less than 
two months with a nominal volume of €4,006.7 million (31 December 2022 : 
€5,552.3 million with a term of less than six months)."
"Of the total, €2,596.0 
million (31 December 2022: €1,554.6 million) relate to foreign exchange de-
rivatives with a positive fair value and €1,410.7 million (31 December 2022: 
€3,997.7 million) to derivatives with a negative fair value."
"These foreign cur-
rency derivatives are mainly used to convert payments received in US dollars 
into euros for liquidity management purposes and also as an alternative to un-
secured deposits and loans, to hedge the unsecured counterparty risk and li-
quidity risk in everyday liquidity management."
"The 
hedged items covered by hedge accounting consist of internal Group loans and 
highly probable planned transactions."
"Therefore, the hedge ratio is 
1:1."
"The foreign exchange hedging transactions in US dollars are due in 
2024."
"The separated costs relate to over-time 
hedged items in the form of loans to Group companies."
"The amounts in the  
reserve for cash flow hedges relating to interest rate swaps are reversed pro 
rata temporis until April 2032."
"Fair value hierarchy 
The financial assets measured at fair value includes financial assets and liabil-
ities at the following three hierarchy levels: 
 Level 1: Financial instruments with a quoted price for identical assets and li-
abilities in an active market."
" Level 2: Financial instruments with no quoted prices for identical instru-
ments on an active market and whose fair value is determined using valua-
tion methods based on observable market parameters."
" Level 3: Financial instruments where the fair value is determined using one 
or more unobservable significant inputs."
"This does not apply to listed equity 
instruments 
There were no transfers between levels for recurring fair value measurements 
during the year under review."
"The other non-current and current assets and liabilities included in the Level 2 
hierarchy include foreign currency forwards."
"The basis for measuring the mar-
ket value of the foreign currency forwards is the forward rate at the reporting 
date for the remaining term."
They are based on observable market prices.
"The 
basis for measuring the market value of financial instruments held by central  
 
counterparties are market transactions for identical or similar assets on non-
active markets and option pricing models based on observable prices."
"The following table presents the valuation techniques, including material un-
observable inputs, used to determine the fair value of Level 3 financial instru-
ments (FVPL)."
"Interests in institutional 
investment funds 
 Net asset value 
 These investments include private equity funds and alternative invest-
ments held by Deutsche Börse Group."
"They are valued by the fund 
manager based on net asset value."
"Net asset value is determined using 
non-public information from the respective private equity managers."
"Deutsche Börse Group only has limited insight into the specific inputs 
used by the fund managers; a descriptive sensitivity analysis is there-
fore not used here."
"The change in financial assets measured at FVOCI is mainly due to the 
acquisition of strategic investments in the amount of €9.3 million and positive 
valuation effects in the amount of €7.2 million, which were recognised in the 
revaluation surplus with no effect on profit or loss."
"In addition to the 
acquisition of fund shares in the amount of €4.7 million and convertible bonds 
in the amount of €14.2 million measured at FVPL, negative valuation effects 
in the amount of €16.6 million resulted."
"The increase in other non-current 
liabilities measured at FVPL is mainly due to the first time recognition of 
derivatives that were not in the money on the balance sheet date."
"The unobservable inputs can generally consist of a range of values that are 
considered probable."
"The sensitivity analysis determines the fair values of the 
financial instruments using input factors that lie at the lower or upper limit of 
the possible range."
"The securities 
were allocated to level 1."
"The bonds issued by us have a fair value of €6,953.4 million (31 December 
2022: €3,635.3 million) and are disclosed under liabilities measured at 
amortised cost."
"The fair value of such instruments is based on the debt instru-
ments’ quoted prices."
"Due to insufficient market liquidity, the debt securities 
were allocated to Level 2."
"The financial instrument’s carrying amount represents a reasonable approxi-
mation of fair value for all other positions."
"The central pillar of the collateral systems is the determination of the overall 
risk per clearing member (margin) to be covered by cash or securities collat-
eral."
"Losses calculated on the basis of current prices and potential future price 
risks are covered up to the date of the next collateral payment."
"In addition to these daily collateral payments, each clearing member must 
make contributions to the respective default fund (for further details, see “Risk 
report” section in the combined management report)."
"Cash collateral is re-
ported in the consolidated balance sheet under “cash deposits by market par-
ticipants” and the corresponding amounts under “restricted bank balances”."
"Securities collateral is generally not derecognised by the clearing member 
providing the collateral, as the opportunities and risks associated with the se-
curities are not transferred to the secure party."
"Recognition at the secure party 
is only permissible if the clearing member providing the transfer is in default 
according to the underlying contract."
"The aggregate margin calls based on the executed transactions and default 
fund requirements after haircuts was €100,990.9 million as at the reporting 
date (2022: €155,339.1 million), collateral totalling €122,728.5 million 
(2022: €182,104.6 million) was actually deposited."
"The Group only recognises the 
costs of obtaining a contract as an asset for multi-year contracts."
"The recog-
nised costs are amortised in line with revenue recognition."
"Contract costs are presented in the consolidated statement of financial 
position in the items “Other non-current assets” and “Other current assets”."
"Contract assets represent a legal right to consideration for software that has al-
ready been transferred to customers under subscription agreements with future 
payments."
The increase is due to the SimCorp acquisition.
"Contract assets are 
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position in the items 
“Other non-current assets” and “Other current assets”."
"Contract liabilities are generally advance payments by customers for perfor-
mance obligations that have not yet been satisfied in full."
"The €177.8 million 
included in contract liabilities as at 31 December 2022 was recognised as rev-
enue in the financial year 2023."
"The increase in contract liabilities is mainly 
due to changes in the basis of consolidation of €39.8 million from the 
SimCorp acquisition."
"Contract liabilities are presented in the consolidated 
statement of financial position in the items “Other non-current liabilities” and 
“Other current liabilities”."
"The remaining €757.8 million will be recognised in 
subsequent financial years."
"The significant increase is mainly due to changes 
in the basis of consolidation from the SimCorp acquisition."
"Other current liabilities also fell correspondingly, see note 20."
"These receivables do not belong to the financial assets, as the claims do not 
include receipts of cash or cash equivalents but are claims to physical deliver-
ies of commodities."
"As at 31 December 2023 the number of no-par value registered shares 
of Deutsche Börse AG in issue was 190,000,000 (31 December 2022:

"To date, the authorisation to issue convertible bonds and/or bonds 
with warrants has not been exercised."
"There were no further subscription rights to shares as at 31 December 2023

"In November 2023, Deutsche Börse AG announced a share buyback program 
for 2024 based on the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting 
on 8 May 2019."
"In the period up to 3 May 2024 at the latest, up to 
14,000,000 shares in the company are to be repurchased at a total cost of up 
to €300 million (excluding incidental acquisition costs)."
"In addition, 129,872 own shares were sold to 
employees as part of the employee participation programme (Group Share 
Plan, GSP), see note 18."
"Intra-Group reorganisations within Deutsche Börse Group, which included the 
sale of the investment in ISS HoldCo Inc."
"to ISS STOXX GmbH with the simul-
taneous participation of a non-Group investor and the contribution of the in-
vestment in Axioma Inc."
"to SimCorp A/S, resulted in an effect recognised di-
rectly in equity of €– 68.8 million in retained earnings as a result of transac-
tions with equity holders, as well as changes in non-controlling interests of 
€– 198.8 million."
"In 2023, Deutsche Börse AG 
distributed €661.5 million (€3.60 per share) from distributable profit for the 
previous year."
"The 
number of shares carrying dividend rights can change until the Annual General 
Meeting through the repurchase or sale of further treasury shares."
"In this case, 
with a dividend of €3.80 per eligible share, an amended resolution for the ap-
propriation of distributable profit will be proposed to the Annual General Meet-
ing."
"Calculating the pre-
sent value requires certain actuarial assumptions (e.g."
"discount rate, staff turn-
over rate, salary and pension trends) to be made."
"The current service cost and 
the net interest expense or income for the subsequent period are calculated on 
the basis of these assumptions."
"Net interest expense for the financial year is calculated 
by applying the discount rate determined at the beginning of the financial year 
to the net defined benefit liability determined as at that date."
"Moreover, the bonds must be denominated 
in the same currency as the underlying pension obligation."
"Measurement of 
the pension obligations in euros is based on a discount rate which is deter-
mined according to the adjusted “GlobalRate:Link” methodology from the advi-
sory company Willis Towers Watson, updated in line with the current market 
trend."
"The actuarial gains or losses and the difference between the expected and the 
actual return or loss on plan assets are recognised in other comprehensive in-
come in the revaluation surplus."
"They result from changes in expectations with 
regard to life expectancy, pension trends, salary trends and the discount rate."
"Other long-term benefits for employees and members of executive boards (total 
disability pension, transitional payments) are also measured using the pro-
jected unit credit method."
"Actuarial gains and losses and past service cost are 
recognised immediately and in full through profit or loss."
"The Group uses exter-
nal trust solutions to cover some of its pension obligations."
"in each calendar year the company provides an 
annual contribution to a capital component calculated in accordance with ac-
tuarial principles."
"The benefit assets equal the total of the acquired capital 
components of the individual years and are converted into a lifelong pension 
once the benefits fall due."
"In addition, retirement benefit agreements are in 
place with members of the executive boards of Group companies, under which 
they are entitled to pension benefits upon reaching the age of 63 and following 
reappointment."
"When the term of office began, the replacement rate was 30 
per cent of individual pensionable income."
"It rose by 5 percentage points with 
each reappointment, up to a maximum of 50 per cent of pensionable income."
"Under this plan, it is possible to convert portions of future re-
muneration entitlements into benefit assets of equal value which bear interest 
of 6 per cent p.a."
"The benefits consist of a capital payment made in equal an-
nual instalments over a period of three years upon the reaching the age of 65 
or at an earlier date due to disability or death."
"In the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2006, executives in Germany 
were offered the opportunity to participate in the following pension system 
based on capital components: the benefit is based on annual income received, 
composed of fixed annual salary and the variable remuneration."
"Every year, 
participating Group companies provide for an amount that corresponds to a 
certain percentage of the pensionable income."
"The participating companies 
provide an amount corresponding to a specific percentage of this eligible in-
come every year."
"This amount is multiplied by a capitalisation factor depend-
ing on age, resulting in the “annual capital component”."
"The benefit assets 
equal the total of the acquired capital components of the individual years and 
are converted into a lifelong pension once the benefits fall due."
"This benefit 
plan was closed to new staff on 30 June 2006; the executives who were em-
ployed in the above period can continue to earn capital components."
"As part of adjustments to the remuneration systems to bring them into line 
with supervisory requirements, contracts were adjusted for some executives."
"For executives affected, whose contracts allowed for the inclusion of only the 
income received and the variable remuneration above the upper limit of the 
contribution assessment as pensionable income, the pensionable income was 
determined on the basis of income received from the year 2016."
"This is ad-
justed annually to account for the increase of the cost of living according to the 
consumer price index for Germany as issued by the Federal Statistical Office."
"Luxembourg 
The defined benefit pension plan in favour of Luxembourg employees is 
funded by means of cash contributions to an “association d'épargne pension” 
(ASSEP) organized in accordance with Luxembourg law."
"The benefits consist 
of a one-off capital payment, which is generally paid upon reaching the age of 
65."
"Employees receive an annual account statement showing their current bal-
ance."
"The pension plan does not pay any benefits in the event of death or dis-
ability."
"Contributions to the ASSEP are funded in full by the participating com-
panies."
"The contributions are determined annually on the basis of actuarial 
opinions in accordance with Luxembourg law."
"In the 2023 financial year, employees converted a total of €6.6 million 
(2022: €5.8 million) of their variable remuneration into deferred compensa-
tion benefits."
"For Luxembourg, generation tables of the Institut na-
tional de la statistique et des études économiques du Grand-Duché de Luxem-
bourg are used."
"Owing to the current very high inflation rates, pension adjustments in the next 
two to three years will significantly exceed the assumed (long-term) pension 
trend."
"This cumulative inflation (adjustment backlog) was taken into account 
in the corresponding commitments through the one-off increase in pensions."
"Sensitivity analysis 
The sensitivity analysis presented in the following considers the change in one 
assumption of the main plans in Germany and Luxembourg at a time, leaving 
the other assumptions unchanged from the original calculation, i.e."
"possible 
correlation effects between the individual assumptions are not taken into ac-
count."
"At the company’s instruc-
tion, the trustee uses the funds transferred to acquire securities, without any 
consulting by the trustee."
"The contributions are invested in accordance with an 
investment policy, which may be amended by the companies represented in 
the investment committee."
"The trustee may refuse to carry out instructions if 
they are in conflict with the fund’s allocation rules or the payment provisions."
"In accordance with the investment policy, a value preservation mechanism is 
applied; investments can be made in different asset classes."
"Luxembourg 
In Luxembourg, the Board of Directors of the Clearstream Pension Fund is re-
sponsible for determining the investment strategy, with the aim of maximising 
returns in relation to a benchmark."
"This benchmark is 75 per cent derived 
from the return on five-year German federal government bonds and 25 per 
cent from the return on the EURO STOXX 50 Index."
"According to the invest-
ment policy, the fund may only invest in fixed-income and variable-rate securi-
ties, as well as listed investment fund units; it may hold cash, including in the 
form of money market funds."
"Neither did they include any properties or 
other assets used by companies in Deutsche Börse Group."
"Risks 
In addition to the general actuarial risks, the risks associated with the defined 
benefit obligations relate especially to financial risks in connection with the 
plan assets, including in particular counterparty credit and market risks."
"Market risk 
The return on plan assets is assumed to be the discount rate determined on 
the basis of corporate bonds with an AA rating."
"If the actual rate of return on 
plan assets is lower than the discount rate used, the net defined benefit liabil-
ity increases accordingly."
"If volatility is low, the actual return is further ex-
pected to exceed the return on corporate bonds with a good rating in the me-
dium to long term."
"The amount of the net obligation is also influenced in par-
ticular by changes in the discount rates."
"We consider the share price risk re-
sulting from derivative positions in equity index futures in the plan assets to be 
appropriate."
"Any amendments to the investment policy take into account the dura-
tion of the pension obligation as well as the expected payments over a period 
of ten years."
"Inflation risk 
Possible inflation risks that could lead to an increase in defined benefit obliga-
tions exist because some pension plans are final salary plans or the annual 
capital components are directly related to salaries, i.e."
"a significant increase in 
salaries would lead to an increase in the benefit obligation from these plans."
"In 
Germany, however, there are no contractual arrangements with regard to infla-
tion risk for these pension plans."
An interest rate of 6 per cent p.a.
"has been 
agreed for the employee-financed deferred compensation plan; the plan does 
not include any arrangements for inflation, so that it has to be assumed that 
there will be little incentive for employees to contribute to the deferred com-
pensation plan in times of rising inflation."
"In Luxembourg, salaries are ad-
justed for the effects of inflation on the basis of a consumer price index no 
more than once a year; this adjustment leads to a corresponding increase in 
the benefit obligation from the pension plan."
"Duration and expected maturities of the pension obligations 
The weighted duration of the pension obligations as at 31 December 2023 is 
12.6 years (2022: 12.7 years)."
"In addition, contri-
butions are paid to the statutory pension insurance scheme."
"The level of con-
tributions is normally determined in relation to income."
"As a rule, no provi-
sions are recognised for defined contribution plans."
"The contributions paid are 
reported as pension expenses in the year of payment."
"There are defined contri-
bution pension plans for employees in several countries."
"In addition, the em-
ployer pays contributions to employees’ private pension funds."
"During the reporting period, the costs associated with defined contribution 
plans amounted to €61.3 million (2022: €54.6 million)."
"Multi-employer plans 
Several Deutsche Börse Group companies are member institutions of BVV Ver-
sicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G., a pension insurance provider with 
its registered office in Berlin."
"Employees and employers make regular contribu-
tions, which are used to provide guaranteed pension plans, and a potential 
surplus."
"The contributions to be made are derived from contribution rates ap-
plied to active employees’ monthly gross salaries, taking into account specific 
financial thresholds."
"Member institutions have a subsidiary liability for the ful-
filment of BVV’s agreed pension benefits."
"However, we consider the risk that 
this liability will be invoked as remote."
"Given that BVV membership is gov-
erned by several Works Council Agreements, membership termination is sub-
ject to certain conditions."
"The notice period for termination is defined in the ar-
ticles of association of the BVV pension scheme."
"The employer retains a sub-
sidiary liability for the pension entitlements of every individual employee that 
have vested as at the termination date."
"Deutsche Börse Group considers BVV 
pension obligations as multi-employer defined benefit pension plans."
"Moreover, we 
do not know Deutsche Börse Group’s actual share in BVV’s total obligations."
"This plan is therefore shown in the Group’s financial reporting as a defined 
contribution plan."
"On the basis of current information published by BVV there 
is no shortfall that could affect the future contributions payable by the Group."
"The Deutsche Börse Group is not liable for commitments by other members of 
BVV."
"participates in the ABP pension fund within the EEX 
subgroup."
Participation is mandatory for all employees.
"Employer contributions 
are calculated by ABP and adjusted, if necessary."
"Since the allocation of as-
sets to member institutions and beneficiaries is not possible, this pension plan 
can also be presented only as a defined contribution plan."
"During the reporting period, the costs associated with such designated multi-
employer plans amounted to €10.3 million (2022: €10.1 million)."
"In 2024 
we expect to make contributions to multi-employer plans amounting to around 
€10.3 million."
"18 Share-based payment 
Share-based payments for employees, managers and Executive Board mem-
bers comprise cash-settled remuneration plans and remuneration plans settled 
with equity instruments."
"The main remuneration plans at Deutsche Börse 
Group are described below."
"Stock Bonus Plan (SBP) 
The SBP is open to senior executives of Deutsche Börse AG and its participat-
ing subsidiaries."
"It grants a long-term remuneration component in the form of 
so-called SBP shares."
"These are generally accounted for as share-based pay-
ments for which Deutsche Börse AG has a choice of settlement in cash or eq-
uity instruments for certain tranches."
"Tranches due in previous years were 
each settled in cash."
"In the reporting period, the Deutsche Börse Group estab-
lished an additional tranche of the SBP for senior executives who are not risk 
takers."
"In order to participate in the SBP, beneficiaries must have earned a bo-
nus."
"The awards are settled in cash and the SBP shares are measured as 
cash-settled share-based payment transactions."
"The cost of the options is esti-
mated using an option pricing model (fair value measurement) and recognised 
in staff costs in the consolidated income statement."
"The number of stock options is determined by the amount of the individual 
and performance-based SBP bonus for the financial year, divided by the aver-
age share price (Xetra closing price) of Deutsche Börse AG’s shares in the 
fourth quarter of the financial year in question."
"Neither the converted SBP bo-
nus nor the stock options are paid at the time the bonus is determined."
"Ra-
ther, the entitlement is generally received three years after the grant date (the 
“waiting period”)."
"Within this period, beneficiaries cannot assert shareholder 
rights (in particular, the rights to receive dividends and attend the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting)."
"Once they have met the condition of service, the beneficiaries’ 
claims resulting from the SBP are calculated on the first trading day following 
the last day of the waiting period."
"The current market price at that date (clos-
ing auction price of Deutsche Börse shares in electronic trading on the Frank-
furt Stock Exchange) is multiplied by the number of stock options."
"Stock op-
tions are settled in cash."
"The stock options from the 2019 SBP tranche were exercised in the reporting 
period following the expiration of the waiting period."
"Shares of the SBP 
tranches 2020 to 2022 were paid to former employees as part of severance 
payments in the year under review."
"Provisions for the SBP amounting to €3.9 million were recognised at the re-
porting date of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €3.0 million)."
"The 
total expense for SBP stock options in the reporting period amounted to €2.0 
million (2022: €1.5 million)."
"This programme was extended in 2016 with the Re-
stricted Stock Units (RSU) plan."
The following disclosures relate to both plans.
"Long-Term Sustainable Instrument (LSI) 
The LSI remuneration model requires at least half of a part of the variable re-
muneration to be settled in cash and half in phantom shares of Deutsche 
Börse AG (LSI shares)."
All tranches will be settled in cash.
"A portion of the 
variable remuneration is paid in the subsequent year and another portion over 
a further period of three or four years."
"Moreover, a portion of the variable re-
muneration shall be converted into RSU, subject to a three-year retention pe-
riod after grant and a one-year waiting period (RSU shares)."
"Deutsche Börse 
Group thus measures the LSI shares as cash-settled share-based payment 
transactions."
"The options are measured using an option pricing model (fair 
value measurement)."
"Any right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after 
the expiration of the one-year service period on which the plan is based, taking 
certain waiting periods into account."
"The number of LSI and RSU shares for the 2017 tranche is calculated by di-
viding the proportionate LSI or RSU bonus, respectively, for the year in ques-
tion by the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG shares in the last 
month of a financial year."
"This results in individual LSI 
tranches for the LSI bonus, which have maturities of between one and five 
years."
The RSU bonus is used as a basis for another four-year tranche.
"Pay-
ment of each tranche is made after a waiting period of one year."
"Neither remu-
neration system stipulates any condition of service."
"Following the expiry of the 
waiting period, both the LSI and the RSU shares of the 2017 tranche are 
measured on the basis of the average closing price of Deutsche Börse AG 
shares in the last month preceding the end of the waiting period."
"The LSI and 
RSU shares of the 2018-2023 tranches are measured at the closing auction 
price as at the first trading day in February of the year in which the holding pe-
riod ends."
"In the reporting year LSI shares from the tranches 2017-2021 were 
disbursed with a disbursement price of €168.05 for the shares in the tranche 
2017."
The disbursement price for the tranches 2018-2021 was €166.35.
"The difference in payout share prices is caused by the nature of the specific 
terms and conditions for the respective tranches."
"Restricted Stock Units (RSU) 
Like the LSI plan, the RSU plan applies to risk takers within Deutsche Börse 
Group."
"RSU shares are settled in cash; Deutsche Börse Group thus measures 
the RSU shares as cash-settled share-based payment transactions."
"The options 
are measured using an option pricing model (fair value measurement)."
"Any 
right to payment of a stock bonus only vests after the expiration of the one-
year service period on which the plan is based, taking a three-year retention 
period and a one-year waiting period into account."
"No RSU shares were paid 
out in the reporting year."
"Measurement of the LSI and the RSU 
To determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the 
additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an ex-
pectation about future dividend payments."
"The total expense for LSI/RSU 
stock options in the reporting period amounted to €13.9 million (31 December 
2022: €11.3 million)."
The shares are subject to a performance period of five years.
"The subse-
quent payment of the stock bonus will be settled in cash."
"The 100 per cent stock bonus target was calculated in euros for each Execu-
tive Board member."
"The 100 per cent stock bonus target for selected execu-
tives and employees of Deutsche Börse AG and participating subsidiaries is de-
fined by the responsible decision-making bodies."
"Any right to payment of a PSP 
stock bonus vested only at the end of a five-year performance period."
"The final number of Performance Shares was calculated by multiplying the 
original number of Performance Shares with the level of overall target achieve-
ment."
"The two performance factors contribute 50 per cent each to calculate 
overall target achievement."
"For the 2021 and 2022 tranches the overall target 
achievement depends on the performance against three different metrics over 
the performance period."
"The total shareholder return (TSR) for the Deutsche 
Börse AG share compared with the total shareholder return for the STOXX Eu-
rope 600 Financials Index accounts for 50 per cent."
"The annual growth rate 
for adjusted earnings per share over the performance period accounts for a fur-
ther 25 per cent."
"The remaining 25 per cent are calculated by reference to 
performance against four equally weighted ESG targets."
"In the reporting year shares 
from the 2018 PSP tranche were disbursed at a price of €182.30."
"Until the 
2021 tranche, servicing and treatment will be in accordance with the cash 
settlement rules."
"Settlement is in cash and with the exception of the 2021-
2023 tranches the transaction is measured and recognised as cash-settled 
share-based remuneration."
"Because of their specific contractual conditions the 
2021-2023 tranches are treated as a settlement with equity instruments."
"Measurement of the PSP 
To determine the fair value of the subscription rights, the intrinsic value of the 
additional pro rata subscription rights is calculated, which also includes an ex-
pectation about future dividend payments."

The above figures also include the shares of the members of the Executive Board.
"Provisions for the PSP amounting to €32.7 million were recognised at the re-
porting date of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: €47.0 million)."
"Of 
these provisions, €27.7 million were attributable to members of the Executive 
Board (2022: €22.8 million)."
"The total expense for PSP options in the 
reporting period amounted to €11.3 million (2022: €17.0 million)."
"Of that 
amount, an expense of €8.3 million was attributable to members of the Execu-
tive Board (2022: €13.1 million)."
The relevant allocation price for the PSP tranche 2023 was €168.05.
"The performance period for the PSP tranche 2023 ends on 31 December 
2027."
"Under the GSP tranche for the year 2023, the partic-
ipating employees could subscribe for up to 50 shares of the Company at a 
discount of 40 per cent and another 50 shares at a discount of 10 per cent."
The acquired shares are subject to a lock-up period of two years.
"The expense of this discount is recognised in the income statement at the 
grant date."
"In the reporting period, expenses totalling €7.4 million (2022: 
€6.3 million) were recognised in staff costs for the GSP."
"It grants a long-term remu-
neration component in the form of virtual shares in the former Qontigo sub-
group."
These are generally accounted for as sharebased payments.
"The remu-
neration payable to the beneficiaries is intended to reflect the economic devel-
opment of the former Qontigo sub-group."
"The MIP contains a time-based and 
a performance-based component."
"The vesting period is three years, and under 
certain circumstances can be exercised early."
"It began when the transaction 
was completed."
"Due to a potential payout with cash by Group Deutsche Börse, 
the MIP is accounted for under the principles of a cash-settlement."
"Valuation 
The value of the virtual shares is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation 
on the respective balance sheet date, which appropriately reflects the contract-
specific conditions."
"The underlying simulations depend on the underlying from 
which the payment is linked to the beneficiaries of the MIP."
"The enterprise 
value of the former Qontigo Group serves as the underlying."
"On the basis of 
the simulations carried out, a discounted average payment of the contractually 
agreed payment flows to the respective participants is calculated."
"The main 
valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected volatility of 
the former Qontigo Group as well as the expected term and the contract-spe-
cific payment profile."
"A pro rata addition of expenses over the vesting period is 
conducted in accordance with the criteria for a non-forfeiture of the pro-
gramme."
"ISS Employee Incentive Programme (EIP) 
An employee incentive programme has been set up for selected managers at 
ISS, which enables a long-term remuneration component in the form of virtual 
shares in ISS."
The programme is accounted for as share-based payments.
"The 
amounts awarded to the beneficiaries are intended to reflect the economic de-
velopment of ISS."
"The EIP contains a time-based and a performance-based 
component."
"The programme will be settled in the first quarter 2024 with 
shares in Deutsche Börse AG and is accounted for according to the rules for 
equity settlement."
"Valuation 
The value of the virtual shares was calculated at the date of allocation to the 
beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs."
"The 
main valuation parameters included the enterprise value and the expected vol-
atility of ISS, as well as the expected term and the contract-specific payment 
profile."
"In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award is recognised as 
an expense over the vesting period."
"ISS STOXX Employee Incentive Programme 
An employee incentive programme with market-standards conditions was set 
up for the senior management of the ISS STOXX sub-group."
"It grants a long-
term remuneration component in the form of virtual shares and a virtual divi-
dend right for the ISS STOXX sub-group."
"The programme enables the benefi-
ciaries to participate in long-term valuation increases, so the accounting princi-
ples for share-based remuneration apply."
"The vesting period is three years, and under certain circumstances can be ex-
ercised early."
"Grants to the programme beneficiaries were made in late 2023 
and early 2024."
"Since the main contractual conditions were agreed with the 
beneficiaries in 2023 and the employees had already started their work, 
Deutsche Börse Group started recognising the corresponding expenses in Q3 
2023."
"The virtual dividend right is settled in cash, so this component is ac-
counted for in accordance with the rules on cash settlement."
"Valuation 
The value of the virtual shares is calculated at the date of allocation to the 
beneficiaries, using a Black-Scholes model with contract-specific inputs."
"The 
main valuation parameters include the enterprise value and the expected vola-
tility of ISS STOXX, as well as the expected term."
"A pro rata addition of ex-
penses over the vesting period is conducted in accordance with the criteria for 
a non-forfeiture of the programme."
"The value of the virtual dividend right is 
measured at each reporting date using current market parameters."
"SimCorp Employee Incentive Programme 
Employee incentive programmes with market-standards conditions were set up 
for the senior management and employees of SimCorp, which are settled in 
cash."
"They pay a long-term remuneration component in the form of restricted 
stock units (RSU) with contingent claims during the vesting period."
"The pro-
gramme enables the beneficiaries to participate in long-term valuation in-
creases, so the accounting principles for share-based remuneration apply."
The vesting period is five years from the award date.
"The first allocations were 
made to the beneficiaries before Deutsche Börse Group acquired control of 
SimCorp."
"Deutsche Börse Group has the option of changing and/or adjusting the terms 
of the incentive programme in agreement with the Executive Board of SimCorp 
on condition that any such changes and/or adjustments do not reduce the 
overall value of the restricted stock units."
"Valuation 
The value of the restricted stock units was adjusted on the basis of the trans-
action price reflecting the value of SimCorp at the time of the takeover by 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"In line with the vesting criteria, the value of the award 
is recognised as an expense over the vesting period."
"The amount of the provision corre-
sponds to the best possible estimate of the outflow of resources required to ful-
fil the obligation as at the balance sheet date."
"A provision is only recognised for restructuring when a detailed, formal restruc-
turing plan has been adopted and those concerned have been given the rea-
sonable impression that the restructuring measures will be implemented."
"This 
can be by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its key elements to 
those concerned."
"These liabilities are not part of the financial liabili-
ties because the obligation does not consist of payment of cash but in physical 
delivery of commodities."
"In order to determine diluted earnings per share, potentially dilutive ordinary 
shares that may be acquired under the share-based payment programmes are 
added to the average number of shares."
"In order to determine diluted earnings per share, all subscription rights for 
which a cash settlement has not been determined are assumed to be settled 
with equity instruments – regardless of actual accounting in accordance with 
IFRS 2."
"All tranches of the Long-Term Sustainability Instrument (LSI) for which a 
choice between settlement in cash or equity instruments exists were settled in 
the year 2021."
All current and future tranches may only be settled in cash.
"There are therefore no potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the Long-Term 
Sustainability Instrument."
"As part of the employee incentive programmes at Institutional Shareholder Ser-
vices Inc."
"as well as SimCorp A/S there are ongoing option rights, which had a 
small dilutive effect."
"Detailed disclosures on the segment structure, which form part of these 
consolidated financial statements, can be found under the heading “Business 
operations and Group structure” in the section “Deutsche Börse: Fundamental 
information about the Group” in the combined management report."
"The effect of intercompany revenue is 
eliminated (in net revenue) at Group level, however, as the revenue generated 
within the Group by a segment has the same revenue-reducing effect in the re-
spective segment."
For an overview of intercompany revenue see note 4.
"Ser-
vices between segments are offset on the basis of measured amounts or fixed 
prices."
"Our business model – and that of all our segments – is focused on an interna-
tionally operating participant base and pricing does not differ depending on the 
customer’s location."
"From a price, margin and risk perspective, this means it 
does not matter whether sales revenue is generated from German or interna-
tional participants."
"The risks and returns from the activities of the subsidiaries operating within 
the economic environment of the European Monetary Union (EMU) do not dif-
fer significantly from each other on the basis of the factors to be considered in 
identifying information on geographical regions under IFRS 8."
"We have there-
fore identified the following regions: Euro area, other Europe, America and 
Asia-Pacific."
"Sales revenue is allocated to the individual regions according to the customer’s 
domicile, while investments and non-current assets are allocated according to 
the company’s domicile and employees according to their location."
"As described above, the analysis of sales is based on the direct customer’s bill-
ing address."
"that sales to an American investor trading a prod-
uct with an Asian underlying via a European clearing member are classified as 
European sales."
2) Excluding goodwill and right-of-use assets from leasing.
"4) These include intangible assets, property, plant and equipment as well as investments in associates and joint ventures."
"Financial risks mainly arise in the form of credit risks and to a lesser extent in 
the form of market price risks."
"They are quantified by reference to the eco-
nomic capital concept (for detailed disclosures, see the section “Financial 
risk”)."
"Required economic capital is assessed on a 99.9 per cent confidence 
level for a one-year holding period."
"It is compared with the Group’s liable eq-
uity capital so as to test the Group’s ability to absorb extreme and unexpected 
losses."
"Required economic capital (REC) for financial risk is calculated at the 
end of each month and amounted to €600.0 million as at 31 December 
2023."
We evaluate our risk position continuously.
"In the view of the Executive Board, 
no threat to the continued existence of the Group can be identified at this time."
"Further credit risks exist for fund interests and convertible bonds at fair value 
through profit or loss, for financial instruments of the central counterparties 
and derivative financial investments."
"Fundamentally and unless otherwise 
stated, the maximum risk exposure is the carrying amount shown in the con-
solidated statement of financial position."
"Cash investments 
Clearstream receives cash deposits from its customers in various currencies, 
whereby Eurex Clearing AG receives cash collateral, mainly in EUR and CHF, 
and European Commodity Clearing AG mainly in EUR."
"These units invest the 
funds received in accordance with the treasury policy, which gives rise to a po-
tential credit risk."
"We mitigate such risks either – to the extent possible – by investing short-term 
funds on a secured basis, e.g."
"via reverse repurchase agreements, or by de-
positing them with central banks."
"Eligible collateral for reverse repurchase agreements mainly consists of highly 
liquid financial instruments with a minimum rating of AA– (Standard & 
Poor’s/Fitch) or Aa3 (Moody’s) issued or guaranteed by governments or supra-
national institutions."
Counterparty credit risk is monitored on the basis of an internal rating system.
"Unsecured cash investments are permitted only with counterparties with in-
vestment grade ratings within the framework of defined counterparty credit 
limits."
"An investment grade rating in this context means an internal rating of at 
least D, which corresponds to an external Fitch rating of at least BBB."
"The carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements as at 31 December 
2023 was €9,424.2 million (2022: €6,805.2 million) and is shown in the 
items “Restricted bank balances” and “Financial assets measured at amortised 
cost”."
"The fair value of securities received as collateral under reverse repur-
chase agreements was €9,614.5 million (2022: €7,144.9 million)."
"and Eurex Clearing AG are entitled to pledge the eli-
gible securities received to their central banks in order to make use of the cen-
tral banks’ monetary policy instruments."
"Neither Clearstream Banking S.A nor Eurex Clearing AG had pledged securities 
to central banks as at 31 December 2023 (2022: Clearstream Banking S.A 
€451.3 million and Eurex Clearing AG €0.0 million)."
"In addition, Clearstream Banking S.A., Clearstream Banking Frankfurt AG and 
Eurex Clearing AG used forex swaps in the context of their cash investments."
"Loans for settling securities transactions 
Clearstream grants customers intraday technical overdraft facilities to maximise 
settlement efficiency."
"Lending takes place on a secured basis and the individ-
ual borrowing participants must provide full collateral for their credit limits in 
line with the EU regulation."
"These credit limits can be revoked at the discre-
tion of the Clearstream sub-group."
"As at 31 December 2023 they came to a 
total of €175.3 billion."
"€7.1 billion of the total is unsecured and only relates 
to credit lines granted in special exceptional cases to selected central banks 
and multilateral development banks, partly on the basis of the borrower’s 
credit rating and partly on a zero-risk weighting according to Regulation (EU) 
No."
"575/2013 (CRR) and after approval by the Executive Board of the Clear-
stream sub-group."
"Actual outstandings at the end of each business day generally represent a 
small fraction of the facilities and amounted to €392.7 million as at 31 
December 2023 (2022: €131.6 million)."
"The portfolio of deposited collateral 
is not directly attributed to any utilisation, but is determined by the scope of 
the entire business relationship and the limits granted."
"In addition, Clearstream guarantees the risks arising from the Automated Secu-
rities Fails Financing programme that it offers its clients, in which Clearstream 
Banking S.A."
acts as an intermediary between the lender and the borrower.
This risk is covered by pledged collateral on the borrower’s account.
"As at 
31 December 2023 the outstanding guarantees under this programme 
amounted to €521.7 million (2022: €1,385.2 million)."
"The securities 
pledged in connection with these loans amounted to €550.7 million (2022: 
€1,731.5 million)."
"Trade receivables 
The maximum credit risk for the item trade receivables is €1,840.5 million as 
at 31 December 2023 (2022: €2,295.7 million)."
"Trading, settlement and 
custody fees are generally collected without delay by direct debit."
"Fees for 
other services, such as the provision of data and information, are settled 
mainly by transfer."
"Trade receivables are analysed using an expected credit 
loss model based on the simplified approach as outlined in IFRS 9."
"To meas-
ure the expected credit loss, trade receivables and contract assets have been 
grouped based on the days past due."
"The trade receivables share the main risk 
characteristics."
"The expected loss amount has been determined by applying 
the lifetime expected loss approach."
"The expected loss rates are based on the 
payment profiles over a period of five years and the loss profile experienced 
over that period."
"The following criteria are used for the assessment of derecognition: 
 Insolvency proceedings are not started for want of assets."
" Insolvency proceedings have not resulted in any payment for a period of 
three years, and there is no indication that any amount will be received going 
forward."
"In the reporting year, as in the previous year there were no significant write-
offs due to customer defaults (2022: nil)."
"Contract assets 
The maximum credit risk for the item contract assets was €375.5 million as at 
31 December 2023 (2022: nil)."
"Impairments of €3.0 million were recognised 
on contract assets as at 31 December 2023."
"No contract assets were recog-
nised as at 31 December 2022."
"Contract assets relate to rights to considera-
tion from customers for software licences under subscription agreements with 
future payments, if this right depends on future performance by us."
"Contract 
assets from contracts with customers are measured at amortised cost less ex-
pected credit losses."
"Contract assets come within the scope of the IFRS 9 im-
pairment testing rules."
"The simplified approach is used and the expected credit 
loss over the entire term is estimated."
"All debt securities are con-
sidered to have low default risk and the loss allowance recognised during the 
period was therefore limited to twelve months’ expected losses."
"The Group 
considers listed bonds to have a low credit risk if they have an investment 
grade credit rating from an external rating agency."
"This resulted in a reclassification to the item “Other financial assets measured at 
amortised cost” in the amount of € 1.5 million."
"This amount 
represents the risk-based view of Eurex Clearing AG and European Commodity 
Clearing AG, while the carrying amount of the “financial instruments held by 
central counterparties” item in the balance sheet shows the gross amount of 
the open trades according to IAS 32."
"The amount of collateral deposited for the financial in-
struments of the central counterparties was €122,728.0 million as at 31 De-
cember 2023 (2022: €182,104.6 million)."
"This amount represents the collat-
eral value of cash and securities collateral deposited for margins, covering the 
net value of all margin and default fund requirements 
Additional security mechanisms of the Group’s central counterparties are de-
scribed in detail in the section “Risk report”."
"Credit risk concentrations 
Our business model and the resulting business relationships mean that credit 
risk is concentrated in the financial services sector."
"Credit limits for counter-
parties prevent any excessive concentration of credit risks on individual coun-
terparties."
Concentrations of collateral are also monitored.
We also apply additional methods in order to detect credit concentration risks.
"We analyse the impact of a default by our two largest counterparties with un-
secured commitments and stressed recovery parameters."
"In addition, analyses 
are carried out for the Group’s top 5 and top 10 counterparties, based on the 
risk-weighted commitments of the individual counterparties."
"All the concentra-
tion metrics have dedicated early warning thresholds and limits and are part of 
the quarterly risk reporting to the Executive Board."
"As in the previous year, no 
material adverse credit concentrations were detected in 2023."
"Deutsche Börse Group is generally only affected to a lim-
ited extent by market risk."
"The economic capital required for market price risks (based on the Value at 
Risk (VaR) with a confidence level of 99.9 per cent) is calculated at the end of 
each month."
"As of 31 December 2023 the economic capital for market price 
risks was €143.0 million (2022: €114.0 million)."
"In the 2023 financial year, no impairment losses (2022: €1.0 million) were 
recognised in profit or loss for entities accounted for using the equity method 
that are not included in the VaR for market risk."
"Interest rate risk 
Changes in market interest rates may affect Deutsche Börse Group’s net in-
come for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders."
"This risk 
arises whenever interest terms of financial assets and liabilities are different."
"Interest-rate-sensitive assets include the Group’s money market and invest-
ment portfolios, while interest rate sensitive liabilities mainly consist of short-
term debt instruments."
"Interest rate risk from long-term liabilities of Deutsche 
Börse AG is mitigated through issuance of fixed-coupon bonds."
"In line with our risk strategy, we may use financial instruments to hedge exist-
ing or highly probable interest rate exposures."
"For this purpose, interest rate 
swaps, as well as swaptions, might be used."
"Our treasury policy requires the 
critical parameters of the hedging instruments to match the hedged items."
"Deutsche Börse Group issued three fixed rate bonds with a total nominal value 
of €3 billion in 2023 in connection with the takeover of SimCorp."
"To hedge 
the long-term financing against unexpected interest rate increases, three for-
ward starting deal contingent interest rate swaps with a nominal value of  
€2 billion were taken out in May 2023."
"These swaps were dissolved when the 
fixed interest bonds were issued in September 2023."
"Cash flow hedge  
accounting was applied to this hedging."
"Details of Deutsche Börse Group’s 
outstanding bonds can be found in the  “Financial position” section of the 
combined management report."
"Cash received as deposits from market participants is invested mainly via 
short-term reverse repos and in the form of overnight deposits at central banks, 
limiting the risk of a negative impact due to a changed interest rate environ-
ment."
"Negative interest rates resulting from reinvestments of these cash depos-
its are passed on to the respective Clearstream customers after applying an ad-
ditional margin."
"For Eurex Clearing AG, interest rates on cash collateral are in 
principle calculated based on a predefined market benchmark rate per cur-
rency after deducting an additional spread per currency."
"In exceptional cases 
such as market disruption, Eurex Clearing AG reserves the right to calculate in-
terest rates on cash collateral based on the recognised interest rate."
"Group entities may furthermore invest their own capital and part of customer 
cash balances in high-quality liquid bonds."
"The risk from interest-bearing assets and liabilities is monitored every business 
day and systematically limited."
"The system consists of a combined limit metric 
(CLM) that covers both liquidity and interest rate risk."
"The interest rate risk 
limits determine the acceptable maximum loss caused by a hypothetical ad-
verse yield curve shift."
"In this way, the cash flow risk arising from potential interest rate changes was 
hedged."
Cash flow hedge accounting was applied to this hedging.
"The three main types of foreign-ex-
change risk that we are exposed to are cash flow-, translation- and transac-
tion-related foreign-exchange risk."
"Cash flow risk reflects the risk of fluctua-
tions in the present value of future operating cash flows from foreign-exchange 
movements."
"Translation risk comprises effects from the valuation to our assets 
and liabilities in foreign currencies."
"Finally, transaction risk is closely related to 
cash flow risk; it may arise through changes in the structure of asset and lia-
bilities in foreign currencies."
"We operate internationally and are, to a limited extent, exposed to foreign-ex-
change risk, primarily in US$, Fr., £ and Kč."
"Exchange rate fluctuations may 
affect our profit margins and the value of assets and liabilities denominated in 
a currency that is not the functional currency of the relevant Group entity."
Currency mismatches are avoided to the maximum extent possible.
"All types of 
foreign exchange risk are measured regularly and monitored at Group level."
"Limits are set for the cash flow and currency translation risks that affect our 
gains and losses."
"Deutsche Börse Group’s treasury policy defines risk limits 
which take into account historic foreign-exchange rate fluctuations."
"Any expo-
sure exceeding those limits must be hedged."
"Foreign-exchange exposures be-
low the defined limits may also be hedged."
"Management of foreign-exchange 
risks is in principle based on the Group level."
"Hedging may take place on a 
single entity level if foreign-exchange risk threatens the viability of the single 
entity."
"To eliminate foreign-exchange risks we use financial instruments to hedge ex-
isting or highly probable forecast transactions."
"The Group may use foreign-ex-
change forwards, foreign-exchange options as well as cross-currency swaps to 
hedge the exposure to foreign-exchange risk."
"Under the Group’s policy, the 
critical terms of forwards and options must align with the hedged items."
"entered into foreign-exchange forwards in 2023 to 
hedge part of the risk from the result of treasury activities in banking and simi-
lar business in US$."
"In addition, the Group uses foreign exchange derivatives 
to hedge foreign exchange risks in connection with internal cash pooling and 
loans."
"For the CTAs, the invest-
ment is protected by a predefined floor, which reduces the risk of extreme 
losses for Deutsche Börse Group."
"In addition, there are equity price risks aris-
ing from strategic equity investments."
"Liquidity risk 
For us, liquidity risk may arise from potential difficulties in renewing maturing 
financing, such as commercial paper, issued bonds as well as bilateral and 
syndicated credit facilities."
"Financing arrangements required for unexpected 
events may also result in a liquidity risk."
"Most of our cash investments are 
short-term to ensure that liquidity is available, should such a financing need 
arise."
"Term investments can be transacted via reverse repurchase agreements 
against highly liquid collateral."
"For refinancing purposes, Eurex Clearing AG 
and Clearstream Banking S.A."
"can pledge eligible securities with their respec-
tive central banks."
"In terms of the maturities of the cash spreads received from 
customers and its corresponding investments, Eurex Clearing is almost per-
fectly matched."
"The companies of Deutsche Börse Group have the following credit lines at 
their disposal, which were not recognised as of the balance sheet date."

"has also issued a guar-
antee in favour of Clearstream Banking S.A."
"amounting to US$ 3.0 billion 
(2022: US$3.0 billion)."
"A commercial paper programme offers Deutsche Börse AG and subsidiaries an 
opportunity for flexible, short-term financing, involving a total facility of 
€3.5 billion in various currencies."
"We had issued commercial paper with a 
nominal volume of €1,142.1 million as at 31 December (2022: €566.0 mil-
lion) 
In 2023, after the successful acquisition of SimCorp, Standard & Poor’s down-
graded Deutsche Börse AG’s long-term issuer credit rating to AA–."
"Deutsche 
Börse AG’s commercial paper programme also had the highest short-term rat-
ing of A-1+."
The AA rating of Clearstream Banking S.A.
"was confirmed with a 
stable outlook by the rating agencies Fitch and S&P Global Ratings (S&P) in 
2023."
S&P also rated Clearstream Banking AG as AA in November 2023.
"For 
further details on the rating of Deutsche Börse Group, see section “Financial 
position” section in the combined management report."
"Such litiga-
tion may result in payments by entities in the Group."
"If it is more likely than 
not that an outflow of resources will occur, a provision will be recognised 
based on an estimate of the most probable amount necessary to settle the obli-
gation if such amount is reasonably estimable."
"The management of the entity 
affected must assess whether the possible obligation results from a past event, 
as well as evaluate the probability of a cash outflow and estimate its amount."
"We recognise provisions for possible losses only if there is a present obligation 
arising from a past event that is likely to result in an outflow of resources and 
if the Group can reliably estimate the amount of the obligation (see also note 
19)."
"Contingent liabilities may result from present obligations and from possi-
ble obligations arising from events in the past."
"Losses also may arise from legal risks which are not highly probable, so that 
no provisions have been recognised."
"If the event is not completely improbable, 
the legal risks may have to be recognised as contingent liabilities."
"As neither 
the timing of these contingent liabilities nor the amount of any payment can be 
estimated reliably, any quantitative disclosure would not be a useful guide to 
possible future losses."
"For this reason, no figure is shown for contingent liabili-
ties."
"The main legal disputes that have been classified as contingent liabilities as at 
31 December 2023 and for which consequently no provisions have been rec-
ognised as at 31 December 2023 are described below."
Litigation involving Clearstream Banking S.A.
"in connection with the Central 
Bank of Iran 
Clearstream Banking S.A."
"is involved in different legal proceedings in Luxem-
bourg and the U.S."
"in connection with the Iranian central bank, Bank Markazi."

"On the other hand, Bank Markazi is suing, among others, Clearstream Banking 
S.A."
"in Luxembourg in connection with assets that currently or in the past

holds as a custodian in Luxembourg.
"In connection with assets concerning Bank Markazi, Bank Markazi on 17 Jan-
uary 2018 filed a complaint in Luxembourg court naming Clearstream Banking 
S.A."
"The complaint primarily seeks the 
restitution of assets totalling approximately USD 4.9 billion (plus interest), 
which the complaint alleges are held on accounts of Banca UBAE S.p.A."
"and 
Bank Markazi with Clearstream Banking S.A."

stream Banking S.A."
has filed an appeal against the decision.
"On 15 June 2018, Banca UBAE S.p.A."
"filed a complaint against Clearstream 
Banking S.A."

"in the event that 
Banca UBAE S.p.A."
"loses the legal dispute brought by Bank Markazi and is or-
dered by the court to pay damages to Bank Markazi."
Independent of whether Clearstream Banking S.A.
"should be required to turn 
over assets attributed to Bank Markazi in the U.S., the Executive Board of 
Clearstream Banking S.A."
"does not think that claims for damages raised 
against Clearstream Banking S.A."
in Luxembourg or in the U.S.
"Based on this, as of 31 December 2023 and unchanged from the pre-
vious year, no provisions were made in connection with the aforementioned 
matters."

course of these measures, Deutsche Börse Group entities were made aware 
that the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Cologne has extended the group of sus-
pects to include current and former employees as well as executive board 
members of Deutsche Börse Group companies."
"In 2020 and again in 2022, 
Deutsche Börse Group became aware of further extensions of the group of sus-
pects."
"Due to the still early stage of the proceedings, it is still not possible to 
predict timing, scope or consequences of a potential decision."
"The companies 
concerned are cooperating with the competent authorities."
"They do not expect 
that they could be successfully held liable."
"Tax risks 
Due to its business activities in various countries, Deutsche Börse Group is ex-
posed to tax risks."
"A process has been developed to recognise and evaluate 
these risks, which are initially recognised based on their probability of occur-
rence."
These risks are then measured on the basis of their expected value.
"A 
tax liability is recognised in the event that it is more probable than not that the 
risks will occur."
"We continuously review whether the conditions for recognising 
corresponding tax liabilities are met."
"Full provision has been made in the balance sheet for any tax and interest 
back-payments that may result and the corresponding appeals have been 
lodged."
"We assume that the tax authorities will at least query the points (i) and 
(ii) mentioned above for the years from 2009 onwards for which the tax as-
sessments are not yet definitive."
"Business relationships with related parties 
The following table shows transactions entered into within the scope of busi-
ness relationships with non-consolidated companies of Deutsche Börse AG

pervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG who were active in the reporting period

agement personnel."

view, expenses of €8.3 million (2022: €13.1 million) were recognised in con-
nection with share-based payments to Executive Board members."

members was €17.9 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: €14.5 million)."

ber 2023 (2022: €58.4 million)."

Börse AG in 2023, so no expenses were incurred (2022: zero)."

"In accordance with the 
German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement 
on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, 
	
■the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material 
respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional 
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit 
has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit 
Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for 
Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under 
those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of 
the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report."
"We are 
independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of 
European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have 
fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of 
the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit 
services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe 
that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements, on the group management report and on the non-financial 
statement included in the group management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were 
of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for 
the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a 
separate audit opinion on these matters."
"The other intangible assets relate in 
particular to stock exchange licences, brand names and customer 
relationships."
"Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite 
useful life are tested for impairment once a year or on an ad hoc basis, 
while other intangible assets with a definite useful life are tested for 
impairment on an ad hoc basis by the company in order to identify any 
need for impairment."
"The recoverable amount is generally determined on the basis of 
the fair value less costs to sell."
"The measurement is generally based on 
the present value of future cash flows of the respective cash-generating 
units or groups of cash-generating units."
"The present values are 
determined using discounted cash flow models."
"The Group‘s approved 
medium-term planning forms the starting point, which is extrapolated 
using assumptions about long-term growth rates."
"Expectations about 
future market developments and assumptions about the development of 
macroeconomic factors are also taken into account."
"Discounting is carried 
out using the weighted average cost of capital of the respective (groups of) 
cash-generating units."
"As a result of the impairment test, an impairment requirement totalling 
€ 24.6 million was identified."
"Against this background and due to the complexity of the 
valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our 
audit."
"➁	 
As part of our audit, we first analysed the methodology used to perform 
the impairment test."
"In addition, we assessed the appropriate 
consideration of the costs of Group functions - where taken into account 
in the models - and the appropriateness of the growth assumptions after 
the forecast period and the assumed weighted average cost of capital."
"In 
addition, we assessed the company‘s valuation by comparing the implied 
multiples with market multiples."
"In order to take account of the existing 
forecast uncertainties, we reviewed the sensitivity analyses prepared by 
the company."
"Where there was a need for impairment as at the balance 
sheet date, we verified the appropriate recognition of the impairment 
losses."
"The valuation methods, parameters and assumptions applied by the legal 
representatives are in line with our expectations and are also within what 
we consider to be reasonable ranges."
"➂	 
The company‘s disclosures on the impairment test for goodwill and other 
intangible assets are contained in section „10 Intangible assets“ of the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Following further share purchases and the 
implementation of a squeeze-out under stock corporation law, the 
company held 100% of the shares in SimCorp as at the balance 
sheet date."
"The acquisition was recognised as a business combination in accordance 
with IFRS 3 using the acquisition method."
"As part of the purchase price 
allocation, the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired 
company were recognised at fair value."
"The purchase price allocation had 
not yet been finalised as at the reporting date, as it was not yet possible 
to conclusively determine the tax items and intangible assets in particular."
"The comparison of the consideration transferred with the acquired assets 
and liabilities resulted in provisional goodwill of € 2,335.6 million."
"➁	 
As part of our audit of the acquisition of SimCorp, we first inspected and 
analysed the contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price 
determined as consideration for the acquired business operations with the 
evidence provided to us."
"Based on this, we assessed the company‘s 
approach to measuring the identifiable assets and liabilities at their fair 
values at the acquisition date."
"Among other things, we analysed the 
models underlying the valuations as well as the valuation parameters and 
assumptions applied with the assistance of valuation specialists."
"Furthermore, we analysed the adjustment of the groups of cash-
generating units at whose level goodwill is monitored, which was carried 
out as part of the SimCorp acquisition."
"In addition, we assessed the 
disclosures required by IFRS 3."
"➂	 
The company‘s disclosures on the acquisition are contained in section 
„02 Consolidation principles“ of the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"➌	 Assessment of certain legal risks
➀	 
Deutsche Börse Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliated companies are 
exposed to certain legal risks."
"These certain legal risks include legal 
disputes of Clearstream Banking S.A., Luxembourg, in connection with 
the Central Bank of Iran, in which Clearstream Banking S.A."
"is exposed to 
claims for restitution and damages against the Central Bank of Iran in the 
amount of USD 4.9 billion (plus interest) and claims by other groups of 
plaintiffs, a claim by the insolvency administrator of Air Berlin PLC i.L."
"against Clearstream Banking AG for payment of around €498 million and 
an investigation relating to securities transactions by market participants 
over the dividend record date (cum-ex transactions)."
"The assessment of 
whether and, if so, to what extent a provision is required to cover the risk 
is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty."
"No provisions were recognised for the above-
mentioned legal risks in the consolidated financial statements as at 31 
December 2023, as the executive directors do not consider an outflow of 
funds to be probable."
"In our view, the above-mentioned legal risks are of particular significance 
for our audit due to their legal complexity, the considerable uncertainties 
regarding their further development and their potential impact on the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations."
"➁	 
As part of our audit, we inspected the underlying documents relating to 
the above-mentioned legal disputes and proceedings and analysed the 
legal assessments of Deutsche Börse Group."
"In addition, we 
held regular discussions with the legal departments of the companies in 
order to understand current developments and the reasons that led to the 
corresponding assessments of the outcome of the proceedings."
"The 
development of the specific legal risks, including the assessments of the 
legal representatives with regard to the possible outcomes of the 
proceedings, was made available to us in writing by the legal 
departments."
"In addition, we obtained external lawyers‘ confirmations as 
at the balance sheet date and analysed legal opinions from external 
lawyers."
"The estimates made by the legal representatives regarding the 
aforementioned matters and their presentation in the consolidated 
financial statements are adequately substantiated and documented."
"➂	 
The company‘s disclosures on the material legal risks are presented in the 
section „25 Financial commitments and other risks“ in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements."
"Other Information
The executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"The other 
information comprises the statement on corporate governance pursuant to 
§ 289f HGB and § 315d HGB as an unaudited part of the group management 
report."
"1 HGB and that the consolidated financial 
statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the 
Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are 
responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related 
to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting 
based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative 
but to do so."
"The executive directors are also responsible for the preparation of the 
non-financial statement included in the group management report in 
accordance with the applicable German legal and European requirements as 
well as with the specifying criteria disclosed by the Group’s executive 
directors."
"The applicable requirements contain wording and terms that are subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which authoritative 
comprehensive interpretations have not yet been published."
"Accordingly, the 
executive directors have disclosed their interpretations of such wording and 
terms in section „About this report“ of the non-financial statement."
"The 
executive directors are responsible for the defensibility of these interpretations."
"As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or 
courts, the legal conformity of these interpretations is uncertain."
"Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements and this group management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism 
throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"■Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive 
directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive 
directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required 
to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the 
consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"■Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express 
audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and

ments of section 162 Aktiengesetz (Stock Corporation Act, AktG) and follows 
the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance 
Code (GCGC) as amended on 28 April 2022."
"Above and beyond the requirements of section 162 (3) AktG, the remuneration 
report was reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft both in a formal as well as a material audit."
"The remuneration report and the attached memorandum on the review of the 
remuneration report can be found on the Deutsche Börse AG website at 
https://www.deutsche-boerse.com > Investor Relations > Corporate Govern-
ance > Remuneration."
"Review of the 2023 financial year 
This review of the 2023 financial year explains the context in which the remu-
neration decisions were taken and enables their comprehensive perception."
"Approval of the remuneration report 2022 by the Annual General 
Meeting 2023 
The remuneration report for the 2022 financial year was presented to the An-
nual General Meeting in 2023 for approval."
"The Annual General Meeting ap-
proved the remuneration report for 2022 by a majority of 91.69 per cent."
"This 
was the second report on the implementation of the remuneration system that 
was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2021 (2021 remuneration 
system) with a majority of 94.97 per cent."
"Thereafter, the Supervisory Board discussed the feedback from shareholders 
and proxy advisers provided as part of the consultation on the remuneration  
report."
"In view of the continued high approval rate and the positive feedback 
from shareholders and proxy advisers, the Supervisory Board does not cur-
rently see any reason to make fundamental changes to the remuneration  
report."
The last adjustment was made seven years earlier in 2016.
"Over this 
period, the size of Deutsche Börse Group and the complexity of its business 
model, as well as of regulatory requirements, increased significantly, which 
means that the scope and volume of the Executive Board members’ responsi-
bilities have also continued to increase."
"Deutsche Börse Group’s strong growth 
is reflected in its financial performance indicators and in the number of divi-
sions, business models, employees and regions in which it operates world-
wide."
"In line with the objectives of the corporate strategy “Compass 2023”, 
Deutsche Börse Group has achieved significant organic and inorganic growth."
"Two of the most important takeovers in the Group’s history took place in this 
period: the takeover of ISS and the acquisition of SimCorp A/S that was com-
pleted in the 2023 financial year."
"This growth implies greater responsibilities 
for the Executive Board members, in a global market environment that is diffi-
cult overall and is also governed by an increasingly complex legal and regula-
tory framework."
by 5 per cent for the 2023 financial year.
"No changes 
were made to the company pensions of the Executive Board members in this 
context."
The adjustment is in line with the 2021 remuneration system.
"At the 
same time, the Supervisory Board reviewed the appropriateness of Executive 
Board remuneration in the 2023 financial year to ensure that the amount of 
remuneration is still in line with the market and continues to meet regulatory 
requirements."
"Further information on the review of appropriateness can be 
found in the section “Appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration”."
"Performance and target achievement in 2023 
The Supervisory Board believes it is vitally important to have a clear link be-
tween Executive Board members’ remuneration and their performance (“pay 
for performance”)."
"A large proportion of Executive Board remuneration there-
fore consists of performance-based remuneration components."
"For this reason, 
and because strategically relevant indicators are used as performance criteria, 
the amount of Executive Board remuneration is closely linked to the perfor-
mance of Deutsche Börse Group."
"Deutsche Börse Group was able to exceed its original forecast significantly in 
the 2023 financial year."
"Both net revenue and EBITDA increased by 
17 per cent in 2023."
Earnings per share went up by 15 per cent.
"The performance of Deutsche Börse Group was influenced by both secular and 
cyclical growth factors."
"Structural growth was achieved largely by means of 
new customer wins and increased market share, expanding customer relation-
ships and innovative products."
"Cyclical growth effects stemmed particularly 
from the global increase in interest rates."
"In combination with an only moder-
ate decrease in cash deposits by customers in the Securities Services and 
Fund Services segments, this led to strong growth in net interest income at 
Clearstream."
"Higher interest rates and a general reduction in the money supply 
also had a positive impact on the use of interest rate derivatives and repo 
products from Eurex and Eurex Repo in the Trading & Clearing segment."
"In 
this context, the rise in the outstanding notional volume of centrally cleared 
over-the-counter (OTC) traded and euro-denominated interest rate derivatives 
had a positive impact on net revenue."
"Significantly higher trading volumes for 
electricity derivatives on the EEX also led to an increase in net revenue in the 
Trading & Clearing segment."
"This was due to lower margin requirements as 
volatility on electricity and gas markets was lower, and additional market 
share."
"The newly created Investment Management Solutions segment profited 
from both sustained demand for ISS products in Governance Solutions, Corpo-
rate Solutions and ESG, and from contract renewals with customers in the An-
alytics business."
"The acquisition of SimCorp A/S also made a key contribution 
to M&A growth in this segment from the fourth quarter."
"Deutsche Börse Group substantially strengthened its strategic position in key 
growth markets overall, and again improved its line-up for further organic 
growth and future competitiveness."
"This applies particularly to the ongoing 
strategic development of the pre-trading business, with the creation of the new 
Investment Management Solutions segment."
"The successful performance in 2023, which included signifi-
cantly outperforming ambitious targets for further increases in net revenue and 
EBITDA, was also reflected in the average achievement of 178.78 per cent for 
the performance bonus."
"Net revenue and EBITDA, in addition to individual tar-
gets, are the three equally weighted criteria for the Performance Bonus."
"The following chart shows the average overall target achievement of the Execu-
tive Board members in the Performance Bonus for 2023: 
 
 
A detailed description of the performance criteria, target achievement and re-
sulting payouts can be found in the chapter “Performance Bonus”."
"The tranche of the Performance Share Plan (PSP) granted in 2019 (PSP 
Tranche 2019) ended at the close of the 2023 financial year."
"The overall tar-
get achievement in the PSP Tranche 2019 of 162.69 per cent reflects 
Deutsche Börse Group’s continued strong growth over the five-year perfor-
mance period."
"Targets were exceeded for both the performance criterion “Ad-
justed Net Income Growth” and the performance criterion “Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) Performance”."
"The target achievement for relative TSR not only 
reflects the strong absolute performance of the Deutsche Börse share on the 
capital market, but also its above-average relative performance compared with 
the relevant peer group."
"Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board 
There were no changes among the members of the Executive Board and Su-
pervisory Board in 2023."
"Choosing suitable perfor-
mance criteria for performance-based remuneration sets incentives to manage 
the company sustainably and successfully over the long term and to drive the 
realisation of its strategic objectives."
"In order to support a strong equity culture 
and further align the interests of the Executive Board and shareholders, most 
of the performance-based remuneration components are share-based."
"Executive Board remuneration is based on the principle that Executive Board 
members should receive appropriate remuneration in line with their perfor-
mance, functions and responsibilities."
"By setting ambitious performance crite-
ria, the Supervisory Board follows a strict pay-for-performance approach."
"The 
long-term structure of the remuneration system, as expressed in the largely 
multi-year assessment basis for the performance-based remuneration compo-
nents, also avoids creating incentives for taking unreasonable risks."
"The 
remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board is presented to the An-
nual General Meeting for approval."
"The Supervisory Board reviews the remu-
neration system regularly with the support of its Nomination Committee."
"After 
any significant changes, but not less than every four years, the Supervisory 
Board again presents the remuneration system to the Annual General Meeting 
for approval."
"Appropriateness of Executive Board remuneration 
The remuneration of Executive Board members is determined by the Supervi-
sory Board on the basis of the remuneration system, whereby the Nomination 
Committee prepares the Supervisory Board’s decision."
"The Supervisory Board 
ensures that remuneration is appropriate to the corresponding Executive Board 
member’s tasks and performance, as well as to the company’s financial situa-
tion, and that it does not exceed common market pay levels without special 
justification."
"For this purpose, the Supervisory Board conducts a regular hori-
zontal and vertical peer group comparison, generally every other year."
"To do so, the Supervisory Board may engage external experts who are inde-
pendent of the Executive Board and the company."
"The horizontal comparison 
is based on relevant national and international peer groups."
"The Supervisory 
Board selects the peer groups based on the criteria country, size and industry 
sector as stipulated in AktG."
"Based on the country criterion and given their 
comparable size, DAX-listed companies are considered as a suitable peer 
group for the purpose of the horizontal comparison."
"In order to reflect the in-
dustry-sector criterion, European financial institutions were used as customers 
and competitors of Deutsche Börse Group, as well as international stock ex-
change operators as additional peer groups."
"In this context, senior managers mean the two management levels below 
the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board considers the remuneration ratio 
with regard to the employees of Deutsche Börse AG and the employees of 
Deutsche Börse Group overall."
The last review of appropriateness took place in the 2023 financial year.
"The 
Supervisory Board was supported by an independent external advisor and the 
Executive Board remuneration was found to be appropriate."
"Target remuneration 
In their service contract, each Executive Board member is promised a target re-
muneration in line with common market levels, which depends largely on their 
relevant knowledge and experience for the role."
"It is also based on the target 
remuneration for the other Executive Board members."
"As described in the 
chapter “Review of the 2023 financial year”, the target remuneration of the Ex-
ecutive Board members was adjusted in the 2023 financial year and the target 
direct remuneration increased as of 1 July 2023 by 10 per cent p.a., i.e."
"by 
5 per cent for the 2023 financial year."
"On this basis, the total target remuner-
ation for the Executive Board members for 2023 was as follows:

"In the 2021 remuneration system, maximum remuneration for the Chief 
Executive Officer is €12,000,000 and for the ordinary Executive Board mem-
bers €6,000,000."
"It will only be possible to report on compliance with maximum remuneration 
for 2023 after the payout for the tranche of Performance Shares granted in 
2023."
"To the extent that the payout from Performance Shares would result in 
the maximum remuneration being exceeded, the payout would be reduced ac-
cordingly to ensure compliance with the maximum remuneration."
"A maximum remuneration also existed prior to the 2021 remuneration system 
to cap the annual payouts from remuneration components."
"It was set at 
€9,500,000 for each active Executive Board member and was always com-
plied with."
"Overview of the remuneration structure for Executive Board  
members 
In structuring the remuneration, the Supervisory Board strives to ensure that 
the overall framework for remuneration within the Executive Board is as uni-
form as possible."
"The remuneration system for Executive Board members con-
sists of non-performance-based and performance-based components."
"The non-performance-based remuneration components consist of base salary, 
contractual fringe benefits and provisions for retirement and risk protection."
"The performance-based component consists of the Performance Bonus and the 
Performance Shares."
"In addition, the company’s share ownership guidelines require Executive Board 
members to invest a substantial amount in Deutsche Börse AG shares during 
their term of office."
"The following overview shows the main elements of the 2021 remuneration 
system."
"Furthermore, around 70 per cent of 
this performance-based remuneration has a multi-year assessment basis and 
is also share-based."
"This ensures that the remuneration structure is aligned 
with the company’s sustainable long-term development."
"It also ensures that 
the performance-based remuneration to reward the achievement of long-term 
targets is higher than that for short-term targets and that the interests of the 
Executive Board are aligned with those of shareholders."
"The base salary accounts for around 30 per cent of the target direct remunera-
tion."
"The Performance Bonus, which is paid out after the respective financial 
year, accounts for approx."
22.5 per cent of the target direct remuneration.
"The 
Performance Bonus, which is available to the Executive Board members after a 
further four financial years (performance-based restricted stock) also accounts 
for approx."
Performance Shares account for approx.
"25 per cent 
of the target direct remuneration."
"When setting the amount of base salary, 
the Supervisory Board is guided by the relevant knowledge and experience of 
the Executive Board members for their respective role."
"Fringe benefits 
Executive Board members receive contractually agreed fringe benefits."
"These 
include, inter alia, an appropriate company car for business and personal use."
They also receive taxable contributions towards private pensions.
"In addition, 
the company takes out appropriate insurance coverage for them."
"This included 
accident insurance in the 2023 financial year."
"Another fringe benefit in the 
2023 financial year was the use of carpool vehicles or vehicles with drivers."
"Executive Board members were not granted any other fringe benefits in the 
2023 financial year apart from those mentioned."
"In the 2023 financial year, there was also directors & officers (D&O) insurance 
for Executive Board members."
"Pension and risk coverage 
As another non-performance-based component of the remuneration system the 
Executive Board members are entitled to a pension as well as invalidity and 
life insurance."
"The members of the Executive Board are generally entitled to receive retire-
ment benefits upon reaching the age of 60, provided that they are no longer in 
the service of Deutsche Börse AG at that time."
"A different rule applies to 
Thomas Book, who is entitled to retirement benefits on reaching the age of 63."
"The Supervisory Board reviews and determines the pensionable income that is 
used as the basis for retirement benefits."
"Executive Board members normally 
receive a defined contribution pension."
"An exception applies to Executive 
Board members with existing entitlements from previous positions within 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"In this case, they may receive a defined benefit pen-
sion instead."
This exception only applies to Thomas Book.
"Defined contribution pension system 
The rules of the defined contribution pension scheme apply to Theodor Wei-
mer, Christoph Böhm, Heike Eckert, Stephan Leithner and Gregor Pottmeyer."
"Under the defined contribution pension scheme, the company makes an an-
nual capital contribution to the scheme for each calendar year that a member 
serves on the Executive Board."
"This pension contribution is calculated by ap-
plying an individual contribution rate to their pensionable income."
"The Super-
visory Board determines and regularly reviews the pensionable income."
"The 
annual capital contributions calculated in this way bear interest of at least 
3 per cent per annum."
"As a rule, retirement benefits are paid as a monthly 
pension."
"However, the Executive Board member may choose for payment to be 
made in the form of a one-off lump sum or as five instalments."
"The entitle-
ments vest in accordance with the provisions of Betriebsrentengesetz (German 
Company Pensions Act)."
"The re-
quirement is that the respective Executive Board member was in office for at 
least three years and was reappointed at least once."
"As is the case under the 
defined contribution scheme, the Supervisory Board determines and regularly 
reviews the pensionable income."
"The replacement rate depends on the length 
of Executive Board service and number of reappointments, and amounts to a 
maximum of 50 per cent."
"The payment terms and the rules governing vesting 
correspond to those of the defined contribution scheme."
"Members of the Executive Board are entitled to an early pension if the com-
pany does not extend their service agreements, unless the reasons for doing so 
are attributable to the Executive Board member or would justify terminating the 
agreement without observance of a notice period."
"As in the case of a retire-
ment pension, the amount of the early pension is calculated by applying the 
replacement rate to the respective pensionable income."
"Executive Board mem-
bers with a defined contribution pension are not eligible for an early pension."
"Permanent incapacity to work and death benefits 
A key element of the retirement benefits is insurance coverage for Executive 
Board members in the event of permanent incapacity for work or death."
"If an 
Executive Board member has a permanent occupational disability, the com-
pany has the right to put that Executive Board member into retirement."
"A per-
manent occupational disability arises if the Executive Board member is incapa-
ble of working for more than six months and it is not expected that they will be 
fit to return to work within another six months."
"In this case, Executive Board 
members with defined benefit pensions receive an amount calculated by ap-
plying the achieved replacement rate to the respective pensionable income."
"Executive Board members with defined contribution pensions receive the plan 
assets already accrued when the pension benefits fall due, plus a supplement."
"The supplement corresponds to the full annual pension contribution that 
would have been due in the year of departure multiplied by the number of 
years between the date on which the pension benefits fall due and the Execu-
tive Board member’s sixtieth birthday."
"If an Executive Board member dies, 
their surviving spouse receives 60 per cent and each eligible child 10 per cent 
(for full orphans: 25 per cent) of the amount presented above, however up to 
a maximum of 100 per cent of the pension contribution."
"Transitional payments 
In the event that an Executive Board member becomes permanently incapable 
of working, the defined benefit pension agreements for Executive Board mem-
bers provide for a transitional payment."
"The amount of this payment corre-
sponds to the target amount of performance-based remuneration (Performance 
Bonus and Performance Shares) in the year in which the event triggering the 
benefits occurs."
It is paid out in two tranches in the two following years.
"If an 
Executive Board member dies, their spouse receives 60 per cent of the transi-
tional payment."

"Performance-based remuneration 
comprises a Performance Bonus and Performance Shares."
"The performance-
based remuneration components are mostly assessed on a multi-year basis to 
ensure the sustainable long-term development of Deutsche Börse AG."
"They are 
also mostly share-based, which aligns the interests of the Executive Board and 
the shareholders."
"Performance-based remuneration is calculated largely on the 
basis of long-term performance by measuring various performance criteria over 
five years (Performance Shares and performance-based restricted stock: a one-
year performance period plus a four-year blocking period)."
"The cash portion of 
the Performance Bonus (annual payout) is the only short-term element of the 
performance-based remuneration."
"The performance criteria include both finan-
cial and non-financial targets."
"In order to systematically pursue the idea of pay 
for performance, the performance criteria are set ambitiously."
"In order to take a 
holistic approach to the company’s success, different performance criteria are 
used for the Performance Bonus and Performance Shares."
"In accordance with recommendation G.8 GCGC, targets and reference parame-
ters set by the Supervisory Board for performance-based remuneration compo-
nents for each upcoming financial year may not be changed retrospectively."
"The performance criteria and other important aspects of the performance-
based remuneration components address the core pillars of the corporate strat-
egy."
"The following chart illustrates the close link between the corporate strat-
egy and the performance criteria and key aspects of the performance-based re-
muneration."
"As the core principle of Executive Board remuneration at Deutsche Börse AG, 
the focus is always on pay for performance."
"The target achievement 
and the resulting cash payout, as well as the amount to be invested in shares 
(performance-based restricted stock), are measured based on three equally 
weighted performance criteria: net revenue, EBITDA and individual targets."
"The Performance Bonus is intended to set incentives for the realisation of op-
erational objectives which are materially important to the long-term develop-
ment of Deutsche Börse AG."
"For this reason, the performance criteria include 
net revenue and EBITDA, financial indicators which are vital for the successful 
execution of the corporate strategy and create incentives for profitable growth."
"Individual targets make it possible to differentiate performance according to the 
operational and strategic responsibilities of the individual Executive Board 
members."
"At the same time, the individual targets allow the Executive Board 
as a whole to be guided, particularly in terms of achieving core strategic tar-
gets which are essential for the implementation of the corporate strategy."
"A Performance Bonus with a certain target amount is agreed with each Execu-
tive Board member every year, with target achievement being measured over 
the course of a financial year."
"In total, an overall target achievement ranging 
from 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible."
"This means that a complete loss 
of the Performance Bonus is also possible."
"Target 
achievement of 0 per cent to 200 per cent is possible for each performance 
criterion."
"Net revenue 
The basis is net revenue as reported in the consolidated financial statements."
"This consists of revenue plus net interest income from banking business and 
other operating income, less volume-related costs."
"Using net revenue as a per-
formance criterion for the Performance Bonus is intended to incentivise the de-
sired growth in net revenue."
"This serves as the basis for all the other activities 
carried out by Deutsche Börse AG and for its long-term, sustainable success."
"The target achievement for the market expectation component and the target 
achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target 
achievement for the net revenue performance criterion."
"Target achievement for the market expectation component of net revenue 
To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of 
net revenue, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial 
year begins."
"The target value set by the Supervisory Board is based on capital 
market consensus."
"In this way the Supervisory Board ensures that the target is 
in line with investors’ expectations for the upcoming financial year."
"For 2023 
the Supervisory Board set a target of €4,577.2 million."
"The target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target 
value and so €3,890.6 million for the 2023 financial year."
"The upper limit is 
110 per cent of the target and so €5,034.9 million."
"This ensures 
that the target achievement is measured by reference to the target set."
"Net rev-
enue for the measurement of target achievement was reduced by  
€–198.0 million in the 2023 financial year to reflect the takeover of 
SimCorp A/S, which was not included in the target set."
"On this basis the ac-
tual value was €4,878.6 million."

This represents a target achievement of 165.85 per cent in the market expec-
tation component of net revenue."
"This incen-
tivises both internal and external growth expectations in order to sharpen the 
focus on strategic growth."
"The indicator net revenue as reported is used for the 
growth component, which includes any M&A effects."
"To measure the target achievement for the growth component of net revenue, 
the actual percentage change in net revenue compared with the previous 
year’s net revenue is multiplied by three."
"This means the target achievement for the 2023 financial 
year in the growth component of net revenue was 51.11 per cent."
"Adding the target achievement for the market expectation and growth compo-
nents gives a maximum overall target achievement for net revenue of 
200.00 per cent in 2023."
"This 
stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impair-
ment losses."
"One of the main pillars of the corporate strategy, alongside abso-
lute growth, is the profitability of this growth."
"To reflect this strategic rele-
vance, EBITDA has been established as a key indicator for the purpose of 
managing Deutsche Börse AG and implementing the corporate strategy, and 
thus serves as a performance criterion for the Performance Bonus."
"The target achievement for the market expectation component and the target 
achievement for the growth component are added to calculate the target 
achievement for the EBITDA criterion."
"Target achievement for the market expectation component of EBITDA 
To calculate the target achievement for the market expectation component of 
EBITDA, a target value is set by the Supervisory Board before the financial 
year begins."
"The target value is determined by multiplying the EBITDA margin 
in the previous year by the target value for the performance criterion net reve-
nue for the upcoming financial year, as described above."
"For the 2023 finan-
cial year, the Supervisory Board set a target value of €2,665.1 million."
"The target value determines the lower limit, which is 85 per cent of the target 
value and so €2,265.3 million for the 2023 financial year."
"The upper limit is 
110 per cent of the target value and so €2,931.6 million for the 2023 finan-
cial year."
"EBITDA for the measurement of target achievement was ad-
justed by €–2.4 million in the 2023 financial year to reflect the takeover of 
SimCorp A/S, which was not included in the target set."
"On this basis the ac-
tual value was €2,941.9 million."

This represents a target achievement of 200.00 per cent in the market expec-
tation component of EBITDA."
"To measure the target achievement for the growth com-
ponent of EBITDA, the actual percentage change in EBITDA compared with 
the previous year’s EBITDA is multiplied by three."
"To determine the growth component of EBITDA, EBITDA as reported may only 
be adjusted for any material extraordinary non-recurring effects that were not 
or not fully budgeted for, and which were not caused by the current Executive 
Board."
"This means the target achievement for the 2023 financial 
year in the growth component of EBITDA was 49.73 per cent."
"Since the maximum target achievement of 200.00 per cent was achieved in 
EBITDA as the market expectation component, the EBITDA growth component 
is no longer added."
"The overall target achievement for the performance crite-
rion EBITDA is therefore 200.00 per cent in 2023 financial year."
"Individual targets 
may be defined for multiple or all Executive Board members together."
"When 
setting individual targets, the Supervisory Board ensures that they are demand-
ing and quantifiable."
"To ensure this is the case, concrete figures or expecta-
tions are defined for the target achievement."
"To avoid any dilution of the 
incentive effect, each Executive Board member has no more than four targets 
per financial year."
"The targets are derived from the corporate strategy and promote its implemen-
tation."
"Strategic projects and initiatives can be used, as can operating 
measures that serve directly or indirectly for the implementation of the corpo-
rate strategy."
"Individual targets should contribute to an implementation of the corporate 
strategy as well as the long-term, sustainable development of Deutsche Börse 
AG."
Targets can be based on both financial and non-financial indicators.
"ESG 
targets are also potential individual targets."
"By defining financial and non-fi-
nancial targets and measuring their achievement, the Supervisory Board en-
sures that the implementation of the corporate strategy is advanced and pur-
sued sustainably, and that a holistic approach is taken to the success of 
Deutsche Börse Group."
"Up to four individual targets were defined for all Executive Board members at 
the start of the 2023 financial year."
"The Nomination Committee and the Su-
pervisory Board both discussed the individual targets in detail."
"A decision on 
the target achievement was taken on the basis of a detailed presentation and 
assessment of the Executive Board’s collective and individual performances."

the interests of the Executive Board even more closely with those of sharehold-

General principles of the PSP Tranche 2023 
The Performance Share Plan supported by the selected financial performance 
criteria supports the execution of the corporate growth strategy."
"On the other 
hand, the inclusion of ESG targets in the PSP emphasises a focus on Deutsche 
Börse AG’s sustainable development."
"At the same time, the five-year perfor-
mance period encourages a focus, in particular, on the long-term development 
of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The PSP provides each Executive Board member with a number of so-called 
Performance Shares at the beginning of every financial year."
"The number of 
these initial (virtual) Performance Shares is determined by dividing the amount 
of the individual target remuneration in euros by the average Xetra® closing 
price of Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar month preceding the start of 
the performance period."
"The relevant share price at grant for the PSP Tranche 2023, which was 
granted at the beginning of the 2023 financial year and ends at the close of 
the 2027 financial year, was €168.05."
"The overall target 
achievement for the Performance Shares is measured using the performance 
criteria relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), earnings per share (EPS) and 
ESG targets."
"The financial performance criteria each allow for a target achieve-
ment of 0 per cent to 250 per cent, whereas the ESG targets allow for a target 
achievement of 0 per cent to 217.5 per cent."
"The target achievement for the 
criteria relative TSR and EPS is measured at the end of the five-year perfor-
mance period."
"The target achievement for the ESG targets is determined and 
locked in at the end of every financial year, however."
"The final target achieve-
ment for the ESG targets is measured at the end of the five-year performance 
period using the average target achievement over the financial years."
"The final number of virtual Performance Shares is determined by the overall 
target achievement for the performance criteria over the five-year performance 
period, multiplied by the number of Performance Shares initially granted."
"The 
final number of Performance Shares determined in this manner is multiplied 
by the average Xetra® closing price for Deutsche Börse shares in the calendar 
month preceding the end of the performance period, plus the dividends paid 
during the performance period."
"This represents the development of the 
Deutsche Börse share over the five-year performance period."
"The result of the 
multiplication is the payout amount for the acquisition of real shares."
"The pay-
out amount from the Performance Shares is capped at 400 per cent of the tar-
get amount."
"It is due no later than with the regular salary payment for the cal-
endar month following the approval of the consolidated financial statements 
after the end of the respective performance period."
"The Executive Board members are obliged to invest the entire payout amount 
after tax in shares of Deutsche Börse AG."
"The relative TSR emphasises 
the alignment of interests between Executive Board and shareholders and also 
integrates a relative performance metric into the remuneration system."
"This 
creates a strong incentive to outperform the relevant peer group over the long 
term."
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 50 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 
250 per cent."
"By defining an ambitious target achievement curve, which starts 
the payout only after the median has been exceeded, the Supervisory Board 
emphasises the pay-for-performance approach to Executive Board remunera-
tion also with regards to the Total Shareholder Return."
"The detailed target achievement curve for relative TSR is as follows: 
 
The target achievement for the criterion relative TSR is disclosed at the end of 
the performance period for the respective PSP tranche."
"Earnings per share (EPS) 
Earnings per share (EPS) is used as an internal financial performance criterion."
"The basis for the criterion is EPS as reported in the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Alongside net revenue and EBITDA, EPS is the third key indicator 
for measuring the successful implementation of the growth strategy."
"Imple-
menting EPS as a performance criterion for the Performance Shares incentiv-
ises long-term profitable growth in this remuneration component too, and re-
flects Deutsche Börse AG’s focus on growth."
"The performance of EPS is measured by its compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) over the five-year performance period."
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 
250 per cent."
"The target defined by the Supervisory Board is an EPS CAGR of 
7.5 per cent p.a."
over the performance period.
"The cap was set at 
18.75 per cent p.a."
and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.
"The detailed target achievement curve for EPS is as follows: 
 
To measure target achievement, the reported EPS is adjusted for any amortisa-
tion of intangible assets, purchase price allocations (PPA) and transaction 
costs in the case of large M&A transactions valued at more than €1 billion."
"The PPA correction reflects the business model of Deutsche Börse AG and po-
tential M&A targets, since these typically only have minor tangible assets."
"Ad-
justing for transaction costs means the Executive Board is not penalised by 
completing larger M&A transactions, which is in line with the growth strategy 
by means of both organic and inorganic growth."
"ESG targets 
ESG targets are the third performance criterion for the Performance Shares and 
are intended to further encourage the sustainable development of Deutsche 
Börse Group."
"This underlines Deutsche Börse AG’s focus on a holistic ap-
proach to its corporate responsibility and ensures its sustainable success as a 
company."
"The ESG targets are defined on the basis of a catalogue of criteria with four 
categories: “External view”, “Employee satisfaction”, “Expansion of ESG busi-
ness” and “CO2 neutrality”."
"They reflect the different ESG aspects and cover 
them holistically."
"The targets in these four categories are clearly measurable and subject to spe-
cific target achievement curves."
"To measure overall target achievement for the 
ESG targets, the first step is to calculate the target achievement in the four cat-
egories “External view”, “Employee satisfaction”, “Expansion of ESG business” 
and “CO2 neutrality” at the end of each financial year."
"These figures are then 
added on a weighted basis and formally confirmed."
"At the end of the five-year 
performance period, the second step is to measure the overall target achieve-
ment for the ESG targets by calculating the average of the annual target 
achievements for ESG targets over the entire performance period."
"The possible 
overall target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares from 
this 25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent to 
217.5 per cent."
"The annual target achievement for the ESG targets and the 
achievement in the individual categories of ESG targets are disclosed at the 
end of each financial year."
"External view 
In the “External view” category, the aim is to achieve good results in three 
leading independent ESG ratings."
"The target achievement is based on the aver-
age ranking (percentile) in three leading independent ESG ratings determined 
beforehand by the Supervisory Board."
"For the PSP Tranche 2023, the Supervi-
sory Board has chosen the ESG ratings from S&P, Sustainalytics and MSCI."
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent 
to 250 per cent."
"The Supervisory Board has chosen the 90th percentile as the 
target and defined an upper and lower limit."
"The upper limit is the 99th per-
centile and the lower limit the 75th percentile."
This particularly includes a high level of employee satisfaction.
"To 
emphasise this, good results in the annual employee survey are integrated as 
an additional ESG target."
"The survey is carried out by an independent external 
provider."
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent 
to 250 per cent."
"The Supervisory Board has defined a target value in the an-
nual employee survey of 71.5 per cent approval, and set upper and lower lim-
its."
"The cap is set at 84.5 per cent approval and the floor at 55.5 per cent ap-
proval."
"In 2021, Deutsche Börse Group developed an own definition for ESG 
net revenue and reviews it annually."
"As part of this review, the scope of the 
ESG net revenue was adjusted."
"In the Investment Management Solutions segment, ISS STOXX offers rating 
services for management and investment decisions on the one hand, as well 
as solutions for compliance with regulatory, governance or market standards 
and/or shareholder or stakeholder expectations."
"On the other hand, ISS STOXX 
offers ESG indices and climate benchmarks."
"The corresponding ESG net reve-
nue includes the Corporate Solutions, ESG Analytics and Governance Solutions 
businesses as well as all revenue from the licensing of sustainable index solu-
tions."
License revenue from such products can either be allocated directly (e.g.
"in the case of ETF licenses) or an allocation is made if they are sold as part of 
a package."
"In the Trading & Clearing segment, EEX operates trading and clearing services 
for commodity spot and derivatives markets."
"EEX defines ESG net revenue as 
revenue related to sustainable commodity markets."
"They include contracts for 
green power, emission allowances and related registry/ guarantee of origin ser-
vices as well as power products, related to the share of renewable energy pro-
duction in the respective market area or country."
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent 
to 250 per cent."
"The Supervisory Board has defined a target value for growth 
in ESG net revenue of 10 per cent p.a., and set upper and lower limits."
"The 
cap was set at 25 per cent p.a."
and the floor at 0 per cent p.a.
"The possible target achievement for the final number of Performance Shares 
from this 6.25 per cent-weighted performance criterion ranges from 0 per cent 
to 120 per cent."
"If CO2 neutrality is achieved, the target achievement is 
100 per cent."
"If it is missed, the target achievement is 0 per cent."
"As a further incentive to achieve CO2 neutrality, the target achievement is also 
subject to a sub-condition: that CO2 emissions have to be reduced."
"If CO2 
emissions are reduced, the target achievement in the category “CO2 neutrality” 
is increased by 20 per cent."
"If this is not the case, the target achievement is 
reduced by 20 per cent."
"Since energy use in buildings accounts for a large 
share, CO2 neutrality is calculated per workplace."
"The following table provides an overview of target achievements in the respec-
tive categories of ESG targets:
 
 
Overall target achievement and payout from the PSP Tranche 2019 
The close of the 2023 financial year marked the end of the five-year perfor-
mance period for the PSP Tranche 2019."
"The PSP Tranche 2019 was based 
on the remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board with effect from 
1 January 2016 and approved by the Annual General Meeting with a majority 
of 84.19 per cent on 11 May 2016 (remuneration system 2016)."
"The target 
achievement for the PSP Tranche 2019 was measured on the basis of the 
equally weighted performance criteria “Adjusted Net Income Growth” and “TSR 
Performance”."
"Adjusted Net Income Growth 
Adjusted Net Income Growth is the growth in the adjusted net income attribut-
able to the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG for the corresponding financial 
year."
"The Supervisory Board determines the target achievement rate for Ad-
justed Net Income Growth at the end of each financial year during the five-
year performance period, which is then locked in."
"The target achievement rate 
at the end of the performance period in question is the average of the annual 
target achievement rates for each of the five years."
"Target achievement degrees 
may range between 0 per cent and 250 per cent."
"It differs from unadjusted net income 
(€1,724.0 million) by non-recurring effects due to M&A activities and legal 
disputes."
It was also corrected for the costs of organisational restructuring.
"The increase of 17.56 per cent represents a target achievement of 
250.00 per cent for the 2023 financial year."
"Overall, a target achievement of 170.388 per cent was determined for the per-
formance criteria “Adjusted Net Income Growth” for the PSP Tranche 2019."
"The ranking is meas-
ured on the basis of the TSR performance, which is calculated by comparing 
the TSR at the beginning and end of the performance period."
"Possible target 
achievement ranges from 0 per cent to 250 per cent."
"Overall, a target achievement of 155.00 per cent was determined for the per-
formance criteria “TSR Performance” for the PSP Tranche 2019."

"The after-tax amount of the payout must be invested fully in Deutsche 
Börse AG shares."
"Shares are purchased according to the automated procedure 
described below."
"Share Ownership Guidelines 
Share ownership guidelines apply to all Executive Board members, which re-
quire the Executive Board members to invest a substantial amount in Deutsche 
Börse AG shares during their term of office."
"The share ownership guidelines constitute a key element for aligning the inter-
ests of the Executive Board even more closely with those of shareholders."
"They 
also align Executive Board remuneration more closely with the strategic objec-
tive of Deutsche Börse AG’s long-term success."
"The remuneration system 
obliges the CEO to hold 200 per cent and ordinary Executive Board members 
100 per cent of their annual gross base salary in Deutsche Börse AG shares."
"Notwithstanding this rule, an earlier contractual agreement obliges the current 
CEO to hold 300 per cent and the ordinary Executive Board members 
200 per cent of their annual gross base salary in Deutsche Börse AG shares."
"Shares from the Performance Bonus and shares from the payout of Perfor-
mance Shares are also taken into account for the share ownership guidelines, 
in addition to shares held privately."
The required shareholdings have to be acquired within a period of four years.
"Shares are purchased during the first four trading days in June of 
each year that are consecutive calendar days."
"The share owner-
ship guidelines were met as at these dates."
"The shares held by Christoph 
Böhm, Thomas Book and Stephan Leithner were valued as of 31 December 
2021."
"In these cases, the share ownership guidelines were also met."
"The 
shares held by Heike Eckert were valued as at 31 December 2023 and the 
share ownership guidelines were found to be met."
"All the Executive Board 
members are therefore in compliance with the share ownership guidelines."
"In cases of serious misconduct by an Executive Board member, the Supervi-
sory Board may reduce their performance-based remuneration components 
(Performance Bonus and Performance Shares) partially or fully (compliance 
malus)."
"If performance-based remuneration components have already been paid out 
the Supervisory Board can, in these cases, also partially or fully recover the 
amounts paid (compliance clawback)."
"If performance-based remuneration components are determined or paid out on 
the basis of incorrect data, e.g."
"incorrect consolidated financial statements, the 
Supervisory Board can correct the figure or recover the remuneration compo-
nents already paid out (performance clawback)."
"Any such clawback is limited to the calendar year during which the reason has 
occurred."
"The Supervisory Board is entitled to assert a clawback claim even af-
ter an Executive Board member has left the company, for a period of up to two 
years following termination of the service contract."
"Any claims for damages re-
main unaffected by any clawback of performance-based remuneration."
"There was no cause to apply the malus or clawback rules in the 2023 finan-
cial year, so the Supervisory Board did not reduce or recover any performance-
based remuneration."
"The payment is calculated on 
the basis of the total remuneration for the past financial year and, where ap-
propriate, the expected total remuneration for the current financial year."
"The payouts for the Performance Bonus and the Performance Shares take 
place on the dates and conditions originally agreed upon."
"Payouts are not 
made any earlier."
"In accordance with the recommendation of the GCGC, an 
exception applies in cases in which the service contract ends early because of 
permanent incapacity or any other illness, or the death of the Executive Board 
member."
"In these cases, the target amount of Performance Bonus and Perfor-
mance Shares is paid out immediately."
"Post-contractual non-competition clause 
A post-contractual non-competition clause applies to members of the Executive 
Board."
"This means that the Executive Board members are contractually prohib-
ited from acting for a competing company, or from undertaking competing ac-
tivities, for one year following the end of their service."
"Compensation of 
75 per cent of the base salary and 75 per cent of the most recent Performance 
Bonus is payable during the non-compete period."
"Pension benefits and any 
severance payments are offset against the compensation."
"In addition, 50 per 
cent of other earnings are deducted if these – together with the compensation 
– exceed the Executive Board member’s most recent remuneration."
"The com-
pany may waive the post-contractual non-compete clause before the Executive 
Board member’s contract of service ends."
"Information on third-party benefits 
Executive Board members did not receive any benefits from third parties for 
their work on the Executive Board in the 2023 financial year."
"The remuneration 
awarded and due comprises all remuneration components for which perfor-
mance has already been measured, for which all conditions precedent and 
subsequent are met or no longer apply, and which are vested at the close of 
the financial year."
"It is irrelevant whether the payout has already been made in 
the 2023 financial year or occurs at the beginning of the 2024 financial year."
"So for the one-year variable remuneration, for example, the Performance Bo-
nus (cash component) for the 2023 financial year is shown, although the pay-
out takes place at the beginning of the 2024 financial year."

"In addition, Mr Preuss received pension payments in the amount of 
€445.2 thousand."
"Thus, 17.7 per cent of the remuneration awarded and due 
to him consists of non-performance-based remuneration components and 
82.3 per cent of performance-based remuneration components."
"Ms Stars was not granted or owed any remuneration in 2023 apart from the 
PSP Tranche 2019."
"Her remuneration therefore consists entirely of perfor-
mance-based remuneration."
"An additional €2,743.2 thousand was paid in pension payments in the 2023 
financial year to thirteen former Executive Board members who departed from 
the Executive Board before 2014."
"The current system is only slightly different 
to the previous system of remuneration of Supervisory Board members which 
was applied from 1 May 2020."
"In the current remuneration system the attend-
ance fee is also paid for virtual attendance and is paid for each meeting day."
"The remuneration system for the Supervisory Board consists of a fixed remu-
neration plus an attendance fee."
"This is in line with the recommendation G.18 
sentence 1 GCGC as amended on 28 April 2022."
"The structure of Supervisory 
Board remuneration, providing for fixed remuneration only, strengthens the 
Board’s independence and provides for a counterbalance to the structure of Ex-
ecutive Board remuneration, which is mainly variable and aligned with 
Deutsche Börse Group’s growth strategy."
"Supervisory Board remuneration 
therefore contributes to the implementation of the business strategy, and thus 
promotes Deutsche Börse Group's long-term development."
"The members of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual remuneration of 
€85 thousand."
"In accordance with recommendation G.17 GCGC, remunera-
tion is increased for the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Deputy Chair, 
as well as for chairs and members of committees."
"Remuneration of the Chair 
is €220 thousand."
Remuneration of the Deputy Chair is €125 thousand.
"Members of Supervisory Board committees receive additional fixed annual re-
muneration of €30 thousand for each committee position they hold."
"The remu-
neration for members of the Audit Committee is €35 thousand."
"Remuneration 
of committee chairs is €40 thousand and for the Chair of the Audit Committee 
€75 thousand."
"If a Supervisory Board member sits on more than one 
Supervisory Board committee, only work on two of the committees is remuner-
ated."
"Remuneration is then paid for work on the two committees with the 
highest remuneration."
"Supervisory Board members who only hold office for 
part of the financial year receive one-twelfth of the fixed annual remuneration 
and, if applicable, of the remuneration payable for their membership of com-
mittees, for each month or part-month in which they are members."
"The remu-
neration for any financial year is due and payable as a one-off payment after 
the Annual General Meeting that accepts the consolidated financial statements 
for the relevant financial year or decides on their approval."
"Members of the Supervisory Board or a Supervisory Board committee receive 
an attendance fee of €1 thousand for each Board or committee meeting that 
they attend."
"Where two or more meetings are held on the same day, the at-
tendance fee is only paid once."
"The members of the Supervisory Board are included in a directors & officers 
(D&O) insurance policy maintained by the company at an appropriate level in 
the interests of the company."
"After preparation by the Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board exam-
ines on a regular basis whether its members’ remuneration is appropriate, 
given their tasks and the situation of the company."
"It carries out a horizontal 
market comparison for this purpose."
"The Supervisory Board may seek the ad-
vice of an independent external expert."
"Given the particular nature of the Su-
pervisory Board’s work, the review of Supervisory Board remuneration does not 
generally include a vertical comparison with the remuneration of employees of 
Deutsche Börse AG or Deutsche Börse Group."
"Whether it does or not, the Annual 
General Meeting votes not less than every four years on the Supervisory Board 
remuneration, including the underlying remuneration system, in accordance 
with section 113 (3) AktG."
"A resolution may also be passed confirming the 
current remuneration."

"The joint operation Frankfurt

Eurex Clearing AG, Eurex Repo GmbH, Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange 
GmbH, Clearstream Holding AG and Clearstream Banking AG."
"As for Executive 
Board and Supervisory Board remuneration, the average remuneration for the 
entire workforce is total remuneration (including any bonuses and other fringe 
benefits)."
"Look ahead to 2024 from a remuneration perspective 
As the remuneration system for the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG and 
the Remuneration Report 2022 were approved by a large majority of share-
holders, no changes to the remuneration system are currently planned."
"On the 
contrary, the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Börse AG sees these votes as a 
clear recommendation to maintain the current remuneration unchanged and to 
apply it again in the 2024 financial year."
"This applies particularly to the un-
derlying performance criteria and the target achievement curves."
"Regardless of this, the intention is to present a remuneration system for the 
Supervisory Board with adjustments for approval at the Annual General Meet-
ing 2024."
"The intention is to adjust the amount of remuneration in line with 
the function, in order to guarantee that the Supervisory Board remuneration re-
mains competitive in future."
"Detailed information about the adjustments to the Supervisory Board remuner-
ation can be found in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting 2024."
"The executive directors and the Supervisory Board are 
also responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary 
to enable the preparation of a remuneration report that is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"Responsibility of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, 
including the related disclosures, based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit 
in accordance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of 
financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material 
misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the remuneration report."
"The procedures selected 
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or 
error."
"This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the remuneration report, whether due to fraud or error, including the related 
disclosures."
"In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the 
internal control system relevant to the entity’s preparation of the remuneration 
report and related disclosures."
"The objective is to plan and perform audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not to express an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control system."
"An 
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the 
Supervisory Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
remuneration report, including the related disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion."
