"Dear Readers, 
DHL Group once again demonstrated its high performance in 2023."
"Although the global 
economy underwent no noteworthy recovery and the geopolitical challenges remain, 
as a company, we achieved our annual targets."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, EBIT came in at €6.3 billion and thus within the forecast range."
"Free cash flow 
is particularly pleasing, amounting to €3.3 billion before M&A activities."
"The numbers prove it: we are 
highly profitable, even in the economically weakest market environment of the last 15 years."
"This is thanks to the fact that we not only had good responses to the challenges, but we were also prepared: 
we planned our capacities with a view to the future, kept our eye on costs and increased our efficiency on 
an ongoing basis."
The investments of recent years resulted in structural improvements to our profitability.
We benefit from this even in phases of weak economic momentum.
"In addition, we adjusted prices in line 
with the market and passed on inflationary cost developments to our customers."
"The past fiscal year makes it once again clear: our logistics portfolio, which is unique around the world, 
is productive and robust."
"No other company in the industry boasts such a broad, diversified and global 
structure."
"And our network is very well suited for online retail, which remains a strong and fundamental 
driver of growth."
"As a company, we have been on board with the e-commerce trend since the early days 
and have used it to our advantage."
"It has been contributing to our success for many years – and will 
continue to do so in the coming years."
"DHL Group also pursues ambitious goals with regard to the environment, social responsibility and sound 
corporate governance in line with our ESG Roadmap."
"Our ESG measures contribute to us remaining a 
market leader in the future as well."
Our particular priority along the way is that we remain steadfast on the path to decarbonization of logistics.
"In the year under review, we increased our investments in the reduction of greenhouse gases by 56% and 
saved 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e."
"In addition, we successfully placed our first sustainability-linked 
bond on the capital market with a volume of €500 million."
"We will not ease up in our dedication to more 
environmentally friendly logistics."
"Climate change remains the greatest problem that humanity is faced 
with."
And the clock keeps on ticking.
"We planned our capacities 
with a view to the future, 
kept our eye on costs and 
increased our efficiency."

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report
My particular thanks go to our more than 590,000 employees worldwide – for their tireless efforts in 
yet another challenging year."
"Without their motivation and passion, we would not have been able to so 
 
successfully accomplish many things."
"We are pleased that we again exceeded the target of more than 
80% in Employee Engagement in the year under review, with the figure coming in at 83%."
"And, going 
forward, we plan to offer our employees more opportunities to directly take part in the success 
of the company."
"To this end, we are piloting a program in 12 countries that allows employees 
to acquire our shares at a discounted price."
"The program is intended to further strengthen 
the connection between the workforce and the company."
"Although global trade 
continues to find itself in a challenging environment, I see a year of opportunity – 
also because competitors are withdrawing or appear to be distracted."
"For our part, we 
are definitely focused and in a position to continue delivering excellent quality."
"We 
are continuing to work on our status as an employer, provider and investment of choice."
"In doing so, we want to take advantage of the many opportunities for DHL Group to 
continue to grow."
"And I thank you, Dear Shareholders, for the trust you have placed in me since I was named 
CEO of DHL Group."
"Leading a company that keeps the world running, day in and day out, and 
that enables trade in more than 220 countries and territories is an inspiring and special responsi-
bility."
A company that connects people and improves lives.
"DHL Group has evolved from a national 
postal service provider to a leader in the global logistics market."
"I look forward to writing the upcoming 
chapters of this success story together with my colleagues on the Board of Management and the highly 
dedicated workforce."
"Tobias Meyer  
Chief Executive Officer
The investments of 
recent years resulted 
in structural improvements 
to our profitability."

"The Board of Management’s clear strategic

"The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board worked together in a trusting and successful manner in the year under 
review."
"The Board of Management involved the Supervisory Board early on in all decisions of material significance for the company 
and regularly informed the Supervisory Board on further developments."
"Attendance at plenary and committee meetings

"All members of the 
Supervisory Board took part in the plenary meetings; only Simone Menne was excused from one meeting."
"Attendance at plenary 
and committee meetings in 2023 is shown individually in the table."
"No member took part in fewer than three-fourths of the 
meetings."
"Meetings of the Supervisory Board were held regularly without the Board of Management members, for example on 
matters regarding the Board of Management and to review the efficiency of the Supervisory Board’s work."
"The members of the Board of Management participated in all plenary meetings and reported on the business performance in the 
divisions for which they are responsible."
"The CEO and the members of the Board of Management responsible for the respective 
committee attended the committee meetings."
"Executives from the tier immediately below the Board of Management and the 
auditors were also invited to attend for individual agenda items."
"The members of the Financial and Audit Committee discussed 
individual matters with the auditors, also without the Board of Management members being present."
"Discussions with investors 
In the autumn of the past year, I held talks with several investors and proxies on topics that fall under the responsibility of the 
Supervisory Board."
"The professional experience and expertise of 
the new Supervisory Board members proposed by the Supervisory Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting were discussed in 
detail, in consideration of their independence and the future composition of the committees."
"The Board of Management’s intention 
to convene the 2024 Annual General Meeting once again as an in-person meeting was also positively received by the investors."
"Key topics addressed in plenary meetings 
All meetings centered on reporting and discussion of the Group’s and its divisions’ financial position and business performance, as 
well as information on the discussions of the committee meetings."
"Furthermore, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects 
were of importance, as well as the environmental and social impact of the company’s current operations and the implementation of 
the sustainability strategy."
"There was also regular exchange with the Board of Management on digitalization, including the 
developments in the field of artificial intelligence."
"In addition to the strategic direction of the product portfolio in the Group as a 
whole, the impact of new regulatory parameters on the business in the Post & Parcel Germany division was also a material topic in 
the year under review."
"In March 2023, we discussed the annual and consolidated financial statements, including the management report and the 
nonfinancial statement."
"At the recommendation of the Finance and Audit Committee, we approved the financial statements that 
had been given an unqualified opinion by the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC)."
"We concurred with the Board of 
Management’s proposed resolution on the appropriation of the net retained profit and therefore a dividend distribution in the 
amount of €1.85 per share."
"In line with the finance strategy, 41.1% of net profit was thus distributed to the shareholders last year."
"Following many years of having our financial statements audited by PwC, the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 
2023 fiscal year were audited by the audit firm Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, as resolved by 
the Annual General Meeting."
The responsible auditors were Prof. Dr. Frank Beine and Dr. Hendrik Nardmann.
"Our discussions also focused on the status of collective bargaining negotiations and the expansion of the 
volume of the current share program to as much as €3 billion in conjunction with the approval of a potential collection of up to 
55 million further repurchased shares."
"Moreover, in this meeting, the Supervisory Board approved the establishment of a joint 
venture with Saudi Aramco."

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report 
In the meeting in June, we discussed in particular the acquisition of the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo."
"In addition, the 
agenda included the change of the Group name from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group and the approval of the adjustment 
of business responsibilities on the Board of Management."
"The allocation of business responsibilities was adjusted so that the Group 
Brand Marketing function was transferred to the responsibility of John Pearson."
"John Pearson is already responsible for the 
Customer Solutions & Innovation function and the Global Commercial Board."
"With the additional responsibility for the Group Brand 
Marketing function, significant commercial functions of the Group are now bundled under one umbrella."
"In September, our focus was on the reform of the Postal Act and the potential impact on the financial position and results of 
operations of the company."
"Without the presence of the Board of Management, we discussed at length the effectiveness and 
efficiency of our activities in the plenary meetings and in the committees."
"The subject of our analysis included collaboration within 
the Supervisory Board and with the members of the Board of Management, the work in the committees, the involvement of the 
Supervisory Board in the strategic direction of the company and the skills profile of the Supervisory Board."
"In preparation for this 
agenda item, the members of the Supervisory Board had completed a detailed questionnaire with selected questions on various 
topics, for example their satisfaction with the information provided and the frequency and structure of the Supervisory Board 
meetings."
"According to the results of our discussions, the Supervisory Board performed its monitoring and advisory duties 
effectively and efficiently."
"We will continue to include suggestions made by individual members of the Supervisory Board in our 
discussions between the annual efficiency reviews."
"In our final Supervisory Board meeting of the year in December, we approved the Group’s business plan for 2024 after intense 
discussion, defined the annual bonus targets for the Board of Management members and addressed the topics of digitalization and 
the energy transition."
"We resolved to comply without limitation with the suggestions and recommendations of the German 
Corporate Governance Code in the year under review."
"Material topics of the committee meetings 
The six committees of the Supervisory Board prepare the plenary discussions and decisions and meet in advance of the plenary 
meetings."
"The committees have also been tasked with making the final decisions regarding a few matters, including Executive 
Committee approval for secondary activities of Board of Management members or Finance and Audit Committee approval of 
nonaudit services to be provided by the auditor."
"In the plenary meetings, the committee chairs provide the members of the 
Supervisory Board with comprehensive information on the work of the committees and are available for questions and further 
discussion."
The Annual Corporate Governance Statement provides information on the tasks of the committees and their members.
The Finance and Audit Committee met seven times.
"Following the election of Deloitte as auditor by the Annual General Meeting, the 
Finance and Audit Committee commissioned the audit firm with the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements and 
the audit review of the 2023 half-yearly report."
"The committee also commissioned Deloitte with the audit of the nonfinancial 
statement contained in the management report to obtain limited assurance and reasonable assurance regarding selected 
indicators and discussed the audit strategy, planning, results and quality with the auditors."
"The committee also discussed the half-
yearly financial report following the review by the auditor and the quarterly financial statements with the CEO and the Board 
member for finance prior to publication, in the presence of the auditors."
"The committee monitored the independence of the auditor 
and had the auditor’s nonaudit services submitted for approval."
"It also had reports submitted on the nonaudit services rendered in 
general as well as the status of the utilization of the statutory budget provided for this purpose."
"As the committee chair, Stefan 
Schulte was also in regular dialog with the auditor outside of the meetings regarding the progress of the audits and reported on 
this to the committee."
"Also covered at the meetings were the accounting process, risk management and the findings of internal 
audits."
"Moreover, the committee dealt intensively with the planned reform of the Postal Act and the impact on the financial 
situation and results of operations of the company."
"It obtained detailed reports from the Chief Compliance Officer on meaningful 
aspects of compliance and on updates to the compliance organization and compliance management."
"The effectiveness and 
development of the internal control and risk management system was also regularly presented and discussed in the presence of 
the responsible department head."
"In addition, the committee dealt with the 
company’s sustainability strategy and its implementation in detail and on an ongoing basis."
"The meetings also focused on the 
acquisition and disposal of equity interest in companies, such as the establishment of a joint venture between DHL Supply Chain 
and Saudi Aramco."
The Nomination Committee met once during the reporting period.
The term of office for each is to be four years.
The Mediation Committee did not meet in the year under review.
"Support of the members of the Supervisory Board 
The company supports the members of the Supervisory Board in their activities on an ongoing basis."
"New members are provided 
with a diverse and comprehensive range of offers that ensure quick and specific onboarding."
"The costs 
for attending selected external training events as well as those for subscribing to industry publications are also reimbursed."
"In June, for 
instance, the Supervisory Board toured the DHL hub in Leipzig, where – following an introductory lecture – it was led through the 
expansive premises during the busy evening hours and introduced to individual work processes and responsibilities."
"Various 
executives from the Express division, some of whom work on-site, were available to answer questions and to make 
recommendations."
"Directors’ Day, which takes place twice per year, also enables the members of the Supervisory Board to deepen 
their understanding of current topics and developments that are relevant to the company."
"Changes to the Board of Management 
With Frank Appel’s resignation after more than 20 years on the Board of Management, Tobias Meyer assumed the role of CEO upon 
the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting."
"He has been a member of the Board of Management since 2019 and was 
previously responsible for Post & Parcel Germany and Global Business Services."
"There were no other personnel changes during the 
reporting period."
"Her successor is Katrin Suder, a freelance corporate 
consultant."
"Mario Daberkow, a member of the Supervisory Board since 2018 and responsible for Global IT Infrastructure & Services 
at Volkswagen AG, was reelected by the Annual General Meeting."
"Katrin Suder and Mario Daberkow were each elected for a term of 
four years."
"The terms of office for Simone Menne, Heinrich Hiesinger and Stefan Schulte end as scheduled following the Annual General 
Meeting planned for May 3, 2024."
"In light of the rules of the German Corporate Governance Code, Simone Menne and Stefan 
Schulte are no longer eligible for reelection following their many years of membership on the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory 
Board recommends to the Annual General Meeting the election of Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Hans-Ulrich Engel and the reelection 
of Heinrich Hiesinger, each for a four-year term of office."
"Both candidates to be newly elected have extensive knowledge in the field 
of accounting and reporting in particular."
"The intention is to elect Hans-Ulrich Engel as the Chair of the Finance and Audit 
Committee, provided he is elected to the Board."
"The main skills of the members of the Supervisory Board can also be found in the 
qualification matrix in the Annual Corporate Governance Statement."
"The term of office for the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board ended as scheduled at the end of the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting."
Nearly all members were reelected for another term of office.
"Silke Busch was elected as a new member to 
succeed Gabriele Gülzau."
"The Supervisory Board confirmed Andrea Kocsis as Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and the 
reelected employee representatives in their committee positions."
An overview of current Supervisory Board members is provided in Boards and committees.
"Managing conflicts of interest 
Supervisory Board members neither hold positions on the governing bodies of, nor provide consultancy services to, the Group’s 
main competitors, nor do they maintain personal relationships with them."
"No conflicts of interest were reported to the Supervisory 
Board in the year under review."

economic parameters."
We experienced a shipment volume decline of 9.2% in the Freight business unit.
"Increased labor costs, toll 
charges and persistently high diesel prices caused constant cost pressure."

from the previous year continued."
"We are experiencing volumes well above the level from before the pandemic in 2019 in nearly all 
markets."
"The geographic presence of DHL eCommerce was expanded in the year under review through the acquisition of the

Satisfied customers and a high level of delivery reliability 
We focus on delivering industry-leading performance as well as quality and service excellence."
"With this focus, we succeeded in 
achieving an overall global delivery quality of 96% (previous year: 95.5%)."
"Moreover, by expanding our offering to more than 
110,000 service points in Europe with 24,000 parcel lockers, we are closer to the customer and enable more sustainable last-mile 
delivery."
"Post & Parcel Germany division 
The postal service for Germany 
The core business of the Post & Parcel Germany division is the transport, sorting and delivery of documents and goods shipments."
"We maintain a nationwide post and parcel network in Germany, which we continually expand in consideration of digitalization and 
sustainability."
"Our products and services in the mail communication segment are targeted toward both private and business customers and range 
from physical and hybrid letters to additional services such as registered mail, cash on delivery and insured items."
"In the year under review, the German market for mail communication for business customers was worth around €4.0 billion 
(previous year: around €4.3 billion)."
"The downward trend in market development is due primarily to the continued substitution of 
traditional letter mail with electronic communication."
"This competitive market is made up of both alternative delivery service 
providers as well as consolidation service providers who deliver their mail volumes to Deutsche Post AG."
"Our market share 
increased to 63.2% compared with the prior year (62.1%), primarily due to competitors exiting the market."
"Cross-channel dialogue 
On request, Post & Parcel Germany offers advertisers end-to-end solutions in the Dialogue Marketing segment, ranging from 
address services and tools for design and creation to printing, delivery and evaluation."
"This supports cross-channel, personalized

"DHL Parcel for companies and private individuals 
We maintain the densest network of parcel acceptance and drop-off points in Germany, which was expanded further and 
digitalized in the reporting year."
We offer support to businesses to grow their online retail business.
"Along with the Supply Chain division, we are able to cover the 
entire logistics chain through to returns management on request."
"Various services enable individualized parcel delivery for private customers: parcels can be delivered to an alternative address, a 
specific retail outlet, a Paketshop or a Packstation at short notice."
"This ability to individually select delivery options and notifications 
makes receiving a parcel more convenient and more transparent."
"The German parcel market continues to be subject to competition-driven structural changes, with established as well as new 
companies offering their services."
"In e-commerce, the delivery of a portion of shipments is handled by the merchant’s own 
distribution networks."
"There has been no interruption in the growth trend in the number of online orders, despite the dynamic slowing down compared to 
previous years."
"In light of this as well, we are continuously expanding our network."
"By increasing the number of Pack- and 
Poststations in the coming years, we plan to make it even more convenient for customers all over Germany to send and receive 
parcels and to create an environmentally friendly, traffic-reduced parcel supply system."
Around 96% were delivered within two days.
This puts us above the legally required levels of 80% (D+1) and 95% (D+2).
These figures can be deemed very positive in light of the challenging environment in which they were achieved.
"The beginning of 
2023, for instance, was impacted by collective bargaining negotiations and the associated strikes."
"In addition, the situation on the 
German labor market remained tense overall in spite of the new collective bargaining agreement for employees of Deutsche Post 
AG."
"Our approximately 25,000 person-operated sales points were open for an average of 55 hours per week in the year under review, 
as was the case in the previous year."
"The fixed-location acceptance and sales network has grown to around 
38,000 sites (previous year: around 36,300) thanks to the expansion of our Pack- and Poststation network."
"Deutsche Post and DHL 
are thus easier to reach and closer to consumers in Germany than ever before in recent decades."
"Strategy 
Navigating safely through a volatile, fast-changing environment 
The DHL Group’s strategy draws on the elements of Strategy 2015 and 2020, which established us as the world’s leading logistics 
company."
"Building on this foundation, Strategy 2025, which we presented to the public at the end of 2019, has helped us to 
cement and grow that leading position."
"We defined our strategic goals in a comprehensive process in which we worked with our relevant stakeholders including 
employees, customers, suppliers and investors."
"The “Strategy House” graphic of DHL Group illustrates the most important 
elements of our strategy and how they are connected."
"So far, Strategy 2025 has guided us safely through the volatile, fast-changing environment."
"As part of a yearly assessment, we 
undertook a detailed review of our corporate strategy and found it not only to be fundamentally sound, but that it had also made 
DHL Group more resilient."
"That resilience is the result of the disciplined and consistent execution of our Group strategy, with each and every element 
playing a key role."
"Strategic triad of purpose, vision and values 
Our purpose of “Connecting people, improving lives” has never been more important than it is today."
"In keeping with our vision of 
being THE logistics company for the world, DHL Group strives to continue leading the industry – and doing so in an increasingly 
digital and sustainability-oriented world."
"Our core values “Respect and Results” are just as much a part of our strategy today as they 
have been in the past."
"The triad of purpose, vision and values underpins the three building blocks of Strategy 2025: sustained execution excellence along 
the three bottom lines; becoming an employer, provider and investment of choice; and a focus on our profitable core business and 
digital transformation."
We have also cemented sustainability in the business strategy with our purpose and our own values.
"Respect and Results mean that we are committed to each other and, together, make a positive social contribution."

"At DHL Group, when we speak of our Common DNA, we mean the set of behaviors, tools and programs that we put into practice 
throughout the Group."
"Group-wide programs such as Certified, First Choice and Safety First play an important part in building the

As an integral part of our strategy, sustainability is anchored along our three bottom lines."
"New policies and regulations across 
industries, increasingly changing buying habits and the growing interest in topics related to sustainability have motivated us to 
serve as a sustainability role model in our industry and to set ourselves ambitious targets."
"We therefore made sustainability a 
cornerstone of Strategy 2025 and an essential element of our mission."
"With our ESG Roadmap, we build on our past achievements and plot a course for future success."
"The road map serves as guidance 
in the three areas of environment, social responsibility and corporate governance."
Clear objectives were set for each of these areas.
We strive for environmentally friendly logistics and aim to be a great place to work for all and a trustworthy company and partner.
"We set transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs with which we make sustainability an integral component in the yearly planning 
and strategic cycle, with targets integrated into our decision-making process."
"One key target is to increase the pace of our 
company’s planned decarbonization, nonfinancial statement."
"Divisions focus on profitable core business 
Our divisions continue to focus relentlessly on their profitable core."
"In so doing, they ensure that our services and solutions can be 
provided reliably, even in unusual circumstances."
"Digital transformation as a key lever 
Representing a significant lever for sustainable business growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in our strategy."
"We 
therefore invest in initiatives designed to improve the experiences our customers and employees have with the company and to 
increase operational efficiency."
"In our divisions, we have several initiatives and programs in place to upgrade the IT backbone, 
ensure our future agility and increase IT efficiency."
"In particular in the fields of automation and robotics, data science, API and the 
Internet of Things, we are continuously building up centralized know-how and scaling digital solutions for the divisions."
"Research and development 
As a service provider, DHL Group does not engage in research and development activities in the narrower sense and therefore has 
no significant expenses to report in this connection."
"Steering metrics 
Financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators 
DHL Group uses both financial and nonfinancial performance indicators in its management of the Group."
"The monthly, quarterly 
and annual changes in these indicators are compared with prior-year data and forecast data to assist in making management 
decisions."
"The year-to-year changes in the financial and nonfinancial performance indicators described here also play a role in the 
calculation of management remuneration."
"The Group’s financial performance indicators are intended to preserve a balance 
between profitability, the efficient use of resources and adequate liquidity."
"How these metrics are computed is illustrated in 
calculations."
The performance of the financial key figures in the reporting year is described in the report on economic position.
"As planned, a seventh performance indicator – the cybersecurity 
rating – was introduced in corporate governance during the year under review."
"In addition, the performance indicators Realized 
Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement and cybersecurity rating are incorporated into – and account for 10%, respectively, 
of – the target portfolio for annual bonus calculation of the Board of Management."
"Since this reporting period, these performance 
indicators have also been included in the bonus calculation for executives in upper management."
"The targets and results of these 
key figures can be found in the report on economic position, development is provided in the nonfinancial statement and the outlook for 
the 2024 fiscal year is provided in the expected developments, opportunities and risks chapter."

EBIT and EAC (EBIT after asset charge) 
The profitability of the Group’s operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT)."
EBIT after asset charge (EAC) is another key performance indicator used by the Group.
"EAC is calculated by subtracting the asset 
charge, a cost-of-capital component, from EBIT."
"Making the asset charge a part of business decisions encourages the efficient use 
of resources and ensures that our operational business is geared toward increasing value sustainably while improving cash flow."
"The asset charge is calculated on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, which is defined as the weighted 
average net cost of interest-bearing liabilities and equity, taking into account company-specific risk factors in accordance with the 
Capital Asset Pricing Model."
A standard WACC of 8.5% is applied across the divisions.
"That figure also represents the minimum target for projects and 
investments within the Group."
"The WACC is generally reviewed once annually on the basis of the current situation on the financial 
markets."
"To ensure better comparability of the asset charge with previous figures, in 2023 the WACC used here was maintained at 
a constant level compared with the previous years."
The asset charge is calculated each month so that fluctuations in the net asset base can also be taken into account during the year.
The composition of the net asset base is shown in the calculations.
"Free cash flow facilitates liquidity management 
Along with EBIT and EAC, cash flow is another key performance metric used by Group management."
"The goal is to maintain 
sufficient liquidity to cover all of the Group’s financial obligations from debt repayment and dividends, in addition to meeting 
payment commitments arising from the Group’s operations and investments."
"Cash flow is calculated using the cash flow 
statement."
Operating cash flow (OCF) includes all items that are related directly to operating value creation.
"Another key parameter impacting 
OCF is net working capital."
"Effective management of net working capital is an important way for the Group to improve cash flow in 
the short to medium term."
Free cash flow (FCF) is a management indicator derived from OCF.
"It is used as an indicator of how much cash is available to the 
company for paying out dividends or repaying debt at the end of a reporting period."

2 Includes EBIT-related other noncurrent assets and liabilities.
"Not included are assets and liabilities related to taxes or bonds, for example."
"Steering and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
We aim to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by our operations, as well as our dependency on fossil fuels, in order 
to mitigate the impact of our operations on the global climate."
We use the logistics-related GHG emissions as a medium- and long-term target.
"We use a second performance indicator – the Realized 
Decarbonization Effects – to measure the emissions that we were able to avoid through the use of energy from renewable sources 
and sustainable technologies compared with conventional energy and technologies."
"The calculation methodology for GHG emissions is based on recognized international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol, EN 16258 (replaced by ISO 14083 as of the 2024 fiscal year) and the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework."
"To 
calculate the market-based effects, we use the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics 
Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by the Smart Freight Centre."
"Reductions in emissions through offsetting are not 
factored into our GHG emissions calculation."
"We record the GHG 
emissions from categories 3 (“Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities”), 4 (“Upstream Transportation and Distribution”) and 6 
(“Business Travel”), which are also included in our targets, in the calculation of Scope 3 emissions."
"The use of sustainable fuels is a 
significant focus of our climate protection measures."
"The savings generated through these measures offer us the opportunity to 
implement climate protection in our own supply chain in a targeted manner."
"As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the 
direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented use thereof (book and claim)."
"This makes a positive impact on our target 
calculation."
"Employee engagement as a factor for success 
Motivated and committed employees contribute to the success of the company."
"In the annual Group-wide survey, all employees 
have the opportunity to anonymously rate the company’s strategy and values as well as their working conditions."
"The Employee 
Engagement key performance indicator represents the aggregated and weighted results of five statements in the annual Group-
wide survey of employees."
"Promote diversity by focusing on share of women 
We use the performance indicator of the share of women in middle and upper management to measure the success of our diversity 
measures."
"As part of this measurement, executives working part-time are counted on a per-person basis."
"Since the year under review, this has also included accident-related injuries to external 
employees who are subject to instruction."
"Subject cybersecurity to independent external assessment 
Our cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight."
"This cybersecurity rating is based on 
the technical analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company."
"Assessment of 
the security situation is carried out by an automated service on a daily basis."
"Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating 
offers greater transparency and enables comparison with other companies thanks to standardization."
"We compare our 
performance with DAX 40 companies as well as major customers and logistics companies that are not a part of the DAX."
"The 
cybersecurity rating KPI has been steering-relevant since this reporting period and is also included in the calculation of the annual 
bonus for the Board of Management."
"Conduct compliance-relevant training 
Our aspiration is to be a reliable and trustworthy partner in all business relationships."
"When conducting day-to-day business, our 
managers serve an important function as role models to the employees and business partners, which is why corresponding training 
is of such importance for executives."
"We measure success in this area on the basis of the share of valid training certificates in 
middle and upper management."
"This performance indicator has been replaced by the cybersecurity rating since this reporting 
period in the calculation of the annual bonus for the Board of Management."
"The 2023 fiscal year was shaped 
by the lack of global economic recovery and the normalization of freight transport following the pandemic-related volatility of the 
years 2021 and 2022."
"As expected, profit from operating activities (EBIT) of €6.3 billion did not reach the level of the prior-year 
figure."
"Lower freight volumes and significantly decreased freight rates, as well as negative currency effects, were a burden on the 
business of the DHL divisions."
"The results of the Post & Parcel Germany division reflect cost increases and regulatory framework 
conditions for the German letter mail business."
"Nevertheless, the Group achieved a free cash flow of €2.9 billion, including 
acquisitions and divestitures, in the past fiscal year."
"DHL Group thus underscores its structurally improved ability to perform and 
financial strength, even in a weak economic environment."
"In the year under review, the divisions continued to focus on their profitable core business and ensured that the services and 
products could be provided reliably."
"On the one hand, DHL Group kept a close eye on costs and, on the other, invested further in 
growth areas of global operations as well as in the quality of its services."
"Representing a significant lever for sustainable business 
growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in the DHL Group strategy."
"DHL Group therefore invests in initiatives designed to 
improve the experiences its customers and employees have with the company and to increase operational efficiency."
"Overall, we 
believe that e-commerce and globalization – along with omnishoring – and increasingly sustainability as well, are megatrends that 
will provide for growth in the future."
DHL Group has a wealth of experience in dealing with various economic cycles and crises around the world.
"Thanks to its global 
presence and the broad portfolio of transport and logistics services, there were also areas of business growth in the year under 
review."
"DHL Group is well positioned to not only manage the current challenges, but also to take advantage of an upward trend in 
the global economy as soon as it arises."

"9 In line with changes to the rating agency’s method, we adjusted the target from 710 to 690 points in the third quarter of 2023."
"These effects contributed to the high rates of inflation along with the loosening of fiscal and monetary policies during the 
coronavirus pandemic."
"The tightening of monetary policy up until the third quarter had a lasting weakening effect on the economy 
and global trade and is a significant factor in the caution seen in investments and consumer behavior."
"Even though the key interest rates of leading central banks could have reached their peak in the 
fall of 2023, a loosening of monetary policy is not likely until the middle of 2024."
The data mentioned in the following paragraph describing the economic conditions stem from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Global GDP growth continued to weaken from 3.1% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023.
"GDP growth in industrialized companies fell from 
2.6% to 1.6%, primarily due to the eurozone, which was impacted by the war in Ukraine and whose growth downright collapsed 
from 3.5% to 0.5%."
"Following growth of 1.9% in the previous year, Germany even fell into the slightly negative growth (–0.2%) in 
the year under review."
"By contrast, the United States bolstered economic activity from 1.9% to 2.4% with a very expansive fiscal 
policy."
"At the same time, emerging markets experienced a recovery from 3.7% to 4.2%, with a significant rise in China from 3.0% in 
2022 to 5.4% in 2023 being a major contributor."
"Growth in global industrial production and global trade significantly hampered 
In 2023, growth in global industrial production and global trade remained significantly hampered."
"Following growth of 7.0% and 
2.8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, industrial production grew by only 0.7% in 2023."
"The figures for global trade reflect this 
slowdown, with exports growing by a mere 1.1% compared with 10.9% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022."
"For the logistics sector, this 
cooling comes with more moderate demand and declining volumes."
"In the B2B segment, challenges from partly excess inventories 
and dwindling demand persisted, which resulted in a sustained alignment of freight rates and transport capacities."
"Even toward the 
end of 2023, there was no significant recovery in demand, which underscores the ongoing global economic recession."
"For DHL 
Group, these developments manifested themselves in the form of a decline in revenue and earnings figures."
"E-commerce with structural growth dynamic 
In spite of the overall uncertainty of the economy, continuing inflation and the slowdown in global trade, the e-commerce sector 
confirmed its structural growth dynamic."
"Following a preliminary normalization in 2022, e-commerce-based business once again 
experienced growth in 2023, which confirms the long-term change in consumer behaviors."
"DHL Group is making use of this 
dynamic to expand and improve its e-commerce logistics services."
"Legal environment 
The Group provides some of its services in regulated markets."
"Many of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its 
subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to sector-specific regulation under the Postgesetz (PostG 
– German Postal Act)."
Information regarding this issue and legal risks is contained in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.
"Since the beginning of the share buyback program, we have repurchased a total of 50.0 million shares with a value of 
€1,940 million."

total of up to 130 million treasury shares are to be purchased at a price of now up to €4 billion through the end of 2025."
"On June 26, 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033."
"The 
interest rate from 2031 onward is linked to the achievement of DHL Group’s targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"On October 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of shares in the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo following successful approval 
by the antitrust authorities."
"In the eCommerce division, the company should contribute to the ability to benefit from the growth 
potential of the Turkish market."
"On December 7, 2023, we acquired the remaining shares in Danzas AEI Emirates, consolidated the company, which had previously 
been held as a joint venture, fully into the Group and renamed it DHL Logistics."
"With this acquisition, our customers in the Middle 
East and Africa region will benefit from more efficient logistics and transport services in the Global Forwarding, Freight division."

"Group revenue falls by 13.4% 
Due to the economic environment, Group revenue fell by €12,678 million to €81,758 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Above all, the 
normalization of freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division and negative currency effects in the amount of 
€2,684 million also contributed to this development."
The proportion of revenue generated abroad changed from 76.8% to 74.4%.
"In 
the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was down from the prior-year period (€23,776 million) to €21,348 million; negative currency 
effects in the amount of €770 million contributed to this."
"At €2,787 million, other operating income fell short of the prior-year 
period (€2,925 million)."

income as a result of the increased shareholding in DHL Logistics in the United Arab Emirates."
"Consolidated EBIT down 
Totaling €6,345 million in the year under review, profit from operating activities (EBIT) came in €2,091 million lower than the 
prior-year figure."
"This figure declined from €1,922 million to €1,642 million in the fourth quarter."
"Primarily because the interest 
expenses for provisions and lease liabilities rose, net finance costs were €829 million and therefore above the level of the previous 
year (net finance costs of €525 million)."
"Profit before income taxes fell by €2,395 million to €5,516 million."
"As a result, income 
taxes decreased by €613 million to €1,581 million in spite of a slightly higher tax rate."
"Consolidated net profit in line with EBIT 
Consolidated net profit showed a decline in the 2023 fiscal year from €5,717 million to €3,935 million."
"Of this amount, 
€3,677 million is attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders and €258 million to noncontrolling interest holders."
"Basic earnings 
per share fell from €4.41 to €3.09 and diluted earnings per share from €4.33 to €3.04."
"Dividend of €1.85 per share proposed 
Our finance strategy calls for paying out 40% to 60% of net profit as dividends as a general rule."
"The Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board will therefore propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2024, a dividend of €1.85 
per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85)."

market volumes were below that of the previous year, but they stabilized over the course of the year."
"With regard to air freight 
rates, normalization continued as expected and there were no major fluctuations."
"This trend was also observed for ocean freight, 
with a rise in rates setting in toward the end of the year as carriers began to pass on higher costs for freight rerouting on the Red 
Sea."
"In the European road freight market, the decline in demand due to economic circumstances continued in the year under review and 
worsened in the third quarter of 2023, in particular."

prices, among other factors."
"Global Forwarding, Freight: lower revenue in air and ocean freight as anticipated

"Post & Parcel Germany division 
Impacts of external factors on our business 
The structural transformation in letter mail business continues: as conventional letter mail volumes containing documents continue 
to decline, volumes of goods shipments in the mail and parcel network are growing."
"The Dialogue Marketing business unit 
underwent negative development, with the advertising spend for physical mail declining compared with the previous year due to 
inflation, reluctance to buy and customer insolvencies."
"In the German parcel market, the war in Ukraine and the increased cost of 
living dampened the mood in online shopping and caused parcel volumes to stagnate."
"Post & Parcel Germany: ongoing structural change shapes business performance 
Revenue in the Post & Parcel Germany division amounted to €16,892 million in the year under review and slightly exceeded the 
prior-year figure by 0.7%."
"The main reasons for this development were the higher prices for business customers starting in the 
second half of the year and increased volumes in national and international business with goods shipments."
"This was countered by 
a volume decline in national and international postal business caused by sustained structural change in mail and communication 
business as well as declining sales of advertising mail."
"Furthermore, decisions to discontinue sales territories for the 
EINKAUFAKTUELL product in 2023 and the overall discontinuation in 2024 had a negative impact on sales in the Dialogue 
Marketing segment."
"Parcel Germany performed well, contrary to the general market trend."
"Revenue in the Post & Parcel Germany 
division for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up by 2.5% versus the prior year."
EBIT in the Post & Parcel Germany division in 2023 amounted to €870 million and was below of the prior-year figure by 31.5%.
"With revenue above the prior year especially in the parcel business, this was driven by higher material costs brought on by inflation 
and pressure from collective bargaining agreements."
"The costs also include €30 million in expenses for an early-retirement 
program established in the fourth quarter of 2023."
Return on sales in the reporting period was 5.2%.
"EBIT in the Post & Parcel 
Germany division amounted to €402 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was thus 4.7% above the prior-year period."

"Responsibility for these activities rests with Corporate Finance at Group headquarters in Bonn, which is supported by 
three Regional Treasury Centers in Bonn (Germany), Weston (Florida, USA) and Singapore."
"The regional centers act as interfaces 
between Group headquarters and the operating companies, advise the companies on financial management issues and ensure 
compliance with Group-wide requirements."
"Corporate Finance’s main task is to minimize financial risk and the cost of capital in 
addition to preserving the Group’s financial stability and flexibility over the long term."
"Creating value through transparent and effective capital allocation 
Building on the principles and objectives of financial management, and in light of the Group’s strong financial position, the 
Corporate Board most recently updated the finance strategy in January 2022."
"It takes into account the shareholders’ interests and 
the lenders’ requirements, focusing on value creation through a transparent and effective allocation of capital."
"It also aims to 
maintain financial flexibility and a low cost of capital for the Group with a high degree of continuity and predictability for investors, 
and to support the Group’s ESG Roadmap."
"One key component of the strategy is a stand-alone target rating between “Baa1” and 
“A3” and “BBB+” and “A–,” respectively."
The strategy also sets clear priorities on how available liquidity is allocated.
"It will first be 
used to fund business operations, finance organic investments and make regular dividend payments."
"Thereafter, additional 
dividend payments or share buybacks as well as inorganic growth will be considered."
"FINANCE STRATEGY 
Cash and liquidity managed centrally 
The cash and liquidity of our globally operating subsidiaries is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury."
"Approximately 80% of the 
Group’s external revenue is consolidated in cash pools and used to balance internal liquidity needs."
"In countries where this practice 
is ruled out for legal reasons, internal and external borrowing and investment are managed centrally by Corporate Treasury."
"In this 
context, we observe a balanced banking policy in order to remain independent of individual banks."
"Our subsidiaries’ intra-Group 
revenue is also pooled and managed by our in-house bank (intercompany clearing) in order to avoid paying external bank charges 
and margins."
"Payment transactions are executed in accordance with uniform guidelines using standardized processes and IT 
systems."
"Many Group companies pool their external payment transactions in the intra-Group Payment Factory, which executes 
payments on behalf of the respective companies via Deutsche Post AG’s central bank accounts."

Limiting market risks 
To limit market risks, the Group makes use of primary and derivative financial instruments."
"Interest rate swaps are used to hedge 
against interest rate risks, and forward transactions are used for currency risks."
"We pass on most of the risk arising from 
commodity price fluctuations to our customers and, to some extent, use commodity swaps to manage the remaining risk."
"The 
parameters, responsibilities and controls governing the use of derivatives are laid down in internal guidelines."
"Flexible and stable financing 
The Group covers its long-term financing requirements by means of equity and debt."
"This ensures our financial stability and also 
provides adequate flexibility."
Our most important source of funds is net cash from operating activities.
"We also have a syndicated credit facility in a total volume of €2 billion that creates a secure, long-term liquidity reserve."
"The term of 
the syndicated credit facility is through 2025, it does not contain any further covenants concerning the Group’s financial indicators 
and, thanks to our solid liquidity situation, it was not drawn down during the year under review."
"As part of our banking policy, we spread our business volume widely and maintain long-term relationships with the financial 
institutions we entrust with our business."
"We meet our borrowing requirements primarily through independent sources of 
financing, such as bonds and leases."
"Most debt is taken out centrally in order to leverage economies of scale and specialization 
benefits and hence minimize borrowing costs."
"In June 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033."
"Moreover, a 
promissory note loan in the amount of €100 million was repaid in September 2023 and one bond in the amount of €500 million 
was repaid in October 2023."

in the previous year."
"Income taxes paid declined by €157 million to €1,625 million."

DEUTSCHE POST AG (HGB) 
Deutsche Post AG as parent company 
In addition to the reporting on the Group, the performance of Deutsche Post AG is outlined below."
"As the parent company of DHL Group, Deutsche Post AG prepares its annual financial statements in accordance with the principles 
of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code) and the Aktiengesetz (AktG – German Stock Corporation Act)."
"There are no separate performance indicators relevant for management purposes that are applicable to the parent company 
Deutsche Post AG."
"For this reason, the following presentation focuses in particular on the annual results under the HGB."
"Employees 
The number of full-time equivalents at Deutsche Post AG as of the reporting date was 159,265 (previous year: 161,772)."
"Results of operations 
Revenue rose by a total of €416 million (2.6%) year over year."
"Revenue from the German letter mail business was €7,193 million in the year under review and thus 4.6% below the prior-year 
level of €7,537 million."
"Of this revenue, €4,569 million (previous year: €4,861 million) was attributable to Mail Communication, 
€1,653 million (previous year: €1,711 million) to Dialogue Marketing and €971 million (previous year: €965 million) to other 
services."
"Revenue in the German parcel business in the reporting year was €6,452 million, exceeding the prior-year figure of 
€5,820 million by 10.9%."
This is primarily attributable to higher intra-Group remuneration.
"Revenue of €2,153 million (previous 
year: €2,049 million) was reported for our International business unit in the reporting period."
"Other revenue amounted to 
€750 million (previous year: €726 million) and included mainly income from service level agreements, rental agreements and 
leases and reimbursements for employee leasing."
"Due to higher costs on account of inflation, material expense rose by €101 million on account of an increase in the cost of transport 
services for letters and parcels as well as an increase for leases and rents."
Staff costs were up by €350 million.
"In the year under review, inflation compensation payments in the amount of €387 million were 
made."
"The decrease in other operating expenses by €108 million stemmed mainly from lower expenses from currency translation 
(€165 million)."
"The financial result in the amount of €3,403 million mainly comprises net investment income of €2,864 million (previous year: 
€3,739 million) and a net interest income of €541 million (previous year: expense of €657 million)."
"The change in net investment 
income is due to the €874 million decrease in income from profit transfer agreements attributable to Deutsche Post Beteiligungen 
Holding GmbH, whose earnings were the result of higher intra-Group interest expenses and lower income from investments."
"Income from the discounting of provisions and higher intra-Group interest income due to increased interest rates in the market 
environment led to the improvement in net interest income of Deutsche Post AG."
"After accounting for taxes on income of €–342 million, net profit for the period totaled €2,786 million."
"Including retained profits 
carried forward, net retained profit for the period amounted to €9,216 million."
"Net assets and financial position 
Total assets down 
Total assets declined to €45,425 million as of the reporting date."
"Fixed assets increased from €17,882 million to €18,103 million."
"Investments were made mainly in mail and parcel centers, conveyor and sorting systems, Pack- and Poststations and real estate for 
network expansion."
"Noncurrent financial assets were down by €68 million, due primarily to lower loans to affiliated companies."
"Cash and 
cash equivalents decreased by €745 million, due primarily to money market investments being €1,104 million lower."
"Equity was down from €19,224 million in the previous year to €19,033 million."
"Net profit for 2023 of €2,786 million exceeded the 
dividend paid to shareholders of €2,205 million in 2023."
"Earnings reserves rose by €1,243 million, in particular due to the transfer 
of €2,000 million to earnings reserves and the issue of shares primarily for executive remuneration plans in the amount of 
€209 million."
"The decline of €966 million in earnings reserves had the opposite effect and was due to the offsetting of share 
buybacks."
The equity ratio increased slightly from 41.1% to 41.9%.
"For the disclosures pursuant to Section 160(1), no."
"2, of the 
Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act), please refer to notes 26 and 27 to the financial statements of Deutsche Post AG, as 
well as appendix 5, for the 2023 fiscal year."
Provisions were up by €138 million in the reporting period.
"Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased by 
€179 million due to discounting effects from the higher overall interest rates and higher fair values of the plan assets."
"The change 
in provisions for taxes of €266 million is primarily attributable to the increase in provisions for income taxes (€262 million)."

Liabilities decreased by €1,315 million to €20,195 million."
The liabilities arising from bonds remain unchanged.
"Liabilities to banks 
declined by €96 million."
"Trade payables decreased by €115 million, liabilities to investees by €62 million and other liabilities by 
€107 million."
"The decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies amounting to €935 million resulted largely from intra-Group cash 
management."
"Decline in cash funds 
Deutsche Post AG’s cash funds fell by €745 million to €1,281 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Decrease in debt 
Deutsche Post AG’s debt (provisions and liabilities) fell by €1,177 million to €26,200 million compared with the previous year."
"The 
decrease was due chiefly to a decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies (€935 million)."
"Expected developments, opportunities and risks 
The international strategy and associated performance forecast of DHL Group also reflect the expectations for Deutsche Post AG as 
the parent company."
"Since Deutsche Post AG is interconnected with the companies of DHL Group through arrangements, including 
financing and guarantee commitments and direct and indirect investments in its investees, Deutsche Post AG’s opportunities and 
risks fundamentally align with those of the Group."
"The section titled expected developments, opportunities and risks therefore also 
covers expected developments, opportunities and risks with respect to Deutsche Post AG as the parent company."
"The Post & Parcel 
Germany division reflects Deutsche Post AG’s core business in material respects."
"The subsidiaries have an indirect influence on 
Deutsche Post AG through net investment income from profit transfer agreements."

with the forecast from the previous year and enables the planned dividend distribution in 2024 from the net profit for 2023."
"In addition to its own operations, the subsidiaries’ future operating results influence the future results of Deutsche Post AG."
"The 
HGB financial statements are material to calculating the dividend."
"Without one-off effects from the financial result, we anticipate 
for the 2024 fiscal year a result for Deutsche Post AG at the level of the previous year, which should enable a dividend payment 
compatible with our financial strategy."

"Opportunities and 
risks arising from climate change are assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which also takes the provisions of the EU Taxonomy into account."
"This involves 
discussing and assessing both transitory and physical risks stemming from climate change using various scenarios."
"In the reporting period, the ESG risks identified in the previous year in the material issues of climate change (risk categories: 
operational, market- and customer-specific and from regulation) and information technology were confirmed."
"These risks are 
assessed as being of medium significance for the Group."

"Focus areas in the reporting period 
In June 2023, the first sustainability-linked bond was placed with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033."
"The 
interest rate of the bond is linked to our medium-term target of significantly reducing GHG emissions by 2030."
"The focus throughout the year was on the interpretation and application of the European Union’s (EU) new requirements of 
sustainability reporting that have to be applied starting in the 2024 fiscal year."
"The materiality analysis was conceptualized and 
carried out in consideration of the new requirements of materiality."
"As part of this, the effects, risks and opportunities were 
evaluated during internal expert meetings and in-depth assessments were carried out."
"This also included a comprehensive 
location-based analysis of aspects related to biodiversity."
The results were discussed with internal as well as external stakeholders.
"According to our current assessment, we classify the ESRS topics of climate protection, own workforce, workers in the value chain 
and business conduct, as well as cybersecurity as a company-specific topic, as material."
"In addition, ESG metrics, responsibilities 
and internal collection and reporting systems were reviewed for necessary adjustments or expansions; moreover, the additional 
requirements of the EU Taxonomy were implemented."
"Environment 
Climate protection in the focus of our operations 
The main environmental impact of our business activities is caused by logistics-related greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute 
to climate change."
The EU also classifies the transport sector as energy-intensive (high climate impact sector).
"Within the framework 
of our ESG Roadmap, we have defined measures and ambitious targets to minimize these effects, to realize opportunities and to 
avoid risks."
"The Company 
Combined Management Report 
Consolidated Financial Statements 
Further Information

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
Medium-term target: We have set ourselves a target of reducing our logistics-related GHG emissions to below 29 million metric 
tons of CO₂e by the year 2030."
"In addition to our own GHG emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, we also include the Scope 3 emissions 
from upstream transportation and distribution (category 4), fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3) and business travel 
(category 6) in this target."
"This target was developed based on the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports global efforts to 
limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement of the United Nations."
"Logistics-related Scope 3 emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities, 
upstream transportation and distribution and business travel are to be reduced by 25% by 2030."
"The interest rate of our first 
sustainability-linked bond is linked to these subtargets."
The use of sustainable fuels is a significant focus of our climate protection activities.
"The reduction effects generated through these 
measures offer us the opportunity to implement climate protection directly in the transport sector and in our supply chain in a 
targeted manner."
"As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented 
use thereof (book and claim)."
This makes a positive impact on our target calculation.
"To calculate the market-based effects, we use 
the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by 
the Smart Freight Centre."
Long-term target: We want to reduce the GHG emissions of our logistics services to net zero by 2050.
"That means we will use 
active reduction measures to reduce these emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) down to an unavoidable minimum, which is to be fully 
compensated for with recognized countermeasures (excluding offsetting)."
"DECARBONIZATION TARGETS 
Million metric tons of CO2e 
1 Includes the effect from the acquisition of the Hillebrand Group in the 2022 fiscal year, recognized starting in the 2022 Annual Report."
"3 Includes the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), 3 (fuel- and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel)."
"We round out this package of measures with a range of specifically environmentally 
friendly products: GoGreen Plus enables our customers to make a conscious decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use 
of sustainable fuels."
This approach allows us to uphold our responsibility to the climate and the environment.
"The central climate protection activities are developed in the Department Chief Executive Officer and Group guidelines are adapted 
accordingly or drafted and implemented throughout the Group."
"The Department Finance collects environmental data, monitors 
progress toward goals, assesses opportunities and risks and carries out internal and external reporting, embedded in the internal 
control system."
"Our orientation with regard to climate and environmental protection is set out in Group policies: in the Code of Conduct and the 
Supplier Code of Conduct, in the Environmental and Energy Policy and the internal policies for sustainable fuels and procurement 
processes."
"In the year under review, the Environmental and Energy Policy was completely revised and adapted in line with the ESG 
Roadmap."
"In addition, together with our subcontractors, we work as part of a wide range of initiatives to develop sustainable fuels and 
technologies in order to reduce fuel consumption and lower GHG emissions."
"This also enables us to procure the consumption and 
emissions data necessary for subcontractor management."
"The Clean Cargo Initiative of the global shipping industry and our 
internal Green Carrier Certification for road freight are examples of this."
"Risks arising from climate change 
Opportunities and risks arising from climate change were assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
"For transitory risks, we used the sustainable development scenario of the International Energy Agency."
"Moreover, the assessment of locations 
with increased physical risk was confirmed."
"Progress in decarbonization 
The management of our measures is focused on the development of net logistics-related GHG emissions (GHG emissions) and the 
GHG emissions avoided by the company’s own decarbonization measures."
"Our calculation for this includes the entire process chain 
for generating and supplying energy for transport with the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation distribution), 3 (fuel- 
and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel) of the GHG Protocol (well-to-wheel)."
"The other Scope 3 categories not 
directly related to logistics are not taken into account as part of our medium-term target."
"The Company

The calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions takes the use of sustainable fuels into consideration on the basis of amounts purchased."
"For calculating Scope 3 emissions, we use an activity-based calculation model that also accounts for fuel amounts and reduction 
measures documented by transport companies."
"In the Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions, reduction effects from market-based 
processes are also included that represent a substitution of fossil fuels – without direct physical procurement of the fuels – 
documented by means of certificates (book and claim)."
"The GHG emissions are the result of the modes of transport and are broken down as follows: 68% air, 24% land and 7% ocean 
(previous year: 69% air, 22% land and 8% ocean); buildings still contribute 1%."
"In the year under review, GHG emissions fell by 9.1% 
to 33.27 million metric tons of CO2e."
"The Scope 1 net and Scope 2 (market-based method) GHG emissions decreased by 0.8% to 
8.30 million metric tons of CO2e; the net Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11.5% to 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e."
The decrease in GHG emissions is primarily influenced by the declining development of shipment volumes.
"Realized 
Decarbonization Effects from our measures of 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e) made a 
reduction contribution, meaning we achieved our target for the year under review."
"As part of this, the use of electricity from 
renewable sources, the electrification of our pickup and delivery fleet and fueling with sustainable fuels and/or the voluntary 
blending in the distribution networks used had an emissions-reducing effect."
"An additional reduction of 128 metric kilotons of CO₂e results from the statutorily mandated blending of biofuels (previous year 
adjusted: 140 metric kilotons of CO2e) that is not included in our Realized Decarbonization Effects."
"The burning of biomass 
(biological material made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen) resulted in emissions in the amount of 787 metric kilotons of CO2e 
(previous year: 538 metric kilotons of CO2e) that are not attributable to Scopes 1, 2 and 3 under the GHG Protocol."
"In the year under 
review, GHG intensity was 407 grams of CO2e per € of revenue (previous year adjusted: 387 grams of CO2e per € of revenue)."
2 Not included in the 2030 targets.
We also invest in technologies to design our own new buildings to be climate-neutral.
"The share of sustainable fuels is to 
top 30% in air and ocean freight as well as land transport by 2030."
"In pickups and deliveries, 60% of vehicles used are to be electric 
vehicles."
We want to design all of our new buildings to be climate-neutral.
Sustainable technologies and fuels are often more expensive than conventional technologies and fossil fuels.
"In the year under 
review, the additional expenses for decarbonization measures as a result of this increased by 55.6% to €442 million."
"This enables a 
reduction of around 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e), including 127 metric kilotons of 
CO2e from market-based mechanisms."
"The share of sustainable fuels increased by 1.1 percentage points to 2.8% (previous year: 
1.7%)."
"In pickups and deliveries, we increased the share of e-vehicles used in the reporting period to 37.6%; the number of e-
vehicles was around 35,200 (previous year: 27,800)."
"We therefore made significant progress toward achieving our goal of reaching 
a share of 60% by 2030."
"At 97%, the share of electricity from renewable sources used was well above the level of the previous year 
(previous year: 94%)."
We are also driving decarbonization with our portfolio of GoGreen Plus products.
"We enable our customers to make a conscious 
decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use of sustainable fuels."
"We already offer sustainable alternatives for around 
two-thirds of our classic product range."
"We also launched the DHL GoGreen Dashboard, a digital reporting platform for our 
customers that enables them to consolidate their GHG emissions across all modes of transport, with various options for displaying 
and breaking down the data."
"As a supplement to GoGreen Plus, we still offer our customers offsetting products to compensate for their GHG emissions."
"However, in accordance with the GHG Protocol and for the presentation of the Realized Decarbonization Effects, this offsetting is 
not taken into account as an emissions reduction for the calculation of our own GHG footprint."
"In the year under review, certificates 
in the amount of 1.0 million metric tons of CO2e were retired for the 2022 fiscal year."
"Divisions drive decarbonization 
Express was able to conclude further delivery contracts for sustainable aircraft fuels."
"Moreover, the modernization of the aircraft 
fleet for use on intercontinental and regional routes was continued and the network of partnerships with transport subcontractors 
was expanded further."
"Furthermore, Express continued with the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles."
"Global Forwarding, Freight concluded additional partnerships for insetting with sustainable fuels."
"Our Green Carrier Certification 
for transport partners creates transparency regarding the sustainability of our subcontractors."
"Around 1,000 Freight users already 
receive emissions reports; via myDHLi, we offer Global Forwarding users reports containing real-time data on air and ocean freight."
Our customers are thus supported in achieving their own sustainability goals.
"Supply Chain is driving the decarbonization of its supply chains with a portfolio of state-of-the-art, sustainable products for carbon-
neutral storage, transport and packaging."
"In the year under review, a guideline for sustainable transports for relevant subsidiaries 
was introduced that describes the effective use of sustainable drive technologies and fuels in consideration of economic aspects."
"In 
addition, the focus was on the further expansion of carbon-neutral warehouses and sustainable transport."
"Some of our fueling 
stations in the Great Britain were converted from diesel to HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil)."
"In Ireland, biogas production is being 
expanded by partners to enable fueling trucks with sustainably produced gas."
"eCommerce continues to focus on the expansion of the fleet of e-vehicles and the increased use of electricity from renewable 
sources."
Delivery and pickup in the Netherlands are being made more climate-friendly through the increased use of HVO.
Post & Parcel Germany continued the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles.
"In addition, further measures were tested to make 
transport between our locations more sustainable."
"Using gas-powered trucks (sustainably produced compressed natural gas – 
CNG) for longer transport routes was identified as a solution."
"Moreover, the portfolio of sustainable products was expanded."
"The 
CO2e Sustainability Report offers business customers additional transparency regarding the GHG emissions caused by the 
transport of their national goods shipments."

Energy consumption and efficiency 
Air freight is the most energy-intensive mode of transport in our business model."
"With continuous modernization processes in our 
own fleet and at our locations, we can have a positive impact on our energy consumption."
"For this reason, we are increasingly 
shifting transports to our own more efficient fleet and continuing to train the pilots in the use of energy-conserving flight 
maneuvers."
"In the year under review, Group-wide energy consumption (Scopes 1 and 2) increased to 35,056 million kWh, while the use of 
energy from renewable sources was increased by 35.1% compared with the previous year."
"The transport sector is among the most 
energy-intensive sectors, which is why the so-called energy intensity is calculated on the basis of Group revenue."
"In the fiscal year, 
this figure amounted to 0.43 kWh per € of revenue (previous year: 0.37 kWh per € of revenue)."
"In the year under review, we were able to once again increase the share of electricity from renewable sources, which now comes in 
at 97% (previous year: 94%)."
Use is largely documented by means of certificates.
"The resulting savings in GHG emissions are 
reflected in the Scope 2 emissions (market-based method)."
"In addition, we use the electricity we produce and purchase electricity 
from renewable sources directly via power purchase agreements."
2 Includes legally required blending.
3 Europe: largely regulated energy attribute certificates (EACs).
"North America: renewable energy certificates (RECs), global: international renewable energy certificates (I-RECs)."
"Progress report on the sustainability-linked bond 
Our sustainability-linked bond has an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033."
"The interest rate of the bond is linked 
to our medium-term target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25%."
"For the validation process of our medium-term target by the SBTi, we had already taken into account the effect of the acquisition of 
Hillebrand Group on our logistics-related GHG emissions in our calculations for the 2021 base year."
"The acquisition was completed 
in the 2022 fiscal year and, since then, Hillebrand has been included in consolidation."

Logistics-related GHG emissions are undergoing declining development, in line with expectations."
"This trend is primarily the result 
of economic developments and our decarbonization measures."
"In the year under review, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions amounted 
to 8.30 million metric tons of CO2e, and 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e in Scope 3."
"This corresponds to an increase of 10.4% in 
Scopes 1 and 2, as well as a decrease of 23.7% in Scope 3, compared with the base year of 2021."
"The increase in Scope 1 emissions

Common DNA as a factor for success 
Our corporate culture makes us strong."
"It is underpinned by common values, convictions and behaviors and is one of the most 
important factors in our business success."
We call it our Common DNA.
"This culture connects us across all business units and 
operating regions and defines who we are and how we operate."
"As early as 2006, we defined a Code of Conduct for our employees that is applicable throughout the Group."
"We value the diversity of 
our workforce and act with respect, so that we may work together cooperatively and lay the foundation for our company’s financial 
success."
"Being an employer of choice 
Our employees are our most valuable asset."
"With more than 590,000 employees worldwide, we are one of the world’s largest 
employers in our sector and aim to be an employer of choice."
"For this reason, we want to strengthen and lock in their commitment at a high level."
"We are dedicated to the principles of diversity, 
equity, inclusion and belonging to create a safe work environment free of discrimination where each individual is valued and to 
guarantee workplaces that promote health."

6 Includes accident-related injuries to external employees who are subject to instruction in the Supply Chain division.
"Preserving employee interests 
In addition to direct dialogue with their superiors or other managers, our employees can turn to employee representatives, for 
example works councils, trade unions and other bodies, to indirectly represent their interests."
"At the global level, we engage in regular, open dialogue with international trade union confederations such as UNI Global Union 
(UNI) and International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF)."
"We are also continuing the OECD Protocol from 2016, which was 
agreed upon with the two global trade union confederations."
"A wide range of topics was discussed as part of this during the year 
under review, for example our Human Rights Policy Statement and the different working time arrangements in our divisions."

At the European level, employee concerns are regularly discussed with our European works council, the DHL Forum."
"The Board 
Member for Human Resources takes part in the discussions twice per year."
UNI and the ITF are also represented.
"In addition, as the largest postal service provider in Europe, the Group is a member of the EU Commission’s European Social 
Dialogue Committee for the Postal Sector and is the Committee Chair."
"The work of this committee involves exchange between the 
employers and union representatives in the postal sector of European member states on relevant topics – for example future 
changes in the working world and their impact on employees – in consideration of social matters."
"Our remuneration system 
We foster employee loyalty and motivation by offering performance-based remuneration in line with market standards."
"The 
remuneration includes a base salary plus the agreed variable remuneration components such as bonus payments."
"In many countries – including Germany, the Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States – we also provide 
employees with access to defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans."
"Around 70% of our employees participate in 
these plans."
We also use neutral job evaluations to prevent discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics.
"These evaluations focus on 
the type of job, position in the company and responsibilities assigned and rely on, in addition to formal qualifications, relevant 
professional experience to increase the equity of opportunities for suitable applicants."
"This systematic approach enables an 
independent and balanced remuneration structure."
"In Germany, wages or salaries are generally regulated through either industry-level or company-level collective wage agreements."
"In many of our subsidiaries throughout Germany, our wage-scale employees also receive a performance-based bonus in addition to 
their monthly wage or salary."
"The collectively bargained principles are gender-neutral, so the use of collective agreements ensures 
equity in pay for women and men."
"Employees of Deutsche Post AG covered by the collective wage agreement may opt to take 
additional time off in lieu of a pay increase."
"A total of 19.6% of the workforce there had exercised this option as of December 31, 
2023."
"The remuneration of employees in a non-pay-scale employment relationship (Deutsche Post AG, principal entity in Germany) 
is bound by existing works agreements."
"A resolution was reached in the reporting year on a lasting and significant wage increase for the approximately 160,000 employees 
of Deutsche Post AG subject to collective bargaining."
"In spite of the downward trend in profits in the German post and parcel 
business and the regulatory conditions in this area, significant pay raises and additional compensation for inflation will be provided 
to employees."
"The pay increase means an average raise of 11.5% over a term of two years across all income groups that takes 
effect starting on April 1, 2024."
"Piloted share program 
In addition to managers, we want our employees to share in the long-term success of our company and, in doing so, promote their 
loyalty and motivation."
"In the reporting year, another share program was therefore developed that will initially be piloted in 12 
countries."
"We thus enable our employees participating in the program to acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 15% 
from the market price, up to an annual cap of €3,600."
The shares acquired are not subject to a lockup period.
"Through this pilot 
project, the Board of Management hopes to test the interest of employees in and the administrative burden of such a program."

"Added to this, an average throughout the year of 
81,782 external FTEs (previous year: 83,951 FTEs) subject to the control and direction of the Group were employed at our 
locations."
"Staff costs amounted to €26,977 million and thus exceeded the prior-year figure (€26,035 million)."
"This includes the tax-free bonus 
payment to compensate for inflation."
2 FTE = full-time equivalent.
Part-time employees are converted to full-time.
"Measuring Employee Engagement 
Motivated and dedicated employees are central prerequisites for the sustainable success of our business."
"Each year, we measure 
employee satisfaction and engagement by conducting a Group-wide survey."
"As part of the survey, all employees have the 
opportunity to anonymously rate the company’s strategy and values as well as its working conditions."
"This important tool helps us 
determine where we are in our journey toward becoming an employer of choice."
"We use the analysis of the annual survey to derive 
the Employee Engagement KPI, which also makes up 10% of the annual bonus of the Board of Management."
"In the year under review, 77% of employees took the opportunity to express their opinion and provide feedback."
"This is used as the 
foundation for creating the best possible working conditions at our company, thus corresponding to our strategic goal of being an 
employer of choice."
"We once again exceeded the target of more than 80% with a figure of 83% (previous year: 83%) for this

"Our training offers convey knowledge about our Group strategy and how each employee can make an individual 
contribution to our success."
"One example is our Group-wide “Certified” employee motivation and development program, which 
aims to make our employees certified specialists in their respective areas of responsibility."
"It also creates an atmosphere that 
places our customers at the heart of our activities and ensures we provide excellent service."
"In addition to a certified foundation 
module, we offer our employees a wide range of follow-up modules customized to their specific roles and areas of expertise."
"In 
addition, we offer numerous professional development opportunities related to the topic of digitalization, including courses on the 
application of data science."
"With leadership attributes, we give our employees a guide for how to conduct themselves respectfully and in a results-oriented 
manner on a daily basis when dealing with internal and external stakeholders."
"In addition, we encourage them to take on 
challenges with a positive attitude and to focus on their own strengths."
"We place additional emphasis on providing training for 
managers so that, together with their employees, they can make internal and external stakeholders successful."
"In the year under review, our employees spent a total of 4.7 million hours (previous year: 3.7 million hours) on training and 
professional development throughout the Group."
"Moreover, the Group invested time and money in qualification elements 
integrated in the job, such as orientation and service training, which are not included in this figure."
"Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging  
Our organization brings together people from cultures and cultural backgrounds from all over the world who possess a wide range 
of experiences, abilities and perspectives, with 179 nationalities represented at our German sites alone."
"The diversity of our 
employees is not only an asset to the company but also one of its major strengths."
"Diversity, inclusion and freedom from discrimination are anchored in the form of our Code of Conduct throughout the Group."
"We 
expressly reject any and all forms of discrimination."
"We take an equal-opportunity approach to new hirings, both internally and 
externally, and look exclusively to a candidate’s qualifications when deciding on their suitability."
"The scope of our diversity management activities includes the topics of equity and belonging, in addition to diversity and inclusion."
"The DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging) Board is comprised of executives in upper management from various central 
and divisional functions."
"Among other things, new concepts for employee retention were piloted during the year under review that 
are becoming increasingly important in the competition for skilled workers and qualified employees."
"Moreover, employee resource 
groups were established for the first time."
"Employees organize themselves voluntarily into these groups to promote a diverse and 
integrative working environment that aligns with our company purpose, our values, the business practices and our goals."
"Groups 
focusing on the topics (diversity dimensions) of physical and mental abilities as well as sexual orientation and gender identity 
(LGBTQ+) were founded in the year under review."
"During the Group-wide DEIB Week, a campaign on the topic of awareness for a 
sense of belonging was started, for which we received positive feedback from our employees."
"With regard to LGBTQ+ matters, our company’s in-house RainbowNet network provides opportunities for our employees to share 
their experiences."

Our focus remains on the share of women in management positions."
"By 2025, we aim for women to occupy at least 30% of middle- 
and upper-management positions in the Group."
"The company uses various approaches and programs, such as coaching, mentoring 
and networking, to specifically empower female junior staff for the next step in their careers on the way to becoming middle- or 
upper-level executives."
The share was 27.2% in the year under review (previous year: 26.3%).
"We therefore fell just short of our 
target of women occupying 27.7% of middle- and upper-management positions in the year under review."
"In line with our inclusive approach, we give disabled individuals professional prospects."
"In Germany, employers of a certain size and 
above are required by law to ensure that employees with disabilities make up at least 5% of their workforce."
"At Deutsche Post AG, 
our principal entity in Germany, 14,014 persons with disabilities were employed in the reporting year (previous year: 14,274), 22 
of whom were trainees; that represents 7.9% of the total workforce (previous year: 8.0%)."
The average age of employees throughout the Group is 41 years old (previous year: 40 years old).
"In response to demographic 
developments, we have placed an additional focus of our employee retention measures on recruiting and retaining young talents."
"In doing so, we concentrate on positions with on-the-job training as well as trainee and dual-study programs."
"In Germany, we offered a 
total of around 1,900 spots in our postsecondary educational training and dual-study programs during the reporting year."
"We 
provide college and university graduates with the chance to choose between various postgraduate training programs."
"Occupational health and safety 
The health and safety of our employees in the workplace is of central importance to us and is therefore embedded in our Codes of 
Conduct."
"We comply with the Group’s existing occupational health and safety policies, statutory regulations and industry standards."
"In the Group policy on occupational health and safety, we define our understanding and the importance of this topic; with our 
internal Safety First framework, we provide our employees with clear guidelines for implementation."
"Our management system 
complies with the international ISO 45001 standards, to which various business units of the divisions are also externally certified."
Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to these same high standards.
Accident prevention in the workplace is the top priority of our occupational health and safety activities.
"Some of our biggest 
challenges are in our pickup and delivery operations, because external influences can only be managed to a certain extent in this 
area."
"Bad weather, roadwork, complex traffic situations and dealing with animals require employees to pay attention, concentrate 
and take responsibility for themselves."
"The most frequent causes of accidents remain slipping, tripping and falling, as well as 
dropped objects."
"Accidents are analyzed, the respective material root causes are identified and measures are introduced that 
facilitate the continuous improvement of safety for our employees."
"Solutions proven in practice to reduce or eliminate potential 
hazards are shared across the Group."
"We promote this via systematic, Group-wide exchange on potential improvements and 
corrective measures."
"To this end, an IT-supported process was implemented throughout the Group in the year under review."
Measures can now be directly assessed and used in other divisions.
"The measures receiving the best assessments are nominated 
for internal awards."
"In addition, regular work meetings and workplace inspections are carried out at our locations and areas with 
greater hazard potential are identified with corresponding signage."
"This also includes accident-related injuries to external 
employees who are subject to instruction."
"We use the accident investigations to derive measures to eliminate the respective root 
causes of these accidents and to avoid reoccurrence."
"The lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) dropped to 3.1 in the year under 
review, meaning we significantly exceeded our target value of 3.5."
"In the year under review, we unfortunately documented 11 fatal accidents with our own employees and one with an external 
employee subject to instructions."
"Of these 12 accidents, 11 of them were traffic accidents."
We expressly regret this development.
"Each death is presented to and discussed in detail by the Operations Board, which is chaired by the CEO."
"The Operations Board is 
informed on an ongoing basis about the developments of work-related accident statistics."
"3 Work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours resulting in at least one working day of absence following the day of the accident."
4 For informational purposes; key figure will be converted to this presentation starting in 2024.
"Health and well-being 
We regard health as a state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of illness."
"Work can be a major 
source of satisfaction, and therefore also of health."
"At our company, a healthy workplace is somewhere that employees and 
managers work together to promote the well-being of everyone."
"Within this context, through our Employee Benefits program, we offer our employees and their families insurance cover in the form 
of financial security in the event of death or disability as well as health insurance benefits."
"This offer depends upon provisions of 
labor law and the common market practices in many countries."
"Currently, around 280,000 employees in 100 countries are covered 
by this program."
"In particular as part of this program, incentives are provided to local management to offer health-promoting 
programs to employees and their families."
"We carry out such health projects and local initiatives to create a health-promoting work 
environment and raise awareness of a healthy lifestyle among our employees."
"The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) advises the Board of Management in all matters regarding occupational health management – for 
instance the development of physical and mental diseases in the work context and concepts for how to deal with epidemic or 
pandemic risks."
"In the reporting year, we approved and implemented the declaration on health and well-being throughout the Group as a supplement 
to the Group policy on occupational health and safety."
"In addition, we established the Health & Well-Being Forum, which is 
comprised of experts and managers from all divisions."
The Group-wide sickness rate decreased to 5.7% in the year under review (previous year: 6.3%).
"As part of our corporate citizenship initiatives, 
we are leveraging our global network and the expertise of local employees in line with our purpose: Connecting people, improving 
lives."
"Partnerships and initiatives 
Our initiatives enable us to use our strengths and capabilities to effect change locally and to work together to meet global 
challenges."
We partner with established international organizations to ensure that our initiatives have the greatest impact possible.
"With GoHelp (disaster management), GoTeach (increasing employability), GoTrade (promoting trade) and GoGreen (environmental 
protection), we also support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4, 5, 8, 11, 13 and 17."
"We also support employee engagement through our Global Volunteer Day, the “DHL’s Got Heart” initiative and the Improving Lives 
Fund."
Volunteering encourages employees to participate in local communities.
"Based on the Group-wide annual survey of employees, we know that corporate citizenship is a relevant factor in determining the 
overall level of motivation."
"They want to contribute to social and environmental objectives not only in their personal lives but also at 
work, to help society and the environment and to enhance the Group’s reputation."
"We therefore measure the success of our 
initiatives using the approval rate for the survey question asking whether our employees are proud of DHL Group’s contribution to 
society."
"In the year under review, 78% (previous year: 79%) of all employees responded positively."
"Employees take part in the Go programs in large numbers 
In the year under review, our employees once again took part in social projects in large numbers as part of our Go programs."
"The 
focal points were on humanitarian missions following the severe earthquakes in Turkey, Syria and Morocco."
"Our GoHelp teams 
supported efforts on the ground with their logistics expertise."
"Our internal We Help Each Other aid fund also provided financial 
support for employees affected by natural disasters and war."
"Employee donations were matched by the Group, thus doubling our 
employees’ contributions."
"In addition, we implemented minimum standards for GoTeach and strengthened the GoTrade training 
programs."
"Ensuring our interactions with business partners, employees, the capital market and the general public are conducted with 
integrity and within the bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation and is the basis for sustainable business success."
"The rules for ethical conduct included in our Code of Conduct are further specified in our Human Rights Policy Statement as well as 
our Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Standards Policy."
"Our focus at all times is on preventing potential violations of statutory 
requirements and internal guidelines."
"Corporate Internal Audit evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management system, control mechanisms, management and 
monitoring processes and compliance with Group policies, contributing to their improvement."
"It does this by performing 
independent regular and ad hoc audits at all Group companies and at corporate headquarters with the authority of the Board of 
Management."
"The audit teams discuss the audit findings and agree on measures for improvement with the audited organizational 
units and their management."
The Board of Management is regularly informed of the findings.
"The Supervisory Board is provided 
with a summary once a year."

"Trusted business partner thanks to compliance culture 
We render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies."
One important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery.
"We observe all 
applicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of 
the World Economic Forum."
"Ensuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group 
management bodies."
Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide.
"Responsibility for designing 
the CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO."
"This establishes uniform minimum standards to 
ensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-
Corruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy)."
"The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the 
implementation of the CMS within the divisions."
"Participation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of 
relevant compliance training is mandatory."
"In this way, we raise our employees’ awareness for potential compliance risks and 
enable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner."
"The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance 
Curriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection."
"All employees in the target 
group are required to repeat the training courses every two years."
"We use the share of valid training certificates among executives 
in middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI."
"Potential violations can be reported 24/7 – if legally permitted, anonymously – via our compliance incident reporting system 
(whistleblower hotline)."
"In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone."
"Third parties can also use the system to 
report potential violations."
"Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized 
process."
"Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool 
(BKMS Dashboard)."
"Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the 
Board of Management and to the Supervisory Board’s Finance and Audit Committee."
"The importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign – 
Compliance Awareness Week – which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions."
"The campaign 
was accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (“tone from the top”) and supported by panel 
discussions with managers."
"To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance 
aspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels."
"The compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year: 
98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review."
"In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit 
also reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures."
"Findings 
from the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program."
"Respecting human rights 
Our commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International 
Labor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights 
Policy Statement."
"These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers 
and subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact."
"Our human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours, 
occupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association."
"With 
the Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental 
principles and implement them in their own supply chains."
"With our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the 
requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG)."
"Implementation of the 
measures is monitored by the LkSG Council."
"The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions 
Human Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate 
Procurement and Corporate Internal Audit."
"As part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the 
agreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented."
"In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place."
"The Company

Human rights in the workforce 
With our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce."
"In addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements."
"Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad 
hoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Group-
wide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system."
We carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks.
"First, the risk is analyzed using external 
data (Verisk Maplecroft)."
"Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the 
basis of their specific risk profile."
Targeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments.
"These reviews are conducted by specially trained and 
externally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters."
"If there are violations identified at locations, these 
are then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan."
"In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership 
of the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and 
Europe."
We encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights.
"Participation 
is mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period 
(previous year: 98.4%)."
"Standards in the supply chain 
Corporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards."
"This selection process is based 
on a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well 
as external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft."
"In the year 
under review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits 
(including in accordance with the SMETA method)."
"In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for 
corrective measures are agreed upon."
Procurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on.
"We convey our expectations to 
our suppliers and subcontractors via our Supplier Portal and introduce our selection processes."
"Suppliers can also use our portal to 
familiarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the 
corresponding training module."
"From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can 
use to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents."
"In the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments."
"We 
calculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups)."
"The risk assessment is influenced 
by 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are 
evaluated for each individual purchasing category."
"The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the 
probability and the possible impact."
"More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review 
(previous year: >2,700)."
"We use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our 
standards in the supply chain."
"We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management 
on a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO."
"In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an 
accepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than €35 billion (previous year: >€27 billion)."
"In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and 
enables reliable operations."
"Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in 
accordance with ISO 27001."
"Since January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year: 
Corporate Board Member for Global Business Services)."
"The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and 
manages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes."
"The Information 
Security Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection 
and Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs."
"The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates 
the potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards."
We limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties.
"All 
systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers."
"Additionally, by performing 
continuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality."
A variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks.
All employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations.
"We 
also draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations."
"Participation in Information Security Awareness training is 
mandatory for all employees with a computer workstation."
"All participants who have already completed their training must update 
their certification every two years."
Our cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight.
"This rating is based on the technical 
analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an 
automated service on a daily basis."
"Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables 
comparison with other companies thanks to standardization."
"We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with 
major customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40."
"The target amount is determined by the aspiration to 
be within the upper quarter of this comparison group."
The cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period.
"This performance indicator makes up 10% of 
the annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management."
"As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year 
under review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency."
"In line with the change, we adjusted our target 
for the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points."
"The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year 
under review (previous year: 700 points)."
The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.
"Tax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide 
Our tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group."
"The overarching approach 
applied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs."
We do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes.
"Our Group 
maintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany."
"These 
locations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions."
"None of our companies was established with the 
purpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring."
"In interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law’s spirit and 
intended purpose."
"As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where 
uncertainty is high."
"In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in 
continual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers."
"This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in 
which we operate."
"Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor 
tax risks and respective countermeasures."
"The Company 
Combined Management Report 
Consolidated Financial Statements

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
In the year under review, we recognized taxes and social security contributions totaling €5,274 million."
"In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with 
required frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as 
anti-corruption fair competition and taxation."
Aligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1.
"The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial 
contribution to EU environmental objective 4."
"The taxonomy 
eligibility was determined and reported for these new activities."
"In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU 
environmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction 
and real estate."
"The Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned 
shares of revenue, capex and opex."
The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems.
"In the year 
under review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional 
requirements."
"For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations."
"Development of the Taxonomy KPIs 
The taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year."
"The expansion of the taxonomy 
requirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility."
"The increase in 
taxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of 
taxonomy-aligned activities."
"CHANGES IN REPORTING APPROACH

The EU Taxonomy still does not take into account all economic activities that are relevant for our business.
"Revenue from operating 
warehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible."
"Capex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not 
be directly assigned."
"In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions."
"We avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group 
relationships into account on a consolidated basis."
"Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily 
allocated to the ""Construction and real estate"" and ""Transport"" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were 
classified as not taxonomy-eligible."

Determining taxonomy alignment 
All taxonomy-eligible activities were reviewed with regard to their alignment in the year under review."
"The following statements 
are in regard to the aligned assets per activity and the associated shares of revenue, capex and opex."
These values were assessed as not aligned in all other cases.
"Various technical 
screening criteria relate to requirements from applicable EU legislation."
"If no equivalent 
requirements apply in non-EU countries, no alignment can be demonstrated 
accordingly."
"Does no significant harm (DNSH) to the EU environmental objective 
of climate change adaptation (DNSH 2) 
The climate-change-related risk assessment was carried out based on the TCFD 
analysis, which we supplemented with adjustment solutions for physical climate risks."
"Ensured in the supply chain with our Supplier Code of Conduct, the 
procurement processes and supplier management, as well as the implementation of 
the requirements under the LkSG."
"At the time this report was prepared, there were no 
relevant legal proceedings ongoing in this context."
"We generate a significant portion of our revenue from transport services (transport sector) in collaboration with suppliers and 
subcontractors, who render their services on an independent basis from a legal perspective."
"As a result, these activities and the 
assets associated with them must be evaluated there with regard to alignment with the EU Taxonomy."
"At the time this report was 
prepared, we largely did not have any information on the meeting of technical criteria for these activities and assets, so we are 
reporting them as not taxonomy-aligned, in particular in the activities 6.2, 6.5, 6.6 and 6.10."
"Even suppliers and subcontractors 
who report pursuant to the EU Taxonomy were unable to confirm to us the alignment of their underlying activities."
"If shares of 
revenue and opex cannot be directly assigned to aligned activities, we apply specific allocation keys – such as the percentage of 
taxonomy-aligned vehicles in the entire fleet – that also take individual characteristics of the divisions into account."
"6.4 
Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics: 
devices not subject to permits 
Assets within this activity, e."
"bicycles, meet the requirements of the substantial contribution

"Thanks to partnerships with certified recycling companies, compliance with 
the requirements of DNSH 4 can be ensured and demonstrated."
"6.5 
Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light 
commercial vehicles: Light commercial vehicles1 
Our electric vehicles operate without emissions and therefore meet the requirements of the 
substantial contribution."
"Compliance with regard to recyclability (DNSH 4) and emissions 
thresholds (DNSH 5) is a basic requirement for approval of electric vehicles in Europe, which is 
why we considered these to be met."
"In addition, the simultaneous meeting of the criteria for 
fuel efficiency and rolling noise of tires represents a substantial requirement of DNSH 5."
"6.6 
Freight transport services by road3: Heavy-duty 
vehicles4 
Method is analogous to 6.5."
"Our electric vehicles do not transport any fossil fuels and are 
evaluated as aligned."
"6.10 Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for  
port operations and auxiliary activities 
Our service providers were unable to confirm any alignment for the subcontracted ocean 
transport."
"Compliance with the requirements of DNSH 4 could not be 
demonstrated for the construction of new buildings5 in particular outside of the EU."
"The 
analysis of the location and noise pollution of our sites showed that nearly all of them meet the 
requirements of DNSH 5 and 6."
"7.1 
Construction of new buildings: Office and 
administration buildings as well as warehouses 
Within the EU, we were unable to demonstrate alignment; outside of the EU, alignment could 
not be evaluated due to a lack of well-founded thresholds for nonresidential buildings."
"7.2 
Renovation of existing buildings: Office and 
administration buildings as well as warehouses 
Only major renovations are taxonomy-eligible."
"Generally, renovations do not make a 
substantial contribution (reduction of the primary energy need by 30%)."
"7.3 
Installation, maintenance and repair of energy 
efficiency equipment: Relates to energy-efficient 
sources of light, among other things 
There are no specific DNSH criteria for all of the measures mentioned except for insulation 
measures."
These are therefore always taxonomy-aligned.
"For insulation measures, additional 
criteria under DNSH 5 have to be fulfilled (DNSH 2 and EU minimum safeguards are reviewed 
across activities)."
"7.6 
Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable 
energy technologies: Relates to photovoltaic systems, 
among other things 
Activity is always aligned, as there are no specific DNSH criteria (DNSH 2 and EU minimum 
safeguards are reviewed across activities)."
"7.7 
Acquisition and ownership of buildings: Office and 
administration buildings as well as warehouses 
Within the EU, we were able to demonstrate alignment for some office buildings and 
warehouses (buildings) with particularly low energy consumption that were constructed 
before 2021."
"For buildings built in or after 2021, alignment could not be demonstrated."
"Outside of the EU, alignment could not be verified due to a lack of thresholds, as well as 
inapplicable EU criteria for energy certificates."
"8.1 
Data processing, hosting and related activities 
Our data centers do not meet the criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change 
mitigation and are therefore not aligned."

"Future economic prospects 
Geopolitical instability restrains global economic recovery 
The ongoing geopolitical dislocations will likely continue to dampen global demand and trade in 2024."
"The easing tensions in 
global energy markets seen in 2023 could persist in 2024, thus supporting the current declining trend for inflation."
"However, the 
associated increase in real purchasing power will provide only a partial offset to the prevailing unsettledness among investors and 
consumers."
"Overall, global annual average GDP growth should weaken modestly once again from 2.7% in 2023 to 2.3% in 2024."
"For the most important countries and regions, S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts the following GDP growth rates in 2024: 
growth in China and the United States is expected to weaken to 4.7% and 1.7%, respectively, and to remain roughly steady at a very 
subdued 0.4% in the eurozone."
"The German economy should see mild GDP growth of 0.3%, reflecting a gradual strengthening of 
growth momentum throughout the year following the recession experienced during the second half of 2023."
"Highly cyclical international express market 
Growth in the international express market, particularly in the B2B segment, is highly dependent upon the economic situation."
"For 
2024, we still expect only moderate growth, depending on economic development."
"Freight business influenced by demand and geopolitical developments 
Developments in freight logistics are also heavily dependent upon the economic situation and are difficult to predict in light of the 
uncertain market situation."
"However, in air and ocean freight, we expect a cautious revival in terms of demand due to the economic 
conditions and anticipate moderate growth for 2024."
"In addition, for the ocean freight market especially, the speed with which the 
capacity bottleneck tensions ease on the Red Sea is of importance."
"In light of rather moderate economic development, we also expect only restrained volume growth in the European road transport 
market in 2024, but we are also still faced with high prices."
"Contract logistics market continues to grow 
Growth in omnichannel e-commerce as well as geopolitical challenges will continue to increase the complexity of supply chains."
"This, together with the apparent vulnerability of traditional supply chains and the increasing complexity of global trade relations, 
will increase the demand for flexible and agile solutions, further driving outsourcing."
"Furthermore, in the current phase of the 
economic cycle, many companies are reviewing their structures and cost situations, which could result in a slightly increased 
willingness to outsource logistics."
"Therefore, the market for contract logistics is likely to continue growing, yet inflation, general 
economic conditions and labor shortages represent both an opportunity and a threat."
"Stable growth prospects for eCommerce 
It is to be expected that the share of e-commerce in total retail revenue will continue to grow."
"In line with the implementation of our 
plans for expansion, we will continue to invest in our network, efficient workflows for the last mile and infrastructure so that we 
remain reliable and affordable for our customers."
"We also see additional opportunities for growth thanks to our entry into the 
Turkish market as well."

Stable trends in the relevant post and parcel markets 
The German market for paper-based mail communication will decline further as digital communication increases."
"We will continue 
to adapt the Post & Parcel Germany product portfolio to reflect this development."
The German advertising market should rise slightly in 2024.
"However, the shift from paper-based advertising to online marketing 
will continue, so that the volumes in the physical advertising market – and thus for our Dialogue Marketing services – are expected 
to be in decline."
"According to current predictions, the rising number of goods shipments will partially compensate for significantly declining 
volumes of documents in international business."
"Intra-European and international e-commerce could once again grow 
significantly."
"We expect development in e-commerce to stabilize and the German parcel market to grow slightly again in 2024 and are therefore 
expanding our parcel network and our network of Pack- and Poststations."
"We are also expanding our range of electronic 
communications services, securing our standing as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs 
more flexible."
"Expected developments 
Result well over the pre-pandemic level, even in face of persistent economic situation 
The first half of the 2024 fiscal year will foreseeably still be shaped by the lack of any broad upward trend in the economy."
"The 
comparison with the first half of the previous year, when freight rates were still extraordinarily high in some cases, could be 
negative."
"If the economic forecasts currently available prove to be largely accurate, the result in the second half of the year should 
come in above the level of the comparable prior-year period."
"With undiminished focus on cost and price management, however, we 
still expect Group profit to be well above the level of the pre-pandemic years, even with a continuation of weak economic 
development."
"Expectations for consolidated EBIT 
In the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion."
"The DHL divisions are projected to 
generate total EBIT of more than €5.7 billion."
"In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than 
€0.8 billion."
Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings.
"Dividend proposal: €1.85 per share 
The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 
2024, a dividend of €1.85 per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85)."
"Group’s credit rating remains the same 
As of the reporting date, our credit rating was still at “A2” with a stable outlook according to Moody’s Investor Service and was 
classified as “BBB+” with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings."
"As part of our finance strategy, we still strive for a stand-alone target 
rating between “Baa1” and “A3” and “BBB+” and “A–,” respectively."
"Liquidity remains solid 
Due to the dividend payment for the 2023 fiscal year in May 2024, our liquidity is expected to decrease up to mid-year 2024."
"Due 
to the usually good business development in the second half of the year, the liquidity situation should improve again toward the 
end of the year."
"Investments of €3.0 billion to €3.6 billion 
As in the previous year, we want to manage investments in our strategic goals and further growth in a balanced way, in line with the 
challenging economic environment."
"We plan for capital expenditure (excluding leases) to range between €3.0 billion and 
€3.6 billion in 2024, while focusing on the same areas as in previous years."
"Free cash flow is projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A 
expenses."
"Limiting greenhouse gas emissions 
The development of GHG emissions in the 2024 fiscal year will also depend on the development of the global economy."
"If transport 
volumes undergo weaker development, we expect logistics-related GHG emissions to remain approximately at the prior-year level; 
if the economy proves to be more dynamic, we aim to limit GHG emissions to a maximum of 34.9 million tons of CO₂e."
"This includes 
decarbonization effects of 1.5 million tons of CO₂e."
"We continue to expect a significant reduction to not come until the second half 
of the decade."
"Continued strong employee engagement 
Employee Engagement should amount to more than 80% across the Group in the 2024 fiscal year as well; this figure is expected to 
remain steady at least this high level through 2025."
"Increase share of female executives 
In the 2024 fiscal year, 28.8% of the positions in middle and upper management should be held by women; the share of women 
should rise to at least 30% by 2025."
"Keep LTIFR stable 
The LTIFR per 200,000 working hours should be kept at a maximum of 3.3 in the 2024 fiscal year; by 2025, this figure should be 
reduced to less than 3.1."
"Beginning in the 2024 reporting period, we will adjust the performance indicator to one million working 
hours, which means the target then corresponds to 16.5 and 15.5 in the year 2025."
"Conduct compliance-relevant training 
In the reporting year, the share of valid training certificates among middle and upper management should remain at the high level 
and amount to 98%."
"External cybersecurity rating 
The cybersecurity rating from BitSight should be within the upper quartile of the comparison group and amount to at least 690 
points."
"If BitSight once again changes its rating scale, we will adjust this figure in line with the change."
"Opportunity and risk management 
Uniform reporting standard 
As an internationally operating logistics company, we are facing numerous changes."
"Our aim is to identify the resulting 
opportunities and risks at an early stage and take the necessary measures in the specific areas affected in due time, to ensure that 
we achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value."
"Our Group-wide opportunity and risk management system (RMS) facilitates 
this aim."
"Each quarter, executives estimate the impact of future scenarios, evaluate opportunities and risks in their departments 
and present planned measures as well as those already taken."
"Queries are made and approvals given on a hierarchical basis to 
ensure that different managerial levels are involved in the process."
"Opportunities and risks can also be reported at any time on an 
ad hoc basis."
"We implemented the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as the provisions 
of the EU Taxonomy also in 2023."
"This involves discussing and assessing both transitory and physical risks stemming from climate 
change using various scenarios."
"Furthermore, we use a Monte Carlo simulation for the purpose of aggregating opportunities 
and risks in standard evaluations."
"The simulation is a stochastic model that takes the probability of occurrence of the underlying risks and opportunities into 
consideration and is based upon the law of large numbers."
"Randomly selected scenarios – one for each opportunity and risk – are 
combined on the basis of the distribution functions for each individual opportunity and risk."
"The most important steps in our opportunity and risk management process are: 
OPPORTUNITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS 
1."
"Identify and assess: Managers in all divisions and regions evaluate the opportunity and risk situation on a quarterly basis and 
document the actions taken."
"They use scenarios to assess best, expected and worst cases."
"The measurement period usually 
corresponds to the planning period, but it can also be long term or latent."
"Each identified risk is assigned to at least one risk owner 
who assesses and monitors the risk, specifies possible procedures for going forward and then files a report."
"The same applies to 
opportunities."
At least one management process used to measure net risk exposure must be reported for each opportunity or risk.
"In isolated cases where it is not initially possible to make a quantitative assessment, risks may be assessed on a qualitative basis to
ensure that the full scope of all risks is captured."
The results are compiled in a database.
"We also conduct an annual risk workshop 
for each division with the Divisional Boards, as supplements to the quarterly process."
"Workshop discussion focuses on 
opportunities and risks of significance to the whole division."
"At the same time, newly identified opportunities and risks are 
subsequently integrated into the quarterly process."
"Aggregate and report: The controlling units collect the results, evaluate them and review them for plausibility."
"If individual 
financial effects overlap, this is noted in our database and taken into account in the compilation process."
"After being approved by 
the division risk owners, all results are passed on to the next level in the hierarchy."
"The last step is complete when Corporate 
Controlling reports to the Group Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on significant opportunities and risks as well as 
on the potential overall impact each division might experience."
"For this purpose, opportunities and risks are aggregated for the key 
organizational levels."
We use two methods for this.
"In the first method, we calculate a possible spectrum of results for the divisions 
The Company 
Combined Management Report 
Consolidated Financial Statements

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
and combine the respective scenarios."
"The totals for “worst case” and “best case” indicate the total spectrum of results for the 
respective division."
"Within these extremes, the total “expected cases” shows current expectations."
"The second method makes use 
of a Monte Carlo simulation, the divisional results of which are regularly included in the opportunity and risk reports to the Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board."
"Overall strategy: The Group Board of Management decides on the methodology that will be used to analyze and report on 
opportunities and risks."
"The reports created by Corporate Controlling provide the Board of Management with an additional, regular 
source of information for managing the Group as a whole."
"The Group Board of Management has defined the thresholds for risk 
tolerance and risk-bearing ability and uses the Monte Carlo simulation to review the necessity for strategic changes on a quarterly 
basis."
"The Board of Management is supported in its duties by a Risk Committee, which analyzes individual risks on a quarterly basis 
and reviews the results from risk reporting."
"The Risk Committee also regularly discusses adjustments to the opportunity and risk 
management process."
"Operating measures: The measures to be used to take advantage of opportunities and manage risks are determined within the
individual organizational units."
"They use cost–benefit analyses to assess whether risks can be avoided, mitigated or transferred to
third parties."
"Control: With respect to key opportunities and risks, early-warning indicators have been defined that are monitored constantly 
by the risk owners."
Corporate Internal Audit has the task of ensuring that the Board of Management’s specifications are adhered to.
It also reviews the quality of the entire opportunity and risk management operation.
"The control units regularly analyze all parts of 
the process as well as the reports from Corporate Internal Audit and the independent auditor, with the goal of identifying potential 
for improvement and making adjustments to processes where necessary."
"Reporting and assessing opportunities and risks 
In the following, we have reported mainly on those risks and opportunities that, from a current standpoint, could have a significant 
impact on the Group during the forecast period beyond the impact already accounted for in the business plan."
"In addition, we 
consider both long-term as well as latent opportunities and risks, with the latter unable to be assigned to a particular year or time 
horizon."
Opportunities and risks are assessed according to their probability of occurrence and their impact.
"As part of this, the 
effects for quantitative opportunities and risks are measured by EBIT, the financial result and direct effects on equity."
"The 
assessment is used to classify opportunities and risks as either low, medium or high."
"Medium and high risks and opportunities are 
considered significant and are shown as red or yellow in the following table."
"Qualitative risks can be assigned in terms of their impact to financial risk, reputational risk, operational risk and 
environmental risk."
The opportunities and risks described here are not necessarily the only ones the Group faces or is exposed to.
"Our business 
activities could also be influenced by additional factors that we are currently unaware of or that we do not yet consider to be 
material."
Opportunities and risks are identified and assessed decentrally at DHL Group.
"Reporting on possible deviations from projections, as 
well as long-term and latent opportunities and risks, occurs primarily at the country or regional level."
"In view of the degree of detail 
provided in the internal reports, we have combined the decentrally reported opportunities and risks in categories for the purposes 
of this report."
"Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the 
individual opportunities and risks within the respective categories."
"The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions, 
unless indicated otherwise."
"Opportunity and risk categories 
Overview of material opportunities and risks 
We identify opportunities and risks along the categories described in the following overview."
Both the material as well as the immaterial opportunities and risks from the overview are specified in the following.
"Unless 
otherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial."
"Opportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy 
Over the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world’s fastest-growing 
regions and markets."
"We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt 
capacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success."
"With respect to our strategic 
orientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses."
"Our earnings projections regularly 
take account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation."
We take action early to counter potential strategic risks.
"In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies 
is as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance, 
practice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary."
"In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from 
customers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1)."
"We plan to keep growing our international 
business and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term."
"Based upon this assumption, we are 
investing in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand."
"In the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and 
freight carriers rather than providing them ourselves."
"In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low 
rate that we can generate a margin."
"In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to 
our customers."
"The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of 
transport services as well as the duration of our contracts."
"Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services 
helps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk."
"In the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers’ business performance."
"Since we offer companies a 
widely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus 
counteract the incumbent risks."
"Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business, 
seamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments."
"The eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in 
various countries around the globe."
It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector.
"Our goal is to 
leverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most 
cost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery."
We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments.
"To counteract the 
fundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility."
"Whether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market 
participants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany."
"In this 
regard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants."
"In the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a 
digital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and 
merchandise mail items."
We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services.
"Due to 
the rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our 
network of Pack- and Poststations."
"We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing 
as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible."
"We follow developments in the 
market very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections."
"We currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group 
or individual divisions."
"Legal and compliance-related opportunities and risks 
Legal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements."
Examples are violations of antitrust and competition law.
"Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs, 
penalties and damage to our company’s reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the 
Group."
"Compliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring 
this is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers."
"A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative 
The Company 
Combined Management Report 
Consolidated Financial Statements

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
aims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations."
"Moreover, our compliance unit 
supports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own 
operations as well as in our external supply chain."
"At present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance."
"Opportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects 
The Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of 
vehicles and freight aircraft."
"The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in 
consideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG."
"The risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the 
projects and the availability of resources."
"This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our 
services."
"The aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted 
countermeasures can be taken at an early stage."
"The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported 
to the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board."
"Moreover, the Group Board of Management 
is informed promptly of any critical projects."
We do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.
"Operational opportunities and risks 
Logistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality 
standards."
"Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of 
shipments could seriously compromise our competitive position."
"In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as 
central transport hubs can have negative effects."
"To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be 
organized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches."
"We counteract potential operational risks, for 
example through efficient workflows and structures."
We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.
"Most recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed 
how external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially 
impair our operating performance."
"For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the 
categories titled “Human resources” and “Environment, catastrophes and epidemics.” 
A large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services."
"These include – in addition to our 
fundamental operating processes – supporting functions such as sales and purchasing."
"The extent to which we succeed in aligning 
our internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations 
from the current projections."
Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.
"Increased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air 
transport or access to city centers."
"In certain cases, this may also affect our business models."
"The resulting risk represents a risk of 
medium significance for us currently (2)."
"At this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance."
"The Company

Opportunities and risks arising from human resources 
Qualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success."
"Demographic change and a tense labor 
market situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level."
"To address this 
adequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities."
"In addition, we prevent staff 
shortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees."
"For our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities 
and foster their long-term loyalty to the company."
"In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with 
our Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action."
"Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to 
continuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training 
courses."
The health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group.
"We therefore place a high value on health and 
occupational safety measures."
"With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and 
cooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives."
"This is supplemented with health and exercise programs 
and targeted checkup offers on-site."
"In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means 
of a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff 
development."
"As a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries 
and territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us."
"We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy 
Statement."
"If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification."
The development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees.
"This factor is also being driven by the 
currently high levels of inflation."
The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024.
"The 
development of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time."
"Overall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance."
"Opportunities and risks arising from information technology 
The security of our information systems is particularly important to us."
"The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and 
prevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases."
"To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures 
based upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management."
"In addition, IT risks are monitored and 
assessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security."
"For our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available."
"We have therefore 
designed our systems to protect against complete system failure."
"Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address 
potential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality."
"We employ a patch management process – a defined procedure for 
managing software upgrades – to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades."
"In this context, 
we use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to 
achieve the highest possible level of coverage."
We limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties.
"Systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers."
"We make use of outsourced 
data centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States."
"Our 
systems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations."
"In total, 
these represent a latent risk of medium significance (3)."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) opens up a wide range of possibilities, but it also comes with increasing risks for the Group due to the 
dangers of cybercrime."
"In addition, complying with regulations in dealing with generative AI is a compliance topic in general."
"We also take continuous action to minimize risk, such as holding regular training courses for our employees and monitoring all of 
our networks and IT systems globally via our Cyber Defense Center, along with regular information security incident simulations."
We currently do not see any other specific IT-related opportunities or risks of material significance.
"Financial opportunities and risks  
As a global operator, we are exposed to financial opportunities and risks arising from fluctuating foreign exchange rates, interest 
rates and commodities prices, as well as the Group’s capital requirements."
"Changes in pension obligations also impact our 
business."
"Due to the high volatility of recent years, the influence of interest rates on our pension obligations represents both a risk 
as well as an opportunity of medium significance for us (4)."
"We attempt to reduce the volatility of our financial performance due to 
financial risk by implementing both operational and financial management measures."
"Within the Group, financial instruments are 
used exclusively for hedging purposes and thus reduce existing risks."
"Detailed information on risks in relation to the Group’s 
defined benefit retirement plans can be found in note 37 to the consolidated financial statements."
"With respect to currencies, opportunities and risks result from scheduled foreign-currency transactions as well as those budgeted 
for the future."
"Any significant currency risks arising from budgeted transactions are quantified as a net position over a rolling 24-
month period."
Highly correlated currencies are consolidated in blocks.
"At the Group level, the most important net surpluses are 
budgeted for the US dollar block as well as for the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar."
"The Czech koruna is 
the only currency with a considerable net deficit."
"As of the reporting date, there were no significant currency hedges for scheduled 
foreign-currency transactions."
Any general depreciation of the euro presents an opportunity as regards the Group’s earnings position.
"The main risk to the Group’s 
earnings position would be a general appreciation of the euro."
"We currently assess the aggregate effect of all foreign currency gains and losses both as an opportunity and a risk of medium 
significance for the Group (5)."
"As a logistics group, our biggest commodity price risks result from changes in fuel prices (kerosene, diesel and marine fuels)."
"In the 
DHL divisions, most of these risks are passed on to customers via operating measures (fuel surcharges)."
The key control parameters for liquidity management are the centrally available liquidity reserves.
"The Group’s liquidity is secured 
over the short and medium terms."
"Moreover, the Group enjoys open access to the capital markets on account of its solid 
investment-grade rating and is well positioned to ensure that long-term capital requirements are fulfilled."
"We therefore see no 
significant risk to the Group at present in the area of liquidity."
"Risks may also arise from our accounting, controlling, budgetary and financial processes."
"We monitor those processes continuously 
to prevent such risks from materializing."
We do not currently see any other significant financial opportunities or risks.
"Tax-related opportunities and risks 
Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a variety of tax regimes."
"Opportunities and risks arise from the 
introduction of new types of taxes, legislative changes and judicial rulings."
"As such, opportunities and risks could arise from the 
different interpretation of complex tax regulations, for instance."
"We mitigate this risk through continual dialog with taxation authorities and tax advisers to obtain the greatest possible degree of 
legal certainty."
"This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in which we operate to the best of our 
knowledge and belief."
"Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to 
monitor and avoid tax risk as far as possible."
"Currently, we have not identified any significant tax­related opportunities or risks."
"Opportunities and risks related to real estate transactions 
DHL Group is one of the world’s largest corporate users of industrial properties."
"A large portion of the Group’s industrial real estate 
portfolio consists of leased properties."
"Ownership solutions have additionally been implemented for a number of especially 
strategic properties."
"Our business may be impacted by opportunities and risks arising from the lease, purchase, sale, construction 
or use of real estate."
"A global team of real estate professionals manages the Group portfolio and ensures that any opportunities or 
risks are identified at an early stage and a suitable response is selected."
"We negotiate suitable solutions early with our lessors, analyze real estate markets and identify suitable properties for expanding or 
optimizing the current portfolio based on our divisions’ business strategies and operational location planning."
"The main objective is 
to secure the availability of properties needed for our core business."
We do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of real estate.
"Market- and customer-specific opportunities and risks 
Macroeconomic and sector-specific conditions are a key factor in determining the success of our business."
"In addition to the 
development of the global economy, growth in the logistics market and its interaction with our stakeholders – our customers, 
suppliers and competitors – is of particular importance in this regard."
Changes in demand present both opportunities and risks.
"As a provider of choice, our business is based on our customers’ needs."
"Our customers are likewise exposed to macroeconomic 
trends that impact growth in their respective sectors."
"We monitor market developments on an ongoing basis and review the 
potential financial effects of relationships with business partners and suppliers at regular intervals, to enable us to avert any risk 
that could arise from potential insolvencies, for example, at an early stage."
"Our Customer Solutions & Innovation unit uses a risk 
dashboard for this purpose."
"Due to the current economic situation, potential customer bankruptcies represent a risk of medium 
significance (6)."
"In addition, the easing of the market capacities for 
transport services that were heavily used in previous years is leading to a normalization of freight rates."
"We expect moderate 
business performance in 2024."
"In spite of the continued expectation of weaker global economic growth, we will see opportunities 
for growth, for instance through structural growth in e-commerce."
"The general trend of businesses outsourcing processes 
continues as well."
"In addition, our DHL divisions are benefitting from rising demand for complex and integrated logistics solutions 
thanks to our position as the global market leader."
"Our strong position in all the regions in which we operate allows us to compensate, at least partially, for declines in certain trade 
lanes, often based on growth in others."
"Cyclical risks can affect our divisions differently depending on their magnitude and point in 
time, which could mitigate the total effect."
"Moreover, we have taken measures in recent years to make costs more flexible and to 
allow us to respond quickly to changes in market demand."
"However, an additional weakening of global economic growth 
represents a risk of medium significance (7)."
"Deutsche Post and DHL are in competition with already-established companies, as well as new entrants to the market."
"Such 
competition can significantly impact our customer base as well as the levels of prices and margins in our markets."
"In the logistics 
and letter mail business, the key factors for success are quality, confidence and competitive prices."
"Thanks to the high quality we 
offer, along with the cost savings we have generated in recent years, we believe that we will be able to remain competitive and 
keep any negative effects at a low level."
"As a logistics concern, we are additionally exposed to the effects of fluctuations in market prices on Group profit."
"Despite the recent 
decline in inflation, this still represents a risk of medium significance (8)."
The availability of renewable energy is of central importance for us to achieve our sustainability goals.
"In line with our ESG 
Roadmap, we aim to have more than 30% of the total fuel we use for air freight come from sustainable sources (sustainable 
aviation fuel – SAF) by 2030."
"The current availability and planned projects do not yet appear to be sufficient to meet the demand for 
sustainable aviation fuels."
"The possibility that the market supply of renewable energy and SAF may not be sufficient therefore 
represents a risk of medium significance (9)."
"In addition, no significant opportunities or risks are seen at present in this risk category."
"Opportunities and risks arising from political, regulatory or legal conditions 
Our business is fundamentally intertwined with the political and legal environments in which we operate."
"The stability and security 
of international transport routes represent the first line in this framework, and they could be critically disrupted by events ranging 
from geopolitical developments to military conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East."
"A number of the 
indirect effects of these geopolitical crises, such as the development of the global economy and inflation, have been taken into 
account for the corresponding risks."
"The remaining direct effects in the countries and regions affected currently represent a risk of 
low significance."
"In addition, the international transport of goods is subject to the import, export and transit regulations of more than 220 countries 
and territories as well as their applicable foreign trade laws."
"In recent years, not only the number but also the complexity of such 
laws and regulations has increased significantly (including their extraterritorial application)."
"Violations are also being pursued more 
aggressively by the competent authorities, with stricter penalties imposed."
"We have implemented, on the one hand, ongoing 
monitoring of the regulatory and legislative developments in the markets most relevant for us and, on the other, a Group-wide 
compliance program in response to this development."
"This comprises the legally prescribed checking of all senders, recipients, 
suppliers and employees against current embargo lists."
"In addition, this includes in particular the legally required review of 
shipments for the purpose of enforcing applicable export restrictions as well as country sanctions and embargoes."
"DHL Group also 
cooperates with the responsible authorities, both in working to prevent violations as well as in assisting in the investigation of any 
infringements in order to avoid or limit potential sanctions."
"The Company

A number of risks arise primarily from the fact that the Group provides some of its services in regulated markets."
"The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of 
downstream access, has special supervisory powers – in addition to the Federal Cartel Office – to combat market abuse and 
guarantees the provision of universal postal services."
"This general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in 
the event of negative decisions."
The German federal government had agreed in the coalition agreement that the Postal Act (Postgesetz) would again be amended.
The described aim was to further enhance social and environmental standards and strengthen fair competition.
"The German 
federal cabinet passed a draft law to modernize the Postal Act on December 20, 2023."
"The draft will now go through the ordinary 
legislative process in the Bundestag and Bundesrat."
The amended Postal Act is expected to enter into effect in the course of 2024.
"Depending upon the structure of this new regulatory framework and its application by the German federal network agency, along 
with its interpretation by the responsible courts, opportunities and risks may arise for the company’s regulated areas."
"Revenue and earnings risk can arise, in particular, from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail."
"Approval of the rates for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued by the German federal network 
agency on April 29, 2022."
"The German federal network agency would have to issue the approval of the rates applicable from 2025 
onward in 2024 on the basis of the version of the German Postal Act applicable at the time."
"An association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the price cap 
approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 2024."
The proceedings are still pending.
"The same CEP 
association, as well as postal service providers and other customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative 
Court against the pricing approvals granted as part of the price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021."
"This formal legal error was rectified by 
the German government through an amendment to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021."
"The Cologne 
Administrative Court denied the claims of two customers because they had expired."
"The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet 
reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against the price cap approvals."
"The association’s additional application to be 
granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was denied by the Cologne Administrative Court."
"The association has filed an 
appeal to this ruling with the Federal Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their 
claims with the Cologne Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending."
"The rulings of the Cologne Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the 
respective plaintiffs and have no legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers."
"One postal service provider, which had filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne 
Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters 
delivered in 2017."
"The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful 
pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020."
"The action was denied by the Cologne 
District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021."
"The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this 
ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling."
"On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal 
against nonpermission with Germany’s Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed."
"Especially the regulations from the Postal Act, which are currently undergoing revision, are of particular importance for us."
"Due to the low probability of occurrence, we currently assess this risk as medium (10) 
overall."
"One opportunity largely taken into account in our guidance results from the tax handling of so-called partial service shipments in 
accordance with European legislation."
"If the first-instance ruling of the Cologne Finance Court on the VAT liability of partial services 
is confirmed by the German Federal Fiscal Court, this transport service will have to be offered without VAT."
"The aforementioned 
draft of a new Postal Act is also congruent with the European legal situation and clarifies that partial service shipments are a part of 
the universal postal service and thus have to be offered without VAT in the future."
We also describe significant legal proceedings in note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.
The fight against climate change can result in increased regulatory and legal changes in the coming years.
"An increase in, or 
stepped up introduction of, carbon taxes and levies, certification regulations and other direct costs in conjunction with CO₂ 
emissions (11) represents a risk of medium importance for us, as do increased restrictions on GHG emissions (12)."
"We have not identified any other significant opportunities or risks associated with the political, regulatory or statutory environment."
"Opportunities and risks arising from the environment, catastrophes and epidemics 
Our business operations can be impacted by natural disasters, epidemics and ecological factors, also including physical risks 
caused by climate change such as floods and storms."
The year 2023 was no longer significantly impacted by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Nevertheless, our focus at all 
times was, and remains, on safeguarding the health of our employees."
"We continue to regularly review the consequences of 
potential more virulent variants and their possible impact on our business activities, so that we are able to counter the respective 
current situation with corresponding measures."
"Overall, we do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of material significance in this area."
"A Group-wide guideline sets out the main principles and objectives of the ICS and specifies the structure of the ICS and the 
underlying role concept for the self-assessment."
The scope of the control objectives to be covered by the ICS is derived from a detailed risk analysis.
"Based on the risks identified 
and control objectives, minimum requirements are defined that must be covered through the implementation of suitable controls 
in the control frameworks of the divisions."
Our ICS generally comprises all companies.
"The scope of the activities to be carried out by each entity differs and depends on, 
among other things, the materiality of the entity for the consolidated financial statements and the specific risks that are associated 
with the entity."
"All companies are analyzed on the basis of quantitative and qualitative aspects and categorized into companies 
material to the ICS in consideration of relevant financial figures and functional KPIs."
"Internal control system in the functions 
 
 Disclosures unrelated to the management report (unaudited), preliminary remarks."
"The ICS of DHL Group takes the Finance, Human Resources (HR), Compliance, IT and Operations into account as part of the 
functional design of the Group-wide risk landscape."
"The Group-wide risk landscape is supplemented for the respective function as part of an extended risk analysis and regularly 
reviewed, also including the consideration of sustainability-related targets within the ESG Roadmap."
"Risks and controls in this 
regard are identified and assigned to the respective functions and covered by the control frameworks of the divisions."
"Self-
assessments are carried out in all functions, documented and prepared in a central reporting tool."
"The goal of taking all functions of the Group into account is to ensure compliance with applicable standards and internal Group 
regulations as well as divisional and local provisions in all business transactions and the core processes."
The compliance management system (CMS) is a major component of the monitoring system of DHL Group.
"The CMS was 
established with the goal of creating rules, standards and processes for conduct compliant with laws and guidelines as well as 
measurable self-commitments."
"Therefore, it serves to protect DHL Group from financial risks and damage to its reputation, to 
minimize personal liability risks of governing bodies, managers and other employees, and to avoid competitive disadvantages."
The CMS is organized according to divisions.
"The Compliance Committee acts as a joint decision-making body chaired by the Chief 
Compliance Officer."
"The Compliance Committee facilitates the exchange of information on developments in compliance 
management in the individual divisions, coordinates fundamental strategic questions related to the CMS and ensures consistent 
implementation in the divisions."
"Compliance management at DHL Group is based on a values-oriented Code of Conduct that sets out a uniform Group-wide 
commitment to ethical, responsible and legally compliant conduct in business."
"Our managers act as role models and should set a 
good example to promote compliance."
"DHL Group uses targeted communication and regular training sessions to help its 
employees and business partners understand and adhere to the compliance guidelines and regulations."
"The Company

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
At DHL Group, compliance risks are identified and assessed on a regular basis and systematically across all divisions."
"The identified 
risks are assessed and analyzed according to qualitative criteria and, if necessary, supplemented by further risk minimization 
measures."
"Our compliance program comprises the preventive elements of guidelines, training sessions and business partner reviews."
"In 
addition, detective elements such as violation reporting and case processing management contribute to ensuring the business 
integrity of DHL Group."
"Accounting-related internal control system 
The accounting-related ICS is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting process of the companies included in the 
Group."
"The accounting-related ICS aims to ensure the compliance of (Group) accounting and financial reporting with generally 
accepted principles."
"Specifically, it is intended to ensure that all transactions are recorded promptly, accurately and in a uniform 
manner on the basis of the applicable norms, accounting standards and internal Group regulations."
"Accounting errors are to be 
avoided in principle, and material misrepresentations and errors detected promptly."
"Within the framework of the ICS, we take organizational and process-related measures that involve all companies in the Group."
"Centrally standardized accounting guidelines govern the reconciliation of the single-entity financial statements and support 
uniform accounting pursuant to EU IFRSs throughout the Group."
"In addition, German generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP) have been established for Deutsche Post AG and the other Group companies subject to HGB reporting requirements."
"A 
standard chart of accounts is required to be applied by all Group companies."
"We immediately assess new developments in 
international accounting for relevance and announce their implementation in a timely manner, for example in newsletters."
"Often, 
accounting processes are pooled in a shared service center in order to centralize and standardize them."
"The IFRS financial 
statements of the individual Group companies are recorded in a standard, SAP-based system and then processed at a central 
location where one-step consolidation is performed."
"Other quality assurance components include automatic plausibility reviews 
and system validations of the accounting data."
"In addition, regular, manual checks are carried out centrally at the Corporate Center 
by Corporate Accounting & Controlling, Taxes and Corporate Finance."
"If necessary, we call in outside professionals with the 
requisite expertise."
"Finally, the Group’s standardized process of preparing financial statements by using a centrally administered 
financial statements calendar supports a structured and efficient accounting process."
"The companies have implemented preventive and detective control mechanisms to address risks of material misrepresentation in 
reporting and covered division-specific as well as local requirements."
"To maintain the system’s effectiveness and implement 
continuous improvements, the ICS is subjected to regular reviews."
"To this end, self-assessments are carried out using the dual-
control principle and documented in a central IT application."
"If a self-assessment results in the finding of inadequate control 
implementation, an action plan must be created, and the successful execution thereof must be confirmed by the person responsible 
for the process."
The results of the self-assessments are documented in a central reporting tool.
"The Supervisory Board, Board of Management and 
the functional bodies are regularly informed of the findings."
"In addition, this information is analyzed with regard to potential 
improvements."
"Regular monitoring by Corporate Internal Audit 
Over and above the ICS and risk management, Corporate Internal Audit is an essential component of the Group’s control and 
monitoring system."
"Using risk-based auditing procedures, Corporate Internal Audit regularly examines the processes related to 
financial reporting and reports its results to the Board of Management."

"It should, however, always be taken into consideration that no ICS, regardless of how well designed, can offer absolute certainty 
that all material accounting misstatements will be avoided or detected."
"Overall assessment of the Board of Management 
In the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion."
"The DHL divisions are projected to 
generate total EBIT of more than €5.7."
"In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than €0.8 billion."
Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings.
"In view of the expected EBIT development in 
combination with a predicted increase in the asset charge, we expect the EAC to be down slightly year over year."
"Free cash flow is 
projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A expenses."
"The current business planning has not identified any significant changes in the Group’s overall opportunity and risk situation 
compared with last year’s risk report."
"No new risks with a potentially critical impact upon the Group’s result have been identified 
according to current assessments."
"Based upon the Group’s early-warning system and in the estimation of its Board of 
Management, there were no identifiable risks for the Group in the current forecast period that, individually or collectively, cast 
doubt upon the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
Nor are any such risks apparent in the foreseeable future.
"The stable 
to positive outlook projected for the Group is moreover reflected in our credit rating."

of Conformity for the past five years on the company’s website."
"Corporate governance principles and shared values 
Our business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws, 
international guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group’s strategy."
"Equally, we require our suppliers to 
act in this way."
"We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders, 
whose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that 
we apply good corporate governance criteria."
"With the Code of Conduct, we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees."
"It is applicable across all divisions and 
regions."
"In addition, we take the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises into account."
"In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of 
sustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of 
greenhouse gases."
"As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"In 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany."
The Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion.
"This understanding and mutual respect promote 
cooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success."
"The criteria for the recruitment and professional 
development of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications."
"The members of the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group’s goal of increasing the number of women 
in management."
"Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the 
benefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard."

bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation."
This is also the foundation of DHL Group’s lasting business success.

anticompetitive conduct in particular."
"Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually 
improve and upgrade the CMS system."
"In addition, 
further measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established."
"Cooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages 
As a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board."
Members of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company.
"They manage their Board 
departments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group 
require a resolution by all members of the Board of Management."
"Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to 
subordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board 
of Management about significant developments in their departments."
"The Board of Management ensures compliance with 
statutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance)."
"The internal control system and the risk 
management system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to 
sustainability."
"The CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company’s collective goals and 
plans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out."
"When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act 
in their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit."
"Any conflicts of interest must be 
disclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management 
members must also be informed."
"The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should 
generally end by the time the member turns 65."
"The members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management."
"They propose the remuneration 
system for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and – together with the Board of Management – are 
jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management."
"Furthermore, the statutory obligations of 
the Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the 
proposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting."
"For proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no 
later than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72."
"As a general rule, 
Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office."
"The company’s D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as 
set out in the AktG."
"The principles governing the Supervisory Board’s internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring 
approval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the 
company’s website."
"The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the 
Supervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly."
"The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the 
Supervisory Board."
The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members.
"Members of 
the Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of €100,000."
"The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and 
committees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%."
"This does not 
apply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees."
"The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board 
members can be accessed along with the auditor’s report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the company’s website."

"Individual

members joined via videoconference."
"In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in 
writing in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible 
members."
The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the report of the Supervisory Board.
"Supervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee 
representatives, and by the relevant committees."
"During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members 
about the work and decisions of the committees."
"Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive 
training and professional development measures."
They receive appropriate support from the company in the process.
"In 2023, the 
Directors’ Days took place in May and September."
"The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key 
performance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply 
chain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy."
"Succession planning for the Board of Management 
Together with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the 
Board of Management."
"To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss 
candidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management."
"Within the Supervisory Board, the search for 
suitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee."
"Independent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a 
presentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board."
"In this way, the Supervisory Board 
maintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management."
"When appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and 
experiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse."
"International 
experience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience."
"The initial term of service for members of the Board of 
Management generally runs for three years."
"Independence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board 
All Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"This exceeds the 
target for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members."
"As of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche 
Post AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the 
KfW."
"Accordingly, Luise Hölscher and Stefan B."
Wintels are also independent.
"On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its 
shareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%."
"His 
independence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board will recommend two 
new independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who 
is also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee."
"More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the 
report of the Supervisory Board."
"Lawrence Rosen’s responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair 
his independence."
"At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support 
the Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in 
particular."
"Effectiveness of the Supervisory Board’s advisory and monitoring duties 
Each year, the members of the Supervisory Board review the work and decision-making processes of the Board."
"Discussions take 
place during a Supervisory Board meeting without the presence of the Board of Management."
"At regular intervals, most recently in 
the year under review, the opinions are also evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire, the results of which are incorporated into the 
Board’s discussions."
"Among other topics, discussions focused on the skills profile of the Supervisory Board as well as the progress 
of the onboarding process for new Supervisory Board members."
"As a result, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that it 
performed its monitoring and advisory duties effectively and efficiently."
"Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board (skills profile) 
In addition to legal requirements (notably Sections 100 and 107 AktG), the composition of the Supervisory Board is guided by 
recommendations C.1 and C.6 of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK)."
"Overall, the Supervisory Board set the following 
targets for its composition that also reflect the skills profile it aspires to have: 
1."
"When proposing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election as Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board is 
to be guided purely by the best interests of the company."
The company’s international activities are already adequately reflected in the current composition of the Supervisory Board.
"For 
its future proposals to the Annual General Meeting as well, the Supervisory Board strives to find candidates whose origins, 
education or professional experience equip them with particular international knowledge and experience."
"The Supervisory Board should collectively serve as a competent adviser to the Board of Management on future issues, in 
particular digital transformation and sustainability issues."
The Supervisory Board should collectively have sufficient expertise in the areas of accounting and financial statement audits.
This includes knowledge of international developments in the field of accounting.
"Additionally, the Supervisory Board believes that 
the independence of its members helps guarantee the integrity of the accounting process and ensure the independence of the 
auditors."
"Conflicts of interest affecting Supervisory Board members are an obstacle to providing independent advice to, and supervision 
of, the Board of Management."
"The Supervisory Board will decide how to deal with potential or actual conflicts of interest on a case-
by-case basis, in accordance with the law and giving due consideration to the German Corporate Governance Code."
"As a general rule, 
Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office."
The current Supervisory Board meets these targets and fulfills this skills profile.
"The Supervisory Board took targets and the skills 
profile into account in the election proposals it made to this year’s Annual General Meeting."

information on their professional occupation, their membership on the Supervisory Board and their current term of office."
"Diversity 
Diversity is one of the decisive factors in the business success of the Group – and the Board of Management is no exception."
"As part 
of the selection of members for the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to diversity and to ensuring 
that the members complement each other in terms of their personalities, qualifications, skills, origin and experience."
"Long-term 
succession planning in all divisions guarantees that there will be sufficient qualified internal candidates in the future as well."
"The 
early selection of women for executive positions also plays a key role."
"The members of the Board of Management come with 
different areas of professional expertise in the fields of engineering management, physics, business management, law and 
psychology."
"As of December 31, 2023, the average age of members of the Board of 
Management was 53, with the youngest member being 47 and the oldest 60."
"With regard to long-term succession planning, the focus remains on the share of women in management positions."
"The target set by the Supervisory 
Board of a 25% share of women on the Board of Management by the end of 2024, which exceeds the statutory participation 
requirement, has also already been reached."
"We aim to meet these targets by December 31, 2024."
"The two 
executive tiers are defined on the basis of their reporting lines: tier 1 comprises executives assigned to the N-1 reporting line; here, 
the share of women was 30.2% as of December 31, 2023."
"Tier 2 comprises executives assigned to the N-2 reporting line; here, the 
share of women was 33.3% as of December 31, 2023."
"By 2025, women should occupy at least 30% of middle- and upper-
management positions in the Group."
"This figure has risen continually in recent years and stood at 27.2% as of December 31, 2023."
"The diversity criteria that are particularly important to the Supervisory Board when considering its own composition are also 
outlined in the list of its goals (skills profile)."
"With a proportion of women of 40%, the Supervisory Board has exceeded its own 
target of 30%, which also reflects the minimum statutory requirement."
"Shareholders and Annual General Meeting 
Shareholders exercise their rights, and in particular their right to receive information and to vote, at the Annual General Meeting."
Each share in the company entitles the holder to one vote.
The company did not issue preference shares without voting rights.
"The 
agenda with the proposed resolutions for the Annual General Meeting and additional information will be made available on the 
company website directly after the Annual General Meeting is convened."
"A CV, which provides information about their relevant 
knowledge, skills and functional experience and contains an overview of their essential duties in addition to the Supervisory Board, 
is published for each Supervisory Board candidate put forth for election."

skills and qualifications of the Supervisory Board members."
"The speech by the CEO is generally available on the company’s website at least four days in advance of the respective Annual 
General Meeting."
"We assist our shareholders in exercising their voting rights not only by making it possible to submit postal votes but also by 
appointing company proxies, who cast their votes at the Annual General Meeting as instructed by the shareholders."
"Additionally, 
shareholders can authorize company proxies and submit postal votes via the shareholder portal offered by the company."
"The 
voting instructions to the proxies and the postal ballots can be changed up to the point when voting begins at the Annual General 
Meeting."
"Shareholders entered into the shareholder register and their proxies will be able to watch and listen to the Annual General 
Meeting during an online live stream."
"After three Annual General Meetings held virtually due to the pandemic, the Board of Management was able to invite the 
shareholders to once again attend in person last year."
"The 2023 Annual General Meeting also authorized the Board of Management 
to hold Annual General Meetings virtually if necessary for a period of two years."
"For the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the Board of 
Management decided not to make use of this option and to carry out the meeting once again as an in-person event."
"This is in line 
with the wishes of many shareholders and shareholder representatives to have the opportunity to talk personally with the 
members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as with each other."

approval in the event of significant changes, or at least every four years; the four-year interval also applies to the remuneration of 
the Supervisory Board members."
"The 2021 Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Management remuneration system 
with 93.39% and the Supervisory Board remuneration with 99.46% of the votes cast in favor."
"The resolution proposed to the Annual 
General Meeting on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for 2022 was passed with an approval rate of 
99.07%."

of Supervisory Board members can also be accessed on the company’s website."

individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in the remuneration reports available 
there."
"As scheduled, the remuneration system for the Board of Management will be presented to the 2025 Annual General Meeting 
for approval."
"Each share carries the same rights and obligations stipulated by law and/or in the company’s Articles of 
Association and entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)."
"The company did not issue preference shares 
without voting rights or shares with special rights conveying powers of control."
"The exercise of voting rights and the transfer of shares are based upon statutory provisions and the company’s Articles of 
Association, which place no restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or transfer of shares."

based remuneration program, stocks are subject to time-related trading restrictions during the two-year holding period."

including via the KfW – holds a 16.84% stake in the share capital of Deutsche Post AG as of February 7, 2024."

The members of the Board of Management are appointed and replaced in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions (cf."
Sections 84 and 85 AktG and Section 31 MitbestG).

In accordance with Section 119 (1), Number 6, and Section 179 (1), Sentence 1, AktG, amendments to the Articles of Association 
are adopted by resolution of the AGM."
"In accordance with Article 21 (2) of the Articles of Association in conjunction with Sections 
179 (2) and 133 (1) AktG, such amendments generally require a simple majority of the votes cast and a simple majority of the 
share capital represented on the date of the resolution."
"In such instances where the law requires a greater majority for 
amendments to the Articles of Association, that majority is decisive."
"Board of Management authorization, particularly regarding the issue and buyback of shares 
The Board of Management is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue up to 130,000,000 new no-par-
value registered shares (2021 Authorized Capital)."

up to 54,619,296 additional PSUs may still be issued."

exclusively for DHL Group."

access to its freight aircraft capacity."
"Aerologic mainly serves the DHL Express network from Monday to Friday and flies for the 
Lufthansa Cargo network on weekends."

"In contrast 
to its capital and voting rights, the company’s assets and liabilities, as well as its income and expenses, are allocated based on this 
user relationship."

Adjustment of prior-year figures 
The following adjustments of prior-year figures were made in the 2023 fiscal year."
"With the final purchase price allocation (PPA) 
for Monta Group, adjustments were made to the balance sheet items specified below, which were accounted for in the opening 
balance and led to a corresponding adjusted presentation in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022."
"Moreover, for improved presentation in the balance sheet, accounts of a financial nature were reclassified from other assets and 
other liabilities to financial assets and financial liabilities, respectively (IFRS 7)."
"This enables the amounts presented in the table 
titled “Reconciliation to carrying amounts in accordance with IFRS 9” to be allocated to the carrying amounts, note 43."
"The 
amendment of IAS 1 explains and requires that a disclosure of “material” rather than “significant” accounting policies 
must be made."
"To support this approach, the amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 demonstrate the application 
of the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures."
"The consolidated financial statements were not 
affected."
"Amendments to IAS 8, Definition of 
Accounting Estimates 
The amendments introduced a new definition of accounting estimates and explain how entities should distinguish 
changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies."
"The consolidated financial statements were not 
affected."
"Going forward, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized for such transactions to the extent that equal 
amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise."
"The consolidated financial statements were not 
affected."
"Amendments to IAS 12, International 
Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules 
The amendments to IAS 12 are carried out in conjunction with the regulations for a global minimum tax."
"DHL Group 
falls under the scope of application of the OECD model provisions for pillar two."
"The legal provisions for pillar two had 
only been implemented in some jurisdictions, so the regulations for the global minimum tax were not yet applicable 
throughout the Group in the year under review."
"Beginning with the 2024 fiscal year, the Group expects an increase in 
current taxes by an amount in the low double-digit millions of euros."
"IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts,  
including amendments to IFRS 17 
The standard replaces IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and outlines the principles governing the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts."
"The objective of the standard is to ensure that the 
reporting entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents the effect that insurance contracts have on an 
entity’s net assets, financial position, results of operations and cash flows."
"IFRS 17 was not applied for reasons of 
materiality."
"The 
amendment was issued because the initial application of IFRS 9 is not required to be retroactive, whereas this is the 
case for IFRS 17."
This can result in accounting mismatches for financial instruments.
"However, they will only 
be required to be applied in future periods."
"The lease liability is to be measured so that no profit or loss on the right-of-use 
asset retained results from subsequent measurement."
"Application is not expected to have a material effect on the 
consolidated financial statements."
"Amendments to IAS 1, Classification  
of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent 
(issued on January 23, 2020, and 
applicable for fiscal years beginning  
on or after January 1, 2024) and 
Deferral of the Effective Date."
"The amendments to IAS 1 relate solely to the presentation of debt and other liabilities in the statement of financial 
position."
"They clarify that a liability must be classified as noncurrent if the entity has a substantial right as of the 
reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date."
"The determining 
factor is that such a substantial right exists; no intention to exercise that right is required."
"No material effects on the 
consolidated financial statements are expected."
"The effective date was deferred to January 1, 2024, due to the  
COVID-19 pandemic."
"Further information on liabilities classified as noncurrent with covenants is required for risk 
assessment."
No material effects on the consolidated financial statements are expected.
"New accounting standards not yet adopted by the EU (endorsement procedure) 
The IASB and the IFRIC issued further standards, amendments to standards and interpretations in the 2023 fiscal year and in 
previous years whose application is not yet mandatory for the 2023 fiscal year."
"The application of these IFRS is dependent on their 
adoption by the EU."
The effects on the consolidated financial statements are being assessed.
The effects on the consolidated financial statements are being assessed.
"The functional currency of foreign companies is determined by the primary economic 
environment in which they mainly generate and use cash."
"Within the Group, the functional currency is predominantly the local 
currency."
"In the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities are therefore translated at the closing rates, while periodic 
income and expenses are generally translated at an average price that results from the monthly prices."
"The resulting currency 
translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, currency translation differences 
amounting to €–586 million (previous year: €153 million) were recognized in other comprehensive income, see the statement of 
comprehensive income."
"Goodwill arising from business combinations after January 1, 2005, is treated as an asset of the acquired company and therefore 
carried in the functional currency of the acquired company."
"Goodwill that arose for foreign subsidiaries as part of acquisition 
accounting prior to 2005 is carried in euros at historical cost less the accumulated amortization through to the end of 2004."
"Turkey has met the criteria regarding a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over a period of three years since the 
beginning of 2022."
Accounting pursuant to IAS 29 was applied for the relevant companies.
"Upon application, the adjustments to 
the carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets and liabilities based on the general price index were recognized in the financial result, 
note 18."
The consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute was used for the adjustment of the purchasing power effects.
"As of January 1, 2023, this figure was 1,128 basis points and had increased to 1,859 basis points as of December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with IAS 21, the monetary values such as receivables and liabilities in the financial statements of consolidated 
companies that have been prepared in local currencies are translated at the closing rate as of the reporting date."
"Currency 
translation differences are recognized in other operating income and expenses in the income statement."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, 
income of €452 million (previous year: €696 million) and expenses of €433 million (previous year: €673 million) resulted from 
currency translation differences."
"In contrast, currency translation differences relating to net investments in a foreign operation are 
recognized in other comprehensive income."
"The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for items that are 
required to be recognized at their fair value."
"Revenue and expense recognition  
DHL Group’s normal business operations consist of the provision of logistics services comprising express delivery, freight 
transport, supply chain management, e-commerce solutions and letter and parcel dispatch in Germany."
"All income relating to 
normal business operations is recognized as revenue in the income statement."
"All other income is reported as other operating 
income."
"Revenue is recognized when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer, i.e., when the customer has the ability to 
control the use of the transferred goods or services provided and generally derive their remaining benefits."
"There must be a 
contract with enforceable rights and obligations and, among other things, the receipt of consideration must be likely, taking into 
account the customer’s credit quality."
Revenue corresponds to the transaction price to which the Group is expected to be entitled.
"Variable consideration is included in the transaction price when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of 
revenue recognized will not occur."
"Generally, the Group does not have contracts where the period between the transfer of the 
promised goods and/or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year."
"Accordingly, the promised 
consideration is not adjusted for the time value of money."
"For each performance obligation, revenue is either recognized at a point 
in time or over time."
"Performance progress is generally determined on the basis of the ratio of completed to still-outstanding 
transport duration."
"The revenue generated by providing other logistics services is recognized in the reporting period in which the service was 
rendered."
"Whenever third parties are involved in the performance of a service, a distinction must be drawn between the principal and agent."
"If 
DHL Group serves as the principal, then the gross amount of revenue is recognized."
"If the Group acts as the agent, the net amount is 
recognized."
The transaction price for this specific service is limited to the amount of the commission to be received.
"DHL Group is 
generally the principal when transport services are provided."
Operating expenses are recognized in profit or loss when the service is utilized or when the expenses are incurred.
"Intangible assets 
Intangible assets, which comprise internally generated and purchased intangible assets and purchased goodwill, are measured at 
amortized cost."
"Internally generated intangible assets are recognized at cost if it is probable that their production will generate an inflow of future 
economic benefits and the costs can be reliably measured."
"In the Group, this concerns internally developed software."
"If the criteria 
for capitalization are not met, the expenses are recognized immediately in income in the year in which they are incurred."
"In addition 
to direct costs, the production cost of internally developed software includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead 
costs."
Any borrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets are included in the production cost.
"Value-added tax arising in conjunction 
with the acquisition or production of intangible assets is included in the cost to the extent that it cannot be deducted as input tax."
Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives.
"Impairment losses are 
recognized in accordance with the principles described in the impairment section."
"The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors 
 
such as time and location."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever there are 
indications of impairment."
This includes goodwill almost exclusively.
"Impairment testing is carried out in accordance with the 
principles described in the impairment section."
"Emissions certificates 
CO2 emissions certificates and certificates and/or proof of generation for electricity from renewable energies are recognized as 
intangible assets and reported under other assets."
"Both purchased as well as freely allocated rights are recognized at cost; no 
depreciation is carried out."
"A provision for the obligation to submit CO2 emissions certificates to the responsible authorities in the EU and the United Kingdom 
is recognized at the carrying amount of the CO2 emissions certificates capitalized for this purpose."
"If a portion of the obligation is 
not covered by existing certificates, the provision for this is recognized at the market price of the emissions certificates on the 
reporting date."
"Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation and impairment losses."
"In addition to direct 
costs, production cost includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead costs."
"Borrowing costs that can be allocated 
directly to the purchase, construction or manufacture of property, plant and equipment are capitalized."
"Value-added tax arising in 
conjunction with the acquisition or production of items of property, plant or equipment is included in the cost to the extent that it 
cannot be deducted as input tax."
Depreciation is charged using the straight-line method.
"Significant portions of property, plant and 
equipment that have different useful lives are recognized and depreciated separately."
"If costs are incurred in conjunction with 
regular comprehensive maintenance work (e.g., refurbishment of aircraft and major repairs of engines), these costs are recognized 
as a separate component, provided that they meet the criteria for this recognition."
"The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors 
 
such as time and location."
"If there are indications of impairment, an impairment test must be carried out; see the impairment section."
"If there are any such indications, an impairment test is carried out."
This is done by determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset and comparing it with the carrying amount.
"In accordance with IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the asset’s fair value less costs to sell or its value in use (present value of the 
pretax free cash flows expected to be derived from the asset in the future), whichever is higher."
"The discount rate used for the value 
in use is a pretax rate of interest reflecting current market conditions."
"If the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an 
individual asset, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets to which the asset in question 
can be allocated and that independently generates cash flows (cash generating unit – CGU)."
"If the recoverable amount of an asset is 
lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in respect of the asset."
"If it can be determined, the 
fair value or value in use of the individual assets represents their minimum carrying amount."
"If, after an impairment loss has been 
recognized, a higher recoverable amount is determined for the asset or the CGU at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed up 
to a carrying amount that does not exceed the recoverable amount."
"The increased carrying amount attributable to the reversal of 
the impairment loss is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) if no 
impairment loss had been recognized in the past."
The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill may not be reversed.
"Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less any 
cumulative adjustments from impairment losses."
"Purchased goodwill is therefore not amortized and instead is tested for 
impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36, regardless of whether any indication of possible impairment exists, as in the case 
of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life."
"In addition, the obligation remains to conduct an impairment test if there is any 
indication of impairment."
"Goodwill resulting from company acquisitions is allocated to the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are 
expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition."
"These groups represent the lowest reporting level at which the goodwill 
is monitored for internal management purposes."
"The carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for 
impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired."
"Where impairment losses are recognized in 
connection with a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the existing carrying amount of the goodwill is reduced first."
"If the 
amount of the impairment loss exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to 
the remaining assets in the CGU."
"Leases  
A lease is a contract in which the right to use an asset (the leased asset) is granted for an agreed-upon period in return for 
compensation."
"Lessee 
In accordance with IFRS 16, the Group as lessee has recognized at present value assets for the right of use received and liabilities 
for the payment obligations entered into for all leases in the balance sheet."
Lease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease to the extent that this can be determined.
"Otherwise, they 
are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the respective lessee."
Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost.
"They are depreciated over the term of the lease using the 
straight-line method."
"The Group makes use of the relief options provided for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases (shorter than 12 months) 
and expenses the payments in the income statement using the straight-line method."
"Additionally, the requirements do not apply to 
leases of intangible assets."
"The Group also exercises the option available for contracts comprising both lease and nonlease 
components to not separate these components, except in the case of real estate and aircraft leases."
"In addition, under IFRS 8, intra-
Group leases – in line with internal management – are generally presented as operating leases in segment reporting."
"Extension and termination options exist for a number of leases, particularly for real estate."
"Such contract terms offer the Group the 
greatest possible flexibility in doing business."
"In determining lease terms, all facts and circumstances offering economic incentives 
for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options are taken into account."
"Changes due to the exercise or 
nonexercise of such options are considered in determining the lease term only if they are sufficiently probable."
"Lessor 
For operating leases, the Group reports the leased asset at amortized cost as an asset under property, plant and equipment where it 
is the lessor."
"The lease payments received in the period are recognized under other operating income or revenue if they belong to 
ordinary business activities."
"Where the Group is the lessor in a finance lease, it recognizes the assets as lease receivables in the amount of the net investment in 
the balance sheet."
Certain subleases embedded in customer contracts are still reported as finance leases at the lessor.
"Investments accounted for using the equity method 
Investments accounted for using the equity method cover associates and joint ventures."
"These are recognized using the equity 
method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures."
"An impairment loss is recognized on investments accounted for using the 
equity method, including the goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment, if the recoverable amount falls below the carrying 
amount."
"Gains and losses from the disposal of investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in net 
income/expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method, as are impairments and reversals of impairments."
"Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of 
another entity."
"Financial assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans and other 
financial receivables, as well as derivative financial assets."
"Financial liabilities include contractual obligations to deliver cash or 
another financial asset to another entity."
"These mainly comprise trade payables, liabilities to banks, liabilities arising from bonds 
and leases, and derivative financial liabilities."
"The transaction costs of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
through profit or loss are recognized as expenses."
"For financial liabilities measured according to the fair value option, the part of 
the change in fair value resulting from changes in the Group’s own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income rather 
than in the income statement."
"Classification 
Financial assets are classified in the measurement categories below."
"The classification of debt instruments depends on the 
business model used to manage the financial assets and their contractual cash flows."
"Debt instruments at amortized cost 
Debt instruments that are assigned to the “hold to collect contractual cash flows” business model and whose cash flows exclusively 
comprise interest and principal are measured and recognized at amortized cost."
"Interest income from these financial assets is 
reported in financial income using the effective interest method."
"Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 
Debt instruments assigned to the “hold to collect and sell” business model must be measured at fair value plus transaction costs."
"As 
a result, changes in the carrying amount due to exchange rate gains and losses, impairment gains and losses, and interest income 
calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in the income statement."
"These amounts correspond to the amounts 
that would have been recognized in the income statement if they had been measured at amortized cost."
"All other changes of the 
carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income."
"When the debt instruments are derecognized, the amounts 
recognized in other comprehensive income are to be reclassified to the income statement."
"Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 
Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments acquired to maximize their cash flows by selling them in the short to medium 
term are assigned to the “sell” business model."
They are measured at fair value.
"The resulting measurement gains and losses are 
reported in the income statement."
"Equity instruments classified as FVTOCI  
Pursuant to IFRS 9, equity instruments are to be recognized at their fair value and can be assigned to the FVTOCI or FVTPL 
measurement categories."
"For strategic reasons, most of the equity instruments that the Group invests in are then assigned to the 
FVTOCI category."
"The effects of any change in the fair value of equity instruments of the FVTOCI category are recognized in other 
comprehensive income."
Dividends are recognized in other operating income in the income statement.
"If the equity instruments of 
the FVTOCI category are sold, the fair value changes recognized in equity are to be transferred to other reserves."
"For equity 
instruments assigned to the FVTPL category, the fair value changes are to be reported immediately in the income statement."
Dividends are also recognized in other income in the income statement.

Impairment losses 
The Group makes a forward-looking assessment of the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments (expected-
credit-loss model)."
"Expected credit loss (ECL) within the meaning of IFRS 9 is an estimate of credit loss over the expected lifetime of a financial asset 
accounted for at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), weighted for the probability of 
default."
"A credit loss is the difference between the contractual cash flows to which the Group is entitled and the cash flows 
expected by the Group."
The expected credit loss takes into account the amount and timing of payments.
"Accordingly, a credit loss 
may also occur if the Group expects payment to be made in full, but later than the contractually agreed-upon date."
Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the IFRS 9 impairment rules.
The identified impairment loss for the latter is immaterial.
"ECL is generally measured at the level of individual items; in exceptional cases, such as groups of receivables with the same credit 
risk characteristics, it is measured collectively at portfolio level."
"The standard stipulates the three-stage general approach to 
determining credit loss for this process."
"In accordance with the three-stage model, debt instruments measured at amortized cost and at fair value through other 
comprehensive income are initially recognized in Stage 1."
"The expected credit loss is equal to the loss that may occur due to 
possible default events in the 12 months following the reporting date."
"Financial assets that have experienced a significant increase 
in counterparty credit risk since initial recognition are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2."
"A significant increase includes situations 
in which debtors are no longer able to meet their payment obligations at short notice or when it appears that the debtor has 
experienced an actual or expected deterioration in business performance."
"The credit risk can then be measured using the 
probability of default (PD) over the instrument’s lifetime (lifetime PD)."
"The impairment loss is equivalent to the loss that may occur 
due to possible default events during the remaining term of the financial asset."
"Assets must be transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 
when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due."
"In cases where contractual payments from a debt instrument are 
more than 90 days past due, there is revocable reason to believe that there is objective evidence of a credit loss because the debtor 
is experiencing significant financial difficulties."
The debt instrument is then to be transferred to Stage 3.
"Listed debt instruments measured at amortized cost are assigned to Stage 1 of the three-stage model if an investment-grade rating 
exists from at least one major rating agency."
"The impairment loss recognized in the period is equal to the loss that may occur due to 
possible default events in the twelve months following the reporting date."
Trade receivables and contract assets are generally short term in nature and contain no significant financing components.
"According to the simplified impairment approach in IFRS 9, a loss allowance in an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit 
losses must be recognized for all instruments, regardless of their credit quality."
"The Group calculates the expected credit loss using 
impairment tables for the individual divisions."
"The loss estimate, documented by way of loss rates, encompasses all of the available 
information, including historical data, current economic conditions and reliable forecasts of future economic conditions 
(macroeconomic factors)."
Impairment losses are offset against gains on the reversal of impairment losses.
Further details are presented in note 43.

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
Derivatives and hedges 
The Group began to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements as of January 1, 2020."
"Derivative hedging instruments are 
used to minimize variations in earnings due to payments in foreign currencies, variable-rate borrowing and for planned commodity 
purchases."
"The gains and losses from the underlying and hedging transactions are recognized simultaneously in total 
comprehensive income (hedge accounting)."
The Group has designated cash flow hedges due to the existing risks.
"A cash flow hedge hedges the fluctuations in future cash flows from recognized assets and liabilities (in the case of interest rate 
risks), highly probable forecast transactions as well as unrecognized firm commitments that entail a currency risk."
"The effective 
portion of a cash flow hedge designated as a hedge is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve in other comprehensive income."
"IFRS 9 allows the alternative of designating either the full 
or the intrinsic value of an option as a hedging instrument."
The fair value of an option is considered the cost of the hedge.
"If only the 
intrinsic value of an option is designated as a hedging instrument, changes to the fair value of the option must be recognized in 
other comprehensive income as cost of hedging in the cost of hedging reserve and reclassified on a reasonable basis when the 
hedged item occurs."
"Similar to the intrinsic value of an option, it is permissible to only designate the spot component of a forward 
transaction as a hedging instrument."
"In this case, there is an option to also recognize the effective and cumulative fair value 
changes of the forward component and the foreign-currency spread in the cost of hedging reserve."
"Ineffective portions resulting 
from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized directly in income."
"The gains and losses generated by the 
hedging transactions are initially recognized in equity and are then reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the financial 
asset acquired or financial liability assumed affects profit or loss."
"If a hedge of a firm commitment subsequently results in the 
recognition of a nonfinancial asset, the gains and losses recognized directly in equity are included in the initial carrying amount of 
the asset (basis adjustment)."
Net investment hedges in foreign entities are treated in the same way as cash flow hedges.
"The gain or loss from the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the gain or loss attributable to the ineffective portion is 
recognized directly in the income statement."
"The gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income remain there until the 
disposal or partial disposal, or an impairment loss, of the net investment."
"Recognition and derecognition 
Regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized as of the settlement date, with the exception of derivatives, in 
particular."
"A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired or have been 
transferred, and the Group has transferred essentially all risks and opportunities of ownership."
"Financial liabilities are derecognized 
if the payment obligations arising from them have expired."
"Power purchase agreements 
DHL Group concludes long-term contracts for the provision of electricity from renewable sources (e.g., wind and solar power) to 
reduce its carbon footprint (power purchase agreements) and to hedge against fluctuating prices."
"If the contracts are concluded for 
the company’s own use, they are treated as executory contracts (own-use exemption) and not accounted for as derivatives."
"Offsetting 
Financial assets and liabilities are offset on the basis of netting agreements (master netting arrangements) only if there is an 
enforceable right of offset and settlement on a net basis is intended as of the reporting date."
"The master netting arrangement then creates only a conditional right 
of offset."
"Investment property 
In accordance with IAS 40, investment property is property held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather 
than for use in the supply of services, for administrative purposes or for sale in the normal course of the company’s business."
"It is 
measured in accordance with the cost model."
"Depreciable investment property is depreciated over a period of between 20 and 50 
years using the straight-line method."
The fair value is determined on the basis of expert opinions.
"Impairment losses are recognized 
in accordance with the principles described in the impairment section."
"Inventories 
Inventories are assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, are in the process of production or are consumed in 
the production process or in the rendering of services."
They are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.
"Impairment 
losses are charged for obsolete inventories and slow-moving goods."
"Government grants 
In accordance with IAS 20, government grants are recognized at their fair value only when there is reasonable assurance that the 
conditions attached to them will be complied with and that the grants will be received."
"The grants are reported in the income 
statement and are generally recognized as income over the periods in which the costs they are intended to compensate for are 
incurred."
"Where the grants relate to the purchase or production of assets, they are reported as deferred income and recognized in 
the income statement over the useful lives of the assets."
Such deferred income is presented in other operating income.
"Assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale 
Assets held for sale are assets available for sale in their present condition and whose sale is highly probable."
"The sale must be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification."
"Assets held for sale may consist 
of individual noncurrent assets, groups of assets (disposal groups), components of an entity or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for 
resale (discontinued operations)."
"Liabilities intended to be disposed of together with the assets in a single transaction form part of 
the disposal group or discontinued operation and are also reported separately as liabilities associated with assets held for sale."
"Assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortized, but are recognized at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and 
the carrying amount."
"Gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of individual noncurrent assets or disposal groups 
classified as held for sale are reported in profit or loss from continuing operations until the final date of disposal."
"Gains and losses 
arising from the measurement at fair value less costs to sell of discontinued operations classified as held for sale are reported in 
profit or loss from discontinued operations."
"This also applies to the profit or loss from operations and the gain or loss on disposal of 
these components of an entity."
"Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, demand deposits and other short-term liquid financial assets with an original maturity of 
up to three months; they are measured at amortized cost."
"Overdraft facilities used are recognized in the balance sheet as amounts 
due to banks."
"If an interest is acquired from, or sold to, other shareholders without affecting the existing control relationship, this is 
presented as an equity transaction."
"The difference between the proportionate net assets acquired from, or sold to, other 
shareholders and the purchase price is recognized in other comprehensive income."
"If noncontrolling interests are increased by the 
proportionate net assets, no goodwill is allocated to the proportionate net assets."
"Share-based payments to executives 
Equity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value as of the grant date."
"The fair value of the obligation is 
recognized in staff costs over the vesting period."
"The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is determined 
using internationally recognized valuation techniques."
"Cash-settled share-based payments (stock appreciation rights, SARs) are measured on the basis of an option pricing model in 
accordance with IFRS 2."
The stock appreciation rights are measured on each reporting date and on the settlement date.
"The 
amount determined for stock appreciation rights that will probably be exercised is recognized pro rata in income under staff costs, 
to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period (lockup period)."
"A provision is recognized for the same 
amount."
"Changes in value due to share price movements occurring after the grant date are recognized as other finance costs in net 
finance costs."
"Retirement benefit plans 
There are arrangements (plans) in many countries under which the Group grants post-employment benefits to its employees."
"These benefits include pensions, lump-sum payments on retirement and other post-employment benefits and are referred to in 
these disclosures as retirement benefits, pensions and similar benefits, or pensions."
"A distinction must be made between defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans."
"The Group’s defined benefit retirement plan  
Defined benefit obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method prescribed by IAS 19."
"This involves making certain 
actuarial assumptions."
Most of the defined benefit retirement plans are at least partly funded via external plan assets.
"The 
remaining net liabilities are funded by provisions for pensions and similar obligations; net assets are presented separately as 
pension assets."
"Where necessary, an asset ceiling must be applied when recognizing pension assets."
"With regard to the cost 
components, the service cost is recognized in staff costs, net interest cost in net finance costs and the remeasurements outside the 
income statement in other comprehensive income."
Any rights to reimbursement are reported separately in financial assets.
"Defined contribution retirement plans for civil-servant employees in Germany  
In accordance with statutory provisions, Deutsche Post AG pays contributions for civil-servant employees in Germany to retirement 
plans that are defined contribution retirement plans for the company."
These contributions are recognized in staff costs.
"The amount of Deutsche Post AG’s payment obligations is governed 
by Section 16 PostPersRG."
"This act obliges Deutsche Post AG to pay into the PVK an annual contribution of 33% of the gross 
compensation of its active civil servants and the notional gross compensation of civil servants on leave of absence who are eligible 
for a pension."
"Insofar as the federal 
government makes payments to the PVK under the terms of this guarantee, it cannot claim reimbursement from Deutsche Post AG."
"Defined contribution retirement plans for the Group’s hourly workers and salaried employees 
Defined contribution retirement plans are in place for the Group’s hourly workers and salaried employees, particularly in the United 
Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands."
The contributions to these plans are also reported in staff costs.
"This also includes contributions to certain multiemployer plans that are basically defined benefit plans, especially in the United 
States and the Netherlands."
"However, the relevant institutions do not provide the participating companies with sufficient 
information to use defined benefit accounting."
The plans are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution plans.
"Regarding these multiemployer plans in the United States, contributions are made based on collective agreements between the 
employer and the local union, with the involvement of the pension fund."
"There is no employer liability to any of the plans beyond 
the bargained contribution rates except in the event of a withdrawal meeting specified criteria, which could then include a liability 
for other entities’ obligations as governed by US federal law."
"The expected employer contributions to the funds for 2024 are 
€79 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €81 million, in the previous year: €81 million)."
"Some of the 
plans in which DHL Group participates are underfunded according to information provided by the funds."
"No information is available 
to the Group that would indicate any change from the contribution rates set by current collective agreements."
"In addition, the 
potential financial risks in conjunction with underfunded joint plans were implicitly reduced through measures taken by the US 
government."
"DHL Group does not represent a significant level to any fund in terms of contributions, with the exception of one fund 
where the Group represents the largest employer in terms of contributions."
"Contribution rates for one multiemployer retirement plan in the Netherlands are determined each year by the management body of 
the pension fund with the involvement of the central bank of the Netherlands, based on cost coverage."
"These contribution rates are 
the same for all employers and employees involved."
"There is no liability for the employer toward the fund beyond the contributions 
set, even in the case of withdrawal or obligations not met by other entities."
"Any subsequent underfunding ultimately results in the 
rights of members being cut and/or no indexation of their rights."
"The expected employer contributions to the fund for 2024 are 
€36 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €33 million, in the previous year: €31 million)."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, the coverage degree of plan funding was above a required minimum of approximately 105%, according to 
information provided by the fund."
DHL Group does not represent a significant portion of the fund in terms of contributions.
"They represent uncertain obligations that are carried at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation."
"Provisions with more than one year to maturity are discounted at market rates of interest that reflect the region and 
time to settlement of the obligation."
"The discount rates used in the fiscal year were between 0.25% and 10.50% (previous year: 
0.00% to 10.75%)."
The effects arising from changes in interest rates are recognized under other operating income or expenses.
"Provisions for restructuring are only established in accordance with the aforementioned criteria for recognition if a detailed, formal 
restructuring plan has been drawn up and communicated to those affected."

Technical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves."
"Outstanding-loss reserves represent estimates of obligations in respect of actual claims or known incidents expected to give rise to 
claims that have been reported to the company but have yet to be finalized and presented for payment."
"Outstanding-loss reserves 
are based on individual claim valuations carried out by the company or its ceding insurers."
"IBNR reserves represent estimates of 
obligations in respect of incidents taking place on or before the reporting date that have not been reported to the company."
"Such 
reserves also include provisions for potential errors in settling outstanding-loss reserves."
"The company carries out its own 
assessment of ultimate loss liabilities using actuarial methods and also commissions an independent actuarial study of these each 
year in order to verify the reasonableness of its estimates."
"Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are carried at fair value less transaction costs on initial recognition."
"The price determined in an efficient and 
liquid market or a fair value determined using the treasury risk management system deployed within the Group is taken as the fair 
value."
Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost in subsequent periods.
"Any differences between the amount received and 
the amount repayable are recognized in the income statement over the term of the loan using the effective interest method."
Disclosures on financial liabilities under leases can be found in the leases section.
"Convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares 
The convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares is split into an equity and a debt component, in line with the contractual 
arrangements."
"The debt component, less the transaction costs, is reported under financial liabilities (bonds), with interest added 
back up to the issue amount over the term of the bond using the effective interest method (unwinding of the discount)."
"The value of 
the call option, which allows Deutsche Post AG to redeem the bond early if a specified share price is reached, is attributed to the 
debt component in accordance with IAS 32.31."
"The conversion right is classified as an equity component and is reported in capital 
reserves."
"The carrying amount is calculated by assigning to the conversion right the residual value that results from deducting the 
amount calculated separately for the debt component from the fair value of the instrument as a whole."
"The transaction costs are 
deducted on a proportionate basis."
"Liabilities 
Trade payables are carried at amortized cost."
Most of the trade payables have a maturity of less than one year.
"The fair value of the 
liabilities corresponds more or less to their carrying amount."
"Group companies use reverse-factoring programs for supplier 
financing."
"As part of this, suppliers conclude financing agreements with financial institutions without the involvement of DHL 
Group."
"If they wish, suppliers can receive invoice amounts less an interest component prior to the original due date on the basis of 
these agreements."
DHL Group pays the invoice amounts to the respective financial institutions when they come due.
"Because the 
programs do not lead to any substantial modification of the conditions of payment between DHL Group and the suppliers, and 
payment terms are within the normal industry range, the corresponding accounts payable are still reported under trade payables."
The payments to the financial institutions are reported in the operating cash flow.
"Deferred taxes 
In accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the IFRS 
financial statements and the tax basis of the individual entities."
"Deferred tax assets also include tax reduction claims that arise from 
the expected future utilization of existing tax loss carryforwards and that are likely to be realized."
"The recoverability of the tax 
reduction claims is assessed on the basis of each entity’s earnings projections, which are derived from the Group projections and 
take any tax adjustments and effects on earnings from the reversal of taxable temporary differences into account."
"The planning 
horizon is five years."
"No deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences resulting from initial differences in 
the opening tax accounts of Deutsche Post AG as of January 1, 1995."
"In accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates applicable in the individual countries 
as of the reporting date or announced for the time when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are realized."
"The tax rate applied to 
German Group companies is unchanged at 30.5%."
"It comprises the corporation tax rate plus the solidarity surcharge, as well as a 
municipal trade tax rate that is calculated as the average of the different municipal trade tax rates."
"Foreign Group companies use 
their individual income tax rates to calculate deferred tax items."
"The income tax rates applied for foreign companies amount to up 
to 38% (previous year: 38%)."
"The Group applies the exception to the recognition and disclosure of information regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities in 
conjunction with income taxes for pillar two, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023."
"Income taxes 
Income tax assets and liabilities are recognized when they are probable."
"They are measured at the amounts for which repayments 
from, or payments to, the tax authorities are expected to be received or made."
"If uncertain tax items are recognized because they 
are probable, they are measured at their most likely amount."
"Tax-related fines are recognized in income taxes if they are included in 
the calculation of income tax liabilities, due to their inclusion in the tax base and/or tax rate."
"Contingent liabilities 
Contingent liabilities represent possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, 
of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise."
"Contingent liabilities also include certain 
obligations that will probably not lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where the amount of the 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits cannot be measured with sufficient reliability."
"In accordance with IAS 37, 
contingent liabilities are not recognized in the balance sheet."
"8 
Exercise of judgment in applying the accounting policies 
The preparation of IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements requires the exercise of judgment by management."
"All 
estimates are reassessed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations with regard to future events 
that appear reasonable under the given circumstances."
"For example, this applies to assets held for sale."
"In this case, management 
must determine whether the assets are available for sale in their present condition and whether their sale is highly probable."
"If that 
is the case, the assets and associated liabilities must be measured and recognized as assets held for sale or liabilities associated 
with assets held for sale."
"Examples of the main areas where assumptions, 
estimates and the exercise of management judgment occur are the recognition of provisions for pensions and similar obligations, 
the calculation of discounted cash flows for impairment testing and purchase price allocations, taxes and legal proceedings."
The Group has operating activities around the globe and is subject to local tax laws.
"Management can exercise judgment when 
calculating the amounts of current and deferred taxes in the relevant countries."
"Although management believes that it has made a 
reasonable estimate relating to tax matters that are inherently uncertain, there can be no guarantee that the actual outcome of 
these uncertain tax matters will correspond exactly to the original estimate made."
"Any difference between actual events and the 
estimate made could have an effect on tax balance sheet items in the period in which the matter is finally decided."
"The amount 
recognized for deferred tax assets could be reduced if the estimates of planned taxable income or changes to current tax laws 
restrict the extent to which future tax benefits can be realized."
"The Company

Goodwill is regularly reported in the Group’s balance sheet as a consequence of business combinations."
"When an acquisition is 
initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are generally 
measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition."
"One of the important estimates this requires is the determination of the 
fair values of these assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition."
"Land, buildings and office equipment are generally valued by 
independent experts, while securities for which there is an active market are recognized at the quoted exchange price."
"If intangible 
assets are identified in the course of an acquisition, their measurement can be based on the opinion of an independent external 
expert valuer, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity involved in determining its fair value."
"The independent 
expert determines the fair value using appropriate valuation techniques, normally based on expected future cash flows."
"In addition 
to the assumptions about the development of future cash flows, these valuations are also significantly affected by the discount 
rates used."
"Climate change could give rise to uncertainties and risks for the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group."
"Extreme weather events could potentially lead to damage to property, plant and equipment."
"Increased restrictions imposed by law 
to combat climate change are expected in the coming years, including limits on air transport or access to city centers."
"In certain 
cases, this may also affect our existing business models and our ability to operate optimally."
"• 
Transitory changes in conjunction with decarbonization – including political, legal, technological and market-related changes 
– can influence the useful lives and the values of our assets."
"In particular, there are uncertainties with regard to the extent to which regulatory efforts in connection with the debate 
surrounding climate action will lead to higher costs."
"The current focus as part of the public debate and the climate action measures 
of DHL Group relate to CO2 emissions."
"DHL Group plans to reduce its logistics-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to below 
29 million metric tons of CO2e by the year 2030."
DHL Group wants to reduce the GHG emissions to net zero by 2050.
"To this end, 
additional costs – for emissions trading and sustainable fuels, among other things – were accounted for in the company’s 
projections and thus included in the application of IAS 36 as well as in the impairment considerations for deferred tax assets."
"Other 
central elements of the planned reduction in CO2 emissions are the planned fleet modernization as well as the option for DHL 
Group customers to acquire CO2 offsets during the booking process."
"DHL Group does not currently see any climate-related indications for the adjustment of useful lives and residual values of aircraft 
and other items of property, plant and equipment."
"As part of determining the impairment loss on assets of property, plant and 
equipment, of intangible assets and of right-of-use assets, estimates are also made that relate to, among other factors, the cause, 
time and amount of the impairment."
An impairment loss is based upon a number of factors.
"Moreover, a loss allowance for financial assets has been established to account for expected credit 
losses resulting from customers’ credit quality."
"Detailed information can be found under note 7 on expected credit loss and trade 
receivables."
"In the event of a deterioration of the credit quality of the customer, the scope 
of the derecognition (specific valuation allowances on receivables) actually carried out may exceed that of the loss allowance 
recognized."
"The Company

Impairment testing for goodwill is based on assumptions about the future."
"The Group carries out these tests annually and also 
whenever there are indications that goodwill has become impaired."
The recoverable amount of the CGU must then be calculated.
This amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
"Determining value in use requires assumptions and 
estimates to be made with respect to forecast future cash flows and the discount rate applied."
"For the actuarial valuation of defined benefit retirement plans of the Group, actuarial assumptions are required that relate to, in 
particular, discount rates, expected rates of salary and pension increases and biometric probabilities."
"Generally accepted valuation 
methods are used to determine the fair value of plan assets – in particular, for assets without a market price quotation (e.g., real 
estate) – that require separate assumptions."
"If changes to these assumptions are necessary, this could have a material impact on 
the results of actuarial valuations, recognized carrying amounts and the future amount of retirement benefit expenses."
"Disclosures 
regarding the assumptions made in connection with the Group’s defined benefit retirement plans can be found in note 37."
Pending legal proceedings in which the Group is involved are disclosed in note 45.
"The outcome of these proceedings could have a 
significant effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group."
"Management regularly analyzes the 
information currently available about these proceedings and recognizes provisions for probable obligations including estimated 
legal costs."
Internal and external legal advisers participate in making this assessment.
"In deciding on the necessity for a provision, 
management takes into account the probability of an unfavorable outcome and whether the amount of the obligation can be 
estimated with sufficient reliability."
"The fact that an action has been launched or a claim asserted against the Group, or that a legal 
dispute has been disclosed in the notes, does not necessarily mean that a provision is recognized for the associated risk."
DHL Group considers itself to be exposed to an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.
"This includes potential increases in fuel, energy and gas prices, which can be at least partially compensated for or passed on to 
customers through strict cost management and the established levers such as price increases and price surcharge mechanisms."
"In 
addition, strong volatility is still expected on the goods and financial markets and in exchange rates, driven by rising interest and 
inflation rates."
"Moreover, the risk of a potential decline in global economic growth can be observed, which could lead to an 
increased number of customer bankruptcies."
All assumptions and estimates are based on the circumstances prevailing and assessments made as of the reporting date.
"For the 
purpose of estimating the future development of the business, a realistic assessment was also made at that date of the economic 
environment likely to apply in the future to the different sectors and regions in which the Group operates."
"In the event of 
developments in these economic parameters that diverge from the assumptions made, the actual amounts may differ from the 
estimated amounts."
"In such cases, the assumptions made and, where necessary, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and 
liabilities are adjusted accordingly."
Acquisition accounting for subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements uses the purchase method of accounting.
"The cost of the acquisition corresponds to the fair value of the assets given up, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities 
assumed at the transaction date."
Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses.
"Contingent consideration is recognized at 
fair value as of the date of initial consolidation."
"The assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses, of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements 
in proportion to the interest held in these operations, in accordance with IFRS 11."
"Accounting for the joint operators’ share of the 
assets and liabilities, as well as recognition and measurement of goodwill, use the same methods as applied to the consolidation of 
subsidiaries."
"In accordance with IAS 28, joint ventures and companies on which the parent can exercise significant influence (associates) are 
accounted for in accordance with the equity method."
"Any goodwill is recognized under investments accounted for using the equity 
method."
"In the case of step acquisitions, the equity portion previously held is remeasured at the fair value applicable as of the acquisition 
date, and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement."
"Intra-Group revenue, other operating income and expenses, as well as receivables, liabilities and provisions between companies 
that are consolidated or proportionately consolidated, are eliminated."
"Intercompany profits or losses from intra-Group deliveries 
and services not realized by sale to third parties are eliminated."
"Unrealized gains and losses from business transactions with 
investments accounted for using the equity method are eliminated on a proportionate basis."
"10.1 Segment reporting disclosures 
DHL Group reports five operating segments for the 2023 fiscal year; these are managed independently by the responsible segment 
management bodies in line with the products and services offered and the brands, distribution channels and customer profiles 
involved."
"Components of the entity are defined as a segment on the basis of the existence of segment managers with bottom-line 
responsibility who report directly to DHL Group’s top management."
External revenue is the revenue generated by the divisions from non-Group third parties.
"Internal revenue is revenue generated 
with other divisions."
"If comparable external market prices exist for services or products offered internally within the Group, these 
market prices or market-oriented prices are used as transfer prices (arm’s-length principle)."
"The transfer prices for services for 
which no external market exists are generally based on incremental costs."
The expenses for services provided in the IT service centers are allocated to the divisions by their origin.
"In keeping with internal reporting, capital expenditure (capex) is disclosed."
"Additions to intangible assets net of goodwill and to 
property, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets, are reported in the capex figure."
"Depreciation, amortization and 
impairment losses relate to the segment assets allocated to the individual divisions."
"For reasons of transparency, net cash 
from/used in operating activities is now shown in segment reporting instead of in other noncash expenses and income, as 
previously."
The profitability of the Group’s operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT).
"10.2 Segments by division 
The primary reporting format is based on the divisions, reflecting the Group’s predominant organizational structure."
"The Group 
distinguishes between the following divisions: 
Express 
The Express division offers time-definite courier and express services to business and private customers."
"The division comprises 
the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions."
"Global Forwarding, Freight 
The Global Forwarding, Freight division comprises international air, ocean and overland freight forwarding services."
"The division’s 
business units are Global Forwarding and Freight."
"Supply Chain 
The Supply Chain division delivers customized logistics services and supply chain solutions to its customers based on globally 
standardized modular components including warehousing, transport and value-added services."
"The division comprises the Europe, 
Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions."
"eCommerce 
The eCommerce division is home to the Group’s international parcel delivery business."
"The core business activities are domestic 
parcel delivery in selected countries in Europe, Asia and the United States and non-TDI cross-border services."
"Post & Parcel Germany  
The Post & Parcel Germany division transports, sorts and delivers documents and goods in and outside of Germany."
"Its business 
units are called Post Germany, Parcel Germany and International."
"In addition to the reported segments shown above, segment reporting comprises the following categories: 
Group Functions 
Group Functions includes Corporate Center, Global Business Services (GBS) and Customer Solutions & Innovation (CSI)."
"The 
profit/loss generated by GBS is allocated to the operating segments, while its assets and liabilities remain with GBS (asymmetrical 
allocation)."
"Consolidation 
The data for the divisions is presented following consolidation of interdivisional transactions."
"The transactions between the 
divisions are eliminated in the Consolidation column."
"External revenue, noncurrent assets and capex are disclosed for these regions."
"Revenue, assets and 
capex are allocated to the individual regions on the basis of the domicile of the reporting entity."
"Noncurrent assets comprise 
intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets (excluding pension assets)."
"10.4 Reconciliation of segment amounts to consolidated amounts 
The following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group’s total assets to the segment assets."
"Financial asset components, 
income tax assets, deferred taxes, cash and cash equivalents and other asset components are deducted."
The following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group’s total liabilities to the segment liabilities.
"Components of the provisions 
and liabilities as well as income tax liabilities and deferred taxes are deducted."
"Among other factors, the normalization of 
freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division contributed to this development."
"Business in the Express division was 
shaped by declining volume development."
"In addition, currency effects and lower fuel surcharges had a reducing effect on revenue."
"Meanwhile, revenue in the Supply Chain and eCommerce divisions increased due to new business and contract extensions."
"In the 
Post & Parcel Germany division, revenue growth in the Parcel Germany business unit compensated for the declining business in the 
Post Germany area, which is hampered by ongoing structural transition."
The contract liabilities recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year primarily led to revenue in the fiscal year.
"The reduction in income from currency translation was partially 
compensated for by the increased income from the reversal of provisions and by higher income from the remeasurement of 
liabilities."
Income from operating leases was attributable mainly to leasing of the aircraft fleet’s cargo space.

"The changes in work performed and capitalized 
are primarily in conjunction with the discontinuation of production of the StreetScooter vehicles in the 2022 fiscal year."
The other expenses item includes furthermore a large number of individual items.
The increase results primarily from wage and salary raises and from new employees in the fiscal year.
"Social security contributions relate, in particular, to statutory social security contributions paid by employers."
"Retirement benefit expenses include the service cost related to the defined benefit retirement plans, note 37."
The employees of companies acquired or disposed of during the fiscal year were included ratably.
"The number of full-time 
equivalents at joint operations included in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, amounted to 621 on a 
proportionate basis (previous year: 523)."
"There, they are attributable exclusively to the most recent 
measurement of aircraft prior to reclassification to assets held for sale, note 32."
"In the previous year, the impairment losses related 
to the Express and Global Forwarding, Freight divisions, as well as write-downs of assets of Russian companies in the amount of 
€31 million, 2022 Annual Report, notes 3, 12 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements."
"Taxes other than income taxes are either recognized in the related expense item or, if no specific allocation is possible, in other 
operating expenses."
Miscellaneous other operating expenses include a large number of smaller individual items.
"Higher interest rates 
were able to partially compensate for the deterioration in financial income from the change in fair value of the stock appreciation 
rights (SARs)."
Further disclosures on interest income and expenses are contained in note 43.
"The expense from the unwinding of discounts on bonds resulting from the application of the effective interest method amounted to 
€12 million (previous year: €12 million)."
Gains and losses on changes in fair value of financial assets and liabilities primarily relate to pension plans in the United States.
"The foreign-currency result includes net monetary gains of €10 million related to financial reporting in hyperinflationary 
economies."
Information on interest expenses from unwinding discounted net pension provisions can be found in note 37.
"In accordance with IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24(b), the Group did not recognize any deferred tax assets in 
respect of these temporary differences, which related mainly to property, plant and equipment as well as to pension provisions and 
similar obligations."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining tax-deductible temporary differences between the original 
IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base (previous year: €99 million)."
"In addition, the recognition of 
deferred tax assets previously not recognized for tax loss carryforwards and of deductible temporary differences from a prior 
period reduced the deferred tax expense by €100 million (previous year: €274 million)."
"Effects from unrecognized deferred tax 
assets do not include any effects (previous year: income of €12 million) due to a reversal or impairment loss recognized for a 
deferred tax asset."
"Other effects from unrecognized deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carryforwards for which no 
deferred taxes were recognized."
Tax rate changes also had no material effects.
Outstanding shares relate to issued capital less any treasury shares held.
Basic earnings per share for the 2023 fiscal year were €3.09 (previous year: €4.41).
"Consolidated 
net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders was increased by the amounts spent for the convertible 
bond."
Diluted earnings per share in the reporting period were €3.04 (previous year: €4.33).
"Further details on the dividend 
distribution can be found in note 35."
"With the final purchase price allocation for the Monta Group, its opening balance sheet changed and led to a €25 million 
adjustment to the recognition of intangible assets."
"As part of this, as of December 31, 2022, internally generated intangible assets 
increased by €18 million, purchased brand names by €6 million and purchased customer lists by €17 million, while goodwill fell by 
€16 million, note 2 and 4."
"Purchased software, concessions, industrial rights, licenses and similar rights and assets are reported under purchased intangible 
assets."
Internally generated intangible assets relate to development costs for internally developed software.
"22.2 Allocation of goodwill to CGUs 
For the purposes of annual impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36, the Group determines the recoverable amount of a CGU, 
or a group of CGUs, on the basis of its value in use."
"This calculation is based on projections of free cash flows that are initially 
discounted at a rate corresponding to the posttax cost of capital."
Pretax discount rates are determined iteratively.

"The cash flow projections are based on the detailed planning for EBIT, depreciation and amortization, investment planning adopted 
by management, as well as changes in net working capital, and take both internal historical data and external macroeconomic data 
into account."
"The cash flow forecasts include the expenses for decarbonization measures planned to achieve the targets for 
reducing emissions by 2030 for expanding the use of sustainable fuels and technologies in fleets and buildings."
"As part of the 
planning for the Post & Parcel Germany CGU, assumptions regarding the regulations of the German Postal Act, which is currently 
undergoing revision, were taken into account on the basis of the draft legislation."
"If there are changes to the draft legislation, if it is 
not possible to withdraw from the provision of the universal postal service, or if the new law is not passed in a timely manner, these 
represent material risk factors; however, the probability of their occurrence is considered to be low."
"From a methodological 
perspective, the detailed planning phase covers a three-year planning horizon from 2024 to 2026."
"By contrast, an extended 
planning phase of five years was applied for the eCommerce CGU."
"The eCommerce division is only in its sixth year of existence and 
has not yet reached a steady state."
"This is attributable to relatively high levels of planned capital expenditure over the next three 
years, during which the estimated EBIT will not yet reflect business growth."
"The expectation is that a stable state will be achieved in 
2028."
"Planning is supplemented by a perpetual annuity representing the value added from 2027 onward, or following the 
extended planning phase."
"This is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is determined for each CGU or each CGU group 
separately and is shown in the table below."
"The growth rates applied are based on long-term real growth figures for the relevant 
economies, growth expectations for the relevant sectors and long-term inflation forecasts for the countries in which the CGU or 
CGU group operates."
"The cash flow forecasts are based both on past experience and on the effects of the anticipated future general 
market trend."
"In addition, the forecasts take into account growth in the respective geographical submarkets and in global trade, 
and the ongoing trend toward outsourcing logistics activities."
"Cost trend forecasts for the transport network and services also have 
an impact on value in use."
A key planning assumption for the impairment test is the EBIT margin for the perpetual annuity.

The pretax cost of capital is based on the weighted average cost of capital."
"On the basis of these assumptions and the impairment tests carried out for the individual CGUs or CGU groups to which goodwill 
was allocated, it was established that the recoverable amounts for all CGUs or CGU groups exceed their carrying amounts."
"No 
impairment losses were recognized on goodwill in any of the CGUs or CGU groups as of December 31, 2023."
"When performing the impairment test, DHL Group conducted sensitivity analyses for the significant CGUs or CGU groups in 
accordance with IAS 36.134 for potential changes to the EBIT margin, the discount rate and the growth rate."
"These analyses – 
which included varying the essential valuation parameters within an appropriate range – did not reveal any risk of impairment to 
goodwill."

equity method."
"The table below is an overview of the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data for those 
companies that, both individually and in the aggregate, are not of material significance for the Group."
"Because there is currently no possibility to determine the relevant activities, DHL Group cannot exercise any control over the 
company."
"Another addition to associates is RailDirect LLC, United Arab Emirates, with 49% of shares, while the addition of the 
Polish company APM Solutions Sp."

Miscellaneous other assets include a large number of individual items.
"Deferred taxes have not been recognized for loss carryforwards expected to not be usable in the amount of around €1.2 billion 
(previous year: €1.4 billion)."
"Of these, around €0.4 billion (previous year: €0.6 billion) is attributable to loss carryforwards from US 
subsidiaries for state taxes."

There are material noncontrolling interests in the following two companies: DHL Sinotrans International Air Courier Ltd."
"(Sinotrans), China, which is assigned to the Express segment, provides domestic and international express delivery and transport

DHL Group holds a 50% interest in the company.
"Deutsche Post AG holds a 75% interest in Blue Dart Express Limited (Blue

Blue Dart is a courier service provider.
"A wide variety of other 
defined benefit retirement plans in the Group are to be found in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and a large number 
of other countries."
There are specific risks associated with these plans along with measures to mitigate them.
"37.1 Plan features 
 
Germany 
In Germany, Deutsche Post AG has an occupational retirement benefit arrangement based on a collective agreement, which is open 
to new hourly workers and salaried employees."
"Depending on the weekly working hours and wage/salary group, retirement benefit 
components are calculated annually for each hourly worker and salaried employee and credited to an individual pension account."
"A 
2.5% increase on the previous year is included in every newly allocated component."
"When the statutory pension falls due, the 
hourly workers and salaried employees can choose whether to receive payment as a lump sum or in installments, or lifelong 
monthly benefit payments that increase by 1% each year."
"The large majority of Deutsche Post AG’s obligations relates to vested 
entitlements of hourly workers and salaried employees from a previous agreement, and to legacy pension commitments toward 
former hourly workers and salaried employees who have left or retired from the company."
"In addition, retirement benefit 
arrangements are available to executives below the Board of Management level and to specific employee groups through deferred 
compensation, in particular."
"For information on the pension scheme for the Board of Management, see note 47.2."
"The prime source of external funding for Deutsche Post AG’s respective retirement benefit obligations is a contractual trust 
arrangement, which also includes a pension fund."
"The trust is funded on a case-by-case basis in line with the Group’s finance 
strategy."
"In the case of the pension fund, the regulatory funding requirements can, in principle, be met without additional employer 
contributions."
Part of the plan assets consists of real estate that is leased out to the Group on a long-term basis.
"In addition, 
Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bundespost (VAP – Deutsche Bundespost institution for supplementary retirement pensions), a 
shared pension fund for successor companies to Deutsche Bundespost, is used for some of the legacy pension commitments."
"Individual subsidiaries in Germany have defined-benefit retirement plans that were acquired in the context of acquisitions and 
transfers of operations and that are closed to new entrants."
"Contractual trust arrangements are in place for two subsidiaries for 
external funding."
"United Kingdom 
In the United Kingdom, the Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements are closed to new entrants and for further service 
accrual."
"The Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements in the United Kingdom have mainly been consolidated into a Group plan with 
different sections for the participating divisions."
These are funded mainly via a Group trust.
Normal contribution amounts no longer accrue because the arrangements have been closed.
"Other 
In the Netherlands, collective agreements require that those employees who are not covered by a sector-specific plan participate in 
a dedicated defined benefit retirement plan."
"The dedicated plan provides for annual accruals that are subject to a pensionable 
salary cap."
"The plan provides for monthly benefit payments that are indexed in line with inflation, on the one hand, and the funds 
available for such indexation, on the other."
"In Switzerland, employees receive an occupational pension in line with statutory 
requirements, where pension payments depend on the contributions paid, an interest rate that is fixed each year, certain annuity 
factors and any pension increases specified."
"A separate plan providing for lump-sum payments instead of lifelong pension 
payments exists for specific higher wage components."
"In the United States, the companies’ defined benefit retirement plans have 
been closed to new entrants and accrued entitlements have been frozen."
"The Group companies fund their dedicated defined benefit retirement plans in these three countries primarily by using respective 
joint funding institutions."
"In the Netherlands and in Switzerland, both employers and employees contribute to plan funding."
"In the 
United States, no regularly recurring contributions are currently made in this regard – with the exception of some limited employer 
deficit contributions that were resumed in the year under review."
"In the year under review, the remeasurements caused net pension provisions to rise."
"Total payments amounting to €304 million 
are expected with regard to net pension provisions in 2024."
"Of this amount, €233 million is attributable to the Group’s expected 
direct benefit payments and €71 million to expected employer contributions to pension funds."
"Additionally, rights to reimbursement from former Group companies existed in the Group in Germany in the amount of €9 million 
(previous year: €10 million), which had to be reported separately under financial assets."
"Corresponding benefit payments are being 
made directly by the former Group companies."

n.a."
"For 
other countries, the discount rate for defined benefit obligations was determined in a similar way, provided there was a deep 
market for AA-rated (or, in some cases, AA- and AAA-rated) corporate bonds."
"By contrast, government bond yields were used for 
countries without a deep market for such corporate bonds."
"For the annual pension increase in Germany, fixed rates in particular must be taken into account, in addition to the assumptions 
shown."
The effective weighted average therefore amounts to approximately 1.00% (previous year: 1.00%).
The most significant demographic assumptions made relate to life expectancy and/or mortality.
"For the Group companies in 
Germany, they are based on the HEUBECK-RICHTTAFELN 2018 G."
"Life expectancy for the retirement benefit plans in the United 
Kingdom was based mainly on the S3NMA_H/S3PFA_H tables of the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) of the Institute and 
Faculty of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect plan-specific mortality according to the latest funding valuation."
"Future mortality 
improvements were taken into account based on the current CMI projections model and an updated long-term trend assumption."
"For other countries, their own country-specific current standard mortality tables were used."
"0.91 
0.22 
rate of future salary development 
–0.50 
–0.08 
n.a."
"A one-year increase in life expectancy for a 65-year-old beneficiary would increase the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations by 4.16% in Germany (previous year: 3.95%) and by 2.31% in the United Kingdom (previous year: 3.19%)."
"The 
corresponding increase for other countries would be 2.78% (previous year: 2.75%) and the total increase would be 3.41% (previous 
year: 3.52%)."
"The presentation does not take into account interdependencies between the 
assumptions; rather, it supposes that the assumptions change in isolation."
"This would be unusual in practice, since assumptions are 
often correlated."
"The weighted average duration of the Group’s defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023, was 12.0 years in Germany 
(previous year: 9.8 years) and 12.1 years in the United Kingdom (previous year: 13.0 years)."
"In the other countries it was 15.1 years 
(previous year: 16.1 years), and in total it was 12.6 years (previous year: 11.8 years)."
"A total of 30.3% (previous year: 29.2%) of the present value of the defined benefit obligations was attributable to active 
beneficiaries, 19.5% (previous year: 19.3%) to formerly employed beneficiaries and 50.2% (previous year: 51.5%) to retirees."
Quoted market prices in an active market exist for around 60% (previous year: 58%) of the total fair values of plan assets.
"The majority of the investments on the active markets are globally diversified, with certain 
country-specific focus areas."
"Real estate included in plan assets in Germany with a fair value of €1,615 million (previous year: €1,689 million) is occupied by DHL 
Group."
"In the previous year, hedging measures resulted in a decrease in the proportion of equity and fixed-income holdings and an 
increase in the proportion of the cash holdings, particularly in Germany."
"Asset-liability studies are performed at regular intervals in Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as, among other places, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States, for the purpose of matching assets and liabilities; the strategic allocation of plan 
assets is adjusted accordingly."
"Strategic asset allocation for the respective plans is mainly carried out on the basis of the structure 
of the underlying obligations."
"As part of this, different strategies are pursued in some individual countries."
"These strategies include, 
among others, the comprehensive hedging of obligations (liability-driven investment) and securing future cash flows (cash-flow-
driven investment)."
"The common factor in the strategies is that they are determined in consideration of the respective regulatory 
framework and in consideration of return expectations and the risk-bearing ability of the company."
"Due to the plan-related 
derivation of the capital investment strategies in consideration of the specific economic parameters, there are significant 
differences in the alignment of the investments."
"ESG criteria are taken into account in the management of pension assets, in particular as part of risk management and thus as part 
of the long-term direction of the investment strategy."
"37.5 Risk 
Specific risks are associated with the defined benefit retirement plans."
"This can result in a (negative or positive) change in DHL 
Group’s equity through other comprehensive income, whose overall relevance is classed as medium to high."
"In contrast, a low 
relevance is attached to the short-term effects on staff costs and net finance costs."
"Potential risk mitigation is applied depending on 
the specifics of the plans."
"Interest rate risk 
A decrease (increase) in the respective discount rate would lead to an increase (decrease) in the present value of the total 
obligation and would in principle be accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the fixed income securities 
contained in the plan assets."
"Further hedging measures are applied, in some cases using derivatives."
"Inflation risk 
Pension obligations – especially relating to final salary schemes or schemes involving increases during the pension payment phase 
– can be linked directly or indirectly to changes in inflation."
"In addition, fixed rates of 
increase have been set and increases partially capped, and/or lump-sum payments have been provided for."
"There is also a positive 
correlation with interest rates."
"Investment risk 
The investment is in principle subject to a large number of risks; in particular, it is exposed to the risk that market prices may 
change."
This is managed primarily by ensuring broad diversification and the use of hedging instruments.
"Longevity risk 
Longevity risk may arise in connection with the benefits payable in the future due to a future increase in life expectancy."
"This is 
mitigated, in particular, by using current standard mortality tables when calculating the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations."
"The mortality tables used in Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, include an allowance for expected future 
increases in life expectancy."
"A total of €30 million was added 
for the active early retirement program in the Post & Parcel Germany division."
"The increase in other employee benefits results 
primarily from higher additions to the obligations for partial retirement and pension plans in the United States compared to the 
previous year."
"Technical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves, note 7."
The provision for aircraft maintenance relates to obligations for major aircraft and engine maintenance by third-party companies.
"Of the tax provisions, €67 million (previous year: €140 million) relates to VAT, €25 million (previous year: €31 million) to customs 
and duties and €71 million (previous year: €107 million) to other tax provisions."
Miscellaneous provisions include a large number of individual items.
"The risks from business activities relate primarily to provisions 
for guarantees and compensation payments to customers as well as provisions for losses from onerous contracts."
"In addition, 
miscellaneous provisions include the obligation to return the securities for CO2 emissions certificates in the amount of €70 million 
(previous year: €70 million)."
2 Explanations under note 41.
The amounts due to banks comprise mainly current overdraft facilities and long-term loans due to various banks.
"Other financial 
liabilities relate primarily to the obligation of €450 million for the repurchases still to be carried out from the fourth tranche of the 
share buyback program and the liability of €142 million for the acquisition of the remaining shares in the Monta Group."
"In addition, 
other financial liabilities include the balance sheet accounts reclassified from other liabilities, note 4."

"Possible future cash

certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated)."
"Leases that the Group has entered into as a lessee but that have not yet

contributed primarily to the increase in noncash income and expenses from €–31 million to €–336 million."
"Cash inflow from the 
change in working capital amounted to €536 million, an increase of €321 million compared with the prior year."
"In the previous year, this included, among other 
items, the net purchase price payment of €1,379 million for the acquisition of Hillebrand."

"The Group’s internal risk guidelines govern the universe of actions, responsibilities and necessary controls regarding the use of 
derivatives."
"Financial transactions are recorded, assessed and processed using proven risk management software, which also 
regularly documents the effectiveness of hedging relationships."
"Portfolios of derivatives are regularly reconciled with the banks 
concerned."
"To limit counterparty risk from financial transactions, the Group may only enter into this type of contract with prime-rated banks."
The conditions for the counterparty limits individually assigned to the banks are reviewed on a daily basis.
"The Group’s Board of 
Management is informed internally at regular intervals about existing financial risks and the hedging instruments deployed to 
mitigate them."
"Financial instruments are accounted for and measured and hedge accounting is carried out in accordance with 
IFRS 9."
"Disclosures regarding risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit retirement plans and their mitigation can be found in 
note 37.5."
"Liquidity management 
The ultimate objective of liquidity management is to secure the solvency of DHL Group and all Group companies."
"Consequently, 
liquidity in the Group is centralized as much as possible in cash pools and managed in the Corporate Center."
"The centrally available liquidity reserves (funding availability), consisting of central short-term financial investments and 
committed credit lines, are the key control parameter."
The target is to have at least €2 billion available in a central credit line.
"As of December 31, 2023, the Group had central liquidity reserves of €3.3 billion (previous year: €4 billion), consisting of central 
financial investments amounting to €1.3 billion plus a syndicated credit facility of €2 billion."
"2 Prior-year figures adjusted, note 4."
The following table shows the maturity structure of the derivative financial instruments based on their cash flows.
"For derivatives 
with gross settlement, the nominal values are shown and, for derivatives with net settlement, the market values on the reporting 
date are assumed for settlement at the time of final maturity."
"In the case of commodity swaps with continuous net settlement over 
their term, which are taken into account in the market value, the date of final maturity of the individual derivative is also taken as 
the basis."
"The resulting foreign exchange differences 
directly impact profit or loss."
"In order to mitigate this impact as far as possible, all significant on-balance-sheet currency risks 
within the Group are centralized in Deutsche Post AG’s in-house bank function."
"The centralized currency risks are aggregated by 
Corporate Treasury to calculate a net position per currency and hedged externally based on value-at-risk limits."
"The currency-
related value at risk (95%/one-month holding period) for the portfolio totaled €7 million (previous year: €6 million) as of the 
reporting date; the limit is currently a maximum of €5 million."
"The notional amount of the currency forwards and currency swaps 
used to manage on-balance-sheet currency risks amounted to €6,858 million as of the reporting date (previous year: 
€6,101 million); the fair value was €53 million (previous year: €–86 million)."
Hedge accounting was not applied.
"Derivatives are 
accounted for as trading derivatives (freestanding derivatives)."
"Currency risks arise from planned foreign-currency transactions if the future transactions are settled at exchange rates that differ 
from the originally projected rates."
These currency risks are also captured centrally in Corporate Treasury.
"Currency risks from 
planned future transactions are only hedged in selected cases."
"The relevant hedged items and derivatives used for hedging 
purposes are accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting, note 43.3."

DHL Group – 2023 Annual Report  
Currency risks also result from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations into the Group’s currency (translation risk)."
"No 
translation risks were hedged as of the reporting date."
"Currency forwards and currency swaps in a total notional amount of €7,073 million (previous year: €7,130 million) were 
outstanding as of the reporting date."
The corresponding fair value was €–40 million (previous year: €–55 million).
"IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of quantitative risk data, showing how profit or loss and equity are affected by changes in exchange 
rates as of the reporting date."
"The impact of these changes in exchange rates on the portfolio of foreign currency financial 
instruments is assessed by means of a value-at-risk calculation (95% confidence/one-month holding period)."
"It is assumed that the 
portfolio as of the reporting date is representative for the full year."
"The following assumptions are used as a basis for the sensitivity 
analysis: 
Primary financial instruments in foreign currencies used by Group companies are hedged by Deutsche Post AG’s in-house bank."
Deutsche Post AG determines monthly exchange rates and guarantees these to the Group companies.
"Exchange-rate-related 
changes therefore have no effect on the profit or loss and equity of the Group companies."
"Where Group companies are not 
permitted to participate in in-house banking for legal reasons, their currency risks from primary financial instruments are fully 
hedged locally through the use of derivatives."
They therefore have no impact on the Group’s risk position.
The following table presents currency-related effects on value at risk.
"The information is subject to the limitations of the model, 
which is based on historical volatilities and correlations and thus has limited informative value regarding actual future risks."
"Interest rate risk and interest rate management 
As of the reporting date, there were no outstanding interest rate hedging instruments."
"In the previous year, interest rate hedging 
instruments with a notional amount of €500 million and a fair value of €57 million were recognized, note 43.3."
"Primary variable-rate financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and must, therefore, be included in the sensitivity 
analysis."
All fixed-income financial instruments measured at amortized cost are not subject to interest rate risk.
"If the market 
interest rate level as of December 31, 2023, had been 100 basis points higher, the net financial result would have improved by 
€31 million (previous year: €32 million)."
A decline in interest rates by 100 basis points would have had the opposite effect.
"There 
was no interest rate risk with an impact on equity as of the reporting date."
"The proportion of financial liabilities with short-term interest lock-ins, note 39, amounts to 22% (previous year: 19%) of the total 
financial liabilities as of the reporting date."
"The effect of potential interest rate changes on the Group’s financial position remains 
insignificant."
"As the impact of the related fuel surcharges is delayed by one to two months, 
earnings may be affected temporarily if there are significant short-term fuel price variations."
"The remaining fuel price risk is partly hedged with swap transactions in the notional amount of €80 million (previous year: 
€1 million) and a fair value of €–4 million (previous year: €1 million) running until the end of 2025."
Commodity price risks also result from the ongoing purchase of natural gas and electricity.
"Swap transactions with a notional 
amount of €25 million (previous year: €24 million) were outstanding as of the reporting date."
"The corresponding fair value was  
€–14 million (previous year: €–9 million)."
"A 10% increase in the market prices of the commodities underlying the derivatives as of 
the reporting date would have increased fair values and equity by €9 million (previous year: €1 million)."
"A corresponding decline in 
commodity prices would have had the opposite effect."
The Group received share price options as part of the conclusion of contracts from operational and M&A transactions.
"As of the 
reporting date, share price options with a notional amount of €250 million (previous year: €252 million) and a term of two to six 
years were outstanding."
The corresponding fair value was €25 million (previous year: €33 million).
"A 10% increase in the share prices underlying the derivatives as of the reporting date would have increased fair values and the 
financial result by €7 million (previous year: €8 million)."
"A corresponding decrease in the share prices would have had an effect of 
€–6 million (previous year: €–7 million)."
"Credit risk 
Credit risk arises for the Group from operating activities and from financial transactions."
"The aggregate carrying amount of 
financial assets represents the maximum default risk."
"In an effort to minimize credit risk from operating activities and financial transactions, counterparties are assigned individual limits, 
the utilization of which is regularly monitored."
"The Group’s heterogeneous customer structure means that there is no risk 
concentration."
Financial transactions are only entered into with prime-rated counterparties.
The credit risk of financial assets arising from operations is managed by the divisions.
The expected credit loss associated with financial assets must be determined if they fall under the impairment model of IFRS 9.
"Based on the expected credit loss model (impairment model), a loss allowance must be anticipated for the expected credit loss, 
note 7."
"The following table documents the loss allowance for all debt instruments recognized at amortized cost, such as deposits, 
collateral provided and loans to third parties, and for lease receivables."
"This does not include trade receivables without a significant 
financing component and contract assets."
"All debt instruments and lease receivables were recognized in Stage 1 as of the reporting date; they were neither past due nor 
impaired."
"There were no indications as of the reporting date of any poor performance of the debt instruments and lease 
receivables."
There was no reclassification between the stages in the fiscal year.
"Trade receivables from customer relationships amounting to €10,537 million were due within one year as of the reporting date 
(previous year: €12,253 million)."
They are held primarily with the aim of collecting the principal amount of the receivables.
"These 
items are therefore assigned to the “held to collect contractual cash flows” business model and measured at amortized cost."

"In the 2023 fiscal year, there were factoring agreements in place that obliged the banks to purchase existing and future trade 
receivables."
"The banks’ purchase obligations were limited to a maximum portfolio of receivables of €241 million (previous year: 
€501 million)."
"DHL Group can decide at its discretion whether, and to what extent, the revolving notional volume is utilized."
"The 
risks relevant to the derecognition of the receivables include credit risk and the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk)."
Credit risk represents primarily all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the receivables.
"This risk is transferred in full 
to the bank against payment of a fixed fee for doubtful accounts."
A significant late-payment risk does not exist.
"All of the 
receivables were therefore derecognized."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the Group recognized program fees (interest, allowances for 
doubtful accounts) of €0.3 million (previous year: €0.5 million) as an expense."
"The notional volume of receivables factored as of 
December 31, 2023, amounted to €4 million (previous year: €15 million)."

Fair value hedges 
There were no fair value hedges as of December 31, 2023, as in the previous year."
"Cash flow hedges 
The Group uses currency forwards and currency swaps to hedge the cash flow risk from future foreign currency operating revenue 
and expenses."
"The notional amount of these currency forwards and currency swaps amounted to €215 million (previous year: 
€1,029 million) at a fair value of €13 million (previous year: €31 million)."
"The hedged items will have an impact on cash flow by 
2028."
"Of the unrealized gains or losses from currency derivatives recognized in equity as of December 31, 2023, €11 million (previous 
year: €20 million) is expected to be recognized in profit or loss in the course of the following year."
"An amount of €49 million is recognized in the hedge reserve from cash flow 
hedges that were reversed as part of the issue of the 2023/2033 bond."
"This amount is amortized over the originally hedged term 
until 2031 and reduces the future interest expense."
"Only the product price component of the energy price was designated as the hedged 
item."
"In the fiscal year under review, €0 million (previous year: €17 million) in realized effects from cash flow hedges for 
commodity price risks were recognized in material expense."
"The total gains and losses on open hedging instruments recognized in equity as of the reporting date amounted to €–5 million 
(previous year: €82 million)."
This is because the changes in the fair value of the hedged items and hedging transactions offset each other.
2 Balance sheet item: current/noncurrent financial liabilities (FVTPL).
"Net investment hedges 
Currency risks resulting from the translation of foreign operations were not hedged as of December 31, 2023."
"As of the reporting 
date, there was a positive amount of €16 million (previous year: €25 million) from terminated net investment hedges in the 
currency translation reserve."

2 The simplification option under IFRS 7.29a was exercised for the disclosure of certain fair values.
"If no fair value is available in an active market, quoted market prices for similar 
instruments or recognized valuation models are used to determine fair value."
"IFRS 13 requires financial assets to be assigned to the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy:  
Level 1 comprises equity and debt instruments measured at fair value and debt instruments measured at amortized cost whose fair 
values can be determined based on quoted market prices."
"In addition to financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, commodity, interest rate and currency derivatives 
are reported under Level 2."
"The fair values of assets measured at amortized cost are determined using the multiplier method, 
among other things."
"The fair values of the derivatives are measured on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows, taking 
into account forward rates for currencies, interest rates and commodities (market approach)."
"For this purpose, price quotations 
observable in the market (exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices) are imported from standard market information 
platforms into the treasury management system."
"The price quotations reflect actual transactions involving similar instruments on 
an active market."
All significant inputs used to measure derivatives are observable in the market.
"As of the reporting date, a call option and warrants are recognized under Level 3 that entitle the holder to acquire further shares in 
the company."
"The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined on the basis of the Black Scholes option pricing 
model."
"If possible, parameters observable on the market or derived from market data are used to determine the value."
"A volatility 
of 41% is taken into account for the call option and a volatility of 39% for the warrants."
"The volatilities are based on the volatilities of 
a comparable group of companies."
No major fluctuations in earnings are to be expected with regard to the call option in the future.
"Because the warrants are based on a listed underlying share, there could be earnings fluctuations in the subsequent years."
"The net gains and losses mainly include the effects of fair value measurement, impairment and disposals of financial instruments."
Dividends and interest are not taken into account for the financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
"Interest 
income and expenses and expenses from commission agreements relating to financial instruments measured at amortized cost are 
recognized separately in the income statement."
These contracts are subject to a standardized master agreement for financial derivative transactions.
"This agreement provides for a conditional right of offset, resulting in the recognition of the gross amount of the financial derivative 
transactions as of the reporting date."
The conditional right of offset is presented in the tables.
"Settlement processes arising from services related to postal deliveries are subject to the Universal Postal Convention and the 
Letter-mail INTERCONNECT Remuneration Agreement – Europe (LIRAE)."
"These agreements, particularly the settlement conditions, 
are binding on all public postal operators in respect of the specified contractual arrangements."
"Imports and exports between the 
parties to the agreement during a calendar year are summarized in an annual statement of account and presented on a net basis in 
the final annual statement."
"Receivables and payables covered by the Universal Postal Convention and the LIRAE are presented on a 
net basis as of the reporting date."
"In addition, funds are presented on a net basis if a right of offset exists in the normal course of 
business."
The tables show the receivables and payables before and after offsetting.
"44 Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations 
In addition to provisions and liabilities, the Group has contingent liabilities and other financial obligations."
"Other financial obligations such as the purchase obligation for investments in noncurrent assets amounted to €1,517 million 
(previous year: €2,668 million)."
"They relate primarily to the delivery of additional cargo aircraft as well as obligations from fleet 
management."
"The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of downstream 
access, has special supervisory powers to combat market abuse and guarantees the provision of universal postal services."
"This 
general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in the event of negative decisions."
"Revenue and earnings risk 
can arise from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail."
"The approval of the rates for individual pieces of letter mail for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued 
by the German federal network agency on April 29, 2022."
"An association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action 
with the Cologne Administrative Court against this price cap approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 
2024."
The proceedings are still pending.
"The aforementioned CEP association, as well as postal service providers and other 
customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the pricing approval granted as part of the 
price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021."
"This formal legal error was rectified by the German government through an amendment 
to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021."
"The Cologne Administrative Court denied the claims of some customers 
because they had expired."
"The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against 
the price cap approvals."
"The association’s additional application to be granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was 
denied by the Cologne Administrative Court."
"The association has filed an appeal to this ruling with the German Federal 
Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their claims with the Cologne 
Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending."
"The rulings of the Cologne 
Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the respective plaintiffs and have no 
legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers."
"One postal service provider, which had also filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne 
Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters 
delivered in 2017."
"The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful 
pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020."
"The action was denied by the Cologne 
District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021."
"The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this 
ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling."
"On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal 
against nonpermission with Germany’s Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed."
Possible negative effects on Deutsche Post of these court rulings and the proceedings underway cannot be ruled out.
"Since July 1, 2010, as a result of the revision of the relevant tax exemption provisions, the VAT exemption has only applied to those 
specific universal services in Germany that are not subject to individually negotiated agreements or provided on special terms 
(discounts, etc.)."
Deutsche Post AG and the tax authorities hold different opinions on the VAT treatment of certain products.
"In the 
interest of resolving these issues, proceedings have been initiated by Deutsche Post AG at the tax court with jurisdiction in this 
matter, note 44."
All assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis.
"The 
staff costs are recognized pro rata in profit or loss to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period 
(lockup period)."
"In the fiscal year, a total of €194 million (previous year: €140 million) was recognized for share-based payments, 
€86 million (previous year: €40 million) of which were cash-settled and €108 million (previous year: €100 million) of which were 
equity-settled."
"All 
Group executives can specify an increased equity component individually by converting a further portion of their variable 
remuneration for the fiscal year (investment shares)."
"After a four-year lockup period during which the executive must be employed 
by the Group, they again receive the same number of Deutsche Post AG shares (matching shares)."
"Assumptions are made regarding 
the conversion behavior of executives with respect to their relevant bonus portion."
"Share-based payment arrangements are 
entered into each year, with December 1 of the respective year and April 1 of the following year being the grant dates for each 
year’s tranche."
"Whereas deferred incentive shares and matching shares are classified as equity-settled share-based payments, 
investment shares are compound financial instruments and the debt and equity components must be measured separately."
"However, in accordance with IFRS 2.37, only the debt component is measured due to the provisions of the Share Matching Scheme."
The investment shares are therefore treated as cash-settled share-based payments.
"Of the expenses under the Share Matching Scheme, €63 million (previous year: €57 million) was attributable to equity-settled 
share-based payments."
"A total of €53 million related to cash-settled payments for investment shares (previous year: €64 million), 
all of which were unvested as of December 31, 2023."
Additional information on the granting and settlement of these rights can be found in note 33 and 34.

"The SARs granted can be fully or partly exercised after the expiration of a four-year lockup period at the earliest, provided absolute

earned each time the closing price of Deutsche Post shares exceeds the issue price by at least 10% 15% 20% or 25% at the end of 
the waiting period (absolute performance targets)."
"Both relative performance targets are tied to the performance of the shares in 
relation to the STOXX Europe 600 Index (SXXP; ISIN EU0009658202)."
"They are met if the share price equals the index 
performance or if it outperforms the index by more than 10%."
"Performance is determined by comparing the average price of 
Deutsche Post shares and the average index value during a reference and a performance period."
"The reference period comprises 
the last 20 consecutive trading days prior to the issue date."
"The performance period is the last 60 trading days before the end of the 
lockup period."
"The average (closing) price is calculated as the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares in Deutsche Börse AG’s 
Xetra trading system."
"If absolute or relative performance targets are not met by the end of the lockup period, the SARs attributable 
to them will expire without replacement or compensation."
"Each SAR exercised entitles the Board of Management member to 
receive a cash settlement equal to the difference between the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares for the five trading 
days preceding the exercise date and the exercise price of the SAR."

47.1 Related-party disclosures (companies and Federal Republic of Germany) 
All companies that are controlled by the Group or with which a joint arrangement exists, or over which the Group can exercise 
significant influence, are recorded in the list of shareholdings."
"Deutsche Post AG maintains a variety of relationships with the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Republic) and other 
companies controlled by the Federal Republic of Germany."
The Federal Republic is a customer of Deutsche Post AG and as such uses the company’s services.
"Deutsche Post AG has direct 
business relationships with the individual public authorities and other government agencies as independent individual customers."
The services provided for these customers are insignificant in respect of Deutsche Post AG’s overall revenue.
"Relationships with KfW  
KfW supports the Federal Republic in continuing to privatize companies such as Deutsche Post AG or Deutsche Telekom AG."
"In 
1997, KfW, together with the Federal Republic, developed a “placeholder model” as a tool to privatize government-owned 
companies."
"Under this model, the Federal Republic sells all or part of its investments to KfW with the aim of fully privatizing these 
state-owned companies."
"On this basis, KfW has purchased shares of Deutsche Post AG from the Federal Republic in several stages 
since 1997 and executed various capital market transactions using these shares."
"KfW’s interest in Deutsche Post AG’s share capital 
is 20.49% as of December 31, 2023."
Deutsche Post AG is thus considered to be an associate of the Federal Republic.
"Relationships with the Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation (BAnst PT) 
The Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation (BAnst PT) is a government agency and falls under the technical and legal 
supervision of the German Federal Ministry of Finance."
Tasks are performed on the basis of agency agreements.
"In 2023, Deutsche Post AG was invoiced for €91 
million (previous year: €85 million) in installment payments relating to services provided by the BAnst PT."
"Further disclosures on 
the PVK and the VAP can be found in note 7 and 37."

There were no reportable transactions or legal transactions involving these related parties in the 2023 fiscal year.
"In particular, the 
company granted no loans to these related parties."
"These salaries are determined at 
levels that are commensurate with the salary appropriate for the function or work performed in the company."
"Postemployment benefits are recognized as the service cost resulting from the pension provisions for active members of the Board 
of Management."
The corresponding liability amounted to €14 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €42 million).
"Starting in 2008, newly appointed Board of Management members began receiving a defined contribution pension commitment."
"This entails the company crediting an annual amount totaling 35% of each Board of Management member’s base salary to a virtual 
pension account."
This capital bears interest until eligibility to receive benefits begins.
"The pension benefit is paid out as capital in 
the amount of the accumulated pension balance."
"Pension eligibility is triggered at the earliest when retirement age is reached, in 
the event of invalidity during the term of office or upon death."

"51 Significant events after the reporting date and other disclosures 
On February 6, 2024, the KfW announced that it had sold 50 million shares from its holding in Deutsche Post AG by means of an 
accelerated bookbuild offering."
Placement of the shares was geared toward institutional investors.
"After the successful execution of the share placement, the total shareholding of KfW fell from 20.49% to 16.45%; the number of 
shares in free float increased accordingly."
"Following conclusion of the transaction, the KfW remains the largest shareholder in 
Deutsche Post AG."
"The intended uses 
remain unaffected, note 3."
"Beyond that, there were no reportable events after the reporting date."
"In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the Parent and the 
group of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"Moreover, we have not audited the content of those 
paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to the combined management report that are marked as unaudited in the combined 
management report."
"In all 
material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with 
German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion 
on the combined management report does not cover the content of the above-listed statements nor of the above-listed 
paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to combined management reports marked as unaudited."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with 
Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in 
compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der 
Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the 
International Standards on Auditing (ISA)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further 
described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined 
Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements 
of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit 
Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."
"These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a 
separate audit opinion on these matters."
"In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
2."
"Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets 
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: 
a) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) 
b) auditor’s response 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
a) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, goodwill amounting to EUR 13.1 billion is 
reported under the balance sheet item “Intangible assets”, representing about 20% of total assets and 57% of the Group’s reported 
equity."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company at least once a year for the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements regardless of whether there are external or internal indications that the assets may be impaired."
"The impairment test is 
based on a calculation model in which the planned future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital using a 
discounted cash flow method."
"The planned future cash flows are derived from the executive directors’ adopted middle-term 
planning and the supervisory board’s approved budget planning."
"The result of this measurement depends to a large extent on the assumptions made by the executive directors for the 
determination of future cash flows and the determination of the parameters for the discount rates used and is therefore subject to 
considerable uncertainty."
"Against this background and given the complexity of the underlying measurement models as well as the 
material importance of goodwill, this matter was of particular significance within the framework of our audit."
The executive directors’ disclosures on goodwill are contained in note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
"b) In our audit, we dealt with the process for performing goodwill impairment tests and obtained, among others, an understanding 
of the accounting controls that are included in the process and retraced the method applied to carry out the impairment tests."
"Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation tested."
"In the case of estimates made 
by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used."
"In addition, we retraced the calculation model and examined whether it considered all value-
determining parameters and whether all mathematical connections were correct."
Our audit procedures were supported by our internal valuation experts.
"Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets 
a) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, a total of EUR 2.5 billion is reported under 
the balance sheet item “Provisions for pensions and similar obligations”."
"Moreover, as a result of pension scheme surpluses in 
some defined benefit plans, pension assets of EUR 0.2 billion are reported under the balance sheet item “Other non-current assets” 
as at 31 December 2023."
"The net pension provisions of EUR 2.3 billion were calculated on the basis of the present value of the 
obligation of EUR 14.2 billion, less the plan assets of EUR 12.0 billion measured at fair value and an asset ceiling effect of EUR 
0.1 billion."
"In measuring pension provisions, the executive directors in particular made assumptions about the discount rate and 
long-term salary and pension trends as well as average life expectancy with the help of an external actuary."
"Changes in the 
measurement parameters and experience adjustments resulted in actuarial losses of EUR 0.7 billion as at 31 December 2023."
"In 
addition, measuring plan assets at fair value is subject to estimation uncertainties."
"Deviations from the planned development of the 
fair value of the plan assets resulted in losses of EUR 0.1 billion that are recognised directly in equity."
"In our view, these matters 
were of particular significance in our audit as the measurement of these high-value items is to a large extent based on estimates 
and discretionary assumptions made by the executive directors."
"The Company’s disclosures on pension provisions and similar obligations and on plan assets are contained in note 37 of the notes 
to the consolidated financial statements."
"b) We dealt with the process for measurement of pension provisions and plan assets, obtaining an understanding of the accounting 
controls included in the process."
"Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation 
tested."
"In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, 
assumptions made and data used."
"We had the appropriateness of the measurement parameters for pension provisions, including 
the related assumptions made, evaluated by means of expert opinions provided to us and a comparison with market-related data."
This audit procedure was carried out involving internal experts for pension valuations.
"Moreover, we satisfied ourselves as to the 
competence, capabilities and objectivity of the actuary engaged by the executive directors."
"Our examination of the fair values of 
plan assets was in particular based on bank confirmations and other asset statements and real estate appraisals."
"Our audit of the 
plan assets was supported by our internal valuation experts."

"Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other 
information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.
"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such 
internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e."
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In 
addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements and this combined management report."
We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as 
fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates 
made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."
"We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain solely responsible for our audit 
opinions."
"• 
perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management 
report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the 
executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective 
information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the 
assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance 
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe 
these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibilities in this context are further described in 
the “Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm has applied the requirements of 
the IDW Quality Management Standards."
"1 HGB and 
for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial 
reporting process."
"Group Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or 
unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit."
"• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of 
these controls."
"• 
evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the 
requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical 
specification for this electronic file."
"• 
evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated 
financial statements and to the audited combined management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation 
We were elected as Group auditor by the annual general meeting on 6 May 2022."
"We were engaged by the supervisory board on 
28 April / 4 May 2023."
"We have been the Group auditor of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, since the financial year 2023."
"We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the additional report to the audit 
committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report)."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely 
together with the audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form."
"German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement 
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Prof. Dr Frank Beine."
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key 
ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement."
"These responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of appropriate methods to 
prepare the combined nonfinancial statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are 
reasonable under the given circumstances."
"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have 
determined necessary to enable the preparation of a combined nonfinancial statement that is free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to 
considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, the 
executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder 
in the section “EU Taxonomy” of the combined nonfinancial statement."
"They are responsible for the defensibility of this 
interpretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the 
interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"The preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the combined nonfinancial statement, which include the indicators, 
is subject to inherent existing limitations associated with the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as 
assumptions made."
"Our audit firm applies the IDW Quality Assurance Standard issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Quality 
Assurance Requirements in Audit Practices (IDW QS 1)."
"We have complied with the German Public Auditor Act (WPO) and the 
Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP), including the requirements on 
independence."
"We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB."
"The choice of assurance work 
is subject to the practitioner’s professional judgement."
"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to 
interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal 
conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"In particular, 
these uncertainties also relate to quantifying performance indicators when they are measured or evaluated."
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key 
ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement."
