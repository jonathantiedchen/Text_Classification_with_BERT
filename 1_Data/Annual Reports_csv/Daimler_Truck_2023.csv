Basics of reporting

the Daimler Truck Group due to their integral importance."
"The combined management report summarizes the management 
reports of Daimler Truck Holding AG for the annual financial state-
ments and the consolidated financial statements."
"Information regar-
ding the annual financial statements of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
under commercial law is contained in the separate chapter 
E Daimler Truck Holding AG of the combined management report."
"Structure and segments of the Daimler Truck Group
From a business perspective, a distinction is made at selected points 
between Industrial Business and Financial Services."
"The Industrial 
Business comprises the vehicle segments Trucks North America, 
Mercedes-Benz, Trucks Asia, Daimler Buses and the reconciliation."
Financial Services corresponds to the Financial Services segment.
"The 
eliminations of intra-Group transactions between the Industrial Busi-
ness and Financial Services are generally allocated to the Industrial 
Business and are reported in the reconciliation."
"The content of the section E Sustainability at Daimler Truck was not 
submitted to an audit in the context of the statutory audit of our com-
bined management report."
"Our auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprü-
fungsgesellschaft, has nevertheless conducted an independent assu-
rance engagement on the Non-Financial Statement of the Group, 
contained in this section, to obtain limited assurance."

"And by that, I don’t mean 
Daimler Truck and the commercial vehicle industry, but rather the ongoing war in Ukraine, the terror against 
Israel, and rising populism, which poses a dangerous threat and truly tests our democracy."
"These are just examples of the serious events that concern us in Germany, in Europe and the world, and that 
demand our attention and willingness to act."
"Given these multitude of challenges, there’s a danger of losing sight of the global priority of our times: miti-
gating climate change."
"I therefore want to appeal very clearly at this point: We have absolutely no time to 
lose and must act consistently – in society, in politics, and certainly in business."
"At Daimler Truck, that’s precisely what we’re doing."
"We’ve aligned our strategy to lead the sustainable, emis-
sion-free transport of the future."
"And we’re diligently executing this strategy – step by step, or rather: truck 
by truck and bus by bus."
The foundation for this lies in strong profitability.
"Only with corresponding financial strength can we shape 
the decarbonization of truck and bus transport as leaders."

We don’t merely perceive the 
transformation as a challenge."
"Above all, we see it as an 
opportunity."
"«
Daimler Truck is making great progress here: In 2023, we achieved an operating profit of 5.5 billion euros 
and an adjusted return on sales in the Industrial Business of 9.9 percent."
"Each and every one of our more than 100,000 employ-
ees has contributed to this."
"This brings us very close to our ambition for 2025 of achieving an adjusted return on sales of more than ten 
percent in the Industrial Business in a favorable market environment."
And we aim to push further.
"Having 
established a solid foundation for profitability, we’re shifting gears towards growth."
"Towards profitable 
growth: Between 2025 and 2030, we intend to increase our revenue by 40 to 60 percent – and by 2030, in a 
favorable market environment, the adjusted return on sales in our Industrial Business should exceed twelve 
percent."
"This has a considerable impact because when both revenue and return on sales increase, the oper-
ating profit increases significantly."
Our ambitions show that we see the historic transformation of our industry as more than just a challenge.
"Above all, we see it as an opportunity."
"It’s an opportunity for our environment, for our customers, for our 
Company, and for our investors – and we’re determined to seize this opportunity."
"Through five figures, I’d like to shed light on Daimler Truck’s transformation."
"10 emission-free production models
In 2017, we introduced our first battery-electric truck to the market."
"Today, we offer ten emission-free 
trucks and buses to our customers as production models – in an increasing variety and across all regions: in 
North and South America as well as in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region."
"So far, our emission-free vehicles are designed for urban and regional transport."
"Since battery technology 
and charging infrastructures are still evolving, this is the first sensible step."
"The next significant leap is 
planned for this year with the market launch of our Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 designed for long-haul 
transport with a range of 500 kilometers."
"1,047 kilometers
Our fuel cell truck, the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck, covered more than 1,000 kilometers in fall 2023 – fully 
loaded at 40 tonnes, under real conditions and with just one tank filling."
"To be more precise: with just 80 
kilograms of liquid hydrogen."
"This demonstrates the performance capability of this propulsion technology, 
particularly in flexible, demanding long-distance transport."
"We are therefore advocating at all levels to ensure that the development of a hydrogen-based fueling infra-
structure occurs in parallel with the charging infrastructure for battery-electric trucks and buses."
"We’re 
actively advancing this with groundbreaking projects, such as our Greenlane joint venture in the USA."
"Or 
with the Memorandum of Understanding we signed with Masdar, the clean energy pioneer of the United 
Arab Emirates, in January 2024 to assess liquid green hydrogen exports from Abu Dhabi to Europe."
"The toll is now based on CO2, resulting in significantly higher tolls for diesel trucks compared to 
emission-free trucks."
This is a crucial step towards sustainable transportation.
"Because our customers can only purchase emis-
sion-free trucks if these vehicles are competitive with diesel trucks."
"Despite all manufacturer efforts, emis-
sion-free trucks remain notably more expensive than conventional ones, at least in terms of acquisition 
cost."
"It’s crucial, therefore, for policymakers to effectively price CO2, making the use of diesel trucks more 
expensive and ensuring the competitiveness of emission-free trucks."
"This is precisely what the CO2-based 
toll accomplishes, which we see as a blueprint for all of Europe."
"For this push towards emission-free transport to truly work and make sense, one thing is crucial: a signifi-
cant portion of the additional toll revenues must be invested in establishing charging and fueling infrastruc-
ture for emission-free vehicles."
"Rapid implementation of fast-charging stations and a hydrogen network is 
imperative."
We therefore advocate that 20 percent of the additional revenues be invested for this purpose.
"Yes, the new toll means transportation costs will rise, and we’re aware that increased costs are never easy."
"But this is unavoidable, and we all must adapt."
"Sustainability comes with a price – and a clean, better world 
must be worth this price to us."
"160 countries
That’s how many nations we reach around the world with our brands."
"This showcases the robust position we 
hold at Daimler Truck – not just in Germany and Europe but globally."
"Our customers rely on our products 
and services – and they trust our expertise, especially in the midst of this transformation."
"We are the voice 
of our industry."
We are determined to further increase the value of our Company.
"I have outlined in this letter how we intend 
to achieve this and what potential we see here."
"You will find much more information on this in the following 
chapters of our Annual Report."
"How important it is to us that you as shareholders participate in the positive 
development of Daimler Truck is demonstrated not only by our dividend policy, but also, for example, by our 
share buyback program, which we launched in 2023."
"And even if external factors outside our sphere of influence may temporarily affect the share price - I am 
thinking here, for example, of the geopolitical environment -, I am fully convinced that Daimler Truck’s best 
years are yet to come."
"Leinfelden-Echterdingen, February 2024
Sincerely yours,
Martin Daum
Chairman of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG
€37.46
This was the closing price of our shares at the editorial deadline for this text on February 28, 2024."
"This 
means that since our IPO on December 10, 2021 at a price of €28.00 per share, we have significantly 
increased the value of our Company."
"2	 
Interim takeover of the area of responsibility of Finance and Controlling by Martin Daum after the death of Jochen Goetz on August 05, 2023."
"In January 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Eva Scherer as a Member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance and Controlling, effective April 01, 2024."
"Nat-
urally, the further improvement of the Company’s economic develop-
ment and direction within the transformation of the commercial vehi-
cle industry was of central importance in the past financial year."
"As 
one of the world’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturers, Daimler 
Truck also assumed an important position here and was able to 
achieve some significant milestones in this regard in 2023."
"This 
includes, in particular, product launches in the area of emission-free 
transport."
"In its operating business, Daimler Truck was able to signifi-
cantly improve both growth and earnings and exceed the targets set 
for the 2023 financial year."
"Also, regarding the Company’s strategic 
direction, the planned merger of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corpo-
ration with Hino Motors is a further development."
"Nevertheless, the 2023 financial year with its successes was also 
clouded by the tragic death of our Chief Financial Officer Jochen 
Goetz."
"The human and professional loss was received with a great deal 
of sympathy."
"His contribution to the Company’s success was also his 
lifetime achievement."
"The Supervisory Board would like to thank him 
on behalf of the shareholders, the employees and all those to whom 
he provided advice and support."
"The achievements in the 2023 financial year have shown that many 
things are going well and that great things are possible."
"The develop-
ment of the markets and the earnings that can be achieved in them 
demonstrate the great potential that the Company can still tap into."
"The great commitment of all employees, managers and the Board of 
Management was guarantee for success, has made this possible and 
gives us good reasons to continue to look confidently into the future."
"In the following, we report on the work of the Supervisory Board and 
its committees in the 2023 financial year."
"Responsibilities and working methods of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG fully performed its 
duties in the 2023 financial year."
"Its responsibilities are defined in par-
ticular by the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz or AktG), 
the Articles of Association of Daimler Truck Holding AG, as well as the 
Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board and its committees."
"In 
addition, the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) in its cur-
rently valid version represents an important set of rules, which the 
Supervisory Board naturally attaches great importance to observing 
as far as possible."
"This applied particularly to the 
active dialogue on the evaluation of the financial performance com-
pared to the own targets as well as benchmarked to competition and 
regarding success-critical topics of the transformation of the commer-
cial vehicle industry like Autonomous driving."
"These business transactions arose in many cases from the strategic 
direction of Daimler Truck as part of the advancing transformation of 
the commercial vehicle industry and included product projects, sustain-
ability issues as well as financial and investment projects and plans."
"The Board 
of Management’s reports also contained developments in the procure-
ment and sales markets."
"Additionally, and in the course of strategy 
discussions with the Board of Management, transformation and sus-
tainability issues within the commercial vehicle industry as well as 
their potential technological, financial and economic impacts on the 
Company were discussed."
"The members of the Supervisory Board prepared for the meetings on 
the basis of documents that were made available to them by the Com-
pany before the meetings."
"The preparation for the meetings also 
included separate preliminary discussions on the part of shareholder 
and employee representatives, some of which were attended by mem-
bers of the Board of Management."
"The committees of the Supervisory 
Board intensively prepared the meetings of the Supervisory Board in 
accordance with their respective responsibilities."
"In particular, Joe 
Kaeser as Chairman of the Supervisory Board as well as Michael Bros-
nan as Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly attended bilateral 
meetings with members of the Board of Management and the manage-
ment of the Company to exchange views."
"This included regular meet-
ings with the Chief Legal and Compliance Officer and the Head of Cor-
porate Audit."
"The other members of the Supervisory Board made use 
of this on a topic-related basis."
"Topics in the 2023 Financial Year
In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck 
Holding AG held nine meetings and passed two resolutions via written 
procedure."
"More detailed information on the meeting arrangements 
and the attendance of the members can be found in the overview at 
the end of this report."
"ä A.01 ä A.02 ä A.03
The meetings of the Supervisory Board were characterized by an open 
and constructive exchange."
"In addition to the intensive discussion of 
the relevant business transactions and measures, the Supervisory Board 
also focused on exchanging views on the most important topics of its 
work in the absence of the Board of Management in regular Executive 
Sessions."
"The topics discussed therein included succession planning as 
well as the assessments of important strategic and organizational topics."
"The Supervisory Board also focused on the discussion 
of significant sustainability issues and dealt in depth with human rights 
important to Daimler Truck."
"At the meeting on May 8, 2023, the strategic direction of the Company 
and the financial direction of Daimler Truck were the most important 
focus areas."
"This served in particular to prepare for the Capital Market 
Day, that was held on July 11, 2023, in Boston, USA."
"The Supervisory 
Board also dealt with the interim report for the first quarter of 2023 for 
information purposes, received a corresponding financial update and 
discussed a product development project in the field of zero-emission 
vehicles and, in particular, the development of autonomous trucks."
"At an extraordinary meeting of the Supervisory Board on May 26, 
2023, the Supervisory Board discussed in detail the planned merger of 
the Group subsidiary Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation with 
Hino Motors, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation."
"In this regard, 
the Supervisory Board was comprehensively informed by the Board of 
Management about the planning and legal and strategic implications 
and granted its approval after an in-depth discussion of the realization 
of the project."
"The Supervisory Board used its meeting after the Annual General 
Meeting on June 21, 2023 for a thorough debriefing of the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting, especially for an assessment of the shareholder’s feed-
back."
"In addition, after preparation by the Presidential and Remunera-
tion Committee, the Supervisory Board dealt with Board of 
Management service contracts and approved the appointment of Dr. 
Florian Hofer to the position of Chief Legal and Compliance Officer."
"At a further extraordinary meeting on July 10, 2023, the Supervisory 
Board discussed a share buy-back program with the Board of Manage-
ment, for the implementation of which the Annual General Meeting of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG had already authorized the Board of Man-
agement in 2021."
"Following a thorough examination of the respective 
planning by the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board 
approved the implementation of the share buy-back program."
"In addition to the informative review of the interim report for the first 
half of 2023, the meeting on August 1, 2023, focused on business 
transactions from the operational area and strategic measures."
"In 
addition, the Supervisory Board dealt in-depth with the effects of cli-
mate change on the commercial vehicle industry and also obtained 
information from external experts."
"At its meeting on November 6, 2023, the Supervisory Board dealt with 
the results of the Supervisory Board’s self-assessment carried out for 
the first time in the financial year 2023."
"This report also includes sepa-
rate explanations on this."
"The Supervisory Board also discussed the 
interim report for the third quarter of 2023 and reviewed the informa-
tion provided by the Board of Management regarding ongoing projects 
and existing participations."
"The 
Supervisory Board also exchanged views with the Chief Legal and 
Compliance Officer of the Company on these topics in particular."
"At its meeting on December 8, 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed 
corporate governance issues and, in particular, dealt with the draft 
declaration of compliance for 2023."
"In this context, the Supervisory Board also discussed the implementa-
tion of important recommendations of the DCGK and, in particular, the 
independence of shareholder representatives within the meaning of 
the DCGK."
"The 2023 Declaration of Compliance with the DCGK in accordance 
with Section 161 of the AktG was also adopted on December 8, 2023."
"With the exceptions justified therein, all recommendations of the Code 
are complied with."
"In the interests of good corporate governance, the 
members of the Company’s Supervisory Board are obliged to disclose 
conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"Such con-
flicts of interest may arise in particular from an advisory or governing 
body function with customers, suppliers or lenders of the Company or 
other third parties."
"There were no such conflicts of interest during the 
reporting period."
"Against the background of one year’s work experience with the Rules 
of Procedure amended in the light of the 2022 amended DCGK, the 
Supervisory Board decided to make only specific adjustments to the 
Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board and its committees."
"At its 
meeting on December 8, 2023, the Supervisory Board adopted these 
adjustments."
"In particular, they take into account the increased focus 
of the supervisory and advisory role of the Supervisory Board with 
regard to sustainability issues in corporate governance."
"The continua-
tion of responsibility for this extremely important issue was particularly 
important for the Supervisory Board."
"After extensive consultation and 
in-depth preparation by the Presidential and Remuneration Committee, 
the Supervisory Board has decided to keep and handle the primary 
responsibility for monitoring and advising on sustainability issues and 
not to delegate this to a separate committee."
"This is due to the central 
importance of sustainability for Daimler Truck as well as to the great 
complexity of this topic, which requires the use of all the sustainability 
expertise widely distributed within the Supervisory Board."
"The afore-
mentioned expertise is to be kept up to date through regular training."
"At the Supervisory Board meeting on December 8, 2023, the Supervi-
sory Board also discussed the requirements profiles for the Board of 
Management and the Supervisory Board."
"The composition of the 
Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding 
AG is based in particular on diversity concepts relating to aspects 
such as educational and professional background, gender and age."
"In addition, the 
Supervisory Board resolved to include further requirements in respect 
of the knowledge and experience of the Supervisory Board members 
in the overall requirements profile following the positive experiences 
with the sustainability expertise requirements introduced in 2022."
"In the course of the same 
meeting, the Supervisory Board determined the fulfillment of the 
requirements profile adapted in November 2022 and applicable in the 
entire reporting period regarding the current composition of the Board 
of Management."
"According to Section 96 Subsection 2 AktG, the supervisory boards of 
listed companies subject to joint co-determination must consist of at 
least 30% women and 30% men."
"This quota must be met by the Super-
visory Board as a whole."
"As the overall fulfillment was not objected to, the gen-
der quota must be met by the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"On December 31, 2023, the Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG consisted of six women (of these, three were on the share-
holder side and three on the employee side) and fourteen men (of 
these, seven were on the shareholder side and seven on the employee 
side)."
"However, without prejudice to the overall fulfillment, the share-
holder and employee sides also fulfilled the minimum requirement for 
their respective sides throughout the 2023 financial year."
"Remuneration of the Board of Management
The remuneration system for the members of the Board of Manage-
ment applicable in financial year 2023 (Remuneration System 2023+) 
was determined by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on Decem-
ber 15, 2022 and specified in more detail in February 2023."
"On this 
basis, the Supervisory Board set the targets for the 2023 financial year 
at its meeting on March 9, 2023, upon recommendation of the Presi-
dential and Remuneration Committee."
"The Supervisory Board also 
determined the target achievement for the 2022 financial year."
"The 
Remuneration System 2023+ was subsequently submitted to the 
Annual General Meeting of Daimler Truck Holding AG on June 21, 2023 
in accordance with Section 120a Subsection 1 AktG for approval."
"Approval was given at the Annual General Meeting by a large majority 
of 96.62% votes in favor."
"Further details can be taken from the 
description of the Remuneration System published on the Company’s 
website at w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/corporate-gover-
nance/board-of-management/remuneration-of-the-board-of-manage-
ment."
"Supervisory Board Strategy Days
On October 4 and 5, 2023, the Supervisory Board held the second 
Strategy Days of Daimler Truck Holding AG after the formation of the 
Daimler Truck Group in Wörth in one of the world’s largest truck 
plants."
"As part of this event, the Supervisory Board dealt extensively 
with the strategic direction of the Daimler Truck Group, including the 
sustainable business strategy."
"Another particular focus was on sustainability topics and the nec-
essary technology transformation, in which the Supervisory Board 
dealt in depth with strategic planning in the area of battery-electric 
and hydrogen-powered transport."
"In addition to the in-depth discus-
sion of strategic topics and their impacts, the Supervisory Board also 
used the Strategy Days to deal with production issues in the frame-
work of production tours and to test current and upcoming products."
"Self-assessment of the Supervisory Board
In line with the corresponding recommendation of the DCGK, the Super-
visory Board carried out a self-assessment supported by external con-
sultants in the 2023 financial year."
"The purpose of this measure was to 
assess how effectively the Supervisory Board and its committees fulfil 
their respective tasks."
"The self-assessment was conducted as a very 
comprehensive measure in view of the first time this process was car-
ried out and its importance."
"It consisted of a multi-stage process, 
including bilateral interviews and meeting observation, and involved all 
members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management as 
well as representatives of the Supervisory Board office."
"Focus topics 
included the assessment of the supervisory and advisory activities of 
the Supervisory Board, its cooperation as well as the provision of infor-
mation by the Board of Management as well as issues of corporate gov-
ernance and the work of the committees."
"This also included an in-depth examina-
tion of the implementation of the insights for the further development of 
the work of the Supervisory Board at Daimler Truck."
"Another self-
assessment is planned for the 2025 financial year."
"Discussion and resolution on corporate planning (Daimler Truck 
Business Planning)
At its meeting on December 8, 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed 
and approved the Daimler Truck Business Planning."
"In this regard, the 
Supervisory Board was provided with the respective documents that 
also highlighted sustainability-related aspects in the corporate planning."
"Regarding the target setting for the future planning, the Supervisory 
Board put special emphasis on the inclusion of external comparisons 
with leading competitors."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board dealt with 
the framework for liquidity risk steering developed by the Company."
"Composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees
The Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG consists of twenty 
members."
"In accordance with the provisions of the German Co-Deter-
mination Act, it must be composed of ten employee representatives 
and ten shareholder representatives."
"According to this, the Supervisory Board is equally 
composed."
"The Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG has 
established and appointed a Presidential and Remuneration Commit-
tee, an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee and a Mediation 
Committee in accordance with the relevant provisions of the German 
Co-Determination Act."
"Additionally, the Supervisory Board 
elected Marie Wieck and Roman Zitzelsberger as members of the 
Presidential and Remuneration Committee."
"Audit Committee
Michael Brosnan, Akihiro Eto, Harald Wilhelm, Michael Brecht, Jörg 
Köhlinger and Thomas Zwick were elected to the Audit Committee in  
2022."
"The Audit Committee elected Michael Brosnan as its Chairman 
and Michael Brecht was elected Deputy Chairman."
"Nomination Committee
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Joe Kaeser also chairs the 
Nomination Committee as Chairman of the Supervisory Board."
"Mediation Committee
In 2022, the Supervisory Board set up a Mediation Committee for the 
first time and elected Marie Wieck and Roman Zitzelsberger as further 
members of the Mediation Committee."
"In accordance with the Rules of 
Procedure, Joe Kaeser also chairs the Mediation Committee as Chair-
man of the Supervisory Board and Michael Brecht as Deputy Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board is also Deputy Chairman of the Committee."
"Changes to the Board of Management and  
the  Supervisory Board
There was only one change to the composition of the Supervisory 
Board in the 2023 financial year."
"With effect from October 15, 2023, 
Raymond Curry resigned from his mandate as a member of the Super-
visory Board for personal reasons."

Trucks and buses are the backbone of our 
economy and society."
"The world stands still 
without them."
"At Daimler Truck, we like to 
say with conviction and pride: “We work for 
all who keep the world moving” – for the 
haulers who transport goods from ports 
around the world to supermarkets, construc-
tion sites and hospitals."
"For transport pro-
viders who bring people to work, school or 
on holiday."
"For the public services that keep 
our streets and cities clean, and for many 
more."
"We work for all who keep the world 
moving – this is our purpose and motivates 
us every single day."
"Our brands are firmly established in many regions of the 
world."
"With our Financial Services segment, we offer our customers a 
complete package of vehicles, financing and leasing products and 
other services."
In 2023 we focused on implementing our refined corporate strategy.
"Through suitable strategic projects and initiatives, such as our partner-
ship for the production of battery cells, we underpin our ambition to 
lead the transformation of our industry."
"At the same time, we want to operate profitably and grow steadily."
"In 
this context, we have set ourselves clear goals: sales growth for the 
Group of 40 to 60% in the period from 2025 to 2030 as well as an 
adjusted return on sales for the Industrial Business of more than 10% 
in 2025 and more than 12% in 2030 under sunny macroeconomic con-
ditions."
"Our financial ambitions are primarily driven by zero-emission 
vehicles, autonomous driving, active portfolio management and an 
increase in service revenue."
"Lead Transformation and Lead Profitability - both are key to delivering 
on our promise to society, our customers and shareholders."
"How we achieve our long-term goals: Our strategy
In order to achieve our long-term objectives, we focus on three strate-
gic levers:
1."
"Lead Technology Transformation – We drive ZEV
We want to live up to our commitment to enable CO₂-neutral 
transport on the roads by 2050."
"Among other things, we will 
be offering battery-electric and hydrogen-powered trucks 
and buses that are CO₂-neutral in terms of “tank-to-wheel” 
emissions."
"We are also focusing on digitalization in vehicles and the 
backend, as well as automating transportation."
"Focus on Core – We focus on core business and leverage  
globally
We must prioritize in which areas we will focus our engineer-
ing capabilities and investments."
"A decisive criterion is which 
current or new technologies, products and services meet the 
requirements and wishes of our customers and society in the 
long-term."
"We want to combine our activities in order to be 
even stronger in the future."
"Lead Service Transformation – We drive superior services
We are promoting the transformation to a service offering 
that provides a state-of-the-art physical and digital service 
ecosystem to best support our customers’ businesses."
"The 
transformation to emission-free vehicles enables additional 
growth and business opportunities."
"We are working on these prerequisites
We join forces
Partnerships help us accelerate change even further."
"With the right 
partners, we can reduce our own investment requirements, gain 
access to important expertise, achieve economies of scale more 
quickly and offer our customers a comprehensive service portfolio."
"We inspire
Our employees are fundamental to our progress and success."
"In order 
to continue attracting top talent to Daimler Truck in future, we will con-
tinue to work tirelessly on nurturing an attractive working environ-
ment, corporate culture and the professional and personal develop-
ment of our global team."
"We deliver
In times of massive transformation in our industry, efficient use of 
resources is essential."
"We will continue to focus on a lean and agile 
organization with highly efficient structures and processes."
"The Freightliner eM2 was 
added to the growing CO₂-neutral product lineup going into series pro-
duction in Q4 of 2023."
"Trucks North America is working with various 
partners to promote the expansion of charging and refueling infra-
structure for battery-electric and hydrogen-powered commercial vehi-
cles in the United States."
"In the field of battery technology Daimler 
Trucks & Buses US Holding LLC, Accelera by Cummins and PACCAR 
are collaborating with technology partner EVE Energy to accelerate 
and localize battery cell production and the battery supply chain in the 
United States."
"At the same time, Trucks North America is continuing to 
work with technology partners in the field of autonomous driving to 
bring a self-driving Freightliner Cascadia series production truck (SAE 
Level 4) onto the road by the end of the decade."
"Mercedes-Benz is accelerating the decarbonization of transport: The 
series models of the eActros 300/400 and the eEconic are already 
being delivered to customers in Europe."
"The heavy battery-electric 
long-distance truck eActros 600 was presented to the public for the 
first time in 2023 and is scheduled to go into series production at the 
end of 2024."
"At the same time, the development of the fuel cell truck 
GenH2 Truck is underway, and the aim is for it to be ready for series 
production in the second half of the decade."
"Mercedes-Benz is work-
ing with various partners to advance the development of charging and 
refueling infrastructure for battery-electric and hydrogen-powered 
vehicles in Europe."
"Trucks Asia is driving CO₂-neutral transport forward with its FUSO 
brand and the fully electric Next Generation eCanter."
"In addition to 
Europe, Japan and Australia, the new model is being introduced to 
Asian markets such as Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Singapore."
"The pro-
duction site in Japan also began the export of electric trucks to the 
United States for the new RIZON brand."
"The RIZON trucks have 
received certification from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) 
and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)."
"Trucks Asia also aims 
to expand its position in China, the world’s single largest market for 
heavy-duty commercial vehicles."
"The production of heavy-duty 
Mercedes-Benz semi-trailer tractors, which launched in China in 2022 
as part of the joint venture with Foton -- Beijing Foton Daimler Auto-
motive Co., Ltd."
"(BFDA), also contributed to this."
"In India, Daimler 
Truck’s heavy-duty vehicles are similarly in high demand."
"There the 
BharatBenz brand is capitalizing on the rapid infrastructure growth of 
the country, expanding the dealership network to more than 330 sales 
and service locations nationwide in 2023."
"Daimler Buses drives CO₂-neutral passenger transport in the bus 
industry."
"To this end, the segment has a clear e-roadmap for the elec-
trification of its vehicles across all vehicle segments."
"In line with the 
overarching dual-track strategy of the Daimler Truck Group, Daimler 
Buses is relying on both battery-electric and hydrogen-based technol-
ogies and wants to offer locally CO₂-neutral models in every segment 
by 2030."
"The initial focus is on the core markets of Europe and Latin 
America."
"By 2039, only new vehicles will be sold in the core market of 
Europe that are CO₂-neutral in operation."
"In the city bus segment in 
Europe, this should be the case from 2030."
"In addition, Daimler Buses 
supports transport companies in switching to electrically powered 
buses: The wholly owned subsidiary Daimler Buses Solutions GmbH is 
entirely specialized in the design and development of e-infrastructure 
for buses."
"The segment is also focusing on growth in profitable mar-
kets and is tapping into the North American market with a coach tai-
lored to local needs, the Mercedes-Benz Tourrider."
"Financial Services aims to make a significant contribution to Daimler 
Truck’s service growth."
"The segment plans to increase its share of the 
core business of leasing and financing to around 30% of all trucks and 
buses sold by Daimler Truck in the medium term."
"Financial Services 
has also started a project to open up new markets in Eastern Europe."
"Financial Services also supports customers on their way to sustain-
able transport solutions with new products and services."
Sustainability is an important part of our long-term objectives.
"Sus-
tainability means much more than CO₂-neutral products."
"We take 
responsibility for the environment and society and pursue sustainable 
corporate governance."
"We focus on where we can contribute to a 
more liveable world."
"First and foremost, we start with our production 
facilities - all our European plants have a CO₂-neutral balance sheet 
since 2022."
"For our production facilities in India and in the United 
States, this step is planned by 2025."
"By 2039, we aim to have CO₂-
neutral production at all our plants worldwide."
"We employ more than 100,000 people worldwide."
"They are our most 
important asset - and we take various measures to ensure that they 
feel comfortable at work, can develop their potential and maintain 
their mental and physical well-being."
"We are also committed to respecting and upholding human rights 
throughout our entire value chain."
"We expect all our suppliers to act in 
accordance with international social standards and legal environmen-
tal protection requirements."
"We oblige our direct suppliers to imple-
ment essential and recognized sustainability standards."
"The safety of the drivers of our trucks and buses, as well as of all other 
road users, is our top priority and a central aspect of our vehicle devel-
opment."
"Sustainable action is also reflected in our social commitment 
to the regions and communities in which we are rooted."
We want sustainable success for our Company.
"This means we want to 
offer the best products for our customers - and an attractive invest-
ment for our shareholders."
"For our employees, we create sustainable 
jobs and an attractive working environment."
"For society, we uphold 
our responsibilities as a reliable industry partner."
"Only by acting sustainably, can we achieve long-term success."

that’s exactly what we are committed to do: Leading sustainable trans-
portation – for all who keep the world moving."

"Financial performance measures
Revenue
Revenue is the baseline indicator for sales-related performance of the 
Group, the Industrial Business and its segments as well as for Finan-
cial Services."
"For the Industrial Business, it mainly results from the 
sales of vehicles and service parts as well as from other vehicle-
related services."
"Additionally, revenue from the rental and leasing 
business as well as interest from the Financial Services business is 
included."
"EBIT
EBIT is used as the measure of operating profit for the Group, the 
Industrial Business and its segments, as well as for Financial Services."
"As earnings before interest and income taxes, EBIT reflects the profit 
responsibility of the segments."
"The respective EBIT is derived from gross profit, which is the result of 
revenue less cost of sales."
"Operating profit is then calculated, with 
consideration of selling expenses, general administrative expenses, 
research and non-capitalized development costs, and other income 
and expenses."
"The EBIT of the Industrial Business additionally includes 
other reconciliation items of the Group that cannot be allocated to the 
segments."
"The EBIT for Financial Services already includes the interest 
result from operating activities, which is typical for the banking busi-
ness."
"To provide a more transparent picture of our ongoing business, we 
also calculate and report adjusted EBIT for the Group, the Industrial 
Business and its segments and Financial Services."
"The adjustments 
include individual items if they lead to material effects in a reporting 
year or in special cases after approval by the CFO of Daimler Truck."
"These individual items may in particular relate to legal proceedings 
and related measures, restructuring measures and M&A transactions."
"Return on sales (Industrial Business)
The return on sales is used to assess sales-based profitability in the 
Industrial Business."
It is calculated as the ratio of EBIT to revenue.
"Rev-
enues are primarily influenced by unit sales."
"Based on the adjusted 
EBIT, we also report the adjusted return on sales for the Industrial 
Business and its segments."
"Return on capital employed (Industrial Business)
The return on capital employed is used to assess the profitability of 
the invested capital in the Industrial Business."
"It is calculated as the 
ratio of EBIT to the average operating net assets of the Industrial Busi-
ness."
"If the return on capital employed exceeds the cost of capital rate 
before taxes, value is created from the perspective of our sharehold-
ers."
"The cost of capital rate is derived from the minimum rates of 
return of our equity investors and creditors."
"For the financial year 
2023, the cost of capital rate for the Industrial Business is 12% before 
taxes."
"Operating net assets (Industrial Business)
The segments of the Industrial Business are accountable for all assets 
and liabilities which are in their operative control."
"Their net value rep-
resents the capital employed of the Industrial Business segments for 
running their business."
"The operating net assets of the Industrial Busi-
ness additionally include other reconciliation items of the Group that 
cannot be allocated to the segments."
"Items related to liquidity, income 
taxes or pensions are not part of the operating net assets."
"The steer-
ing of the Industrial Business and its segments is based on the average 
operating net assets of the year which is calculated from the average 
operating net assets of the respective end of quarters."
"Free cash flow (Industrial Business)
The main indicator of the financial strength of the Daimler Truck Group 
is the free cash flow of the Industrial Business."
"In addition to cash 
flows from operating activities, this also includes cash flows from 
investing activities of the Industrial Business."
"On the other hand, effects in connection with the recognition of rights 
of use resulting from lessee accounting, which are mainly non-cash-
effective, are included in the free cash flow of the Industrial Business."
"The free cash flow of the Industrial Business also includes other recon-
ciliation items not attributable to the segments."
"For a more transparent presentation of the ongoing business, we addi-
tionally identify and report an adjusted free cash flow of the Industrial 
Business."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment
The Group’s investments in property, plant and equipment are an 
important performance indicator for Daimler Truck to manage our 
asset base."
"They serve to further enhance the attractiveness and 
future viability of our product range and production processes."
"In addi-
tion to investments in plant and equipment, this item also includes 
investments in land, buildings and operating facilities."
"Research and development
The Group’s research and development expenditures are another main 
performance indicator for preserving our future viability."
"This indicator 
is used to support decision making on future activities with regard to 
the technological challenges ahead, and thus to further strengthen the 
competitive position of Daimler Truck."
"In addition to research and non-
capitalized development costs, the Group’s capitalized development 
expenditures are also included."
"The return on equity is calculated as EBIT divided by quar-
terly average equity."
"If the return on equity exceeds the cost of equity 
rate, we create value for shareholders in the Financial Services seg-
ment."
"The cost of equity rate for the financial year 2023 is 14% before 
taxes."
"Based on adjusted EBIT, we also report an adjusted return on 
equity for Financial Services."
"New business (Financial Services)
New business is a key performance indicator for Financial Services."
"The figure indicates the newly concluded contract volume of leasing 
and financing contracts."
"Of particular importance in this 
respect are the unit sales of the Industrial Business."
"They are calcu-
lated as the total of vehicle sales in the Industrial Business less inter-
segment Group transactions."
"In addition, Daimler Truck pursues non-
financial goals in the area of sustainability, which are described in 
more detail in the chapter E Sustainability at Daimler Truck."
"Non-
financial, sustainability-related components are also anchored in the 
variable remuneration of the Board of Management."
"In the financial 
year 2023, the zero-emission vehicle sales, the reduction of CO2-emis-
sions of our Daimler Truck production sites, the well-being of employ-
ees and the global share of female managers were taken into account 
in the remuneration model."
"This creates an incentive to consistently 
implement our sustainable business strategy."
"Definition of sensitivities
For a qualitative-comparative description of changes per key figure, 
we use the intervals defined below."
"The overall market as well as unit sales and revenue of Daimler Truck 
are considered to be at the prior year’s level if they are within a range 
of minus 2.0% to +2.0%."
"If there is a change in a range between below 
minus 2.0% and minus 7.5% or between above +2.0% and +7.5%, we 
refer to a slight decrease or a slight increase compared with the prior 
year."
"If the change is more than +7.5% or less than minus 7.5% com-
pared with the prior year, we classify this as a significant increase or a 
significant decrease."
"EBIT and adjusted EBIT, research and development expenditures as 
well as investments in property, plant and equipment are considered 
to be at the prior year’s level if they are within a range of minus 5.0% to 
+5.0%."
"If there is a change in a range between below minus 5.0% and 
minus 15.0% or between above +5.0% and +15.0%, we refer to a slight 
decrease or a slight increase compared with the prior year."
"If the 
change is more than +15.0% or less than minus 15.0% compared with 
the prior year, we classify this as a significant increase or a significant 
decrease."
"The free cash flow of the Industrial Business is considered to be at the 
prior year’s level if it is within a range of minus 10.0% to +10.0%."
"If 
there is a change in a range between below minus 10.0% and minus 
25.0% or between above +10.0% and +25.0%, we refer to a slight 
decrease or a slight increase compared with the prior year."
"If the 
change is more than +25.0% or less than minus 25.0% compared with 
the prior year, we classify this as a significant increase or a significant 
decrease."
"Key performance indicators
Key performance indicators for the Daimler Truck Group within the 
meaning of German Accounting Standard (Deutscher Rechnungsle-
gungs Standard or DRS) No."
"20 for 2023 include the following perfor-
mance measures at Group level: revenue, EBIT and adjusted EBIT."
"The 
most important indicators for the Industrial Business are both unit 
sales and free cash flow."
"The adjusted return on equity and new busi-
ness constitute the most significant key performance indicators for 
the Financial Services segment."
"com/en/company/corporate-governance/board-of-management/
remuneration-of-the-board-of-management."
"The Federal 
Reserve (Fed) increased the key interest rate to a range of 5.25% to 
5.50% during 2023 due to the still high inflation rates."
"The average rise 
in consumer prices last year was 4.1%."
"However, private consumption 
increased significantly, also due to a strong labor market and available 
excess savings."
The US economy grew by 2.5% in 2023 calendar year.
"In the eurozone, the conditions in the energy markets eased over the 
course of the reporting year, which was reflected in reduced prices for 
crude oil, gas and power."
"However, 2023 inflation remained with 5.4% 
above the target value, meaning that the European Central Bank (ECB) 
further raised its key interest rate during the last year."
"At the end of 
2023 the key interest rate was 4.5%."
"Overall, there was a clear eco-
nomic downturn in the eurozone compared to 2022 with growth of just 
0.5%, although this varied regionally: the performance of the German 
economy fell by 0.1%, the GDP in France rose slightly by 0.9% and the 
overall economy in Spain actually grew by 2.5%."
"In Japan, the economy grew by 1.9%, above the long-term average."
"After the zero-COVID-19 policy was lifted, the Chinese economy recov-
ered more slowly than expected."
"However, the Chinese government's 
official target was achieved with growth of 5.2%."
"In Brazil, GDP grew by 
around 3.0%, with lower inflation allowing the Brazilian central bank 
to cut key interest rates over the course of the year."
"In this environment, exchange rates were volatile."
"The exchange rate 
of the US dollar against the euro ranged between 1.05 and 1.13 during 
the year."
"At year-end, the euro was around 4% stronger than at the end 
of 2022."
"The Japanese yen fluctuated against the euro between 138 
and 164."
"By the end of the year, the euro appreciated by more than 
11%."
The euro lost around 5% against the Brazilian real.
"The commercial vehicle market
The major truck markets developed very positively."
"In North America, 
the market for heavy-duty trucks (Class 8) grew by 7% to 331 thousand 
units."
"Sales of heavy-duty trucks were also very dynamic in the EU30 
region (European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Norway)."
"The market volume increased by 15% to 342 thousand units in the 
reporting year."
"The Brazilian market for heavy-duty trucks weakened 
significantly, with a decline of 17% compared to the prior year."
"In Japan, 
the market volume of heavy-duty trucks increased by 24%, while in 
China the market grew by 36%."
"Key sales markets for heavy buses also performed well in the report-
ing year."
"Although the market volume in the EU30 region was still 
below the pre-pandemic level, it recorded strong growth of 20% com-
pared to the prior year."
"The Brazilian heavy bus market continued its 
upward trend in 2023, increasing by 18%."
"The definition of the sensitivities for the qualitative comparative 
description of changes in key figures (“on”, “slightly” and “signifi-
cantly” above or below the prior-year level) can be found in chapter 
E Corporate Profile of the combined management report."
"The world economy
Despite geopolitical crises, the development of the global economy in 
the reporting year was more stable than originally expected."
"Interna-
tional supply chains have largely stabilized and COVID-19 restrictions 
have been lifted."
"However, regional and sectoral supply bottlenecks 
continued to lead to constraints."
"The real economic impact of the Rus-
sia-Ukraine war has weakened compared to 2022, which was mainly 
reflected in reduced energy prices."
"Even the initially feared natural gas 
shortage in Europe has not materialized."
"Likewise, the Hamas terrorist 
attack in October had no sustained impact on the price level for crude 
oil."
"Overall, global price pressure decreased in the year under review, 
although inflation rates were still well above the central banks' target 
values."
"Global inflation averaged around 5.5% in 2023, leading to a 
continued restrictive monetary policy environment."
"The global gross 
domestic product (GDP) increased by roughly 2.5% in the past report-
ing year."
"The share of emission-free vehicles has increased signifi-
cantly to 3,443 (2022: 914) units."
"The unit sales performance is shown 
in table ä B.03 and is explained below at segment level."
"The Trucks North America segment achieved unit sales of 195,014 
vehicles (+4%) in 2023 due to strong market demand and despite sup-
plier bottlenecks."
"In the USA, we were able to increase our unit sales 
to 162,949 trucks by 3% compared to the prior year."

nificant increase in unit sales in Canada with 16,420 units (+13%) and 
in Mexico with 13,867 units (+16%)."
"In 2023, the Mercedes-Benz segment recorded a slight decline in 
unit sales with 158,511 (2022: 166,369) vehicles."
"Despite supplier bot-
tlenecks and supported by improved market conditions, sales in the 
EU30 region rose significantly by 9% to 94,001 units."
"In contrast, unit 
sales in Brazil, our main market in Latin America, fell significantly by 
52% to 17,487 units, primarily due to the introduction of the Euro VI 
emissions standard."
"Unit sales in the Trucks Asia segment increased by 3% to 161,171 
vehicles due to overall stronger market demand and decreasing sup-
plier bottlenecks."
"In Japan, unit sales increased significantly by 38% to 
39,021 trucks and buses."
"In India, the segment also recorded a signifi-
cant increase of 39% to 25,435 units."
"In contrast, unit sales in Indone-
sia fell by 20% to a total of 35,311 units due to a market decline."
"Unit sales from our Chinese joint venture Beijing Foton Daimler Auto-
motive Co., Ltd."
"(BFDA), to which trucks of the Auman brand and, since 
the fourth quarter of 2022, Mercedes-Benz trucks produced in China 
also contribute, increased significantly to 70,078 units (2022: 49,159)."
"The unit sales improvement was mainly due to the market develop-
ment in China compared to the very low level of the previous year."
"Unit sales in the Daimler Buses segment in 2023 were significantly 
above that of the prior year at 26,168 units (+9%)."
"The increase in unit 
sales was mainly due to a recovery in the European coach market, 
which led to a significant increase in unit sales in the EU30 region by 
26% to 7,976 units."
"In North America, unit sales also increased signifi-
cantly by 39% to 3,834 units."
"In contrast, unit sales in Brazil, our main 
market in Latin America, fell by around 12% to 9,480 units, primarily 
due to the introduction of the Euro VI emissions standard."
"In the 2023 reporting year, the Financial Services segment leased or 
financed more than one in five new vehicles from the Daimler Truck 
Group in 16 markets."
"At the end of 2023, the segment had a total con-
tract volume of €28.3 billion (+17%)."
"On the one hand, this growth was 
attributable to strong operations in North America."
"On the other hand, 
growth was characterized by the start of operational business in Ger-
many and France as well as positive developments in the Phase 2 mar-
kets."
"Adjusted for exchange rates and contract volumes in Germany 
and France, this corresponds to growth of 17%."
"During the course of 
the year, Financial Services concluded new financing and leasing con-
tracts worldwide worth a total of €11.3 billion (+20%)."

individual models to changing demand."
"Incoming orders and the order backlog declined in the 2023 financial 
year compared to the previous year's high level."
"This development 
resulted, among other things, from diminishing catch-up effects and 
normalized ordering behavior."
"Investment and research activities
Investments in property, plant and equipment
Investments in property, plant and equipment at the Daimler Truck 
Group amounted to €1,026 million for 2023 and were therefore slightly 
higher than in the prior year (2022: €898 million)."

"Investments were made pri-
marily in new technologies (for example zero-emission vehicles and 
digitalization) and the ongoing development of existing products, as 
well as in the expansion of sales and spare parts centers."

America segment amounted to €235 million and were slightly higher 
than in the prior year (2022: €216 million)."

investments in new production equipment to support the transforma-
tion to zero emission vehicles."
"The investments in property, plant and equipment in the Mercedes-
Benz segment were made primarily in the production preparation of 
major projects, including compliance with new legal requirements and 
the launch of additional zero-emission models."
"In the sales function, 
further investments were made primarily in the establishing the infra-
structure of the Company’s own spare parts business, following the 
spin-off from the former Daimler AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group AG)."
"Overall, investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to 
€533 million by the end of 2023 and were therefore significantly 
higher than in the prior year (2022: €431 million)."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment in the Trucks Asia seg-
ment amounted to €128 million in 2023 and were therefore signifi-
cantly lower than in the prior year (2022: €153 million), largely influ-
enced by the change of the exchange rate against the Japanese yen."
"The core areas of investment were e-mobility, digitalization and new 
technologies as well as the expansion and optimization of infrastruc-
ture."
"These investments supported the transformation to new technol-
ogies, establishment of a sustainable and competitive product portfo-
lio and increased market share."
"At €115 million, investments in property, plant and equipment in the 
Daimler Buses segment were significantly higher than in the prior 
year (2022: €85 million)."
"The focus in 2023 was on the completion of 
the Service Center in Berlin and the expansion of the locations in Holy-
sov (Czech Republic), Ligny (France) and Hosdere (Turkey)."
"Research and development
In terms of expenditure on research and development (including capi-
talization), Daimler Truck is sticking to its strategic goals and investing 
in transformation as a priority."
"In 2023, the focus was on zero-emis-
sion vehicles and automated driving."
"For example, the development 
of autonomous driving was driven towards commercial implementa-
tion."
"In addition, investments were made in fuel efficiency and optimiz-
ing the existing product portfolio."
"Research and development expendi-
ture amounted to €1,965 million (including capitalization) and was 
therefore slightly higher than in the prior year (2022: €1,785 million)."
"Of the development costs, €208 million was capitalized (2022: 
€167 million), equivalent to a capitalization rate of 11% (2022: 9%)."
"Amortization of capitalized research and development expenditure 
amounted to €94 million in the year under review (2022: €120 million)."
"In 2023, research and development expenditure in the Mercedes-
Benz segment continued to focus on the development of battery- and 
hydrogen-powered vehicles."
"In parallel, the conventional powertrain 
was adapted to future emission standards."
"Expenditures amounted to 
€801 million, therefore slightly above the prior year’s level (2022: 
€736 million)."
"The research and development expenditure of the Trucks Asia seg-
ment of €179 million was slightly below the prior year’s level (2022: 
€194 million), largely influenced by the exchange rate against the Japa-
nese yen."
"The focus was on the development of all-electric vehicles 
and digital services as well as the further development of the existing 
portfolio."
"In the Daimler Buses segment, €172 million was invested in research 
and development in 2023 (2022: €148 million)."
"Expenditure was there-
fore significantly above that of the prior year."
"In 2023 there was a sig-
nificant shift toward zero-emission drive systems."
"Investments were 
also made in preparing the coach portfolio to meet the Euro VII emis-
sion standard."
"Revenue of the Industrial Business also increased significantly 
by 8% to €53.2 billion (2022: €49.2 billion)."
"The increase in revenue 
resulted primarily from improved net pricing in the vehicle segments 
as well as positive volume and mix effects in unit sales."
"Adjusted for 
exchange rate effects, the Group's revenue increased by 13%."
"The neg-
ative exchange rate effects resulted in particular from the translation 
of the US dollar and Japanese yen."
"ä B.06
Cost of sales amounted to €44.0 billion in the reporting year and rose 
slightly by 6% compared to the prior year."
"The increase in cost of sales 
resulted primarily from increased material costs and increased unit 
sales."
"Exchange rate effects, particularly from the translation of US 
dollar and Japanese yen, had a compensating effect."
"ä B.07
Overall, gross profit rose significantly to €11.9 billion (2022: €9.4 bil-
lion) and as a percentage of revenue to 21.3% (2022: 18.5%)."
"ä B.07
At €2.9 billion, selling expenses were at the same level as the previ-
ous year."
"The prior year included a special item arising from the impair-
ment of trade receivables in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war."
The ratio of selling expenses to revenue fell from 5.7% to 5.2%.
"The Industrial Business and 
Financial Services columns represent a business perspective."
"The 
Industrial Business comprises the vehicle segments Trucks North 
America, Mercedes-Benz, Trucks Asia and Daimler Buses, and the rec-
onciliation."
"Financial Services corresponds to the Financial Services 
segment."
"The eliminations of intra-Group transactions between the 
Industrial Business and Financial Services are generally allocated to 
the Industrial Business and are reported in the reconciliation."
"The following information explains the changes in the reporting year 
compared to the prior year and takes into account all effects that are 
significant from the Daimler Truck Group perspective."
"The definition of the sensitivities for the qualitative-comparative 
description of changes in key figures (“on”, “slightly” and “signifi-
cantly” above or below the prior-year level) can be found in chapter 
E Corporate Profile of the combined management report."
"Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up precisely to the 
totals shown and percentages presented may not accurately reflect 
the absolute values to which they relate."
"The increase resulted pri-
marily from higher personnel and IT costs, particularly in connection 
with the spin-off."
"The ratio of general administrative costs to revenue 
rose from 3.8% to 4.3%."
"ä B.07
At €1.8 billion, research and non-capitalized development costs in 
the 2023 financial year were slightly above the prior-year level (2022: 
€1.6 billion)."
"Further information on this can be found in the “invest-
ment and research activities” section of the chapter E Economic 
Conditions and Business Development in the combined management 
report."
"ä B.07
Other operating income was below the prior-year level at €563 mil-
lion (2022: €703 million)."
"The prior year included income from bargain 
purchase for acquisitions at a price below market value and from the 
termination of pre-existing relationships in connection with the 
acquired financial services business."
"ä B.07
In 2023, profit on equity-method investments, net, was minus 
€109 million (2022: minus €226 million), significantly better than the 
previous year's level."
"The difference is primarily due to the impairment 
of the at-equity carrying amount of Daimler Kamaz Truck Holding 
GmbH (DKTH) in the prior year as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Daimler Truck disposed of DKTH on December 30, 2022."
"ä B.07
The other financial income/expense, net fell from €90 million to 
minus €132 million, mainly due to effects from the change in discount 
rates, which led to positive special effects in the prior year due to the 
increase in interest rates."
"ä B.07
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of €5.2 billion in the 
2023 financial year were significantly higher than the previous year's 
figure of €3.5 billion."
"Positive effects on EBIT arose primarily from 
improved net pricing in the vehicle segments, from positive volume 
and mix effects in unit sales and from positive developments in the 
aftersales business."
"This was offset by the inflation-related increase in 
costs, particularly in material costs, as well as higher personnel costs."
"The reconciliation 
from EBIT to adjusted EBIT is shown in table ä B.09."
"Interest income/expense, net improved from minus €46 million to 
€144 million."
"ä B.07
The tax expense reported under income taxes increased from 
€686 million to €1,355 million."
"The higher effective tax rate of 25.4% in 
the 2023 financial year (2022: 19.9%) results from lower tax income 
from previously unrecognized deferred tax assets."
"ä B.07
The Group’s net profit of €4.0 billion was significantly above the pre-
vious year's result (2022: €2.8 billion)."
"Of the net profit, €196 million 
was attributable to non-controlling interests (2022: €99 million)."
"The share of net profit attributable to shareholders of Daimler 
Truck Holding AG amounted to €3.8 billion (2022: €2.7 billion)."
"ä B.07
Further information on the individual items of the Consolidated State-
ment of Income is provided in E Notes 5 ff to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"The improved net pricing and the increase in unit sales, despite ongo-
ing supplier bottlenecks, had a positive impact on the gross profit."
"Fur-
ther positive effects resulted from exchange rates and improved mate-
rial efficiency."
"This was offset by additional costs due to inefficiencies 
caused by supplier bottlenecks and higher personnel costs."
"In total, 
gross profit rose from 17.5% to 19.5%."
"No adjustments were made; in 
the prior year these amounted to €3 million in connection with the 
spin-off."
"EBIT amounted to €2,887 million (2022: €2,376 million), adjusted EBIT 
to €2,887 million (2022: €2,379 million)."
"The adjusted return on sales 
was at 12.3% (2022: 10.8%)."
"ä B.08 ä B.09
The revenue of the Mercedes-Benz segment increased by 7% to 
€21,638 million in the 2023 financial year, largely due to improved net 
pricing."
"Improved net pricing, the strong aftersales business and the impact of 
sales mix had a positive impact on gross profit."
"This was offset by 
inflation-related increase in material costs, a normalization of the used 
vehicle business and the loss of the previous year's positive effects 
from the license agreement with Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive 
Co., Ltd."
Gross profit rose from 18.2% to 22.6%.
"The adjust-
ments included expenses in connection with the spin-off of €144 mil-
lion (2022: €67 million, M&A transactions) as well as expenses for per-
sonnel cost optimization programs of €16 million (2022: €169 million)."
"The adjustments did not include any expenses in connection with the 
Russia-Ukraine war (2022: €205 million, M&A transactions)."
"EBIT amounted to €2,038 million (2022: €1,188 million), adjusted EBIT 
to €2,199 million (2022: €1,629 million)."
"At 10.2%, the adjusted return 
on sales of was above the previous year's adjusted value of 8.1%."
"ä B.08 ä B.09
The revenue of Trucks Asia increased to €7,060 million (2022: 
€6,499 million) in the 2023 financial year, due, among other things, to 
improved net pricing and increased unit sales."
"Improved net pricing and a strong aftersales business had a positive 
influence on gross profit."
"Exchange rate effects, inflation-related cost 
increases, particularly for materials, and higher personnel costs had 
an opposing effect."
Gross profit rose in total from 17.6% to 18.8%.
"No 
adjustments were made; in the prior year these included impairments 
in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war in the amount of €8 million 
and special effects in connection with the spin-off in the amount of 
€1 million (M&A transactions)."
"EBIT amounted to €330 million (2022: €161 million), adjusted EBIT to 
€330 million (2022: €171 million)."
"At 4.7%, the adjusted return on 
sales was above the adjusted previous year’s value of 2.6%."
"ä B.08 ä B.09
The revenue of Daimler Buses increased by 24% to €4,566 million in 
the 2023 financial year, due, among other things, to improved net pric-
ing and increased unit sales."
"The improved net pricing, increased unit sales, effects from the sales 
mix, exchange rate effects and strong aftersales business had a posi-
tive impact on gross profit."
"This was offset by inflation-related 
increase in costs, particularly for materials, as well as higher person-
nel costs."
Gross profit therefore rose from 11.6% to 15.8%.
"EBIT amounted to €214 million (2022: minus €52 million) and adjusted 
EBIT also amounted to €214 million (2022: €14 million)."
"The adjusted 
return on sales of 4.7% was significantly better than the adjusted pre-
vious year’s value of 0.4%."
"ä B.08 ä B.09
Financial Services revenue increased by 52% to €2,674 million in the 
2023 financial year, primarily due to higher contract volume in Europe 
and North America."
"The gross profit generated by Financial Services improved significantly 
compared to the prior year, in particular due to an increased operating 
result, despite a market environment characterized by pressure on 
margins and regionally heterogeneous risk costs."
"Offsetting effects 
resulted from an increased cost base and higher project-related 
expenses in Europe in connection with the integration of the acquired 
financial services business."
"The significantly lower other income in 
2023 compared to the prior year was due in particular to non-recurring 
income in connection with the acquisition of the financial services 
business in Europe."
"The 2023 adjustments fully include expenses from 
this matter amounting to €25 million (2022: income of €117 million)."
EBIT amounted to €186 million (2022: €310 million).
"Adjusted EBIT 
increased to €211 million and was therefore slightly above the prior-
year level (2022: €193 million)."
"The resulting return on equity 
increased accordingly from 8.0% (2022: 15.9%) to an adjusted return 
on equity of 9.1% (2022: 9.9%)."
"Items at the corporate level resulted in expenses of €448 million in the 
2023 financial year (2022: €421 million), which are, among other 
things, related to the subsidiary TORC Robotics, Inc."
"and the joint ven-
ture cellcentric GmbH & Co."
"The adjustments of €120 million 
(2022: €61 million) included expenses in connection with the spin-off 
and expenses due to the intended merger of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck & 
Bus Corporation and Hino Motors Ltd."
"ä B.09
The elimination of intra-Group transactions resulted in an expense in 
the 2023 financial year of €23 million (2022: €67 million)."
The adjusted return on equity of Financial Services is determined as the ratio of adjusted EBIT to the average quarterly equity.
"Detailed explana-
tions of this and other key figures of our performance measurement 
system can be found in chapter E Corporate Profile of the combined 
management report."
"The return on capital employed of the Industrial Business was 44.6% in 
2023 (2022: 28.9%)."
"The significant increase compared to the prior 
year resulted primarily from the significantly higher EBIT."
"The composition of the return on capital employed of the Industrial 
Business is presented in table."
"Liquidity as well as income taxes and pensions are not included in the calculation 
of the operating net assets."
"Global financial management is carried out 
uniformly by the Treasury organization of the Daimler Truck Group 
within the framework of the legal provisions for all Group companies."
"Fundamentally, it operates within a predefined framework of guide-
lines, limits and benchmarks; organizationally, it is separate at the 
operational level from the settlement, financial controlling, reporting 
and accounting functions."
"Capital structure management arranges the capital structure of the 
Group and its subsidiaries."
"The capital resources of the financial ser-
vices, production, sales or financing companies of Daimler Truck are 
allocated in accordance with the principles of cost- and risk-optimized 
financial and capital resources."
"Liquidity management is intended to ensure that the Group is 
always able to meet its payment obligations."
"To this end, the Group 
plans the cash flows from operating activities and from financial trans-
actions on a rolling basis."
"Financing requirements are met by means of 
suitable liquidity management instruments (for example bank loans, 
bonds); the Group invests surplus liquidity in the money and/or capital 
market, taking expected returns and risks into account."
"Factoring is 
regularly used to a limited extent to manage liquidity."
"Our goal is to provide the liquidity that is deemed to be necessary at 
the best possible cost."
"In addition, to operating liquidity, the Daimler 
Truck Group has further liquidity reserves that are available at short 
notice."
"The components of these additional resources are receivables 
from the financial services business that can be securitized on the 
capital market, a contractually committed syndicated credit facility 
(“revolving credit facility”), and an additional revolving credit facility 
agreed in 2022."
"Cash management determines cash requirements and surpluses on 
a centralized basis."
"In this context, liquidity is concentrated centrally 
in bank accounts of the Daimler Truck Group via cash pooling proce-
dures in various currencies."
"Most payments between Group compa-
nies are made via internal clearing accounts, so that the number of 
external payment flows is kept to a minimum."
"The Daimler Truck Group 
has established standardized processes and systems to manage its 
bank and internal clearing accounts and to carry out automated pay-
ment transactions."
"Market price risk management aims to limit the impact of fluctua-
tions in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices 
on the earnings of the segments and the Group."
"To this end, the 
Group-wide risk volume (“exposure”) for these market price risks is 
first determined."
"For currencies, net exposure constitutes the relevant 
risk volume, which is reduced by netting foreign currency items among 
the Group companies."
"The Group then makes its hedging decisions on 
this basis."
"This includes the volume to be hedged, the period to be 
hedged, and the choice of hedging instruments."
"The hedging strategy 
is defined at Group level and implemented uniformly."
"Decision-making 
bodies are internal committees for market price risks that meet regu-
larly."
"The management of pension assets (“plan assets”) includes invest-
ing the assets held to cover the pension obligations."
"The plan assets 
are legally separate from corporate assets and are mainly invested in 
funds; they are not available for general corporate purposes."
"On the 
basis of the expected development of the pension obligations, the plan 
assets are spread across various asset categories, for example equi-
ties, fixed-income securities, alternative investments and real estate, 
with the assistance of risk/return optimization."
"The Group measures 
the performance of its asset investments on the basis of defined refer-
ence indices."
"The risks of capital investments are limited by means of 
a Group-wide guideline."
"In addition, local regulations are in place for 
the risk management of individual plan assets."
"Additional information 
on pension plans and similar obligations is provided in E Note 23."
"Pensions and similar obligations of the Notes to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"The risk volume considered in the management of credit default 
risks includes all creditor positions of the Daimler Truck Group world-
wide vis-à-vis financial institutions, issuers of securities and custom-
ers in the Financial Services business and the Industrial Business."
"The 
credit risk vis-à-vis financial institutions and issuers of securities 
arises primarily from the investment of liquid funds in the context of 
liquidity management and from the use of derivative financial instru-
ments."
"The management of these credit risks is essentially based on 
an internal limit system that is geared to the creditworthiness of the 
financial institution or issuer."
"The credit risk vis-à-vis customers in the 
Industrial Business results from the relationship with authorized deal-
ers and general distribution companies, other corporate customers 
and private customers."
"Credit risk management is based on a uniform 
risk management process."
"Depending on the identified risk, credit col-
lateral is requested."
"Financial Services manages the credit risk with 
respect to end customers in its financial services business on the 
basis of a uniform risk management process."
"This process defines 
minimum requirements for the credit and leasing business and sets 
standards for credit processes and for the identification, measure-
ment, and management of risks."
"Key elements for the management of 
credit risks are an appropriate credit assessment supported by statis-
tical risk classification procedures, as well as a structured portfolio 
analysis and monitoring."
"Country risk management includes several risk aspects: The risk 
from capital investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the risk 
from cross-border financing of Group companies in risk countries, and 
the risk from direct sales to customers in those countries."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group has an internal rating system in which all countries in 
which the Daimler Truck Group operates are classified into risk catego-
ries."
"Risks from cross-border receivables are partially covered by 
export credit insurance, letters of credit and bank guarantees in favor 
of the Daimler Truck Group."
"Furthermore, an internal committee deter-
mines and limits the amount of hard currency portfolios at Financial 
Services companies in risk countries."
"Further information on the management of market price, credit default 
and liquidity risks is provided in E Note 34."
"Management of financial 
risks."
"Profit 
before income taxes was significantly higher than the prior year."
"The 
positive result was mainly due to the ongoing improved net pricing in 
the vehicle segments, as well as positive volume and mix effects in 
unit sales."
"An increase in inventory values was due, among other things, to a  
generally higher cost base in inventories and a slightly higher level of 
finished goods."
"A positive development in global supply chains led to  
a lower level of work in progress."
"The decrease in trade payables was 
due to a lower purchasing volume at the year-end."
"Including the increase in trade receivables, this led to a negative 
change in working capital of €1.3 billion (2022: negative €0.9 billion)."
"Working capital represents the sum of inventories, trade receivables 
and trade payables."
"In 2022, other operating assets and liabilities included cash outflows 
of €0.2 billion relating to the termination of pre-existing contractual 
relationships as part of the acquisition of the Financial Services com-
panies."
"This negatively impacted the cash flows from operating activi-
ties and were allocated in full to the Financial Services segment."
"The changes in other assets and liabilities include positive effects in 
particular from the increase in provisions for product warranties as 
well as provisions for personnel expenses and social benefits."
"In the reporting period, payments were made for personnel cost-opti-
mization programs resulting from the agreed cost-cutting measures 
and socially responsible job reductions."
"Cash flow from investing activities ä B.11 resulted in a cash out-
flow of €2.1 billion (2022: €4.2 billion)."
"The cash outflows are generally 
due to the additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets as well as the acquisition and sale of mutual funds."
"The decrease compared to the prior year is primarily due to consider-
ation paid to the Mercedes-Benz Group in 2022 in connection with the 
acquired Financial Services business, of which €1.3 billion related to 
the repayment of financing liabilities and was allocated to the Indus-
trial Business."
"Cash flow from financing activities ä B.11 resulted in a cash inflow 
of €2.9 billion (2022: €3.3 billion) in the reporting period."
"The cash 
outflows were mainly due to dividend payments to the shareholders of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG amounting to €1.1 billion and the com-
mencement of the share buyback program during Q3 2023 of €0.6 bil-
lion."
"In addition, cash inflows resulted primarily from raising funds on 
the international money and capital markets and from issuing Asset-
Backed-Securities (ABS)."
"The issuance of bonds took place mainly in 
the USA, Netherlands and Canada at a total value of €6.0 billion."
"In 2023, cash and cash equivalents increased by €1.1 billion after 
adjusting for exchange-rate effects."
"Free cash flow of the Industrial Business
The measure used by Daimler Truck for the financial strength of its 
industrial activities is the free cash flow of the Industrial Busi-
ness ä B.12."
"Detailed explanations of this and other key figures of  
our performance measurement system can be found in the chap-
ter E Corporate Profile of the Combined Management Report."
"Other adjustments include the Daimler Truck Headquarters allocation 
to Financial Services and miscellaneous adjustments to reflect the 
economic amount of investments or divestments that are wholly or 
partially non-cash in nature."
"In 2023, the free cash flow of the Industrial Business amounted to 
€2.8 billion (2022: €1.7 billion)."
"The increase in free cash flow of the Industrial Business by €1.1 billion 
to €2.8 billion reflected the strong revenue and earnings performance."
"This was set off by a higher level of working capital, which had a nega-
tive impact on free cash flow."
"An increase in inventory values was due, among other factors, to a 
generally higher cost base in inventories and a slightly higher level of 
finished goods."
"A positive development in global supply chains led to a 
lower level of work in progress."
"The increase in trade receivables was due to timing and lower factor-
ing volumes."
"Factoring activities with external banks and financial 
institutions amounted to €25 million (2022: €154 million) and internal 
factoring agreements with Financial Services fell to €293 million 
(2022: €387 million)."
"In addition, there was a moderate decline in 
trade payables."
"A planned increase in investment in property, plant and equipment, 
primarily to address transformation topics should also be highlighted."
"In determining free cash flow ä B.13, the increase in income taxes 
paid is attributable to the improved earnings performance."
"In addition, 
higher interest cash inflows due to increased liquidity and a stronger 
interest rate environment compared to the prior year, should be noted."
"The special contribution to the pension fund made in the prior-year 
period did not materialize this year."
"For a more transparent presentation of the ongoing business, we iden-
tify and report an adjusted free cash flow of the Industrial Busi-
ness ä B.12."
"After adjusting for M&A transactions and restructuring 
measures, adjusted free cash flow of the Industrial Business amounted 
to a cash inflow of €3.3 billion (2022: €2.0 billion)."
"The reconciliation from the CFBIT to 
the free cash flow of the Industrial Business also includes taxes and 
interest paid."
"In addition to the eliminations between the segments, 
the other reconciliation items include items that are attributable to the 
Industrial Business but for which the segments are not responsible."
"Table ä B.13 shows the reconciliation from the CFBIT to the free cash 
flow of the Industrial Business."
"The CFBIT of the Industrial Business is derived from EBIT and 
changes in operating assets and liabilities (“net assets”) and also 
includes additions of right-of-use assets."
"Table ä B.14 
shows the composition of CFBIT for the Industrial Business."
"Table 
ä B.15 shows, for the Industrial Business, the reconciliation from 
CFBIT to adjusted CFBIT and the adjusted cash conversion rate."
"An adjusted cash conversion rate of 0.8 was achieved for the Industrial 
Business of the Daimler Truck Group."
"This is slightly below the previ-
ous year’s value of 0.9, and is attributable to increased investment."
"To the extent that the Group’s internal refinancing 
of the Financial Services business is provided by the companies of the 
Industrial Business, this amount is deducted in the calculation of the 
net debt of the Industrial Business."
"Since December 31, 2022 the net liquidity of the Industrial Business 
increased by €0.8 billion to €8.3 billion."
"The increase was mainly due 
to the positive free cash flow of the Industrial Business of €2.8 billion."
"This was offset by the dividend payment of €1.1 billion in June 2023 to 
the shareholders of Daimler Truck Holding AG and the share buyback 
program in the second half of 2023, resulting in a cash outflow of 
€0.6 billion."
"The increase in liquidity and financing liabilities of the Industrial Busi-
ness resulted primarily due to the bond issuances in the USA, Nether-
lands and in Canada and the increase in money market funds."
"As part of 
its usual business activity, the Group has entered into other financial 
obligations of €1.0 billion (December 31, 2022: €1.0 billion), which 
exceeded the liabilities shown in the Consolidated Statement of Finan-
cial Position as at December 31, 2023."
"At both December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Daimler 
Truck Group had issued irrevocable loan commitments that had not 
been not utilized as of those dates."
"In addition, there are other financial obligations arising from the post-
divestment liability resulting from the spin-off in 2019 and the spin-off 
and demerger in 2021."

Statements."
"Refinancing
The financing transactions carried out by Daimler Truck in 2023 were 
primarily for the acquisition and refinancing of the leasing and sales 
financing business."
"To this end, Daimler Truck made use of various 
financing instruments in different currencies and markets."
"These 
include bank loans, bonds with medium and long maturities in the cap-
ital market, and the securitization of customer receivables in the finan-
cial services business (“asset-backed securities”)."
"The situation on the money and capital markets in the reporting year 
was characterized by high volatility in view of geopolitical and eco-
nomic risks."
"The cycle of interest rate hikes initiated by most central 
banks in 2022 continued in 2023, resulting in a continued volatile refi-
nancing environment for issuers."
"During the reporting period, the 
Group covered its refinancing needs by issuing bonds and asset-
backed securities (ABS) transactions."
"In the United States and Europe, 
this takes the form of so-called benchmark issues (bonds with a high 
nominal volume) by Daimler Truck Finance North America LLC and 
Daimler Truck International Finance B.V respectively."
"Another important source of refinancing in the 2023 financial year 
were bank loans, particularly for the Brazilian real, Japanese yen, and 
Mexican peso currency areas."
"These loans were provided by global 
banks as well as by banks operating nationally."
"The lenders also 
included government financing institutions (such as the Brazilian 
Development Bank)."
"In August 2021, an agreement was concluded with a consortium of 
international banks to provide a syndicated credit facility, of €5.0 bil-
lion."
"The facility has an initial term of five years with two one-year 
extension options."
"Both extension options have expired and were not 
utilized."
Daimler Truck does not intend to utilize the credit facility.
"In September 2022, a revolving credit line of €1.0 billion with a term of 
24 months was concluded with an international banking group."
"There 
is an option to increase the credit line further by €500 million within 
the first 18 months of the term."
"The option to increase and the credit 
facility had not been utilized as of the reporting date."

December 31, 2023, these are mainly related to the following curren-
cies: 43% to the US dollar, 12% to the Brazilian real, 17% to the euro, 
and 7% to the Canadian dollar."
"As at December 31, 2023, the total financing liabilities shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position amounted to €25.7 bil-
lion (December 31, 2022: €20.8 billion)."

"Credit ratings
Daimler Truck’s credit rating remained unchanged in the 2023 financial 
year."
S&P Global Ratings raised our outlook to positive.
"This means 
that Daimler Truck continues to have a solid investment grade rating 
from the rating agencies S&P Global Ratings and Moody's."
"On May 26, 2023, S&P Global Ratings changed the outlook for our 
long-term rating from “stable” to “positive”."
"The BBB+ / A-2 ratings 
(long-term and short-term) from S&P Global Ratings reflect the assess-
ment of the agency that Daimler Truck has a strong market position in 
the most profitable markets of the United States and Europe."
"In addi-
tion, S&P noted positively that Daimler Truck is on track to achieve its 
profitability targets and is implementing efficiency improvements and 
cost-cutting measures."
"Moody’s also pointed to the global 
recovery of truck markets, the positive margin development, as well as 
Daimler Truck's conservative financial policy coupled with strong 
liquidity."
"The increase included €1.3 billion in neg-
ative exchange rate effects; adjusted for these effects, the increase 
was €8.5 billion."
"Financial Services accounted for €29.8 billion of total 
assets (2022: €25.5 billion), corresponding to 41.9% of all assets in the 
Daimler Truck Group (2022: 39.9%)."
"Table ä B.21 shows the Condensed Statement of Financial Position of 
the Daimler Truck Group as well as the Industrial Business and Finan-
cial Services."
"At 52.7%, current assets as a proportion of the balance sheet total 
were similar to the prior year (December 31, 2022: 50.6%)."
"At 32.0%, 
current liabilities as a proportion of the balance sheet total were simi-
lar to the prior year (December 31, 2022: 32.8%)."
"Table ä B.22 shows 
the balance sheet structure by maturity."
"The development costs capitalized in the year under review 
amount to €209 million (December 31, 2022: €167 million) and corre-
spond to 10.6% (2022: 9.4%) of the Group’s total research and develop-
ment expenditure."
"Property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets) of 
€8.0 billion were similar to the prior year (December 31, 2022: 
€8.0 billion)."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment increased 
from €898 million to €1,026 million."
"In our production and assembly 
sites, investments were made primarily in preparation for production 
of zero-emission vehicles in order to support the transformation to 
electric vehicles."
"Other key areas were investments in plant optimiza-
tion and ongoing development of the existing product portfolio as well 
as the expansion of our sales and spare parts centers."
"Investments in 
property, plant and equipment at the sites in Germany amounted to 
€439 million (2022: €294 million)."
"Equipment on operating leases and receivables from financial 
services increased in total to €30.7 billion (December 31, 2022: 
€26.9 billion); adjusted for currency translation, there was an increase 
of €4.2 billion."
This is mainly due to new business.
"The share of total 
assets accounted for by the leasing and sales financing business was 
43.2% and similar to the prior year (December 31, 2022: 42.0%)."
"Equity-method investments of €1.1 billion were similar to the prior 
year (December 31, 2022: €1.1 billion)."
"Inventories increased from €8.8 billion to €9.2 billion; the share of 
total assets is below that of the prior year at 12.9% (2022: 13.8%)."
"An 
increase in inventory values was due, among other things, to a gener-
ally higher cost base in inventories and a slightly higher level of fin-
ished goods."
"A positive development in global supply chains led to a 
lower level of work in progress."
"Trade receivables of €5.3 billion were above the figure for the prior 
year (December 31, 2022: €4.7 billion)."
"The increase was primarily due 
to the development of unit sales."
"Cash and cash equivalents increased to €7.1 billion (December 31, 
2022: €5.9 billion)."
"The increase resulted primarily from the bond issu-
ances in the USA, Netherlands and in Canada as well as from the cash 
flows from operating activities."
"The marketable debt securities and similar investments with a 
carrying amount of €1.8 billion were significantly higher compared to 
the prior year (December 31, 2022: €1.1 billion)."
"The increase is pri-
marily attributable to the increase in money market funds, measured 
at fair value through profit or loss."
"Other assets of €3.8 billion primarily comprise deferred taxes and 
tax refund claims (December 31, 2022: €3.2 billion)."
"Among other 
things, the change is due to higher refund claims in connection with 
sales tax as well as due to an increase in the deferred tax assets."
"The Group’s equity increased compared to December 31, 2022 from 
€20.6 billion to €22.2 billion."
"Equity attributable to the share-
holders of Daimler Truck Holding AG increased accordingly to 
€21.6 billion (December 31, 2022: €20.1 billion)."
"Against the backdrop of the robust liquidity position, the Board of 
Management and Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
decided on July 10, 2023 to implement a share buyback program."
"On 
this basis, own shares worth up to €2 billion (excluding incidental 
acquisition costs) will be acquired on the stock exchange over a period 
of up to 24 months commencing from August 2, 2023."
"While total assets increased by 11.3%, equity increased by 7.9% com-
pared to the prior year."
"The lower increase in equity is mainly due to 
the fact that there was no dividend distribution to the shareholders of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG in the prior year."
"The Group’s equity ratio 
was similar to the prior year at 31.2% (December 31, 2022: 32.2%); the 
equity ratio for the Industrial Business was 47.7% (December 31, 2022: 
47.9%)."
"Provisions of €6.5 billion are higher year-on-year (December 31, 
2022: €6.1 billion); at 9.1%, their share of the balance sheet total is 
similar to the prior year (December 31, 2022: 9.5%)."
"Provisions for pen-
sions and similar obligations of €1.2 billion were similar to the prior 
year (December 31, 2022: €1.1 billion)."
"The slight increase in the pres-
ent value of pension obligations to €6.3 billion (December 31, 2022: 
€5.9 billion) was offset by the fair value of plan assets to fund these 
obligations of €5.7 billion (December 31, 2022: €5.4 billion)."
"The increase was mainly due to borrowing on the inter-
national money and capital markets and due to issuing asset-backed-
securities."
"Of the financing liabilities, 55.2% relate to bonds, 28.3% to liabilities to 
banks, 7.7% to liabilities from ABS transactions, 4.5% to liabilities from 
lease agreements and 3.1% to loans and other financing liabilities."
"Trade payables of €5.1 billion were similar to the prior year (Decem-
ber 31, 2022: €5.3 billion)."
"The decrease in trade payables is due to a 
lower purchasing volume at the year-end."
"Further information on the recognized assets, equity and liabilities of 
the Group can be found in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position ä D.03, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 
ä D.05 and the relevant Notes to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
"Overall assessment of the economic  
situation
The past financial year was characterized by relatively stable condi-
tions."
"The real economic effect from the Russia-Ukraine war has weak-
ened compared to the prior year."
"The situation regarding energy prices 
and inflation developments improved over the course of the year."
"An 
escalation of geopolitical risks in the Middle East did not have any sig-
nificant real economic impact in the year under review."
"An overall positive market environment, supported by catch-up 
effects, contributed to stable sales and improved net pricing for 
Daimler Truck."
"Supply chains that were largely stabilized over the 
course of the year made it possible to largely meet the overall strong 
customer demand, although local and sectoral bottlenecks in the sup-
ply chains continued."
Daimler Truck completed the 2023 financial year very successfully.
"The outlook for 2023 was raised over the course of the year and con-
firmed with record values for Daimler Truck, among other things, at 
Group level for revenue and EBIT as well as for free cash flow of the 
Industrial Business."
"The adjusted return on sales of the Industrial Busi-
ness reached a historical record level for Daimler Truck of 9.9% and 
was increased in all vehicle segments compared to the prior year."
"A comparison of the key figures of the outlook provided with the actual 
development in the 2023 financial year as well as the outlook for the 
2024 financial year is shown in table ä B.75 of chapter E Outlook."
"The Statement of Income is prepared in accordance with the interna-
tionally prevailing cost of sales method."
"The comparative period for 
the Statement of Income is the prior financial year."
"For Daimler Truck Holding AG as a management company, net profit 
represents the most significant performance indicator."
"Net profit is 
considered to be at the prior year’s level if it is within a range of minus 
5.0% to +5.0%."
"If there is a change in a range between below minus 
5.0% and minus 15.0% or between above +5.0% and +15.0%, we refer to 
a slight decrease or a slight increase compared with the prior year."
"If 
the change is more than +15.0% or less than minus 15.0% compared 
with the prior year, we classify this as a significant increase or a signifi-
cant decrease."
"Profitability
The profitability of Daimler Truck Holding AG in the financial year was 
mainly influenced by the profit transfer arising from the control and 
profit and loss transfer agreement with Daimler Truck AG, which 
totaled €5,511 million (2022: €1,393 million)."
"General administrative expenses amounted to €73 million (2022: 
€55 million)."
"This mainly included personnel expenses of €28 million 
(2022: €23 million), other non-production-related external services 
amounting to €18 million (2022: €13 million) and other indemnity 
insurance of €8 million (2022: €8 million)."
"The increase over the prior 
year was mainly due to higher costs for external services and higher 
personnel expenses."
"Other operating income fell by €6 million to €17 million (2022: 
€23 million)."
"This mainly arose from the invoicing of management ser-
vices provided to Daimler Truck AG of €13 million."
"The main reason for 
the decrease compared to the prior year was the reduction in costs 
passed on."
Net Interest income increased by €44 million to €45 million.
"Com-
pared to previous year, the increase is mainly due to higher interest 
income from interest on the cash pool balance."
"Income taxes amounted to €238 million (2022: €0 million) and 
resulted entirely from the significant increase in taxable operating 
income within the tax group."
"The net profit of Daimler Truck Holding AG amounted to €5,262 mil-
lion (2022: €1,362 million) and was therefore according to our expec-
tations (as stated in the prior year’s outlook report) of a significant 
increase in net profit."
"For the 2023 financial year, the Company 
reported a distributable profit of €5,554 million (2022: €1,362 million)."
"The distribution amount stated takes into account the 805,283,357 
no-par value shares entitled to dividends existing on December 31, 
2023."
"At this time, the Company held 17,668,525 treasury shares, from 
which it has no rights pursuant to Section 71b German Stock Corpora-
tion Act (AktG)."
"As the number of shares entitled to dividends will 
change by the date of the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing 
share buyback program, a resolution proposal that is amended accord-
ingly will be put to the vote at the Annual General Meeting."
"This resolu-
tion proposal will still provide for a dividend of €1.90 per no-par value 
In addition to the reporting on the Daimler Truck Group, the financial 
results of Daimler Truck Holding AG are reported here."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG is the parent company of the Daimler Truck 
Group and has its headquarters in Stuttgart (Germany)."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG is structured as a management company in 
which the Board of Management is located and provides management 
services to the Group."
"The Company has no employees of its own 
below the level of the Board of Management – apart from a few 
employees with dual employment contracts."
"The financing of the 
Daimler Truck Group is secured centrally by Daimler Truck AG and the 
other companies of the Group, where appropriate, in conjunction with 
guarantees provided by Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"Due to its position 
as the listed parent company of the Daimler Truck Group, Daimler 
Truck Holding AG is responsible for a wide range of tasks, particu-
larly with regard to the external presentation of the Daimler Truck 
Group."
"These tasks include, in particular, external financial reporting 
and the fulfillment of other statutory disclosure requirements and tax 
requirements arising from the tax group."
"The Group-wide central func-
tions are carried out at the level of Daimler Truck AG – which provides 
services to Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements follow the International Finan-
cial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union 
(EU)."
"This results in some accounting differences with regard to recog-
nition and measurement."
"These primarily relate to management remu-
neration and the measurement of equity interests, receivables and lia-
bilities, measurement of provisions, financial instruments and deferred 
taxes."
"The annual financial statements of Daimler Truck Holding AG are pre-
pared in accordance with accounting regulations under commercial 
law and the supplementary provisions under stock corporation law."

share entitled to dividends."
"The amount of the total dividend payout 
will be reduced according to the changed number of no-par value 
shares entitled to dividends."
"The amount of the profit carried forward 
will be increased accordingly."
"The amount to be allocated to retained 
earnings will remain unchanged."
"The economic position of Daimler Truck Holding AG in its function as 
a management company primarily depends on the development of its 
subsidiaries."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG participates in the operating 
results of the subsidiaries through the profit transfer of Daimler Truck 
AG."
"This means that the economic situation of Daimler Truck Holding 
AG corresponds to that of the Group as a whole, which is illustrated in 
the chapter E Profitability, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and 
Financial Position of the combined management report."
"Non-current assets remained unchanged from the prior year at 
€15,100 million and consisted exclusively of the 100% equity interest in 
Daimler Truck AG shown under financial assets."
"Receivables and other assets rose by €3,805 million year-on-year 
to €6,570 million and mainly included receivables from affiliated com-
panies of €6,416 million."
"In the amount of €5,511 million, these largely 
resulted from the control and profit and loss transfer agreement with 
Daimler Truck AG and in the amount of €873 million from receivables 
from intra-group clearing transactions within the scope of central 
financial and liquidity management."
"Due to the cash management 
structure, the operating bank account of Daimler Truck Holding AG is 
balanced daily."
"Cash flow from operating activities amounted to minus €78 million 
in the 2023 financial year (2022: minus €20 million)."
"Compared to pre-
vious year, the reduction in operating profit had a negative impact on 
cash flow from operating activities."
"Cash flows from investing activities in the 2023 financial year 
came to €1,393 million (2022: €1,218 million) and resulted from the 
profit transfer of Daimler Truck AG."
"Cash flow from financing activities of minus €1,315 million (2022: 
minus €1,198 million) in the 2023 financial year resulted mainly from 
the change in receivables and liabilities of intra-group clearing transac-
tions within the scope of central financial and liquidity management."
"The equity of Daimler Truck Holding AG rose by €3,634 million to 
€21,302 million in the reporting year."
"As of December 31, 2023 Daimler Truck Holding AG 
held treasury shares in the amount of €18 million (2022: €0 million)."
"Provisions rose by €109 million to €124 million and resulted primarily 
from tax provisions, personnel provisions, other legal obligations and 
the obligation to prepare and audit the annual financial statements."
"Liabilities rose by €62 million to €244 million and mainly included lia-
bilities from the fiscal entity for VAT purposes (€218 million)."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG generally par-
ticipates in the risks of the associated companies and subsidiaries of 
the Daimler Truck Group in proportion to its respective ownership 
interest."
"The risks and opportunities are presented in the chapter 
E Risk and Opportunity Report of the combined management 
report."
"In addition, relationships with our subsidiaries and associated 
companies may result in charges arising from legal or contractual con-
tingent liabilities (in particular financing) as well as impairments of the 
shares in Daimler Truck AG."
"Based on the criteria set out in the chap-
ter E Risk and Opportunity Report of the combined management 
report, the extent and probability of occurrence of the opportunities 
are considered to have decreased compared to previous year."
"The 
overall risks of the Daimler Truck Group are considered to be on the 
same level as previous year."
"The aforementioned period is ten years for pension obligations based 
on the German Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz) estab-
lished prior to the effective date of the spinoff and hive-down."
"Daimler 
Truck Holding AG does not expect any outflow of liquidity in this 
respect due to the sufficiently available special-purpose assets of the 
other legal entities."
"The provisions in this context, in particular the procedure for regulat-
ing internal compensation between the participating legal entities, can 
be found in the Group separation agreement, which is an annex to the 
spin-off and hive-down agreement of August 6, 2021."
"The spin-off and 
hive-down became effective on December 9, 2021 by entry in the 
commercial register."
"On the basis of the current assessment, an actual outflow of liquidity 
from Daimler Truck Holding AG is considered unlikely."
"For 2024, we expect the net profit of Daimler Truck Holding AG to be 
significantly below the level of the 2023 financial year."
"In particular, we 
anticipate a significantly lower profit transfer from Daimler Truck AG."
"Furthermore, due to the interconnectedness of Daimler Truck Holding 
AG with the Group companies, we refer to our statements in the chap-
ter E Outlook of the combined management report, which in partic-
ular also reflect the expectations for the parent company."
"We take 
the associated responsibility for our employees, the environment and 
society very seriously."
"We view sustainability holistically and as an 
integral part of our core business."
"We also use the United Nations’ 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide."
"With their help, we 
are working out the details of our own commitment to sustainable 
development and to respecting human rights."
"The framework that guides our responsible actions is called “ESG” 
(Environment, Social, Governance)."
"Accordingly, we focus our sustain-
ability activities on the three topic areas of corporate governance, 
environment and social issues."
"Governance
Our aim is to be a company that business partners want to work with 
in the long term and where employees like to work."
"In brief: a company 
to trust."
Our actions are based on responsibility.
"We want to adhere to 
corporate governance rules and integrate sustainability into our short 
and long-term decisions."
"In addition, we encourage open dialog with 
our stakeholders and support environmental and social initiatives."
"We 
manage compliance and ESG risks with proven systems – backed up 
by our internal audits."
"We also ensure transparent sustainability 
reporting to the capital market."
"On this basis, we set our goals and 
manage their achievement with corresponding key performance indi-
cators."
"A focus area in the reporting year was the preparation for the new EU 
legislation on sustainability reporting, the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (CSRD)."
"In addition to incentives for the financial 
performance of the Board of Management and senior managers in the 
short- and long-term variable remuneration, our compensation system 
also includes non-financial performance criteria with regard to sustain-
ability."
"Further information on the remuneration of the Supervisory Board and 
the Board of Management can be found on w www.daimlertruck."

neration-of-the-supervisory-board and w www.daimlertruck.com/

ation-of-the-board-of-management."
"Environment
As an organization with responsible corporate governance, we are 
dedicated to protecting the environment and the climate."
"We are com-
mitted to the goals of the Paris Agreement and are paving the way 
towards CO₂e-neutral transportation."
"From 2039, we plan to offer only 
vehicles that are locally CO₂e-free in driving operation in Europe, Japan 
and the USA."
"We now offer ten battery electric models in series pro-
duction that are used by customers worldwide."
The supply chain also forms part of our sustainability efforts.
"We 
expect our suppliers to act in accordance with the legal requirements 
for environmental protection."
"We also require our direct suppliers to 
comply with our Company’s sustainability standards."
"We also want to contribute to the goal of making the transport of 
goods and people CO₂e-neutral by constantly improving our produc-
tion."
"We want to make production CO₂e-neutral on balance worldwide 
by 2039."
"We have already reached one milestone: our European pro-
duction plants are CO₂e-neutral on balance."
"Our production sites in 
India, Japan and the USA are also expected to be CO₂e-neutral on bal-
ance by 2025."
"Social
There are three areas at the heart of our social responsibility: our 
employees, respecting and protecting human rights, as well as road 
user safety."
"We employ more than 100,000 people worldwide."
"They are 
our most important asset and we aim to take a variety of measures to 
ensure that they feel comfortable in the workplace, that they can 
develop their potential, maintain their health and that their human 
rights are respected."
We also want to take social responsibility for our supply chain.
"Our 
goal is that our suppliers also respect social standards and support 
our sustainability work with regard to human rights."
"For example, we 
require our direct suppliers worldwide to comply with human rights 
standards, and to communicate these standards to their direct suppli-
ers and ensure compliance within their sphere of influence."
"The safety of our products is part of our DNA and one of our most 
important obligations — not just toward our customers, but toward all 
road users."
We aim to prevent road traffic accidents.
"That is why we 
are continuously enhancing our safety and assistance systems and 
advancing autonomous driving."
"Our aim is to develop our products in 
accordance with the highest safety standards, which we regularly ver-
ify through internal quality controls and external certifications."
"Within the Board of Management, Chairman 
Martin Daum is responsible for the topic of sustainability in accor-
dance with the rules of procedure."
"At regular intervals, the Supervi-
sory Board is informed by the Board of Management about the strat-
egy of the Daimler Truck Group and its individual segments, which, in 
addition to long-term economic goals takes into account ecological 
and social objectives."
"Two members of the Supervisory Board's Audit 
Committee also have expertise in the area of sustainability reporting 
and its auditing."
"Further information can be found in the chapter 
E Declaration on Corporate Governance and in the sec-
tions E Overall requirements profiles for the composition of the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and E Qualifica-
tion matrix for the Supervisory Board."

tional structures are intended to strategically support our sustainabil-
ity goals."

and G working groups are responsible for this."
"Within the legal and compliance organization, the sustainability man-
agement department deals with the relevant Group-wide control 
issues."
"In addition to sustainability reporting, it is also responsible for 
the further development of the sustainable business strategy, human 
rights compliance and stakeholder management."
"This function reports 
to the Chairman of the Board of Management via the Company’s Chief 
Legal and Compliance Officer."
"Under the leadership of the Chairman of 
the Board of Management, the Corporate Sustainability Board 
meets at least twice a year."
"The Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) is composed of 
senior management level representatives of the segments and repre-
sentatives of various functional units."
"The SSC, under 
the direction of the Chief Legal & Compliance Officer, advises – 
as required – on the course of action at least once a quarter 
and assesses the sustainability performance reported by the 
working groups."
"The processing of the focus topics from the sustainable business 
strategy is organized and structured by the respective responsible 
departments in working groups."
"Progress made and any important 
decisions are reported to the SSC and the CSB or submitted to 
them for a decision."
"By policies we mean framework-setting, internal regulations of the 
Daimler Truck Group, which directly binds all employees and members 
of managing bodies as defined in the scope of application."
"A central 
team is responsible for the global policy management and the associ-
ated processes, which are regulated within the policy on policy man-
agement."
"To ensure the transparency and efficiency of the policies, all 
employees have access to all Daimler Truck policies at any time via the 
central policy platform."
"Risk and opportunity management
Risk and opportunity management is an integral part of the Group-
wide planning, management and reporting process."
"It is intended to 
support the achievement of the Company’s goals in a sustainable man-
ner and to raise awareness of associated risks within the Company."
"There was no occurrence of seri-
ous non-financial risks in the reporting year."
"Detailed information can 
be found in the chapter E Risk and Opportunity Report."
"Materiality analysis
GRI 2-14, 3-1/-2
As the basis of our sustainability reporting and to help shape our sus-
tainable business strategy, we conducted a materiality analysis in the 
summer of 2022 which is also valid for the 2023 reporting year."
"Based 
on the corporate strategy, regulatory developments and current indus-
try trends, we identified our material topics and prioritized them."
"For a 
holistic view, we analyzed both the business relevance of sustainability 
issues and their impact on our environment and the people around us."
"These two perspectives were explored through the involvement of vari-
ous stakeholders."
"We examined the positive and negative impact of 
our business activities with a comprehensive competitor analysis, an 
SDG impact assessment and expert interviews."
"We then looked at the 
impact of sustainability issues on our business performance and 
results through an online survey of both our employees and our truck 
fleet customers and analyzed the relevant ESG rating requirements."
"B.26
Materiality Analysis
The results of the analysis, including recommendations for action, 
were presented to the Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) and 
the Corporate Sustainability Board (CSB)."
"The results of the materiality 
analysis confirm the focal topics for our sustainable business strategy."
Eight areas of action were identified as material.
"From an external and 
internal perspective, the focus is on the ecological aspects of our busi-
ness – above all, on combating climate change, resource efficiency 
and preventing pollution."
"The social requirements of respect and pro-
tection for human rights as well as occupational health and safety 
were also highly rated, especially by our employees."
"These topics con-
stitute the most relevant themes for us on which we want to increas-
ingly focus our sustainability management and reporting in the future."
"The topics of green supply chain, compliance and traffic safety will 
also be important."
"Climate change mitigation &
	
	 adaptation to climate change
	2."
"Traffic safety
Further topics
	9."
"
Diversity, equity & inclusion
	10."
"Good corporate governance
	12."
"The results will form the basis for the next report 
and the materiality assessment should be completed by the end of the 
first quarter of this year 2024."
"Compliance, underpinned with 
rules and a corresponding compliance culture are therefore very 
important to us."
"Compliance and responsible corporate governance are central to our 
understanding of sustainable business."
"Therefore, we operate an 
established Compliance Management System (CMS), which comprises 
programs and processes to comply with legal requirements and to pre-
vent misconduct."
"We inform and raise awareness among our employ-
ees on compliance topics through numerous training measures and 
communication campaigns."
"Compliance Management System
With our CMS we want to ensure compliance with laws and guidelines 
within the Company and promote compliant behavior."
"The measures 
needed for this are defined by our compliance and legal organizations 
in a process that also takes the Company’s business requirements and 
specific risk situation into account."
"The CMS is based on national and 
international standards and is used worldwide."
"It consists of seven ele-
ments that are complementary and are explained in more detail below."

"Corporate culture and compliance values
Our goal is for all employees to know and comply with the Group-wide 
Daimler Truck Code of Conduct, to behave responsibly, with integrity 
and in accordance with the rules."
"Our Code of Conduct serves us as a 
general standard of values: It sets the guidelines for our actions and 
helps us to make the right decisions."
"The guidelines apply to all 
employees of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG as well 
as to the controlled Daimler Truck Group companies, are available in 
twelve languages and are available at any time for all employees via 
the central guidelines platform."
"The Code of Conduct was published 
after revision in February 2023."
"It is based on the Daimler Truck Pur-
pose Principles."
"With these we have defined four key principles that 
drive us in our daily work:
	
— We start with listening."
— We lead with the long view.
"Compliance objectives
The Chief Legal and Compliance Officer and the Compliance Board are 
responsible for setting the objectives of the compliance program in 
line with our compliance strategy."
"The compliance strategy is derived 
from the corporate objectives as well as applicable laws, regulations, 
voluntary commitments, and the Daimler Truck Purpose Principles."
"Compliance organization
GRI 2-16/-25
Our compliance organization is organized regionally and in line with 
our functions (Center of Competences)."
"In this way, it can provide 
effective support – for example, through guidelines and recommenda-
tions."
Functional or regional contacts are available for this purpose.
"Therefore, a global network of local contacts ensures that our compli-
ance standards are upheld."
"The network supports the management of 
the Group companies in implementing our compliance program locally."
"In addition, the Compliance Board manages overarching issues and 
monitors whether our measures are effective."
"The Board has the task 
of responding at an early stage to changes in business models and in 
the business environment, picking up on regulatory developments and 
continuously developing the CMS."
"The Compliance Board is composed 
of representatives of the Compliance and Legal departments, meets 
regularly and is chaired by the Chief Legal and Compliance Officer."
"From the Company’s perspective, the 
compliance network’s independence from the segments is assured by 
the direct reporting line to the Legal and Compliance department and 
to the Chairman of the Board of Management."
"Compliance risks
We regularly and systematically examine and evaluate all controlled 
Group companies, majority shareholdings and our own central depart-
ments worldwide in order to minimize compliance risks."
"Centrally 
available data and, if necessary, local information are accessed."
"The 
results of regular compliance risk evaluations form the basis of our 
risk management."
"We use them to implement targeted risk-minimizing 
measures worldwide."
"This risk management approach serves as a 
framework for all compliance fields."
"As part of the 2023 risk manage-
ment cycle, all existing risk ratings were reviewed at the end of 2022 
and adjusted where necessary."
"Based on these risk classifications, 
measures were handed over to the affected units to be implemented."
"New companies were assessed separately and risk ratings and mea-
sures were agreed upon."
"As part of the replacement of the previous 
risk management approach in the reporting year, all high-risk business 
units were re-assessed in a first wave and individual packages of risk 
reduction measures were assigned."
"Starting from the beginning of 
2024 all remaining business units shall be introduced to this new 
approach."
"The individual measures are derived 
from the findings of our systematic compliance risk analysis."
"Areas of 
focus include, among other things: continuous awareness of compli-
ance and adherence to relevant processes, consistent follow-up of 
reports of misconduct, and the formulation of clear requirements for 
the conduct of our business partners."
"The key compliance program elements are explained in more detail 
below."
"Reporting of rule violations via 
the whistleblowing system SpeakUp
GRI 2-25/-26/-27, 3-3, 207-2/-3
In the 2023 reporting year, the central whistleblowing system was 
renamed from Business Practices Office (BPO) to SpeakUp @ Daimler 
Truck – our whistleblowing system."
"The SpeakUp whistleblowing sys-
tem enables our employees worldwide, as well as business partners 
and third parties, to report violations."
"Reports to SpeakUp draw our 
attention to possible risks for the Group, employees and third parties 
and help prevent damage."
"As part of the renaming of the whistleblowing system, the platform 
SpeakUp was introduced in the 2023 reporting year and improvements 
were made to the reporting of potential violations."
"The integrated 
SpeakUp platform enables all employees and third parties worldwide 
to report potential misconduct to the whistleblowing system in writing 
via a protected website or by voice message via a free telephone num-
ber."
"In both cases, the language of the report can be freely selected, 
with the new platform offering a more extensive language selection 
and making contact possible at any time."
"Information can also still be 
sent to the whistleblowing system SpeakUp by email or post."
"In Ger-
many, an external, neutral intermediary is available to whistleblowers 
as an additional contact point."
"In all cases, a report can also be sub-
mitted anonymously."
"A globally valid Group policy regulates the procedure of the SpeakUp 
whistleblowing system and the corresponding responsibilities."
"Its aim 
is to ensure a fair and transparent procedure that takes into account 
both the principle of proportionality for the person affected and the 
protection of the whistleblower."
"The policy also serves as a benchmark 
with which we assess violations and decide on the consequences."
"The department follows up on the tip-off and processes 
the report independently."
"Violations with a low risk for the company 
include, for example, theft, fraud or undue assets offenses with a value 
of less than €100,000 - provided they do not relate to corruption."
"If the whistleblowing system SpeakUp classifies a tip-off related to 
Daimler Truck’s own business area as a major risk violation after an 
initial risk-based assessment, it assigns the case to an investigating 
unit."
SpeakUp tracks the case until it has been closed.
"Violations with 
major risks include, for example, corruption, antitrust and money laun-
dering offenses as well as violations of technical specifications or vio-
lations of environmental regulations."
"Cases of sexual harassment, dis-
crimination or racism as well as other human rights violations are also 
major risk violations."
"In order to continually increase trust in our whis-
tleblowing system SpeakUp and to further raise awareness, especially 
among our employees, various communication measures are used."
"Potential violations of our Business Partner Standards, in particular 
human rights violations and violations of environmental protection reg-
ulations by our direct and indirect suppliers, can also be reported to 
the whistleblowing system SpeakUp."
"Reports received through the 
system are forwarded to the responsible department for the internal 
complaint procedure."
"In the 2023 reporting year 24 new major-risk cases were opened via 
the whistleblowing system SpeakUp."
"Out of the newly opened cases, 
ten cases fell into the category “severe cases of sexual harassment, 
discrimination and racism”, two cases fell into the category “reputa-
tional damage” and one case fell into the category “fraud (over € 
100,000)”."
"Another eight cases fell into the category “damage (over € 
100,000)”, one case into the category “undue enrichment (over € 
100,000)”, one case into the category “severe violations of the integ-
rity of the whistleblowing system” and one case into the category 
“other major risks”."
"In these 20 cases, a concrete initial suspi-
cion was confirmed."
"Here, the 
company decides on appropriate measures, taking into account pro-
portionality and fairness."
"The personnel measures in the reporting 
year 2023 included extraordinary terminations, final warnings, written 
and verbal warnings, voluntary resignations as well as a relocation and 
a termination agreement."
"Further information and contact details can be found on
w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/compliance/whistleblowing-
system-speakup."
"Collaboration with sales partners and suppliers
GRI 2-23
For us, a shared understanding of values forms the basis for success-
ful collaboration with our partners."
"Our Business Partner Standards, 
which outline in detail our expectations of partners were revised in the 
reporting year."
"We provide the standards to all our business partners, 
including our suppliers."
"The Business Partner Standards can be found 
on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/compliance/compliance-
of-our-business-partners."
"In these, we summarize all of our require-
ments for our business partners for sustainable business and formu-
late our expectations with regard to working conditions, the respect 
and protection of human rights, the environment as well as compli-
ance."
"For our suppliers, further requirements are contained in our con-
tractual conditions on social responsibility and environmental protec-
tion as well as the compliance contractual clauses."
"We also provide 
our business partners with a specifically developed compliance aware-
ness module."
"The module raises awareness of current requirements 
and offers our suppliers and sales partners assistance in dealing with 
possible compliance risks."
"Further information about the module can 
also be found on w www.dt-compliance-awareness-module.com/en/."
"We check direct business partners, especially sales partners and sup-
pliers, as part of risk-based due diligence processes."
"In the reporting 
year, we checked new direct sales partners for compliance risks."
"Using 
a permanent monitoring process, we also examine all existing sales 
partners with the aim of identifying possible behavioral violations."
"Existing direct suppliers are regularly checked for risks - in particular 
human rights risks - in order to identify them and address them in a 
follow-up process."
"A risk-based due diligence check is also carried out 
for new suppliers before they are commissioned, which particularly 
takes human rights issues into account."
"Further information can be found on w supplier.daimlertruck.com/
portal/en and in the chapters E Green supply chain and  
E Human Rights."
"M&A Compliance program
We also carry out compliance risk assessments for M&A projects."
"The 
objective of those risk assessments is to detect all corruption-relevant 
circumstances as well as to determine all issues relating to the trans-
action partner's reputation and integrity that affect or undermine the 
transaction."
"In addition, the relevant sanction lists and the require-
ments for combating money laundering and terrorist financing are also 
considered in each transaction."
"If required, technical compliance and 
human rights compliance aspects, as well as data and IT compliance 
issues, are also included in the compliance risk assessment of an M&A 
transaction."
"In case of relevant findings, the necessary compliance 
measures are defined."
"In general, our standard compliance clauses for M&A contracts include 
aspects of good and sustainable corporate governance, compliance 
with laws and respect for human rights."

the latest findings and content is developed further."
"The contents and 
topics of the training courses are tailored to the roles and functions of 
the respective target group."
"A web-based and target group-oriented 
training program is available for employees in administrative areas, 
consisting of a range of mandatory modules."
"Employees from produc-
tion and production-related areas can voluntarily take part in the train-
ing program."
"The training modules are assigned when an employee is 
hired, promoted or transferred to a function that involves an increased 
risk."
"The web-based training measures are available worldwide via a 
Learning Management System."
"We are supplementing our web-based training program with face-to-
face training, some of which we conducted in virtual form in 2023."
"We 
also offer information and qualification measures for supervisory and 
management functions."
"As part of an executive onboarding program, 
we provide information about legal and compliance topics in order to

"Monitoring and improvements
GRI 2-25
We have established various internal mechanisms to check the exist-
ing CMS for appropriateness and effectiveness."
"Using an annual monitoring process, we 
review the programs, processes and measures of the CMS and analyze 
whether they are appropriate and effective."
"This involves accessing 
centrally available data and, if necessary, local information."
"Indications 
of ineffective implementation of measures are recorded and reported 
as part of monitoring and corresponding remedial measures are 
defined."
"If changing risks or new legal requirements make it neces-
sary, we also adapt our processes and measures in the CMS."
"Addition-
ally, Corporate Audit reviews compliance aspects in the context of 
their risk-oriented process checks on a regular basis."
"Furthermore, the 
setup of the new risk management and monitoring process within the 
Legal & Compliance department was audited and reviewed for 
improvement potential in 2023."
"The compliance risk and monitoring 
process at Daimler Truck is carried out for all compliance fields 
anchored in the Legal & Compliance department."
"Compliance fields 
that are in the process of being set up are subject to an adequacy 
check."
"Compliance programs and processes along established compli-
ance areas are also examined for their effectiveness."
"These monitoring 
results and other possible measures, as well as the review of the com-
pliance strategy, are evaluated and decided on by the Compliance 
Board once a year."
"
▴
For the reporting year, there were no indications that the compliance 
programs, processes or measures adopted were not appropriate or 
not effective in the context of the risk situation of the Company."
"▾ Compliance management focus areas
Value-based compliance is an indispensable part of our daily business 
activities."
"Our intention is to encourage compliant conduct throughout 
the entire Company around the world by taking specific measures."
"In 
the following, we explain how we are pursuing our main objectives, 
what are the regulations and policies providing us with direction in this 
regard, and which specific measures we are implementing."
"We therefore critically examine our 
business partners and transactions and deal with authorities and pub-
lic officials in a particularly sensitive manner."
"An important component of our anti-corruption compliance program is 
the Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International, which 
is taken into account as a central parameter in risk assessments."
"We 
see increased risks of corruption particularly in sales activities in high-
risk countries as well as in our business relationships with authorized 
dealers, general agents and suppliers worldwide."
"Our standard compli-
ance clause for contracts requires all business partners to have appro-
priate anti-corruption procedures and measures in place."
"Preserving and promoting fair competition
Our Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Program is aligned with national 
and international standards to ensure fair competition."
"It comprises a 
binding, globally valid Daimler Truck Group standard that defines how 
matters of antitrust law are to be assessed by the Legal and Compli-
ance department and how the work with trade associations has to be 
carried out."
"The Group-wide Daimler Truck standard is based on the standards of 
the underlying European regulations and takes established legal prac-
tice at European antitrust authorities into account, as well as the laws 
of European courts."
"Guidelines are also intended to support our employees across our 
worldwide operations identify critical antitrust situations and behave 
in accordance with the regulations."
"This is particularly important when 
contacting competitors, working with retailers and general agents, and 
working on committees in associations."
"In order to create transpar-
ency in our employee dealings with associations spanning the world, 
we rolled out a standardized, centrally controlled documentation solu-
tion in this reporting year."
"Ensuring compliance with technical and regulatory require-
ments for our products
For us, product compliance means compliance with technical and reg-
ulatory requirements, standards and laws that are relevant to business 
activities around the world."
"Our objective is to identify risks within the product creation process - 
i.e., in product development and certification – as well as in product 
reliability processes at an early stage, including the implementation of 
preventative measures."
"In doing so, we take into account the funda-
mental objectives of relevant laws and regulations as well as internal 
specifications and processes in development and production as well 
as after the vehicles have been placed on the market."
"The Product Compliance Management System (PCMS) defines princi-
ples, structures and processes in order to provide our employees with 
guidance and security, in particular for challenging situations on inter-
preting technical regulations."
"Furthermore, the PCMS also includes 
minimum standards for handling our products in the field regarding 
safety, regulatory conformity and emissions issues."
"Respect and protection of human rights
GRI 2-23/-24/-25
With our Human Rights Compliance Management System (Human 
Rights CMS), we rely on a systematic approach to fulfilling human 
rights due diligence obligations."
"The aim is to systematically evaluate all Group companies and majority 
shareholdings in order to identify human rights risks and, if necessary, 
to implement preventative and remedial measures."
"Systematic risk 
analysis and specific measures tailored for those identified risks serve 
to fulfill our due diligence obligations in the supply chain."
"Handling and 
processing information about potential human rights violations is also 
an integral part of the Human Rights CMS."
"The SpeakUp whistleblow-
ing system provides employees and external whistleblowers with vari-
ous channels to point out suspected human rights violations, report 
rule violations and demand remedial action."
"Further information can be found in the section “Reporting violations 
of the rules via the whistleblowing system SpeakUp” and in the chap-
ter E Human Rights."
"However, data not only opens up business opportunities, but its han-
dling requires special care as comprehensive data protection require-
ments apply both in Europe and globally."
"We adopted a commitment to data responsibility with the aim to 
define a clear framework on how we handle data based on the three 
guiding principles of “added value”, “business potential” and “respon-
sible use of data”."
"Our Global Data and Information Policy lays the 
foundation for responsible and compliant handling of information and 
data worldwide."
"It defines a binding minimum standard for all Group 
units."
"The more comprehensive data protection requirements of the 
EU GDPR are addressed by the EU Data Protection Policy."
"The Data 
CMS integrates all these elements as well as local data privacy 
requirements in a structured approach."
"The Data CMS supports the 
Group in systematically planning, implementing, and continuously 
monitoring measures to ensure compliance with the data protection 
requirements."
"The Chief Data Privacy Officer performs the tasks defined by law to 
comply with data protection regulations."
"Her contact details are pub-
licly available."
"The Chief Data Privacy Officer is available at any time as 
a contact person for customers with data protection concerns."
"For all incidents that concern information security, Daimler Truck has 
established a central reporting procedure: The Information Security 
Incident Management process."
"Employees and contractors are asked 
to report any potential data protection and information security 
breaches this way."
"Isolated data protection incidents were reported to 
the responsible data protection supervisory authorities in the 2023 
financial year."
"In the reporting year, there were no cases in which data protection 
supervisory authorities conducted investigations based on customer 
complaints or data protection incidents reported by the Company."
"Therefore, we have implemented global minimum standards, pro-
cesses and safeguards throughout the Group."
"We have appointed a Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer who 
ensures compliance at Daimler Truck Holding AG and all of its con-
trolled Group companies."
"This role is responsible for Group-wide stan-
dards and processes pursuant to the German Anti-Money Laundering 
Act."
"The Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer is assisted by two Deputy 
Anti-Money Laundering Officers."
"One deputy is responsible for ensur-
ing compliance measures for the prevention of money laundering and 
terrorist financing for the Industrial Business (trade in goods), while 
the other deputy is responsible for the segment Financial Services."
"Our minimum standard, regardless of its applicability, are the sanc-
tions lists of the EU, the United Kingdom and the USA (including the 
US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and US Bureau of Industry 
and Security (BIS)) which are checked through an IT-system in every 
business transaction."
"Responsible sales 
We want to adhere to legal restrictions for deliveries of military com-
mercial vehicles and civilian commercial vehicles for military end use."
"For business with executive bodies with a state monopoly on the use 
of force, especially police and security authorities worldwide, we have 
internal processes that provide for our own critical review covering 
multiple aspects."
"In particular, the risk of human rights violations is 
considered."
"In individual cases, our evaluation process leads to the 
refusal of transactions that we cannot reconcile with our claim of sus-
tainable and responsible corporate management."
"The 
framework and rules provided by the tax department (e.g."
"guidelines, 
procedural instructions, tax measures) serve this objective and are 
anchored in the tax guidelines."
"— We deliver active risk management for the Group and its operational 
employees through an appropriate Tax Compliance Management 
System (Tax CMS)."
"— We pursue legal, active and non-aggressive tax planning based on 
business reasons (tax follows business)."
"This means that we, as a company, comply with our responsibility as a 
taxpayer."
"We also strive to work cooperatively, transparently, and con-
structively with tax authorities."
"In the process, we maintain our legal 
standpoints and defend our interests wherever we believe such 
actions are appropriate and legitimate."
"The Group’s tax strategy 
defines the framework for action, and this strategy is further specified 
and implemented by means of organizational and content-related poli-
cies, provisions, and instructions."
The worldwide responsibility for tax is allocated to our Head of Tax.
"Significant tax-relevant decisions are made in the Tax Compliance and 
Tax Risk Committee (TCRC), of which the Chief Financial Officer is a 
member."
"The TCRC is also kept informed on an ongoing basis about 
material tax issues."
"The tax policies regulate the responsibilities, tasks 
and duties of the persons entrusted with tax matters at Daimler Truck."
"In addition, they provide concrete implementation guidelines for meet-
ing relevant legal obligations and enhance our employees’ awareness 
of tax-related issues."
"In accordance with the Daimler Truck Code of 
Conduct, intentional violations of external and/or internal tax 
requirements must be reported and followed up."
"The same applies to 
the failure to correct incorrectly processed transactions."
Tax risk management is also part of the Tax CMS.
"Its function is to 
monitor and check whether tax obligations are met."
"This risk manage-
ment system, which is consistent across the Group, serves to identify 
and reduce tax risks and associated personal risks of employees act-
ing on behalf of the Group."
"It comprises numerous measures, such as 
ongoing monitoring or integration of tax risks in the internal control 
system and in the Group-wide risk management process in accor-
dance with the risk management policy."
"In the reporting year, we were 
not aware of any significant violations of tax laws that would have 
resulted in criminal proceedings."
"To this end, our HR Compliance translates relevant legal and regula-
tory requirements into policies, specialist concepts and process stan-
dards for management and HR processes."
"Group-wide responsibility 
for HR work and HR compliance is assigned to our Chief Human 
Resources Officer."
"The HR Compliance Management System is intended to contribute to 
the creation of a respectful, trusting and inclusive corporate culture, to 
ensure appropriate working and social standards throughout the 
Group and to ensure compliant HR work."
"Background checks for man-
agers and the implementation of sanctions and consequences are 
intended to contribute to the Company's compliance culture."
"We take the associated responsibility for our employees, 
for the environment and for society as a whole very seriously."
"The 
overarching goal is to assume social responsibility and to align corpo-
rate and social interests in the long term."
"To adapt our corporate goals to the needs and expectations of society, 
we encourage regular stakeholder engagement."
"In addition to the con-
tinuous exchange with our employees, customers and suppliers, we 
use our expertise to contribute to societal dialogue."
"We cooperate 
constructively with representatives from society and politics, e.g."
"by 
joining voluntary commitments with industry, science or non-govern-
mental associations."
"Specifically, the exchange is about finding sus-
tainable solutions to societal challenges."
"Dialogue with politics and society
GRI 207-3,415-1
We define political representation as the constant dialog with deci-
sion-makers at various political levels."
"These include politicians, mem-
bers of the government, public officials and representatives of interest 
groups, trade organizations and associations, which in turn maintain 
political contacts."
"We have set out our own principles for political dialog and for the 
responsible representation of interests and, with involvement of the 
management, compiled them into a Group policy."
"We follow the princi-
ple of political restraint and neutrality in our dealings with govern-
ments, political parties, delegates and officials."
"Deal-
ing with grants, making party donations and approaches to the politi-
cal representation of our interests is also governed by our Group pol-
icy on lobbying and political and party donations."
"Daimler Truck AG is 
listed in the EU transparency register as well as in the lobby register 
for representation of interests to the German Bundestag and the Ger-
man Federal Government."
"Employees of Daimler Truck controlled 
Group companies who represent political interests must report and 
register with the relevant department in accordance with the Group 
policy on lobbying work."
"With the above-mentioned tools we want to ensure that the political 
representation of our interests complies with applicable regulations 
and ethical standards."
"In this respect, we are especially careful to 
observe antitrust requirements when working in industry associations 
and cooperating with other companies."
"The policies mentioned above 
also define how we intend to address risks in connection with the 
political representation of our interests."
"We also address these risks in 
compliance processes applicable throughout the Group."
"Feedback 
related to our activities in the area of political representation of inter-
ests can also be captured by our whistleblowing system SpeakUp."
"In 
the reporting year we did not make any donations, neither monetary 
nor in kind, to political parties in any part of the world."
"This decision 
has been made independent of current political or economic events."
"These include among others the UN Global Compact, econsense, the 
sustainability initiative of the Federal Association of German Indus-
tries, Drive Sustainability and Hydrogen Europe."
"We use these forums 
to have a dialog with representatives across wider civil society."
"Among other things, we are involved in organizations that focus on the 
further development of alternative drives and innovative renewable 
technologies, such as the use of hydrogen."
"Diversity, equity and inclusion also play an important role for us, which 
is why as a member of the organization “Charta der Vielfalt e.V.” and 
the European Women’s Management Development Network e.V., the 
Group actively participates in discussions on these topics."
"In working groups of the aforementioned associations and initiatives 
that are relevant to our core business, we actively participate in asso-
ciation work."
"In this way we contribute our company-specific perspec-
tive and experience and help to advance the discussion in a fact-ori-
ented and qualified manner."
"Corporate citizenship
GRI 203-1
By corporate citizenship activities we mean all of the Group’s social 
activities, such as donations, corporate volunteering and disaster 
relief."
"These are aligned with the Group’s sustainable business strat-
egy and core business."
"An important part of our global social commitment includes donations 
to non-profit organizations and the sponsoring of social projects."
"Throughout the Group, donations are selected in accordance with local 
legal and internal Company criteria."
"In the reporting year, €8 million 
were paid out at national and international level."
"Due to the war in Ukraine and the earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, we 
focused on supporting local people by, among other things, providing 
vehicles for relief transport for various non-profit organizations."
"We 
also facilitated employees being able to drive the trucks for relief 
transport."
"The Company also made a donation to UNICEF and the Ger-
man Red Cross as part of its support for Turkey and Syria."
"Further-
more, a fundraising campaign was organized by the employees for the 
benefit of UNICEF, in which the amount donated by the employees was 
doubled by the Company."
"In addition, a large donation was made again 
in the reporting year to support the Ukrainian population, which was 
equally distributed amongst UNICEF, the German Red Cross and the 
World Food Programme of the United Nations."
"A total of €3 million 
were paid out as part of humanitarian aids."
"We also encourage our employees to get involved in social projects, to 
help shape the social environment at our locations and to support aid 
projects worldwide (corporate volunteering)."
"Another example of the commitment of our workforce is the “ProCent” 
initiative."
"Here, employees in Germany can donate the cents of their 
monthly salary."
"These amounts are doubled by the Company and flow 
into a support fund for national and international projects with a chari-
table purpose."
"Our employees suggest projects that could potentially 
receive money from this fund."
"In the 2023 reporting year - among 
other things - a cistern was purchased to supply water to a school gar-
den reducing the amount of water required."
"Also, at national level, a 
drone was purchased to protect fawns."
"At the international level, Pro-
Cent donations were used to implement projects, especially in Africa, 
such as the construction and financing of a supply warehouse in a vil-
lage in Togo."
"The same scheme provided the financing of knitting and 
sewing machines in Uganda to train young people with little or no for-
mal schooling."
"In total, 47 projects at the national level and seven proj-
ects at the international level were financially supported in the report-
ing year with a total amount of around €350.000."
"We want sustainable transportation to succeed and thus 
make a significant contribution to combating global climate change."
"The management is responsible for setting and reviewing strategic 
ambitions, such as the reduction of our CO2e emissions."
"Our organiza-
tional structure for the entire energy and environmental management 
on global and regional levels focuses specifically on the corresponding 
topics."
"Environmental and energy management at our sites
GRI 3-3
At our production sites, we implement environmental management 
systems according to EMAS and/or ISO 14001, which are regularly  
validated or re-certified."
"In addition, we have been working with 
ISO 50001 energy management systems at production sites in  
Germany, the USA and some other locations since 2012."
"In accordance with the above standards, environmental and energy 
management are firmly anchored in our organization."
"Their effective-
ness is regularly reviewed and verified by third-party experts."
"In the 
reporting year, 47 of our total of 50 relevant sites (production sites, 
development sites and test tracks) with a participation of ≥ 50% were 
certified in relation to environmental management and 18 locations 
were certified regarding energy management."
"This covers around 
80,000 employees for environmental management, (which corre-
sponds to around 99% of the relevant workforce), and around 50,000 
employees in relation to energy management (which corresponds to 
around 62% of the relevant workforce)."
"With the environmental and energy guidelines adopted by the Board of 
Management, we have defined our environmental policy and commit-
ted ourselves to an integrated improvement process with regard to 
environmental protection and the handling of energy, which includes:
1."
We address the environmental challenges of the future.
"
We develop products that are environmentally friendly over the 
whole life-cycle and contribute to sustainable transportation."
"
We constantly reduce the environmental impacts of our operations 
and strive for clean and green production."
"
We offer our customers a comprehensive service and information 
on the environmental life-cycle of our products."
"Our ambition is to deliver exemplary environmental performance 
worldwide."
"We provide our employees and stakeholders with comprehensive 
information on environmental performance and specific commit-
ments."
The guidelines are binding for all employees and for all locations.
"We 
also aim for them to be implemented in joint venture partnerships."
"We 
have defined responsibilities for the implementation and compliance 
with environmental protection measures and energy efficiency require-
ments in all functional areas and on all company levels, from develop-
ment and production to service and sales."
"
▴
▾ Environment
As a global company, we strive to enhance the quality of life and the 
environment in the regions in which we operate."
"The protection of the 
environment is not detached from other objectives: Rather, it is an 
integral part of our corporate strategy, which is geared towards long-
term value enhancement and sustainability."
"For us, environmental pro-
tection means being active in the following areas: climate change miti-
gation, climate change adaptation, resource preservation, energy 
efficiency, prevention of environmental pollution, management of 
water, waste, energy and hazardous substances."
"At the same time, the 
contribution to the circular economy and biodiversity is of particular 
importance to us."
"We are committed to identifying further environ-
mentally relevant challenges through a regular analysis based on the 
principle of double materiality."
"Material environmental topics
GRI 3-3
In order to obtain a holistic picture of our environmental impact and of 
the impact of the environment on Daimler Truck, we have identified 
material topics within our materiality analysis."
"The following environ-
mental topics were identified as material:
1."
"Climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation;
2."
"Prevention of pollution;
4."
"Further information can be found in the section “Materiality analysis” 
in chapter E Responsible Corporate Governance."
"From this report onwards, CO₂-equivalent (CO₂e) emis-
sions are reported."
"Daimler Truck is striving for resource-saving and climate-friendly pro-
duction."
"For this purpose, we have launched the “green production” 
initiative."
"Green production aims to reduce CO₂e emissions, increase 
the use of renewable energies, increase energy and water efficiency 
and reduce waste at the international production sites."
"By 2030, we aim to reduce energy consumption by around 590 GWh, 
water usage by around 470 thousand m³ and waste generation by 
40 kt (with mean values from 2013 and 2014 as a baseline)."
"For this 
purpose, specific target values were calculated for each of our produc-
tion plants."
"We are committed to investing in climate-protecting technologies and 
projects around the world to help meet national and global climate tar-
gets efficiently."
"Furthermore, we are pursuing a 42% reduction in production-related 
CO₂e emissions with regard to emission from 2021 to 2030."
"By 2030, 
at least 55% of energy is to come from renewable sources."
"In order to track the targets and the progress to achieving them, a 
green production database was launched, in which our plants world-
wide enter their efficiency and reduction measures."
"Using this data-
base, we track implementation progress and establish roadmaps for 
each production site to guide the achievement of the objectives."
"About one 
fifth of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe is produced on the 
roads as a result of the transportation of goods and passengers."
"We 
take climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation into 
account in our range of activities: During our product development, 
within the supply chain as well as in our production."
"We regard it as 
our mission to make transportation locally CO₂e-free on a global level 
through technical innovation."
"In this way, we aim to contribute to the 
decarbonization of the industry."
"We are pursuing the goal of CO₂e neu-
trality on the roads and throughout the entire value chain globally by 
2050, as well as locally CO₂e-free driving operation for new vehicles 
(tank-to-wheel) in the triad markets (EU, USA and Japan) by 2039."
"Additionally, we strive to achieve CO₂e-neutral production on the bal-
ance sheet (scope 1 & scope 2) worldwide by 2039."
"We are pursuing 
these goals in several steps and with several measures, such as 
increasing energy efficiency, increasing the use of renewable ener-
gies and the temporary use of compensation certificates."
"Since 
2022, we have been delivering CO₂e-neutral production on the bal-
ance sheet in our production plants in Europe and at some other 
sites (for the 2022 reporting year the remaining CO₂ emissions were 
compensated; from the 2023 reporting year on the CO₂e emissions 
will be compensated)."
"Starting from 2025, the production sites in the 
USA, India and Japan are expected to achieve CO₂e neutrality on the 
balance sheet as well."
"By 2039, all production sites worldwide should 
be CO₂e-neutral on the balance sheet using compensation certifi-
cates."
"Climate change mitigation through innovative products
Trucks’ and buses’ biggest influence on climate lies in their use-
phase, meaning with customer vehicle use and driving behavior."
"Therefore, a vehicle that is fuel-efficient, energy efficient and cli-
mate-friendly from the outset is an essential prerequisite for a contri-
bution to climate change mitigation in the transport sector."
"We are 
working purposefully to make vehicles more environmentally friendly 
and, in particular, to focus on product-related climate protection."
"In 
our technology strategy, we have defined two focus areas: The pow-
ertrain and the operating system of a commercial vehicle."
"On the 
drive technology side, we are keeping the combustion engine com-
petitive and are developing vehicles that are locally CO₂e-free in driv-
ing operation with battery and hydrogen technology."
"With regard to 
the operating system, we aim to add value for our customers and the 
environment with innovative software and electronics solutions."
"In 
addition, we are also driving innovation in the infrastructure for the 
transformation of transportation."
"Early on we started to develop alternative drive technologies and 
already offer a large fleet of locally CO₂e-free vehicles in driving oper-
ation in various markets around the world."
"In the reporting year 
2023, we already had ten CO₂e-free truck and bus models in driving 
operation in series production in our core markets of the EU, USA 
and Japan."
"The product-related highlights of the reporting year 2023 
can be found in the chapter E Important events."
"In the coming years, more vehicles will follow not only with battery 
electric drive, but also with hydrogen-based drive."
"When 
it comes to hydrogen, in addition to fuel cells, we are now also pursu-
ing the hydrogen combustion engine technology path as an addition to 
our zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) drive technology."
"This increases not 
only the customer value, but also the effectiveness of our measures to 
achieve our goal of a locally CO₂e-free product portfolio in driving 
operation."
"We are relying on the legal framework for the hydrogen 
combustion engine to be adopted promptly in the short-term relevant 
core markets of the EU, the USA and Japan."
"With this dual strategy, we 
aim to achieve the goal of CO₂e-neutral transportation of goods and 
CO₂e-neutral passenger transportation on the roads worldwide by 
2050."
"Further information can also be found on w www.daimler-
truck.com/en/innovation/powertrain."
"A vehicle’s environmental impact 
— and that includes its CO2e emissions and pollutants — is largely 
determined during the first phases of its development."
"An important 
instrument for testing the environmental compatibility of a vehicle is 
the documentation accompanying the development process."
"Here we 
define specific characteristics and target values, for example, for fuel 
consumption and pollutant emissions that must be achieved for every 
vehicle model and every engine variant."
"Based on these target values, 
we assess our progress in the course of product development and ini-
tiate corrective measures as required."
"Legislators all over the world have set standards for emissions in order 
to regulate the emission of hazardous substances such as nitrogen 
oxides and particulates and to reduce air pollution."
"These emission 
limits have become ever more stringent over the past few years."
"EU legislation focuses on new vehicles for reducing CO₂ emissions in 
road traffic and sets out specific targets."
"For new heavy-duty trucks 
over 16 tonnes, it requires CO₂ emissions to be reduced on average by 
15% by 2025 and by 45% from 2030 for new heavy-duty trucks over 
five tonnes and heavy buses in comparison to the survey period from 
July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020."
"Heavy city buses receive a separate, 
dedicated Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) sales target of 90% from 
2030 and 100% from 2035."
"For this purpose, the European Commis-
sion, together with scientists and with the support of industry and 
other experts, has developed a uniform Europe-wide simulation pro-
gram called the Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO)."
"This also includes the relevant test and measurement procedures for 
CO₂ emissions and fuel consumption."
"The relevant data will be col-
lected throughout Europe and will be made transparent."
"A similar 
approach is taken in the US with the Greenhouse Gas Emission Model-
ling Program (GEM) from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and in Asia with the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association 
(JAMA)."
"Daimler Truck has defined a technology roadmap to offer 
locally CO₂e-free vehicles in driving operation while trying to meet all 
future global regulatory requirements."
"To comply with these limit values today and in the future, we are con-
tinuously developing our technologies."
"IT solutions and intelligent, 
integrated utilization concepts are intended to enable a further reduc-
tion in pollutant emissions in addition to efficient drive and emission 
control."
"Information on the topic of air pollution control in production 
can be found in the chapter E Prevention of pollution."
"We have therefore defined a strat-
egy to reduce the current diesel powertrain portfolio while remaining 
competitive."
"We are investing in the development 
of competitive products tailored to customers’ needs."
"When develop-
ing our all-electric trucks, we are focusing in particular on the aspect 
of customer co-creation."
"This means that product development 
includes collaborating with truck customers and has allowed us to 
ensure that customer feedback on the electric truck was taken into 
account early on in the development of the Mercedes-Benz eActros."
This is intended to be retained for future products on the process side.
"Our colleagues in the US market are also in regular contact with cus-
tomers on the topic of e-mobility for example within the scope of the 
“Electric Vehicle Council”."
"Moreover, when developing commercial 
vehicles with battery electric and hydrogen-based drive system tech-
nology, we maintain a dialogue with representatives of cities and with 
leading experts on the issues of urban and transportation develop-
ment."
"This provides us with valuable insights relating to new strategic 
initiatives."
"Battery development
GRI 306-2
Batteries are a key component of e-mobility."
"Our experts from a vari-
ety of disciplines deal with all aspects of this storage technology – 
ranging from fundamental research to production maturity."
"We have 
been investing in resource-efficient technologies and manufacturing 
processes for batteries for years and are continuously working on opti-
mizing the current lithium-ion battery."
"With our next-generation batter-
ies, we dispense with the otherwise common raw materials nickel and 
cobalt and replace them with lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP)."
"This way, 
we reduce our impact on people and the environment on the one 
hand, and on the other, we achieve a longer service life and increase 
safety in the vehicle."
"The LFP batteries are already used in some mod-
els and are to be predominantly installed in the future, taking into 
account further battery technology development."
"This also enables us 
to transfer our batteries to “2nd life applications” after the vehicle’s 
life and thus further extend the productive use of our storage systems."
"Our goal is to shorten development cycles, lengthen the range through 
better energy density and reduce charging times."
"We are consistently 
expanding our research and development activities."
"For example, we 
are developing our expertise regarding the technological evaluation of 
materials and battery cells."
"Furthermore, we are partnering with Accelera by Cummins Inc., PAC-
CAR and EVE Energy to accelerate and localize battery cell production 
and the battery supply chain in the United States."
"The planned joint 
venture will manufacture battery cells for electric commercial vehicles 
and industrial applications."
"InnoLabs
In order to further drive the transition to locally CO₂e-free trucks and 
buses in driving operation, we have established competence centers 
for battery and high-voltage systems, electrical drive components as 
well as for hydrogen-based fuel cell units and electrical drive systems."
"In the “InnoLabs”, short for innovation laboratories, employees from 
development and production departments work together closely."
"This 
gives us the opportunity to test new technologies, develop and evalu-
ate products and processes, while always focusing on their impact on 
our environment - not only in the product, but also in the selection of 
materials and in the manufacturing process."
"Through the close coop-
eration between the production and development departments, we 
ensure that the approach of remanufacturing, recycling and the circu-
lar economy more generally plays an essential role from the start of 
development."
"The InnoLab for eDrive and ZEV systems in the Gaggenau and Kassel 
plants in Germany, is part of the production and technology network 
for electric drive systems and their components."
"The aim of the Inno-
Lab eDrive is to prepare our plants for the future orientation of 2030 
with innovative products for a global modular system."
"The InnoLab is 
also responsible for the functionality of the entire system, which is 
heavily influenced by sustainability requirements, from product design 
to production capability and after-sales."
"In addition to the electric 
drive itself, our InnoLab is responsible for the complete functionality of 
the eDrive - from the software function of the inverter to the certifica-
tion of the energy label."
"In addition to the production of electric 
motors and the assembly of converters for electric drives, we will also 
evaluate other high-voltage components for production."
"The InnoLab 
Battery in the Mannheim plant is used for the development, testing 
and measurement of state-of-the-art battery production processes."
"It 
acts as a link between development and production and aims to 
ensure that our electric trucks are powered by cells and batteries that 
meet the latest technology standards."
"CO2 reduction and efficiency increase through digital products
GRI 305-5
In addition, we offer our customers a broad portfolio of services to 
reduce fuel consumption in diesel trucks or facilitate the transition to 
zero-emission vehicles."
"The services are marketed under the 
Mercedes-Benz (for example MB-Uptime) and Fleetboard (Mercedes-
Benz Region Europe and Latin America), Detroit Connect (Trucks North 
America), OMNIplus ON (Daimler Buses) and truckonnect (Trucks Asia) 
brands."
"Digital services in particular help to optimize fuel consumption, reduce 
wear and tear on the vehicle and reduce the risk of accidents."
"They 
provide in-depth information on the driver’s driving behavior as well as 
CO₂ emissions and help fleet managers and drivers use the vehicles as 
efficiently as possible."
"Typical use cases include driving style assess-
ment, driver coaching, CO₂ reports and support for safe driving."
Digital services also assist in the transition to CO₂e-free trucks.
"For 
example, the Charge Management service provides detailed informa-
tion on charging processes."
"Other services enable route planning and 
provide information on vehicle use, thus supporting fleet customers’ 
deployment planning."
"We make use of global services that are adapted 
to the various regional requirements."
"Driving forward the expansion of the necessary infrastructure
We are not only working on bringing new, locally CO₂e-free vehicles in 
driving operation to the market, but also speeding up the development 
of the available infrastructure for our customers to operate these vehi-
cles efficiently."
"In 2023, Daimler Buses Solutions GmbH was founded 
as a 100% subsidiary of Daimler Buses GmbH."
"The Company was 
founded out of the conviction that e-mobility can only fully realize its 
advantages with a holistic planning approach that takes all relevant 
aspects into account."
"The e-mobility ecosystem of Daimler Buses 
GmbH therefore consists of interlocking individual components with 
the aim of offering customers a sustainable and cost-optimal solution 
for electric bus fleets."
"Additionally, our facility in Redford, Michigan, 
has initiated activities to build a multi-function charging park for both 
trucks and cars."
"This park is designed to assist customers in their tran-
sition to using ZEVs."
"That is why we are a member of various partnership initiatives with the 
aim of achieving a CO2e-neutral transport environment in the future."
"This includes partnerships with suppliers and technology companies 
to develop our products, with energy and system companies to pro-
vide leading charging technologies, and with fuel companies to 
enhance the availability of liquid hydrogen at gas stations."
"To name 
specific examples, we have a joint venture with the TRATON GROUP 
and the Volvo Group to build up a charging infrastructure in 
Europe."
"The joint venture’s high-performance charging stations should 
be available for use by all battery electric heavy-duty vehicle fleet 
operators."
"Similarly, as a further example, we can name our joint ven-
ture with NextEra Energy Resources and BlackRock Renewable Power 
which has the goal of setting up a nationwide US charging network for 
battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles."
"Furthermore, in 
Europe, we have partnerships to set up an H2 infrastructure."
"Also 
worth mentioning are our ongoing partnerships to continue assisting 
our customers in depot charging until public charging infrastructure is 
further set up."
"In order to achieve TCO parity (total cost of ownership) and reduce 
costs, we use economies of scale and our partnerships while at the 
same time expanding our own know-how about differentiating technol-
ogies."
"To enable CO₂e-neutral transport, the focus is not solely on 
locally CO₂e-free vehicles in driving operation."
"Rather, success is 
based on the multiplication of three factors: locally CO₂e-free vehicles 
in driving operation, a green energy infrastructure for battery and 
hydrogen vehicles, and cost parity with conventional vehicles, for 
example through CO₂ pricing, CO₂-based tolls and subsidies."
"We continually evaluate 
the regional energy markets in order to expand the green energy sup-
ply at all locations."
"Since the beginning of 2022, the majority of our 
production sites in Europe have been supplied with green power from 
wind turbines, photovoltaic systems and hydroelectric power plants."
"For the German locations, it was contractually agreed with the supplier 
that the power provided is identical to the electricity consumption 
every quarter of an hour."
"This is tracked through regular TÜV certifica-
tion."
In this way we ensure a complete green electricity supply.
"By 
2025, all production sites in the USA, Japan and India are to be sup-
plied with 100% green power."
"All other, own production locations are to 
follow by 2030 at the latest."
"In addition to the purchase of green energy, we are constantly pushing 
forward the generation of our own energy at our production sites."
"In 
2023, we installed additional photovoltaic systems at our locations 
worldwide."
"Today, there is already around 20.6 MWp of installed pho-
tovoltaic module capacity worldwide, resulting in approximately 25.7 
GWh of power being potentially generated per year."
"We regularly check 
the availability of renewable energies at all locations and use them 
where market conditions permit."
"In 2023, the proportion of purchased 
energy from third parties was 99.4% of Daimler Truck’s energy con-
sumption."
"In the reporting year, Daimler Truck, EnBW and the city of Wörth am 
Rhein founded the joint venture “WärmeWerk Wörth GmbH”."
"This is 
intended to explore the possibilities of a climate-neutral energy supply 
for the Mercedes-Benz Wörth plant and the city of Wörth am Rhein 
through geothermal energy."
"The aim is to determine the geothermal 
usability and, if applicable, to build and operate a geothermal system 
for heat generation at the Wörth site."
"Energy generation through geo-
thermal energy offers the Wörth plant the opportunity to use an 
almost CO₂e-free energy source in the immediate vicinity for sustain-
able production."
"The current plan is to select a suitable site by 2025 at 
the latest."
"This will be followed by testing and development between 
2025 and 2027."
"As part of the green production initiative, we plan to reduce energy 
consumption at our production sites by around 590 GWh by 2030 (in 
relation to the years 2013 and 2014)."
"For this purpose, a large heat 
pump was installed at the Kawasaki plant in Japan, which can be oper-
ated much more efficiently than the previous systems."
"The exchange 
can save around 6,000 MWh of energy per year."
"Further measures were implemented at the international production 
sites."
"With the help of the green production database and internal 
company expert groups, there is a cross-plant exchange on efficiency 
measures and the feasibility checks at all Daimler Truck production 
sites."
"CO2e compensation
In the 2022 reporting year, we compensated for the remaining 
CO₂ emissions (scopes 1 & 2) at all European locations and at some 
other locations through qualified climate protection projects."
"Since the 
beginning of the 2023 reporting year, we have been compensating for 
remaining CO₂e emissions (scopes 1 & 2) at all European locations and 
at some other locations through qualified climate protection projects."
"All compensation projects meet the high quality threshold set by the 
Gold Standard."
"The Gold Standard for the global Sustainable Develop-
ment Goals sets the standard for climate and development interven-
tions to quantify and certify their impact."
"These projects not only avoid 
CO₂e emissions, they also promote sustainable, social and ecological 
development in the project countries in many ways."
"We consider CO₂e compensation as a means of transitioning to CO₂e-
free production."
"At the same time, we are working on further technical 
options to reduce CO₂e emissions at the production sites themselves."
"We achieve this by implementing efficiency measures and continually 
expanding the use of renewable energies."
"Our sustainability strategy aims to eliminate CO₂e emissions as far as 
possible in the future so that we can forego compensation."
"All remain-
ing CO₂e emissions of scopes 1 & 2 were compensated for at the fol-
lowing locations in the listed segments:
	
— Trucks North America (TN): Portland, Saltillo
	
— Mercedes-Benz (MB): Molsheim, Stuttgart (incl."
"Leinfelden-Echter-
dingen, Untertürkheim and Brühl), Wörth
	
— Trucks Asia (TA): Tramagal
	
— Daimler Buses (DB): Garcia, Holysov, Hosdere, Ligny, Mannheim, 
Neu-Ulm, Samano
	
— Segment-independent component plants: Gaggenau (incl."
"Werkteil 
Rastatt and Bad Rotenfels), Kassel, Mannheim
In 2023 a total of 263,409 tonnes of CO₂e were compensated for the 
above-mentioned locations."
"The following tables show the energy consumption and CO₂e emission 
developments over the last three years."
"The absolute energy consump-
tion has decreased by 2.6% compared to 2022."
"The share of renewable 
energies in total energy consumption remained the same."
"The specific 
energy consumption per vehicle was reduced for both trucks and 
buses."
"Absolute CO₂e emissions fell by 5.3% in the reporting year compared to 
the prior year."
"The main influencing factor here was the conversion of 
additional production plants to green energy supply."
"The specific CO₂e 
emissions were also reduced."
2	 Previous year’s value was updated due to the changeover from CO2 to CO2e.
"In many 
cases the extraction and further processing of primary raw materials 
is energy-intensive and leads to the emission of pollutants into water, 
soil and air."
"No less important is the fact that the use of natural 
resources also harbors social risks."
"A fair distribution of raw materials, 
secure access to clean drinking water, and upholding human rights in 
the course of raw material extraction are only a few of the challenges."
"We are continuously working on reducing resource consumption in our 
products."
"The areas of vehicle development, production planning and 
production in particular are responsible for using resources sparingly 
and designing and producing vehicles with the least resources possi-
ble."
"We make decisions concerning these areas in the specialist com-
mittees responsible for the respective model series."
"These commit-
tees consist of the subsection representatives and expert groups such 
as those dealing with specific groups of materials."
"When making fundamental decisions regarding construction concepts, 
production technologies and the use of materials, company manage-
ment is involved in various committees, in particular in the Board of 
Management meetings."
"A variety of factors are taken into account 
including costs, resource-efficient technologies and alternative materi-
als like secondary materials and renewable raw materials, as well as 
opportunities for industrialization."
"It is examined to what extent the 
results of development can be transferred to large-scale industrial 
production, for example with regard to the use of raw materials."
"Some 
of these substances can be categorized as scarce or critical."
"Further 
information can be found in the chapter E Green supply chain."
"We monitor the used quantities of those materials closely and try to 
continuously reduce the amount that is needed per vehicle."
"To this 
end, we incorporate the approach of “Design for Environment” as early 
as possible during the vehicle development stage."
"This means we 
design our vehicles to be as resource-conserving and environmentally 
friendly as possible during their entire life cycle."
"The cornerstones of 
this approach are lightweight engineering, the use of recycled materi-
als, as well as recycling and life cycle assessments."
"Furthermore, we anticipate future legal regulations and incorporate 
the expected requirements into product development at an early 
stage."
"Examples include the future changes in battery regulation with 
legally prescribed targets for recycling efficiency, raw materials to be 
recovered and their reuse in production via recycling quotas."
"Since 2015, 
this principle has been embedded in the EU’s Circular Economy Action 
Plan."
"We are increasingly focusing on measures that promote a circu-
lar economy."
"We pledge to the following waste hierarchy: The top goal 
is to avoid waste."
"In order to reach this goal, we are working to extend 
the service life of all vehicle components — for example, by using espe-
cially durable, long-lasting materials."
"We are also using resources effi-
ciently and reducing the use of raw materials that are only available in 
limited amounts."
"Only then measures will be taken to reuse various 
components and component parts for material recovery."
"To establish 
circularity along our value chain in the future, we have reorganized 
ourselves with a global strategy."
"Life Cycle Assessment
GRI 306-2
Many aspects of circular principles have a quantitative focus."
"For 
example, positive impacts of recycling or remanufacturing can be dem-
onstrated through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which helps us priori-
tize the most relevant factors influencing the circular economy."
"These 
aspects go hand in hand with LCA, a method for assessing the environ-
mental impact of a product over its entire life cycle."
We use LCAs as a holistic approach to assess our products.
"Our trucks 
and buses are examined over their whole life cycle (supply chain, pro-
duction, customer use and end-of-life phase) to identify potential 
improvements in environmental impact."
"Life cycle thinking, the results 
of the hot spot analysis and the analysis of the material life cycle steps 
are included in activities such as R&D, procurement and production – 
to further optimize the environmental footprint of our products."
"Last 
year we calculated LCAs for some of our vehicle models for our own 
production, but also for purchased parts and materials."
"In addition, the 
critical review of the LCA in accordance with the ISO standard ensures 
the data quality."
"As part of the world premiere of our Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 in 
October 2023, we published LCA data for the first time."
"The results 
show that the CO2e footprint of the Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 
depends heavily on the electricity mix used to charge the batteries."
"With the current European electricity mix in the reporting year, the 
Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 achieves CO2e savings of around 40% 
compared to a comparable Actros model with a diesel engine."
"This fig-
ure rises to more than 80% using fully renewable energies starting 
from raw material extraction over the entire product life cycle of ten 
years and total mileage of 1.2 million kilometers."
"The data and assumptions underlying the LCA, including the specifications for the functional units and methods, have a significant influence on the results."
A comparison with other truck models or vehicles is therefore neither intended nor recommended.
2	 Energy mix data source was provided by sphera.com.
"3	 Simulated with the Vehicle Energy Consumption Calculation Tool (VECTO 3.3.15, 3102)."
"This corresponds to a saving of between around 370 to 775 tonnes of 
CO2e."
"Two topics stand out in particular:
	
— The substitution of materials with more environmentally friendly 
alternative materials (e.g."
"renewable raw materials);
	
— The use of secondary raw materials, in coordination with our suppli-
ers, to implement a circular economy within our product portfolio."
"Our “R-strategies” to build a global circular economy
GRI 306-2
We are continually developing ourselves and the organization into an 
environmentally friendly and responsible company by striving for a cir-
cular value chain."
"Our goals are clearly defined: We want to reduce 
waste and environmental impacts to a minimum while maximizing the 
usability of resources."
"In order to achieve these goals, so-called 
“R-strategies” were introduced."
"The following graph shows the individual phases in the product life 
cycle using the example of a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV)."
"cleaning, safe storage,
testing, categorization, etc."

"To produce them, natural resources are needed."
"Our goal is to keep the consumption of natural resources as low as pos-
sible and to increase the use of recycled and renewable raw materials."
"For example, we have aluminum scrap recycled in order to return this 
recyclable material to our vehicles via the material cycle."
"This will not 
only conserve valuable resources but also reduce CO₂e emissions, 
because large amounts of energy are needed for aluminum smelting."
"However, with the expansion of e-mobility, the need for materials for 
vehicle production is changing."
"Metals such as lithium, cobalt or nickel 
are required for drive batteries in electric vehicles."
"Given the increas-
ing demand for these substances, it is an important task to ensure suf-
ficient availability."
"However, since the raw materials used in a battery 
electric vehicle will only be returned to the cycle after many years, 
until then, primarily newly mined raw materials will be used."
"This 
poses challenges for value chains that rely on such materials."
"One of 
our goals is to transform our entire value chain into as closed a cycle 
as possible."
"For example, we want to reuse our production waste and 
old materials as much as possible."
"We are looking to develop early solutions for other components, espe-
cially with a view to the transformation process for e-mobility compo-
nents, such as electric axles, adapted transmissions, fuel cells, batter-
ies or inverters."
"We are involved in a number of individual research 
projects in related areas, for example as part of the “EIC Accelerator” 
(European Innovation Council), at “REESilience” (extraction of rare 
earths from magnets) or at LiBInfinity (recycling of industrial batteries, 
EV batteries)."
"We take the findings from these partnerships and apply 
them to our own requirements and development processes."
"Reduce
Our activities on the topic of “Reduce” can be found in the sec-
tion “Waste” and in the chapter E Prevention of pollution."
"Repair, reuse
One of our primary objectives within the circular economy is to main-
tain or repair vehicles and their individual components."
"This does not 
only lead to a longer service life for the customer, but also avoids 
direct waste."
"If it is not economically viable to repair a vehicle, individual compo-
nents (for example mirrors, engine attachments and trim panels) may 
still be reused in the used parts market."
"Used Mercedes-Benz trucks with low mileage and low vehicle age can 
receive the label “Mercedes-Benz Trucks Certified” after a thorough 
technical inspection."
"Trucks with this label are no older than five years, 
have driven no more than 500,000 kilometers and have been techni-
cally tested and repaired according to stringent, uniform standards by 
our own TruckStores and branches or Mercedes-Benz contract part-
ners."
"We want to use this seal to further refine the profile of our used 
vehicle business and give our customers a special promise of quality 
and reliability."
"Remanufacture
If both repair and reuse do not apply, remanufacturing is a viable 
option."
"By remanufacturing, we mean reconditioning used original 
parts in such a way that their function, safety and quality are equiva-
lent to that of a new part."
"This is what the “Genuine Remanufactured 
Parts” brand stands for."
"The used parts, mostly engines, transmissions 
or other components, are collected by the different Daimler Truck seg-
ments in the respective regions via the branches or sales partners."
"The process for preparing the “core” parts is similar in all regions: the 
received material is removed and examined, comprehensively 
inspected for its quality, cleaned, prepared, subjected again to exten-
sive quality tests and eventually made available to the customer."
"This means that the remanufactured parts meet our high quality stan-
dards for new series production parts."
"Compared with the production 
of a new part, significantly fewer raw materials are required, which 
means that we contribute to resource conservation and a more posi-
tive environmental footprint of our vehicles."
"By extending the useful 
life of our vehicle parts and by reconditioning them, we promote a 
non-dependence on critical resources and at the same time contribute 
to closing the material cycle in the sense of a circular economy."
"With the transformation towards e-mobility, we as a company are 
already aligning ourselves with the future requirements of the market 
and our customers."
"The processing and the associated targeted 
improvement of the health status of the battery (State of Health - SoH) 
is part of this orientation."
"In the design phase to develop a processing 
concept for this new drive technology, it was clear that implementa-
tion could only take place if our quality standards were guaranteed."
"After intensively evaluating potential partners, we decided to initiate a 
cooperation with the series supplier of our high-voltage batteries."
"The 
processing of the high-voltage battery was developed, checked and 
worked out step by step with all responsible experts."
"Defining a holis-
tic approach for the battery and its further use and reuse was the cru-
cial criterion."
"The batteries that come to us after their first life in the 
vehicle are checked and then handed over to our partner."
"Extensive 
re-conditioning of the battery takes place there."
"It is important to 
understand that electronic components, in contrast to non-electronic 
components, cannot be completely restored to new condition."
"An 
acceptance inspection similar to the series batteries is always con-
ducted."
"The processed batteries can then be installed back in the vehi-
cle and used by our customers as usual, providing a sustainable and 
economical way to continue operating our electric buses after remov-
ing the previous battery generation."
"At Daimler Truck North America (DTNA), we have launched our battery 
remanufacturing activities in parallel with our vehicle activities to 
ensure seamless service for our customers."
"In addition to the remanu-
facturing business for high-voltage batteries, there are also remanu-
facturing activities for conventional components such as combustion 
engines, axles and gearboxes that have been established for years."
"As 
part of these activities, processes and procedures are further opti-
mized and questioned in order to reduce the environmental impact 
and meet future requirements."
"The need for remanufactured parts 
also changes with the transformation."
"In order to meet future market 
requirements, the Aftermarket Product Innovation Team at site has 
established a new process to strategically evaluate, design and intro-
duce new product offerings."
"A sensible and sustainable 
second-life application of our high-voltage batteries has been our goal 
since the beginning of production of our electric buses."
"Accordingly, 
possible scenarios for the reuse of batteries in electric vehicles con-
tinue to be evaluated."
"After their “first life” in the vehicles, the batteries are still in very good 
condition and are therefore too valuable to be recycled directly."
"Daimler Buses' idea was therefore to use the remaining capacity of the 
batteries."
"Applications for this include, for example, peak load reduc-
tion in the power grid, emergency power supply as an alternative to 
generators or lead-acid batteries, or the use of batteries to optimize 
self-consumption in combination with solar modules."
"This type of 
reuse is significantly more resource-efficient than direct recovery 
through recycling and makes an active contribution to the transition to 
a circular economy."
"From previous discussions with potential service providers, Mercedes-
Benz Energy GmbH has emerged as a suitable partner for Daimler 
Buses to realize the reuse of our batteries."
"This has already been implemented with a stationary storage system 
made of first-generation lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries 
(NMC batteries) as part of the “GUW” research project (regenerative 
and controllable direct current substation) at an eCitaro customer in 
Hanover."
"The storage system with a total capacity of more than 500 
kWh stabilizes the local tram power grid and enables cost-effective 
rapid charging of electric buses."
"The project is funded by the Federal 
Ministry of Economics and Infrastructure, and we are working with 
Mercedes-Benz Energy GmbH on an optimal logistics concept and an 
overall process that conserves resources."
"In addition, we are looking 
into other possible applications for storage solutions and are con-
stantly following developments on the market, with the aim of always 
being able to offer our customers the latest and most sustainable solu-
tion."
"At DTNA activities on the topic of repurposing batteries in the form of 
battery storage options are also already taking place."
"This will examine 
the extent to which modules with lower SoH values can be used to 
support the network and charging infrastructure."
"Recycling
Due to future legal requirements, economic and environmental frame-
work conditions, as well as general market developments, recycling in 
the sense of a universal circular economy for individual components is 
gaining in importance."
"Daimler Truck is looking at potential business 
models, production processes and recycling solutions for the core 
components of e-mobility, such as high-voltage batteries, fuel cells, 
the e-axle and other components."
"In addition to reducing waste, it also 
involves the reintroduction of the raw materials obtained into the pro-
duction cycle and positive financial effects, for example through lower 
purchasing volumes of raw materials."
"The recycling of our high-voltage batteries is intended for every sold 
electric vehicle."
"For this reason, only batteries that qualify to be recy-
cled are installed in our vehicles."
"In our buses, we pay attention to a 
range of aspects that we consider to be crucial for quality."
"Cell and material manufacturers are currently developing new recy-
cling methods along the value chain and are further expanding their 
recycling offering."
"In the future, new recycling service providers can be 
expected to enter the European market as well as increase the diver-
sity of material recovery technologies."
"Vehicle batteries are collected and disposed of via the Daimler Recy-
cling System, “DaRSy”."
"It is a centrally controlled recycling manage-
ment system in the area of workshop waste disposal (for example 
removal of vehicle parts, liquids and packaging of spare parts)."
"In addition to participating in publicly funded projects, the Center of 
Competence Recycling was established at the Gaggenau site at the 
beginning of 2022."
"The objective is to develop legally compliant, eco-
nomically viable and feasible recycling solutions for the drive compo-
nents (battery, electric motor and fuel cell) of electric vehicles as a first 
step."
"The results are intended to culminate in a Daimler Truck recycling 
strategy, which can be gradually expanded to other components in 
order to ultimately ensure that a vehicle can be recycled almost entirely."
"At DTNA we ensure that batteries will be handled in a safe and envi-
ronmentally friendly process by partnering with a battery recycler for 
all our facilities."
"We want to make sure that all materials that we use 
are able to re-enter the cell manufacturing process."
"We have therefore set ourselves the goal of reducing the 
amount of waste in production by around 40 kt and by around 12% per 
vehicle by 2030 (based on the average values for 2013 and 2014)."
"As 
part of this effort, it is important to ensure transparency concerning 
the waste value streams and to correctly separate the various types of 
waste."
"Our production plants have implemented local waste separa-
tion systems."
"We minimize waste such as offcuts, sand, filter materials and sludge 
through new or optimized production processes and close material 
cycles where possible."
"We are also trying to reduce our packaging 
materials associated with parts transportation."
"The main focus is on 
reducing the amount of wood waste generated when disposing of pal-
lets and transport boxes."
"We test the use of returnable load carriers or 
other packaging materials at different locations in cooperation with 
our suppliers."
"In general, we aim to prioritize disposal of our waste via recovery pro-
cesses instead of waste disposal processes and thus improve our cur-
rent recovery rate of 84%."
"We have set ourselves the goal of a recov-
ery rate of more than 95% at our production sites by 2030."
"Our experts 
regularly review our disposal methods to determine how they can be 
optimized."
"This often makes it possible for us to add our waste 
streams to higher value recycling streams."
"1	 The target could not be achieved with 33t of waste for disposal in 2023 due to an 
unforeseen circumstance in the waste disposal process and legal re-categoriza-
tion of waste streams."
Our Mercedes-Benz do Brasil Ltda.
"sites have also been pursuing the 
“zero waste to landfill” strategy for production waste since 2021 and 
have implemented these since the end of 2022."
"We treat and dispose of our waste worldwide in accordance with the 
legal regulations."
"We work with licensed and regularly certified waste 
disposal companies."
"Our production locations are required to track the 
disposal of production waste to its final destination and regularly audit 
facilities for the disposal of hazardous waste."
"Further information about how we design our production processes as 
environmentally friendly as possible can be found in the chapter 
E Prevention of pollution."
"2	 The “waste for recycling” category includes waste that is recycled or used for 
energy recovery."
"For this purpose, we are striving to implement the 
legal processes and measures required to minimize risks at all our pro-
duction sites as part of the environmental management systems that 
are ISO 14001 certified or validated by the European environmental 
management and auditing system (EMAS)."
"Our activities focus on 
assets requiring protection such as air, water (groundwater and sur-
face water, lakes, and rivers) and soil."
"For their protection, we have 
defined technical and organizational requirements within the frame-
work of company-wide standards."
"Ensuring environmentally friendly handling of hazardous substances is 
particularly relevant."
"We have defined clear internal processes, specifi-
cations and standards to ensure the safe storage and environmentally 
friendly use of hazardous substances at our sites."
"An internal handling 
permit for chemicals is required for using hazardous substances at our 
sites, in addition to an assessment of their environmental hazard."
"Fur-
thermore, substitution processes to improve the environmental com-
patibility of existing substances will be initiated if necessary."
"To ensure that the Group standards are implemented, we have been 
applying the environmental due diligence method throughout the Com-
pany since 1999 – previously as part of the former Daimler AG and since 
the end of 2021 as an independent company."
"It helps us to identify, 
assess and avoid potential risks of pollution at our production sites at an 
early stage and to comply with a high environmental standard world-
wide."
The topic of hazardous substances also plays a central role here.
"All our consolidated production sites are audited and evaluated within 
the framework of this due diligence method in a five-year cycle accord-
ing to a standardized process."
"The results are reported to the respective 
manufacturing site and executive management so that any potential 
optimizations can be made."
"In addition, on an annual basis we review 
the extent to which our recommendations for risk minimization and pol-
lution prevention at the production sites have been implemented."
"Use of water
GRI 3-3, 303-1/-2/-4
Heavy rain and floods as well as water shortages due to falling ground-
water levels in some areas are affecting more and more regions 
around the world."
"Conscious, efficient and sustainable use of water is 
essential given the state of global water resources."
"We aim to contrib-
ute to this and strive to continuously improve water efficiency and to 
close water cycles in order to sustainably reduce water usage."
"Our 
water efficiency target can be found in the green production target 
house in section “Sustainability goals for our production” in the chap-
ter E Environment."
"In 2023, we carried out the water risk assessment worldwide and thus 
created data transparency for all our production sites."
"We will use the 
results to make corporate and local project decisions related to site 
development, to support customized water efficiency projects and 
water initiatives, and to proactively minimize our risks related to water 
stress, potential water scarcity, flooding and water quality."
"Our water management is subject to the applicable water protection 
laws and we continuously adapt it to the current regulations."
"In addi-
tion, we have set ourselves the objective of fully implementing the 
Group’s internal standard for preventing stormwater contamination at 
all production sites around the world by no later than 2030."
"Waste water from our production processes and sanitary facilities is 
either directed to public waste water treatment and disposal facilities 
in accordance with local regulations, or treated and discharged 
directly at our own sites."
"At some of our sites, we operate biological 
wastewater treatment plants."
"One example of our responsible waste-
water management is our truck and bus production plant in Chennai, 
India."
"None of its wastewater is channeled into the sewage system or 
into bodies of water."
"The process water is thoroughly treated in the 
plant’s own wastewater treatment plant and then used in operating 
processes, in sanitary facilities and for irrigating green areas."
"In addi-
tion, large volumes of rainwater are collected in retention basins on 
site and purified by means of water filtration systems."
"Some of our plants, such as Wörth or Aksaray, have a separate sewer 
system for separate drainage of sanitary wastewater and stormwater."
This promotes the natural water cycle.
"The separation system makes it 
possible to prevent the rather considerable amounts of rainwater from 
entering the sewage treatment plant with relatively low loads."
"As a 
result, wastewater treatment can be much more effective and energy-
efficient."
"~7% of the water, which is trans-
ferred to third party companies, which are not part of Daimler Truck."
"For us, the relevant air pollutants are nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, car-
bon monoxide and particulate matter, which are mainly produced in 
combustion processes, as well as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC 
emissions) which mainly arise in painting processes."
"We attach partic-
ular importance to reducing those VOC emissions."
"This can be done by 
selecting newly developed, high solids paint materials, optimizing the 
paint processes and establishing new, modern exhaust air purification 
systems."
"For this reason, we have been continuously working for years 
on developing and using new technologies and paints in cooperation 
with our suppliers."
"We have developed an in-house standard to prevent, minimize and 
eliminate environmental risks and the associated effects of produc-
tion-related air pollutants, odors and noise."
"It defines a uniform proce-
dure for the documentation of air pollution sources, the associated 
measurement obligations and the definition of pollutant reduction 
measures at our production sites."
"If the country-specific obligations 
that follow local legislation are lower, the regulations of our standard 
must be followed."
"As part of environmental management, we regularly check whether 
internal and external air pollution control requirements are being com-
plied with and reporting obligations are being met."
"In addition to our activities in climate, immission, water and 
soil protection, we are also committed to preserving biodiversity in 
and around our sites."
"In an in-house recommendation for action on near-natural landscape 
design, we provide practical information, for example, for the planning 
of new construction activities."
"We also cooperate with various nature 
protection organizations that advise and support us in our activities 
around animal and plant life protection."
"An example is our work with Naturschutzbund Deutschland (NABU), 
landscape planners and gardeners, for more than ten years."
"Our 
Gaggenau production site is a member of a pilot group of the nation-
wide “UnternehmensNatur” project, which advises and supports com-
panies on the design of near-natural green spaces and which has been 
running projects across the country since 2021."
"The project is funded 
by the State Ministry for the Environment and implemented by NABU 
Baden-Württemberg and environmental service provider, Flächenagen-
tur Baden-Württemberg."
"Our internal biodiversity index (BIX) is available for the specific mea-
surement of the biological value of areas at our locations and the 
development of future planned initiatives."
"The index describes the eco-
logical value of open spaces at a production location and can be used 
to define suitable measures to increase biodiversity."
"In the reporting 
year the BIX was collected for the locations Wörth, Gaggenau, 
Mannheim, Kassel and Leinfelden-Echterdingen."
"To this end, we participated in several cross-generational initiatives at 
the following locations:
	
— Gaggenau: In a cross-generational project, managers and trainees 
are committed to protecting bees and promoting biological diver-
sity."
"In the reporting year, the non-profit Foundation for People and 
the Environment (“Stiftung für Mensch und Umwelt”) honored the 
initiative as the winner of the “Germany is humming” (“Deutschland 
summt”) planting competition in Berlin."
"— Kassel: Again this year, a voluntary collaboration with Sternental 
holiday care took place in August on the topic of “nature awareness 
and gardening” (“Naturbewusstsein, Gärtnern und Garten”)."
"The 
participating children were able to put together a local flower seed 
or herb seed mixture for their garden."
"In recent years, for example, 
the bee hotels located on the factory premises have also been built 
here."
"— Wörth: As part of a family day, there was an apple collection cam-
paign in the orchards as well as planting and care campaigns, 
among other things in collaboration with senior managers and train-
ees."
"— Mannheim and Kassel: Providing information and raising awareness 
among the workforce on the topic of nature conservation as part of 
a traveling exhibition during the Biodiversity Action Weeks 2023."
"During the Biodiversity Action Weeks 2023, employees were pro-
vided with information on the topic of nature conservation as part of 
a roadshow and sensitized to this topic."
"They can 
therefore make important contributions through their commitment to 
climate protection and resource conservation."
"Accordingly, we strive 
to raise the awareness of the topic with our suppliers and support 
them on our path to greater environmental protection in the supply 
chain."
"Together with our direct suppliers, we want to ensure that our 
products and services in Europe, the USA and Japan are CO₂e-neutral 
by 2039 and worldwide by 2050."
"By transforming our product portfolio towards locally CO₂e-free vehi-
cles in driving operation, emissions in the manufacturing phase of the 
products are becoming increasingly important in relation to the total 
emissions during the product life cycle."
"Important drivers of emissions 
in the supply chain are the materials used."
"Our objective is to use the supply chain as a key lever to reduce our 
CO₂e emissions in order to reduce the CO₂e footprint of our products 
across the value chain and life cycle."
"Transparency about emissions in 
the supply chain is an important prerequisite for this."
"On the one hand, our measures for a green supply chain relate to sup-
pliers as our business partners, but on the other hand also to the pur-
chased parts and materials as well as the transport routes to our pro-
duction facilities."
"Our upstream supply chain extends over many tiers in a worldwide 
network of players."
"As our business partners, our direct suppliers play 
a key role in this."
"We expect all suppliers to comply with the environ-
mental requirements described in our Business Partner Standards and 
also to pass them on to their own supply chain."
"To fulfill our due care 
obligations, we have developed a comprehensive concept for the sus-
tainable management of both environmental and social factors in the 
supply chain."
"In addition to including the requirements in contractual 
terms, it contains assessment instruments as well as information and 
qualification measures for suppliers."
"The risk management for sustain-
ability in the supply chain has been revised based on the requirements 
of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA) and also 
contains criteria for environmental risks (such as site/country-specific 
environmental risks)."
"If the supplier is exposed to a higher risk on this 
basis, we use further assessment measures and implement permanent 
screenings."
"If there is a need for improvement, we use qualification 
measures or define concrete implementation steps to mitigate the 
risks."
"Information and complaints about environmental violations in 
the supply chain can be addressed with us via the established report-
ing processes and will be followed up with appropriate consequences."
"Further information about our whistleblowing system can be found in 
the chapter E Compliance."
"By anchoring sustainability standards in the contractual terms with our 
suppliers, we can assert binding environmental requirements such as 
environmentally friendly production, reduction of energy, water con-
sumption and waste, as well as chemical and hazardous substance 
management."
"We also expect our suppliers of production materials to 
operate with an environmental management system that is certified 
according to ISO 14001, EMAS or other comparable standards."
"Suppli-
ers with a low order volume are excluded."
"Our goal is that at least 70% 
of our relevant production material purchasing volume is covered by 
environmental certificates."
"In the reporting year we have achieved a 
coverage of 72% of the purchasing volume planned for 2023.1
Elements of the circular economy are also a contractual component 
here, which is why minimizing waste, for example through recycling, is 
a clear requirement."
"The use and consumption of resources during 
production should also be reduced or preferably avoided."
"At the same 
time, the focus should be on the use of alternative materials, material 
savings, recycling and the reuse of materials."
"Suppliers are encour-
aged to design and carry out processes and procedures in such a way 
that the product can be recycled at the end of its life cycle."
"Public recognition for good performance is equally important to us in 
the areas of climate change mitigation and resource conservation."
"For 
this reason, we regularly hold a Supplier Award, which recognizes sup-
pliers for outstanding performance in the sustainability areas of cli-
mate change mitigation and resource conservation."
"1	 The values were determined on November 30, 2023."
"Transparency on the environmental impacts of the supply chain 
of our vehicle parts
We work with various instruments to identify sustainability risks in the 
supply chain and check compliance with our standards."
"Further information can be found in the 
section “Our approach in the supply chain” in the chapter E Social."
"A supplier's sustainability rating 
derived from the SAQ is taken into account as a mandatory criterion in 
operational purchasing when new orders are awarded above a defined 
order value."
We also use data from CDP.
"For example, we carried out 
the CDP supply chain program for the fourth time in the reporting year."
"As part of this program, we encouraged our production material sup-
pliers to report on the environmental impacts of their business activi-
ties and their climate change mitigation efforts."
"As in the previous 
year, this data survey focused on suppliers of production materials, 
which account for around three quarters of our annual purchasing vol-
ume planned for 2023."
"Compared with the prior year, we included 
additional production material suppliers in the survey."
The final scores will not be announced by CDP until 2024.
"2	 The values were determined on November 30, 2023."
"In order to create transparency 
about their decarbonization strategies and CO₂e reduction targets, we 
also have many direct discussions with key suppliers."
"The CO₂e foot-
print is increasingly becoming a criterion in purchasing decisions."
"We 
want to have transparency about the CO₂e balance of the products 
delivered to us."
"In addition to battery production, the main driver of greenhouse gas 
emissions is the production of raw materials such as steel, aluminum 
or plastics."
"In the future, the emissions of materials will be taken into 
greater consideration in new projects and award decisions."
"In order to 
promote the procurement of sustainable production materials, we will 
systematically integrate relevant key performance indicators such as 
CO₂e emissions into business processes in order to achieve our goal of 
CO₂e neutrality by 2039."
"We are also working with our future battery 
suppliers to minimize CO₂e emissions in the production process."
"The exchange of information within and outside the Company plays an 
important role in the successful implementation of measures for an 
environmentally friendly supply chain."
"We thus train the buyers  
responsible for procuring production material on the sustainability 
requirements for suppliers."
"In addition, as part of the work with indus-
try associations like Drive Sustainability, we also conduct web-based 
training to raise awareness of suppliers."
"Environmental aspects such 
as energy consumption, emissions and resource management are also 
included therein."
"In the reporting year, suppliers in the focus countries 
of Brazil, the Czech Republic and Turkey were trained."
"In our measures for an environmentally friendly supply chain, we not 
only focus on the suppliers of materials and parts, but also consider 
the transport routes to our production sites."
"Therefore, the material 
purchasing departments work together with the logistics departments 
and implement various measures."
"Inbound logistics
We are moving ahead with the transformation of the transportation 
industry towards locally CO₂e-free driving and are also relying on elec-
tric trucks in our own supply chain."
"We have set ourselves the ambi-
tious objective of ensuring the delivery traffic to the Wörth plant, our 
largest assembly plant, is 100% electric by the end of 2026."
"A signifi-
cant part of the direct supply chain can thus become locally CO₂e-free 
in driving operation."
"Together with logistics service providers and 
freight forwarders who supply our German production plants on a daily 
basis, we are working on gradually integrating electrically powered 
trucks into our fleets."
"As part of this, we are setting 
up an in-house charging infrastructure in Wörth and the aggregate 
plants Mannheim, Gaggenau / Rastatt and Kassel, which is available 
to both suppliers and company-owned vehicles."
"By the end of 2023, 
the first inbound transports to the Wörth plant, including from sister 
plants, were fully electric."
"Over the course of 2024, we plan to gradu-
ally convert all transports within the first implementation radius 
(approx."
200 km) to electric trucks.
"Especially the electrically powered 
Mercedes-Benz eActros 300 semitrailer truck will be used for this pur-
pose."
"As the project progresses, the eActros 600 will cover longer 
transport distances."
"We are demonstrating the wide range of applica-
tions of the two electric truck models under realistic conditions in 
company transport."
"The core of our concept for battery electric long-haul transportation is 
to offer customers a holistic transport solution consisting of vehicle 
technology, advisory, charging infrastructure and services."
"In order to 
develop a targeted concept for locally CO₂e-free supply logistics in 
driving operation to the Wörth plant together with freight forwarders, 
an individual analysis of the usual routes will initially be carried out."
"It 
provides information on driving times and the distance between deliv-
ery locations, charging options and individual range."
"They will also 
receive support in integrating electric trucks into existing fleets and in 
realigning their logistics centers, including advice on setting up the 
appropriate in-house charging infrastructure."
"The next step is to 
extend the process to the other plants in our production network."
"Following the example shown by the Wörth plant, the aggregate plants 
in Germany have also set up the first charging stations in 2023 and 
switched transport to electric trucks."
"Further charging parks with 
associated infrastructure and the conversion of a large part of the in- 
and outbound deliveries are planned for the following years."
"An integral part of our future inbound logistics concept for locally 
CO₂e-free transport in driving operation is also the development of a 
factory-owned charging infrastructure at the Wörth site."
"The charging 
stations, including megawatt charging stations for high-voltage battery 
charging, are planned at key points for inbound transport in the imme-
diate vicinity of production at the Wörth plant."
"The parts installed in 
production are delivered just-in-time to the assembly line."
"The time 
taken to unload the electric truck will be used to recharge the vehicle’s 
battery."
"This means that the vehicle ideally would not have to plan for 
any further downtimes and can resume its route immediately after the 
parts have been delivered."
"In addition, the possibility of re-bundling 
and thus optimizing the supply flows in the transport network in a new 
consolidation center near the site is currently being examined."
"In addition to these specific CO₂e reduction measures, we are creating 
greater transparency about the CO₂e emissions of our transport sys-
tem."
"We have introduced a calculation tool for the production sites in 
Europe to report CO₂e emissions based on real transport data and thus 
also measure the effect of optimization measures and, for example, 
the use of electric trucks."
"The calculation logic was certified by the 
Smart Freight Center and corresponds to the Global Logistics Emis-
sions Council (GLEC) standard."
"In 2024, we want to roll out this calcu-
lation tool globally in order to record the CO₂e emissions from global 
transport in a standardized manner."
"Against this background, Regulation (EU) 
2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 
2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable 
investments, and amending EU Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (Taxonomy 
Regulation) entered into force in 2020."
"The Taxonomy Regulation is a 
uniform and legally binding classification system stating which eco-
nomic activities in the EU are considered taxonomy-aligned and thus 
“environmentally sustainable” with regard to six environmental objec-
tives specified by the Regulation."
"In 2023, the delegated acts for environmental goals 3-6 were 
published."
"These were taken into account accordingly in the taxonomy 
check."
"All consolidated group companies are included in the calculation of the 
relevant key performance indicators (KPI) for Daimler Truck."
"This does 
not apply to companies included in the consolidated financial state-
ments using the at-equity method."
"Taxonomy-eligible economic activities
With the descriptions of economic activities in the delegated acts, the 
Taxonomy Regulation specifies which activities are generally taxon-
omy-eligible."
"An analysis of the activities in 
this context led to the conclusion that the corresponding activities are 
exclusively for our own use as part of the manufacturing activity and 
represent an insignificant scope for Daimler Truck."
"Accordingly, 
Daimler Truck does not carry out any independent activities in the con-
text of the delegated legal act."
"In addition, in accordance with the new delegated act (EU) 2023/2486 
of June 27, 2023, the distribution of activities between environmental 
objectives 1-6 was analyzed and examined."
"On this basis it could be 
determined that there is no overlap in the environmental objectives."
"Accordingly, only the environmental goal of climate change mitigation 
is essential."
"The additional tables for double counting are therefore 
omitted."
"Daimler Truck has classified the following activities as taxonomy-eligi-
ble in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation."
"The back-
ground to this is that the Taxonomy Regulation does not contain any 
definition of the term “low carbon” outside the technical screening cri-
teria."
"Taxonomy alignment
All activities classified as taxonomy-eligible have been checked for 
taxonomy alignment."
"A significant contribution to an environmental 
objective is to be made by complying with the specified technical 
screening criteria defined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"For Daimler 
Truck, this applies to environmental goal 1, as all activities contribute 
exclusively to climate change mitigation."
"Furthermore, within the framework of the technical screening criteria, 
significant harm to another environmental objective must be excluded 
on the basis of the defined “do no significant harm criteria” (DNSH)."
"In 
addition, compliance with the minimum safeguards with regard to 
human rights, including labor rights, corruption and bribery, taxation 
and fair competition must be ensured."
"An economic activity can only 
be regarded as ecologically sustainable if all criteria are met."
"Daimler 
Truck carried out the review of the technical screening criteria for the 
economic activities at product and/or site level."
"The assessment of 
compliance with the minimum safeguards is essentially based on 
Group-wide guidelines and their local implementation."
"
2	 Cf question nine in the European Commission’s FAQ dated October 6, 2022."
"The EU taxonomy also provides that buses pre-
compliant with the Euro VI standard shall be taken into account in the 
alignment assessment."
"Since the current Euro VI standard had already 
entered into force at the time of the assessment, Daimler Truck does 
not consider any pre-fulfilment and the vehicles are accordingly not 
taken into account in the alignment assessment."
"Do No Significant Harm
Compliance with the DNSH criteria was mainly assessed on the basis 
of checklist-based interviews for the relevant sites and products."
"As stated above, Daimler Truck exclusively makes a significant contri-
bution to environmental objective 1 “Climate change mitigation”."
"Therefore, the DNSH criteria for the other environmental objectives 2 
to 6 must be examined."
"Evidence of compliance with the DNSH criteria for the respective envi-
ronmental objectives is provided by overarching standards, guidelines 
or other appropriate evidence."
"Compliance is checked as part of regu-
lar “environmental due diligence audits”, if relevant."
"If individual crite-
ria are not met, the corresponding turnover, CapEx and OpEx are not 
reported as taxonomy-aligned."
"Daimler Truck incorporates various physical climate 
risks into the analysis in accordance with the requirements of the 
EU taxonomy."
"Each of the physical climate risks to be considered in 
accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation was assessed on the 
basis of climate scenarios."
"The climate projections are based on the 
Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP scenarios)."
"The 
analysis therefore focuses on economic activity 3.3."
"and considers 
a period up to 2080."
"Identified risks are addressed in an adaptation 
1	 Cf Appedix A of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139."
"For activities 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6, no risk to the performance of 
the activities due to physical climate risks is considered."
"Extreme 
weather tests are carried out during vehicle development."
"In addition, Daimler Truck also 
takes into account the avoidance of water scarcity through a central 
risk assessment based on recognized models and procedures."
"The 
existing processes cover the adjustments to the criteria in the dele-
gated act made in 2023."
"Environmental objective 4 - “Transition to a circular economy”
	
— Activity 3.3: The possibility of using secondary raw materials and 
the possibility of a design for easy disassembly and durability must 
be taken into account for the relevant vehicles."
"In addition, hazard-
ous substances must be traceable and a waste management estab-
lished at the sites."
"In this context, various Group-internal guidelines 
and standards apply as well as, in individual cases, further suitable 
evidence."
"The issue of durability is anchored, for example, in the 
product development process."
"The “Group Standard for Waste Man-
agement” defines waste management across the Group."
"— Activities 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6: The criterion requires the existence of 
waste management measures, in particular at the end of a vehicle’s 
life cycle."
"— Activities 6.5 and 6.6: Defined quotas of recyclable or reusable 
materials in the products must be complied with."
"If the quotas 
determined in accordance with the specifications reach the required 
threshold values, the technical screening criterion is considered to 
be fulfilled."
2	 Cf Appedix B of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139.
"Environmental objective 5 - “Pollution prevention and control”
	
— Activity 3.3: The criterion is based on Appendix C of the Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2139."
"Appendix C refers to various European 
regulations out of the chemicals legislation."
"As part of notes I to 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 supplementing 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament, published on 
June 27, 2023, letter f) of Annex C was clarified and a further para-
graph was added."
"The substances defined in Appendix C are subject 
to restrictions on manufacture, placing on the market and use, both 
in terms of use in the sites and in the products."
"There are specifica-
tions regarding the use of working materials and product compo-
nents and substitution tests for these."
"Moreover there are difficulties in interpretation regarding the vague 
term “Where applicable” in relation to the use of lead, mercury, 
hexavalent chromium and cadmium."
"Daimler Truck interprets the crite-
rion in accordance with the previous version of the regulation and ref-
erences Directive 2000/53/EC."
"— Activities 6.3, 6.5 and 6.6: Compliance with certain tire categories 
in terms of rolling resistance and rolling noise shall be demon-
strated."
"In the reporting year, appropriate analyses were performed 
for the relevant vehicles to provide the required evidence."
"If infor-
mation on the tires is available and the corresponding classes are 
adhered to, the technical screening criterion is considered to be ful-
filled."
"Environmental objective 6 - “Protection of biodiversity and ecosys-
tems”
	
— Activity 3.3: The criterion refers to Appendix D of Delegated Regula-
tion (EU) 2021/2139, which defines requirements for the protection 
of biodiversity and biodiversity-sensitive areas in the vicinity of the 
sites."
"As part of the environmental due diligence audits, compliance 
with environmental permits is verified, among other aspects."
"The 
impact on nearby, sensitive areas is also examined."
"If required, mea-
sures are derived (for details, see the chapter E Prevention of pol-
lution)."
"During the assessment, the relevant technical screening criteria were 
analyzed, interpreted, the results documented and substantiated by 
corresponding evidence documents and calculations."
"No increased risk was identified and assessed in this regard for the 
2023 reporting year."
"For each potential risk area, preventive and, if 
necessary, remedial measures are already in place."
"All activities are fully assigned to the environmental objective 
of “climate change mitigation”."
"Furthermore, all activities can be 
clearly assigned to the respective economic activity according to the 
Taxonomy Regulation."
"This avoids double counting in the calculation of 
the overall performance indicators."

"The KPI for turnover is the ratio 
of taxonomy-eligible/taxonomy-aligned turnover to the total Group 
turnover for the reporting year."
"Overall, the denominator takes into account all turnover of the Daimler 
Truck Group."
"The turnover reported in the Consolidated Income State-
ment amounted to €55,890 million in the 2023 reporting year (refer to 
E Note 5."
"Revenue of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments)."
"To determine the numerator, the turnover was examined as to whether 
it was generated in connection with the production, leasing or financ-
ing of vehicles (taxonomy-eligible)."
"Turnover not related to vehicle pro-
duction or leasing/financing has been excluded."
"Turnover is then assessed to determine whether it meets the technical 
screening criteria for the respective activity."
"If turnover related to the activities cannot be clearly assigned to the 
taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned proportion, they are generally 
assigned using an allocation key, for example for turnover in connec-
tion with spare parts and services."
"The base for the allocation of turn-
over from the sale of spare parts that cannot be clearly assigned are 
historical sales figures."
"Turnover from service contracts that cannot be 
clearly assigned is similarly allocated."
"In the 2023 reporting year, €508 million or 0.9% of the turnover was 
classified as taxonomy-aligned and €53,389 million or 95.5% as taxon-
omy-eligible."
"In the prior year, €276 million or 0.5% of revenue were 
classified as taxonomy aligned and €48,613 million or 95.5% as taxon-
omy eligible."
"The increase in taxonomy-aligned sales results from the increased 
sales of low-CO2 vehicles."
"Capital expenditure
The KPI for CapEx is the ratio of taxonomy-eligible/taxonomy-aligned 
capital expenditure to total capital expenditure in accordance with the 
Taxonomy Regulation for the reporting year."
Acquired goodwill is not included.
"To determine the numerator, the investments are analyzed to identify 
whether they are related to the production or leasing/financing of 
vehicles."
"These taxonomy-eligible investments are further examined to 
determine whether they meet the technical screening criteria associ-
ated with the activity."
"In the 2023 reporting year, the numerator consists of the following 
components:
1."
"CapEx A: Capital expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities."
"This also includes capital expenditure for the 
expansion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities that were com-
pleted in the 2023 reporting year."
"€49 million was attributable to 
CapEx A in the 2023 reporting year."
"CapEx B: Investments for the expansion of taxonomy-aligned eco-
nomic activities that were not completed in the 2023 reporting year."
"In relation to these investments, a so-called “CapEx plan” is to be 
published."
"The CapEx plan covers the actual reporting year as well 
as a time frame of five years and the included investments can be 
exclusively assigned to activity 3.3."
"The capitalized research and 
development costs included relate to the development of Battery 
Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV)."
"Important milestones of the CapEx plan, such as the completion of 
major development projects, are regularly published on the Daimler 
Truck Group’s website."
"The investments within category “CapEx B” 
amount to €206 million in the reporting year 2023."
"The CapEx plan 
includes expenditures in a range of €3,400 million to €3,500 million 
which occurred in the current reporting year and are planned for the 
period from 2024 to 2028."
"Where capital expenditure could not be clearly determined as taxon-
omy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned, generally, an allocation based on 
future sales figures has been made."
"The basis is the approved busi-
ness plan."
"The proportion of the CapEx KPI reported as taxonomy-aligned con-
sists of additions to property, plant and equipment including right of 
use assets (€134 million; 2022: €71 million) and additions to internally 
generated intangible assets."
"particularly from capitalized usage rights 
(€121 million, 2022: €120 million)."
"In the 2023 reporting year, there 
were no taxonomy-aligned additions from acquisitions due to business 
combinations."
"The total amount of investments can be reconciled to the Group addi-
tions in the reporting year (refer to E Note 11."
"Intangible assets, 
E Note 12."
"Property, plant and equipment and E Note 13."
"Equip-
ment on operating leases of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements)."
"In the 2023 reporting year, €255 million or 7.5% of the capital expendi-
ture was classified as taxonomy-aligned and €3,139 million or 92.2% 
as taxonomy-eligible."
"In the prior year, €191 million or 5.0% of invest-
ments were classified as taxonomy aligned and €3,633 million or 
94.7% as taxonomy eligible."
"The investment volume is therefore on 
prior-year level."
"The total operating expenditure to be included in the denominator 
comprise the volume pursuant to Appendix 1 of the Delegated Act on 
Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation disclosure requirements."
"For 
determining the numerator, operating expenditures are assessed 
according to whether they are related to the production or leasing/
financing of vehicles (taxonomy-eligible)."
"Furthermore, they are assessed for the fulfilment of the technical 
screening criteria associated with the activity."
"In the 2023 reporting 
year, the following OpEx components are included in the numerator:
1."
"OpEx A: Operating expenditure associated with assets or processes 
that are part of taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"These 
amounted to €49 million in the 2023 reporting year."
"OpEx B: Operating expenditure relating to the expansion of taxon-
omy-aligned activities."
"In relation to these expenditures, an “Opex-
Plan” needs to be published."
"The OpEx plan is seen as part of the 
CapEx plan and fulfils the criteria set out there."
"Expenditures 
assigned to OpEx B amounted to €239 million in the 2023 reporting 
year."
"The OpEx plan has a range of €2,600 million to €2,700 million 
which occurred in the current reporting year and are planned for the 
period from 2024 to 2028."
"In the case that operating expenditure cannot be clearly determined 
as taxonomy-aligned or taxonomy-eligible, sales-based allocation keys 
are applied in principle."
"For research and development expenditures 
that cannot be directly allocated, these are generally based on the 
approved business plan."
"For other operating expenditure that cannot 
be directly allocated, the allocation keys are generally based on actual 
values."
"In the 2023 reporting year, €288 million or 12.9% of operating expendi-
ture was classified as taxonomy-aligned and €1,908 million or 85.2% 
as taxonomy-eligible."
"In the prior year, €136 million or 6.5% of operat-
ing expenditure were classified as taxonomy aligned and €1,931 mil-
lion or 92.8% as taxonomy eligible."
"The higher operating expenditure 
mainly result from increased non-capitalized research and develop-
ment costs for completed and ongoing projects (+€137 million)."
"Where we can 
make a contribution to change something for the better, we do it."
"For us, our vision of “Leading Sustainable Transporta-
tion” means helping to shape the transport of tomorrow responsibly."
Our employees are an important foundation for this.
"With their ideas, 
talents and skills, they play a crucial role in shaping our company –

and wider society were considered."
"We also analyzed and evaluated 
the effects of social influences on Daimler Truck's business activities."
"As a result, the following topics were defined as essential:
1."
"Occupational safety & health protection
2."
"Traffic safety
Further information can be found in the section “Materiality Analysis” 
in the chapter E Responsible corporate governance."
"We build on a corporate culture in which each and every 
employee is the focus and can develop their individual contribution 
along the employee journey."
"A key focus for action according to our Materiality Analysis is maintain-
ing the health (both personal and occupational), safety and well-being 
of our employees."
"As a progressive employer we want to offer a fair 
remuneration system and far-reaching flexible working time models 
that promote the compatibility of work and family as well as a good 
work-life balance."
"We also support our employees’ development 
through a wide range of qualification programs and flexible learning 
methods."
"We want to leverage the commitment and cooperation of all 
employees and ensure open and respectful interaction with each 
other."
"Once again we have been reminded how we can rely on con-
structive cooperation with employee representatives and trade unions."
"Over 100,000 employees worldwide drive our Group forward with their 
skills, ideas and commitment."
"Our employees are a central success 
factor of our Group."
"They were the key to achieving the Company's 
results in the 2023 reporting year."
"The HR-unit consists of various functions 
that work along the entire HR-value chain and at all our locations."
"HR-
business partners advise and support our employees, including man-
agers, on all relevant, strategic HR topics and implement them as a 
team."
"We are organized according to our segment structures and each 
segment has its own HR responsibility."
"In addition, cross-cutting top-
ics such as human resources development, labor policy and remunera-
tion are bundled in Centers of Competences (CoC) within a global gov-
ernance function."
"The Head of the People and Organization 
Development CoC is represented in the Sustainability Steering Com-
mittee."
"The HR Compliance Management System focuses on compliance with 
legal provisions, regulatory standards and ethical principles to ensure 
compliant human resources work as well as appropriate labor and 
social standards."
"In this way the system contributes to the creation of 
a respectful, trusting and integrative corporate culture."
"The HR Direc-
tor is responsible for human resources work and HR compliance 
across the Group."
"Further information on HR compliance can be found 
in the section “Compliance with labor and social law obligations (HR 
compliance)” in the chapter E Compliance."
"To ensure an ongoing exchange between the individual functions and 
the best possible decision-making in the interests of the entire Group, 
the Operations Committee (OpCom) meets regularly as the highest HR 
decision-making body chaired by the board member responsible for 
human resources."
"To ensure that HR functions are closely involved in 
the operational business, the HR Business Partners are involved in the 
management bodies of their areas of responsibility."
"Our corporate culture and Daimler Truck as an attractive  
employer 
For us, it is important that our values and our culture are shared and 
lived by everyone in the Company."
"To this end, we want to promote the 
commitment of our employees and expand opportunities for design 
within the framework of “Impact Culture”."
"Our “Impact Culture” 
focuses on the topic of belonging together and, above all, on the ques-
tion of how we want to work together across different levels, regions 
and specialist areas."
"Our corporate culture is also the basis for our 
employer communication."
"We want to be a good and attractive employer – both for our own 
employees and for the various target groups in the global labor mar-
ket."
"To increase the awareness around Daimler Truck and at the same 
time show our employees appreciation for their daily work, the internal 
and external employer campaign with the slogan 'You make us' was 
launched for the first time worldwide in 2023."
"The aim is to carry our 
corporate culture, the “Impact Culture”, and our employer brand inter-
nally and externally and to strengthen our identity."
"The focus topics 
are sustainability, future technologies, individual development oppor-
tunities, internationality as well as diversity, equity and inclusion."
"The 
employer branding and recruitment activities are based on the short, 
medium and long-term Company strategy, the needs of the depart-
ments and the expectations of the target groups."
"An important basis of our corporate culture and attractiveness as an 
employer is a good and coherent leadership and collaboration culture."
"With the initiative ""DTR0CKs"", 
the training was initially designed for managers, to enable them to 
experience the ""Great Leadership Behavior"" and to take the first steps 
in implementing it in their daily leadership work."
"This Daimler Truck ini-
tiative was awarded the Silver Excellence in Practice Award by the 
European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD) in 2023."
"After a successful roll-out at management level, further training for-
mats were developed for employees in order to familiarize them with 
the behavioral anchors."
"In addition, the Daimler Truck Learning Curriculum supports managers 
and employees in constantly developing themselves and their actions, 
with the focus being based on our purpose and supporting guidelines."
"To consistently represent our understanding of culture in our pro-
cesses and structures, we continued to work on integrating Great 
Leadership Behavior into the performance and potential processes for 
managers and aspiring managers in 2023."
"Under the term “Impact 
Compass” we support managers in their leadership role."
"In this way, 
we anchor the Daimler truck culture in everyday life, offer transpar-
ency and orientation and promote personal and professional develop-
ment by involving our employees in the entire process."
"The newly 
introduced, personal 360° feedback process also acts as an important 
component in the cultural change."
"In addition, the global Impact Com-
pass enables new approaches to identifying and promoting the perfor-
mance and potential of our employees."
"Daimler Truck AG was awarded 
the HR Excellence Award 2023 in the “Performance Management” cat-
egory for the agile development and implementation of the Impact 
Compass."
"Our Employee Survey is an important tool for engaging in dialog with 
our employees."
"We want to methodically measure and understand 
what motivates our employees and enable a comprehensive and stan-
dardized measurement of the Group and its teams."
"The Employee Sur-
vey is considered an important indicator of where we currently stand 
in the areas of satisfaction, commitment, compliance and health – and 
above all where we have the potential to develop."
"Managers are there-
fore called upon to engage in a dialog with their teams and take appro-
priate measures for their continuous development."
"The HR organiza-
tion provides help and tools for this purpose."
"The annual Employee Survey which we conducted for the first time as 
an independent company in September 2022, was conducted again 
this year."
"With over 100,000 employees, the participation rate has 
increased to 82% (2022: 79%)."
"The results of the 2023 Employee Sur-
vey show a slight increase across all topics, such as engagement."
"On a 
five-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (extremely satisfied), 
the general satisfaction of the workforce with the Company is shown 
to have an average score of 4.01."
"Our score when it comes to the fol-
low-up process - including the discussion of results and the derivation 
of adequate measures for the development of the workforce - was sig-
nificantly increased to an average score of 3.83 (2022: 3.69)."
"We want 
to build on the progress we have already made and leverage the will-
ingness of all employees to shape our young corporate culture 
together."
"Further information on our corporate culture and values can be found 
on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/career/youmakeus."
"Cooperation with employee representatives and trade unions
GRI 2-30
It is one of our fundamental beliefs to work with elected employee rep-
resentatives and trade unions in a trust-based relationship."
"This is the 
only way to successfully overcome diverse challenges together and 
take advantage of opportunities."
"We recognize the right of our employees to form employee representa-
tion organizations for collective bargaining in order to regulate working 
conditions, as well as the right to strike, depending on applicable law."
"On this basis, it is our common aim to agree on constructive regula-
tions and solutions that are in the interest of companies and employ-
ees and thus form a sustainable and strong foundation for a successful 
Daimler Truck future."
"Collective agreements are in place for the major-
ity of employees across the Group, for example through bargaining 
agreements."
"In Europe, around 70% of employees are subject to the 
provisions of a bargaining agreement, with more than 95% in Germany 
alone, and around 65% in North America and Asia."
"The elected works councils at the German locations of Daimler Truck 
AG continued their work in the responsible specialist commissions."
"The European Works Council (EWC) and the World Employee Repre-
sentative Committee (WWC), which were brought together at an inter-
national level, worked on overarching topics in 2023."
"In a joint confer-
ence with the Company management, the focus was on fixed costs, 
the possible merger of the subsidiary Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus 
Corporation with Hino Motors, a subsidiary of the Toyota Corporation, 
and human rights."
"With this international cooperation, Daimler Truck is 
setting an example worldwide because countries outside the European 
Union have the same rights and obligations as those to which the EWC 
Directive directly applies."
"Currently 23 countries are represented 
according to their number of employees and have sent 34 representa-
tives."
"Further information on the Works Council and international com-
mittees can be found on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/works-coun-
cil/international-councils."
"The employee representatives elected for the statutory term of office 
were in constructive dialogue with the Company representatives on 
numerous technical topics."
"Furthermore, a particular focus of global 
cooperation is on successfully shaping the transformation towards 
CO2-free mobility and digitalization."
"The common goal is to create an 
economically sustainable and successful company while at the same 
time ensuring employment is as socially secure as possible."
"An impor-
tant measure in this context is the qualification and further training of 
employees, which was gradually expanded globally in the 2023 report-
ing year."
"Another key focus of work with the employee representatives is all 
issues relating to occupational safety and maintaining the health of 
employees."
Many measures were developed together here.
"Solidarity 
aid and unbureaucratic joint action were also shown after Turkey was 
hit by a devastating earthquake on February 6, 2023."
"Company man-
agement and the general works council initiated donations in kind and 
in cash."
"Further information can be found in the section “Corporate 
Citizenship” in the chapter E Partnerships and engagement."
"By defining global minimum standards for occupa-
tional health and safety, our occupational health and safety strategy 
goes beyond legal requirements when designing workplaces and pro-
cesses."
"Our goal is to preserve the occupational safety and health of all 
employees, to identify and prevent health risks, and to permanently 
promote health and well-being as a prerequisite for creativity and pro-
ductivity."
"We are committed to “Vision Zero” and are therefore part of 
a global initiative of the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health 
(IOSH) and the International Social Security Association (ISSA)."
"Both 
organizations aim to prevent work-related accidents and illnesses 
while promoting the safety, health and well-being of employees."
"We pursue a holistic and long-term approach, which we continuously 
review and further develop."
"A sustainably oriented, functioning health 
and occupational safety management system is of central importance 
to us."
"Whether ergonomic workplace design, health offers or safety 
qualifications: our focus is on the health, safety and well-being of our 
employees."
"We include these in our annual Daimler Truck Employee 
Survey with two questions about health, occupational safety and well-
being in order to obtain an overview of the situation within the Com-
pany."
"Organization, responsibilities, requirements and guidelines
GRI 403-1/-3/-4/-6/-8
Organizational responsibility at Group level belongs to the Health & 
Safety department, which comprises Occupational Medicine, Occupa-
tional Safety & Ergonomics, Social Counseling and Workplace Health 
Promotion."
"The occupational health and safety strategy is developed 
and implemented globally through regular, global dialog."
"At our sites, 
there are reporting lines from the occupational safety and health 
departments to the respective site management and to the Health & 
Safety department."
"In quarterly meetings the Board is involved 
through the Corporate Medical Director and the Head of Global Safety 
& Ergonomics in relevant topics such as accident and risk manage-
ment, safety culture, health training and preventive medical examina-
tions."
"In addition to using key statistics, for example from health and 
accident reports, the Health & Safety department also relies on per-
sonal feedback, the evaluation of surveys and the tracking of mea-
sures in the event of work accidents."
"The material health and safety issues are also regularly discussed, 
evaluated and further developed with various internal committees, 
such as the Commission for Occupational Safety and Environment and 
Health."
"Other parties engaged include the works council and Company 
representatives at all Company levels and with external committees 
such as the Company Health Insurance Board of Directors."
"In addition, 
the positive effects of the above measures are incorporated into the 
advisory process for managers and employees."
"The aim is to continu-
ously improve the measures with a view to sustainability and effi-
ciency."
"We complement the legal requirements for occupational health and 
safety with additionally defined policies."
"There are globally uniform 
guidelines based on prevention."
"The occupational health and safety 
policy, which is based on international standards and national laws, 
constitutes our global guideline."
"It emphasizes the responsibility and 
exemplary function of the managers and appeals to the personal 
responsibility of employees at the same time."
"An ISO 45001 certification for work safety and health provides our 
employees safety at the workplace."
"In this reporting year, 15 of the rel-
evant 48 sites (production, development and test sites) with majority 
shareholding were certified."
"This covers around 30,000 of our work-
force, which corresponds to around 37 % of the relevant workforce."
"In the reporting year, we were able to evaluate safety certification on a 
total of eight locations in India, Indonesia, Mexico and North America."
"Eleven locations in Argentina, China, Germany, France, Mexico, Spain 
and the Czech Republic are planned for auditing in 2024."
"Our employees have the right to physical and mental health and a safe 
working environment."
"We offer our employees in Germany occupa-
tional health care and counseling."
"In addition to occupational health 
checks and aptitude tests as well as medical consultations, employees 
can take part in the Daimler Truck “Health Check” every three years 
and get the flu vaccination every year."
"This care is supplemented by 
the measures and services of the workplace health promotion and 
counseling services."
"In addition to the implementation of the Group 
works agreement on “Mental Health”, another focus in the 2023 
reporting year was our internal international initiative “WE CARE 
ABOUT US”."
"This initiative was founded to pursue the goals of Vision 
Zero."
"Stakeholders from the areas of Occupational Medicine, Occupa-
tional Safety, Social Counseling and Workplace Health Promotion work 
closely together and combine their expertise as part of the initiative."
"Assessment of hazards
GRI 403-2/-9
We pursue a preventive approach and assess the potential risks of 
workplaces and work processes at an early stage."
"To implement this, 
instruments and risk assessment processes have been defined that 
comply with local regulations."
"An important instrument is the risk 
assessment, which automatically generates a briefing document."
"Parts 
of this risk management process are digitized using an online tool."
"The 
tool is provided by the European Occupational Safety and Health 
Agency (EUOSHA) and has been enhanced for our needs."
"The objec-
tive is to encourage risk awareness among employees and mindful 
behavior."
"The specified global standards, with regard to occupational 
health and safety management (including risk assessment) and mini-
mum technical standards (for example technical safety standards for 
machines and systems), are to be implemented by our sites."
"The use 
of the online tool depends on local and legal requirements."
"Safety risks and near-accidents must be reported to the manager on a 
location-specific basis and are dealt with as part of regular meetings in 
production and administration (shop floor management)."
"We record information about work accidents and risks using our acci-
dent documentation systems."
"Country-specific reports are prepared 
and from them accident reduction measures derived."
"We want to con-
tinuously improve the workplaces, environments and processes of our 
employees and actively involve them in their design process."
"We utilize 
a holistic health and occupational safety management system to pre-
vent work accidents and work-related illnesses."
"The focus here is pri-
marily on preventive measures, such as instructions and trainings on 
occupational safety, the Daimler Truck Health Check, health programs 
and digital health services, which we continuously review and develop 
further."
"Tragically, one employee and an external employee suffered a 
fatal accident in the reporting year."
"The incidents were investigated 
and the causes were determined."
"In addition, the responsible persons 
for global occupational safety were informed and the accidents were 
discussed at management level."
"Corrective measures were deter-
mined to prevent such accidents from occurring again."

"Awareness of occupational safety
GRI 403-5
Employees are made aware of ergonomics and occupational safety 
throughout the Group with videos, various information portals and 
online training being used for this purpose during the reporting year."
"New employees receive general initial training in the form of an induc-
tion course and they receive workplace-specific instruction on safety-
relevant aspects."
"We offer qualification measures for newly appointed 
managers depending on the location and the level of qualification."
"In 
Germany there are also mandatory measures."
"External companies receive an external-specific training before enter-
ing the plants."
"In addition, we maintain a “Health & Safety Wiki” on the 
Social Intranet, which we regularly update."
"There, our employees can 
find all the important information and rules relating to health and 
safety at work."
"In addition, in the year under review, we offered a 
cross-site digital health service in Germany on the topics of exercise, 
nutrition and relaxation in order to sustainably raise awareness of 
health-related topics in the long term."

Diversity, equity & inclusion
GRI 405-1
SDG 5, 10
Our workforce is as diverse as our customers and more than 100,000 
people from 129 nations work for us."
"Diversity helps us to find new 
perspectives and acts as a driving force behind creative ideas and 
innovations."
"We are convinced that diversity is an important aspect of 
our corporate culture and makes us more successful as a company."
"We promote an impact culture in which our employees can actively 
participate and develop their talents freely."
"We therefore need to be 
respectful of one another and remain open-minded, which means 
there is no place for discrimination in the workplace."
"For us, inclusion 
means treating the diversity of our employees consciously, and appre-
ciatively."
"We strengthen our principles by partici-
pating in the UN Global Compact, through membership of the Charter 
of Diversity employer initiative Charta der Vielfalt e.V."
"and the Euro-
pean Women’s Management Development Network e.V."
"The principles of diversity, equity and inclusion are laid down in the 
general company agreements for the promotion of women and equal 
opportunities, and in the inclusion agreement."
"Furthermore, these top-
ics are regulated in our Code of Conduct and our “Group-wide general 
agreement on fairness in the workplace”."
"The team develops strategic fields of action in cooperation with the 
global DEI network, consisting of DEI experts from various organiza-
tional units worldwide, and in coordination with all business units."
"Fur-
thermore, the network initiates overarching projects, training and 
awareness-raising measures, such as the annual “Diversity Day”, 
which incorporate the seven diversity dimensions mentioned above."
"The newly founded DEI Advisory Board also began work in 
March 2023."
"The international committee consists of senior managers 
from all organizational units as well as diversity experts and represen-
tatives of underrepresented groups."
"The DEI Advisory Board is chaired 
by the CEO of Daimler Truck Holding AG and Daimler Truck AG."
"The 
committee meets once a quarter and decides on the strategy and rele-
vant topics relating to diversity, equity and inclusion."
"The DEI Advisory 
Board also advises the Daimler Truck Board of Management and 
anchors the topic in the appropriate business areas."
"In the four work-
ing groups Our People, Our Drive, Our Development and Our Commu-
nity, the Board members work on topics such as anchoring equity and 
inclusion in human resources processes or promoting an inclusive 
working environment in the production plants between board meet-
ings."
"Initiatives discussed by the Board will be carried forward by the 
global DEI network according to local requirements."
"One of the first 
measures was to set up a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion learning plat-
form on the social intranet, which brings together all global offers for 
our employees for self-learning and self-reflection as well as team 
building activities and exercises."
"In addition, all recommendations and 
guidelines for creating an inclusive work culture are stored on the site."
"Managers as role models
Our goal is to create an inclusive working environment in which we 
encourage all employees to be their true selves and feel they belong."
Managers play a crucial role in this.
"As a common basis for shaping the leadership culture, our e-learning 
module “Inclusion in Mind!” is mandatory for all managers including 
for the Board of Management and is available in nine languages."
"The 
aim of the training is to raise awareness of respectful cooperation and 
possible roadblocks and to show how each individual can contribute."
"It 
also teaches what effective methods to reduce potential biases and 
resolve conflicts are available."
"As an indicator for an inclusive work culture, the Inclusion Index was 
introduced in the reporting year."
"It is based on four questions from the 
annual Daimler Truck Employee Survey and expresses how inclusive 
the working environment is perceived by our employees."
"All managers 
with more than six employees receive the Inclusion Index as an indi-
vidual value for their own team."
"Accompanying documents for self-
reflection and discussion with the team help managers to make their 
leadership behavior more inclusive and encourage dialog with their 
team."
"Promoting diversity throughout the employee journey
GRI 404-2
We promote diversity even before talents join the Group."
"As a cooper-
ation partner of the “FEMTEC Network”, we support young engineers 
and offer students in the fields of mathematics, IT, science and tech-
nology insights into the Company and opportunities for dialog and 
cooperation."
"When recruiting, diversity is of great importance to us: 54% of new 
hires through our Trainee Programs have an international background, 
and 41% of new hires since the programs started are women."
"The 
Company also places special emphasis on training young people with 
disabilities."
"An action plan has been created for hiring severely dis-
abled apprentices."
"The aim of the action plan is to facilitate the appli-
cation process for people with disabilities."
"The women's advancement program She@Truck is a development pro-
gram in the areas of truck technology and Mercedes-Benz trucks."
"The 
15-month program is embedded in the development of high potential 
candidates at medium Management level and includes an individual 
learning program with mentoring and coaching, combined with joint 
multi-day seminar modules."
"A new aspect of this concept is that both 
the sponsors and the mentors from the top two management levels 
below the board are involved in workshops in order to raise even 
greater awareness of their responsibility for more diversity when filling 
management positions."
"Commitment in networks
Through networks (Employee Business Resource Groups), our employ-
ees can share common interests, experiences and values across all 
levels and divisions."
"Our networks help to firmly establish a culture of 
diversity and appreciation in the Company."
"At the same time, they sup-
port us as dialog partners in the further development of our measures 
concerning diversity, equity and inclusion."
"We have five company-wide 
networks and many other regional groups around the world."
"Most of 
these are cultural, gender-related and “LGBTIQ networks”."
"To promote 
interaction between the networks, the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
Management team organizes regular meetings."
"Sponsors from top 
management support the networks in their work and give them more 
visibility internally and externally."
"In addition, the internal “Global Inclusion & Diversity Community” 
accessible on the Social Intranet portal is the meeting place for all 
employees around the world who would like to help shape diversity, 
equity and inclusion in the Company."
"The Community provides impor-
tant and up-to-date information about the topic, but also offers the 
opportunity to network, ask questions or contribute ideas."
"Gender Diversity Aspiration
With this Gender Diversity Aspiration, we strive to continuously 
increase the proportion of women in management positions."
"The pro-
portion of women in management derived from our personnel report-
ing systems is reported to the Board of Management on a regular and 
standardized basis."
"At the end of the reporting year, the proportion of 
women in management positions was 19.8%."
"We aim to increase this 
proportion to 25% by 2030."
"Remuneration systems
GRI 2-19/-20, 404-3
Worldwide, we remunerate work performed at all Group companies 
according to the same principles."
"Our Corporate Compensation Policy, 
which is valid for all groups of employees, establishes the framework 
conditions and minimum requirements for the design of the remunera-
tion systems."
"By means of inter-
nal audits, the Internal Auditing department annually checks on a ran-
dom basis whether selected aspects of the policy have been adhered 
to."
"In our desire to offer salaries and benefits that are customary in the 
respective markets, we also want to take into account local market 
conditions."
"The variable remuneration (company bonus) of the management levels 
below the Board of Management for the 2023 financial year is based 
not only on financial performance criteria but also on non-financial 
goals based on sustainability."
"On a regular basis, our HR departments conduct individual salary 
review interviews with our employees."
"In this way, we ensure salary 
decision-making transparency while complying with data protection 
regulations."
The respective development potential is also discussed.
"If employees have justified objections to their remuneration – for 
example, if they do not see themselves as being treated equally – they 
are free to contact their manager, the HR department or the works 
council."
"In companies subject to collective bargaining agreements, such as 
Daimler Truck AG, the agreements that have been reached grant 
employees additional rights."
"These give them the right to object to 
their placement in a specific salary group or to the results of their per-
formance assessment."
"The remuneration regulations and salary tables 
can be viewed by employees."
"Employees of Daimler Truck AG can find 
out about their salary structure and amount online – even in compari-
son to their peer groups."
"Employees at Daimler Truck AG and its subsidiaries who are subject to 
a collective bargaining agreement are usually also offered voluntary 
benefits that are agreed upon with the respective employees’ repre-
sentative bodies."
"These benefits include employer-funded contribu-
tions to retirement benefits and options to participate in an employee-
funded retirement benefits system."
"In many cases, employees who are subject to collective bargaining 
agreements can also participate in profit-sharing arrangements at 
their respective company."
"In addition, offers from numerous sports 
and social institutions can be used - from daycare centers to social 
counseling services."
"2	 Due to the spin-off and independence of the Daimler commercial vehicles busi-
ness in December 2021, this data is not comparable with those of the following 
years."
"3	 This data has been adjusted due to the spin-off and independence of the Daimler 
commercial vehicles business, but still contains minor uncertainties as adjust-
ments for combined locations and units can only be made in the 2022 financial 
year."
"Flexible working-time arrangements
As a company, we have learned that hybrid working is a sustainable 
working model - wherever the job allows."
"For instance, in Germany, we 
were able to draw on an existing flexible company agreement on 
mobile working."
"At the same time, a transformation in office work-
places is being observed worldwide: Open office spaces without fixed 
workstation assignments and modern collaboration zones promote an 
open corporate culture."
"We are also working on introducing more flexi-
ble working time models in production areas, such as part-time work."
"Part-time working models in all forms have a long tradition – from less 
working hours per day, to selected working days per week, to tempo-
rary leave, such as parental leave."
"Employees can make use of this to 
take care of their family or attend a training course."
"In many cases, the 
possibilities of time off or the reduction of working hours for the care 
of children goes beyond the legal framework in the individual coun-
tries."
"In Germany, we provide employees with childcare places in our in-
house daycare centers."
"We also cooperate with support centers: Par-
ents can contact our cooperation partner if they have questions about 
alternative childcare options or need a tutor for their children."
"Employ-
ees who would like to care for relatives can leave the Company for a 
period of time beyond that defined by legal provisions, or reduce their 
working hours for this period for up to four years– with guaranteed 
reinstatement."
"The objective of all these measures is to facilitate a 
better balance between work and family life."
"In the course of the profound transformation in 
our industry, job descriptions, duties, and requirement profiles are 
changing."
"Our objective is to continuously develop the qualifications of our work-
force and thus make a significant contribution to our competitiveness."
"We invest strategically in training and professional development, con-
tinue to expand our HR development programs and adapt our training 
portfolio and the range of dual study courses at universities."
"To suc-
cessfully manage the digital and technological transformation, we rely 
on diverse and needs-based qualifications of our employees."
"In addi-
tion, we conduct the targeted recruitment of talent with digital skills 
and technical expertise in new technologies."
"We have a methodological approach for observing quantitative and 
qualitative aspects of workforce development."
"We collect quantitative 
data using an online tool and we also analyze strategically relevant 
abilities with the help of qualitative methods."
"Here we compare exist-
ing specialist, methodological, and social skills with future require-
ments."
"This procedure helps us to discover potential bottlenecks in 
specialist units and to predict the need for up-and-coming staff and 
training in advance."
"E-learning platforms:
As part of the strategic goal on the topic of ""People and Culture"", we 
offer our employees access to the E-Learning platform LinkedIn Learn-
ing."
"Every employee has access to a learning license and can access 
over 20,000 web-based learning offers in thirteen languages continu-
ously, flexibly and regardless of time and place."
"Additional E-Learning 
platforms for experts were piloted in the reporting year."
"All employees can 
find the appropriate qualifications tailored to their business needs in 
our Learning Management System (LMS)."
"Depending on the required 
level of qualifications, we work with universities through various “aca-
demic programs”, develop and train our own teaching content or use 
accredited learning providers using optimal learning formats."
"On average, the number of qualification hours1 per employee in our 
learning management systems amounted to around twelve hours 
(2022 average of twelve hours) for the reporting year."
"For female 
employees, the average number of qualification hours was around 
eleven hours (2022 around ten hours)."
"Our employees used the newly 
introduced E-Learning platform “LinkedIn Learning” for an average of 
half an hour (and one hour for female employees)."
"In addition to this 
offer, when it comes to qualifying our employees, we increasingly use 
learning formats that are integrated into everyday work."
"These average 
values therefore only represent a part of the actual scope of qualifica-
tions."
"Apprentices and students
We provide training according to the requirements of our Company 
and we continuously review the portfolio of our apprenticeships and 
courses of study."
"Our internationally recognized dual study programs 
are offered at various Company locations."
"We have standardized our 
training content in Germany across all locations and segments in the 
Daimler Truck Training System."
"In the reporting year we continued to focus on the areas of IT skills 
and IT professions, as well as high-voltage and battery technology."
"For 
example, we offer vocational training for IT specialists and automotive 
mechatronics technicians in system and high-voltage technology."
"We 
also provide a course of study in embedded systems, which includes IT 
and electrical engineering."
"In Germany, 555 young people started a new training or dual study 
program in the reporting year (2022: 472)."
"The same number of train-
ing and study places were advertised for the following year."
"1	 Survey period December 2022 to November 2023, as there was a change in the IT

the relatively higher proportion of women in dual university studies."
"During stud-
ies, the number of days in the company is fewer than for trainees."
3	 Changed system for data collection in the 2023 reporting year.
Interculturalism plays an important role for us.
"As early as the training 
stage, our international program “Truck goes Global” for trainees and 
trainers lays the foundations for mobility and flexibility as well as for-
eign language and intercultural skills - financed and supported by the 
Erasmus+ Program of the European Union."
"Dual students also have the 
opportunity to work abroad during their studies."
"We also meet our 
social responsibility internationally and train young people both in-
house and through collaborations with schools."
"In Brazil, for example, 
young people are being prepared for working life through professional 
courses via a school collaboration."
"In addition, Mercedes-Benz Brasil 
supports other social projects for the development of young people in 
sports, culture and technology such as Socio-sporting, Educational, 
Cultural and Innovative, SBA Girassol Pro, On the Right Track/Child-
hood Brasil and IAM Maker Workshop."
"Trainee programs
We offer global trainee programs and introduced the “Daimler Truck 
Trainee Programs” in the reporting year as part of a rebranding off the 
“INspire - the Trucks and Buses Experience Programs”."
"As part of our trainee programs, we offer two appealing entry and 
development paths for talent: The “Leadership Talent Track” as an 
entry point for graduates and career starters who are aiming for a 
future management career."
"During the 18-month program, the trainees 
complete individually tailored project assignments at home and 
abroad and exchange ideas on focus topics in the global trainee net-
work."
"These trainees spend 36 months 
working on highly relevant topics of the future with a focus on advanc-
ing the transformation of our products."
"91 employees are currently 
employed on one of these two tracks."
"After 
the pilot with the various partner companies, we decided to integrate 
the “Green Mobility Trainee” into the “Daimler Truck Trainee Pro-
grams” from 2023 for future employees."
"A separate cluster “Sustain-
ability - Green Factory” was created for this purpose in the “Expert 
Track”."
"Extra-occupational study
We place great importance on the individual academic training of our 
specialists and managers."
"We provide such employees with financial support and 
an accompanying program."
"In 2023, we prioritized courses of study 
that support our transformation."
"We continue to participate in the United 
Nations (UN) Global Compact and are committed to the UN Guiding 
Principles for Business and Human Rights."
"We place particular impor-
tance on the International Bill of Human Rights as well as the core 
labor standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO)."
"We are 
therefore committed to preventing human rights violations from occur-
ring with regard to our own employees and our business partners, in 
particular our direct suppliers."
"The aim is to respect and protect 
human rights as well as to implement necessary measures and pro-
cesses to fulfill our due diligence obligations."
"We confirm our commitment in our Declaration of Principles on Social 
Responsibility and Human Rights, which is available in more than 10 
languages."
"The Declaration of Principles forms the basis for how we 
fulfill our social responsibility and summarizes our commitment to 
human rights."
"It complements our obligation to respect human rights 
from our Daimler Truck Code of Conduct."
"With regard to our Group 
companies and majority shareholdings, we have also anchored 
requirements for respecting and protecting human rights in other 
internal policies, such as our policy for occupational health and safety 
and the policy on minimum standards for human resources work."
"Our 
requirements for business partners (including suppliers) to respect 
internationally recognized human rights are defined in our Business 
Partner Standards."
"Further information on the Declaration of Principles and our Code of 
Conduct can be found on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/

"Organization and responsibility
The Sustainability Management & Human Rights Compliance Depart-
ment in the Legal & Compliance unit is responsible for the 
development and steering of the Human Rights Compliance Manage-
ment System (CMS)."
"It is also responsible for providing legal advice on 
human rights issues within the Group."
"It works closely with depart-
ments that are responsible for the operational implementation of 
human rights due diligence within the Group - in particular with human 
resources and purchasing."
"More information can be found in the chap-
ter E Compliance."
"Strategic developments as well as cross-functional and international 
alignment relating to respecting human rights are discussed in the 
Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) and the Corporate Sustain-
ability Board (CSB)."
"The Chief Legal and Compliance Officer assumes 
the role of human rights officer for the Daimler Truck Group."
"He 
reports directly to the Chairman of the Board of Management of 
Daimler Truck AG and Daimler Truck Holding AG and is responsible for 
monitoring our compliance risk management."
"He also heads the SSC 
and chairs the Compliance Board."

tion “Sustainability Management at Daimler Truck” in the chap-
ter E Responsible corporate governance."
"Collaboration with external partners and engagement in  
initiatives
GRI 408-1, 409-1
As part of our human rights due diligence, we are involved in various 
initiatives and projects to address human rights risks in our value 
chain."
"We are a member of the European automotive industry sustainability 
initiative Drive Sustainability under the umbrella of CSR Europe net-
work."
"For us the central focus of this initiative is the development and 
use of the Sustainability Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), which we 
use to evaluate the sustainability performance of our suppliers of pro-
duction material."
"In addition to environmental aspects, social criteria 
are assessed including guidelines and management systems for 
human rights and social issues as well as occupational safety, training 
for employees, responsible raw material procurement and sustainabil-
ity-oriented supplier management."
"All criteria are evaluated and inte-
grated into an overall assessment of sustainability performance."
"In the reporting year we joined another CSR Europe initiative, the 
“Responsible Trucking” platform."
"Our aim is to work together with 
other actors to improve the social conditions of truck drivers in the 
road transport and logistics sector in Europe - for example by recog-
nizing common social guidelines."
"In the reporting year, we also joined the Responsible Supply Chain Ini-
tiative e.V."
"(RSCI), which offers standardized sustainability audits to 
evaluate the implementation of social and ecological standards in 
automotive supply chains."
"In the event of increased risks or suspected 
cases, we use the RSCI audit program to create further transparency 
with regard to our suppliers and to initiate improvements in the future 
if necessary."
"There is also a particular focus on raw material-specific initiatives and 
projects."
"We are part of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), 
which is committed to pursuing due diligence along the supply chains 
of conflict minerals tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold (3TG) and other min-
erals critical to human rights."
"The focus is on smelters and refineries, 
as at this point in the supply chain, the material from different sources 
is mixed."
"In the reporting year, Daimler Buses GmbH also began a dialogue with 
the NGO Electronics Watch as part of its “Low Emission Vehicle Pro-
gram”."
"Electronics Watch supports public clients in assessing fair 
working conditions in the supply chains of electric buses."
"As part of 
the program, companies are invited to discuss their human rights due 
diligence activities in more detail."
"We seek to enter into dialog with potentially affected stakeholders and 
exchange ideas with - for example employees, civil society groups or 
local populations - along with their representatives."
"The aim is to incor-
porate their feedback and expertise into the development of our pro-
cesses and measures for fulfilling human rights due diligence obliga-
tions in order to continuously improve."
"A particular focus here was on measures 
around employee rights."
"Further information about our involvement in sustainability initiatives 
can also be found in the section “Associations and Initiatives” in the 
chapter E Partnerships and engagement."
"Our approach in the Group companies and shareholdings
GRI 407-1, 408-1, 409-1
To fulfill human rights due diligence obligations, we use a systematic 
approach with our Human Rights CMS."
"The Human Rights CMS is 
based on requirements from internationally recognized standards and 
applicable laws - for example the German Supply Chain Due Diligence 
Act (SCDDA), which has been in force since 2023."
"The Human Rights CMS includes basic principles and measures to pro-
mote compliant conduct."
"It relates to the Group companies and major-
ity shareholdings as well as to our value chain."
"Further information on 
our CMS can be found in the chapter E Compliance."
"All of our Group companies and majority shareholdings worldwide 
were subjected to a systematic risk analysis in the reporting year in 
order to identify possible risks in accordance with our human rights 
due diligence."
"The affected units were then assigned defined mea-
sures based on their determined individual risk profile."
"The measures 
address the identified risk areas and define clear responsibilities for 
implementation."
"These measures include, for example, mandatory 
training on human rights for relevant business areas such as purchas-
ing as well as requirements for responsible work by and with security 
forces."
"For units with an increased risk of discrimination, the appoint-
ment of a “diversity representative” is intended to be able to 
effectively address potential cases on site and to remediate them 
where necessary."
"The annual evaluation of our Human Rights CMS, including the appro-
priateness and effectiveness test, was carried out in the same way as 
in the other compliance areas in the reporting year."
"In addition, risks 
related to respecting and protecting human rights are integrated into 
the decision-making and due diligence process in M&A transactions 
such as mergers and investments."
"Raising awareness of human rights within the workforce
We sensitize our employees with various internal training courses on 
human rights in order to give them a basic understanding of the con-
tent of corporate due diligence and social responsibility."
"For this pur-
pose, human rights issues in the respective working environment are 
taught in specific training courses for particularly relevant depart-
ments, especially in purchasing and sales."
"In the reporting year, the 
expert module “Human Rights Compliance” was rolled out, which was 
mandatory worldwide for relevant target groups, such as the central 
purchasing and human resources departments."
"The aim is to clarify 
the relevance of human rights in everyday work."
"Further information 
can be found in the section “Internal information, communication and 
training measures” in the chapter E Compliance."
"Our approach in the supply chain 
GRI 403-7, 408-1, 409-1, 414-1
A global network of suppliers who, for example, provide us with raw 
materials, components, materials and services, contributes to our cor-
porate success."
"Our goal is that our partners along the supply chain 
also comply with social and environmental standards and thus support 
our sustainability efforts."
"In order to fulfill our due diligence obligations 
across the supply chain, we rely on a concept of binding requirements 
and assessment instruments, as well as information and qualification 
measures for suppliers."
"This concept is also an integral part of our 
Human Rights CMS."
"Expectations towards our suppliers
We are committed to responsible sourcing of production and non-pro-
duction material and services, and we reject child labor, forced labor, 
modern slavery as well as other violations of human rights."
"In our Busi-
ness Partner Standards we define our requirements for our business 
partners in terms of respect and support for human rights, good work-
ing conditions, environmental protection, integrity and compliance 
with legal requirements."
"We require our business partners – particu-
larly our direct suppliers – to recognize these standards and to com-
municate their contents to their employees as well as to their 
upstream value chain."
"We also expect our business partners to verify 
compliance with these standards."
"This is an important prerequisite for 
successful cooperation."
"Detailed regulations on these standards and 
requirements are included in our contractual terms and conditions on 
social responsibility and environmental protection, in particular in our 
Daimler Truck Special Terms."
"Further information regarding our Business Partner Standards can be 
found on our website under w supplier.daimlertruck.com/en/sup-
port/news/the-daimler-truck-business-partner-standards."
"Our risk management system was reviewed against the require-
ments of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (SCDDA) in the 
reporting year and is integrated into the Human Rights CMS."
"In the reporting year, the systematic risk analysis of existing suppliers 
was carried out for the first time using a newly introduced IT system."
"This system generates an abstract risk assessment of our suppliers 
based on various risk indicators, particularly in relation to location, as 
well as the use of critical raw materials or commodities."
"The high-risk 
suppliers identified on this basis are then subjected to a concrete risk 
analysis and evaluated using further assessment measures - in partic-
ular using supplier questionnaires such as the Sustainability Assess-
ment Questionnaire."
"Based on this analysis, measures are determined 
for the risks identified."
"We rely on preventative measures such as our 
contractual conditions on social responsibility and environmental pro-
tection as well as qualification measures."
"As a corrective measure we 
work together with suppliers to develop minimization and discontinua-
tion concepts."
"If necessary, we also use further investigation and risk 
monitoring measures, such as external (RSCI) audits and media 
screenings."
"With these instruments we want to increase transparency 
in the supply chain and ensure that internationally recognized human 
rights are respected and other social standards and environmental 
regulations are observed."
"New suppliers of production material are checked on site for sustain-
ability criteria before possible commissioning."
"These on-site inspec-
tions are also carried out at locations of existing suppliers when new 
locations or production volumes are added."
"In particular, questions are 
asked about social and human rights standards, such as working 
hours, remuneration, occupational safety, free choice of employment 
or freedom of association."
"In countries with a high human rights risk, 
the review is even more comprehensive and includes a review of the 
issues of child and forced labor as an integral part."
"In addition, a sup-
plier's sustainability rating derived from the SAQ is requested and 
taken into account as a mandatory criterion in operational purchasing 
when new orders above a defined order value are awarded."
"In the 
reporting year, we covered a total of 60% of our purchasing volume 
planned for 2023 in production material purchasing with a sustainabil-
ity rating based on the SAQ1."
"The aim is to further increase the propor-
tion of participating suppliers."
"We also hold our suppliers of non-production material, especially ser-
vice providers, responsible for respecting and protecting human rights 
and other sustainability aspects."
"Throughout the entire reporting year, 
new suppliers of non- production material in risk countries and of criti-
cal commodity groups were subjected to a due diligence review that 
also covered human rights issues."
"In addition, 27 commodity groups 
and industries that are potentially critical in terms of human rights 
have so far been identified based on a preliminary risk analysis in 
2021."
These include transport logistics and trade fair construction.
"How we handle critical raw materials
GRI 3-3
When examining human rights risks along the supply chain of produc-
tion material, particular attention is paid to raw materials that are 
potentially mined or processed under critical human rights conditions."
"We carry out reviews with suppliers of these raw materials in the form 
of so-called supply chain assessments."
"A particular focus is currently 
on the battery suppliers who supply us with products that contain criti-
cal raw materials that are relevant for our batteries."
"These include in 
particular lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite."
"Our supply chain assess-
ments consist of three steps:
1."
"
We create transparency along the respective raw material supply 
chains
2."
"We identify risk hotspots in these supply chains
3."
"If necessary, we define suitable measures to counteract risks
We have also integrated the use of critical raw materials as a risk indi-
cator into the systematic risk analysis of our suppliers."
"Our member-
ship in initiatives focused on raw material supply chains, such as the 
""Responsible Lithium Partnership"" or the RMI, supports their mea-
sures for a responsible raw material supply chain, especially from 
countries with a high risk of human rights violations."
"1	 The values were determined on November 30, 2023."
"Raising awareness and providing information to our suppliers
In order to raise awareness of human rights issues among our busi-
ness partners, we provide the “Compliance Awareness Module” on our 
website w www.dt-compliance-awareness-module.com/en/."
"Suspected cases of violations of human rights obligations by our direct 
and indirect suppliers can also be submitted via the reporting chan-
nels of the whistleblowing system SpeakUp."
"If a suspicious case about suppliers is received via SpeakUp, the 
SpeakUp team forwards the case to the responsible local unit - usually 
the responsible investigating post in purchasing - for examination and 
further clarification."
"The unit then determines which measures are 
suitable in each individual case in order to investigate a case appropri-
ately."
"As a rule, the measures are directed at our direct suppliers, with 
the aim of jointly developing a concept to end and minimize any griev-
ances."
"In the reporting year, a total of eleven cases were received relating to 
human rights violations in our own business area and were categorized 
by SpeakUp as high-risk reports."
"In addition, five suspected cases of 
human rights violations in our supply chain were received via Speak-
Up's reporting channels."
"Further information about the procedural principles and the procedure 
can be found on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/compli-
ance/whistleblowing-system-speakup as well as in the section 
“Reporting of rule violations via the whistleblowing system SpeakUp” 
in the chapter E Compliance."
"According to WHO estimates from 2021, 13 million traffic-
related deaths and 500 million traffic-related injuries could occur in 
the next ten years if decisive action is not taken."
"At the same time, 
traffic accidents and their consequences, for example on the flow of 
goods, also have an economic impact."
"Traffic safety can thus contrib-
ute to protecting the lives and integrity of road users as well as the 
safety of the transport of economic goods."
"As one of the largest com-
mercial vehicle manufacturers in the world, we have a great responsi-
bility for safety on the roads."
"For us, traffic safety therefore means, in 
particular, assuming social and economic responsibility."
"Traffic safety 
is thus an essential topic of our sustainable business strategy."
"Zero traffic fatalities by 2050 — that is the target of the European 
Union’s “Vision Zero”."
"In cooperation with WHO, the United Nations 
implemented the resolution on “Improving global road safety” in 2020 
and announced the “Decade of Action for Road Safety” (2021–2030)."
The goal is to reduce road fatalities and injuries by 50% by 2030.
"Based on this, we want to underline our ambitions for traffic safety 
with our mission statement “Vision Zero” and contribute our part as a 
truck and bus manufacturer to the “Vision Zero” of the European 
Union."
"This requires a comprehensive traffic safety concept, and our 
aim is to make traffic safer for all involved by further developing exist-
ing safety systems as well as new ones."
"Further information on the 
topic of traffic safety can be found on w www.daimlertruck.com/en/
sustainability/s-social/traffic-safety."
"Organization and responsibilities
The control and regulation system for traffic safety includes all rele-
vant management levels."
"The highest level of responsibility for traffic 
safety lies with the Board of Management and Corporate Sustainability 
Board (CSB), represented by the Board of Management for Truck Tech-
nology Trucks & Buses."
"The Sustainability Steering Committee (SSC) is 
represented by the Head of Global Software & Electronics Product 
Development, who reports to the Board of Management for Truck 
Technology Trucks & Buses on the subject of traffic safety."
"Within the 
Social Working Group, the topic of traffic safety is strategically man-
aged throughout the Group, involving the operating segments and rele-
vant cross-departmental functions."
"Further information can be found 
in the section “Sustainability Management at Daimler Truck” in the 
chapter E Responsible corporate governance."
"The principle of “integral security”
When developing our vehicles, we follow the holistic concept of inte-
gral safety and distinguish between four phases: “Driving assistance”, 
“prepare for a possible accident”, “protect in the event of an accident” 
and “provide help after an accident”."
"— Phase 2: In the event of danger – Safety assistance systems that 
can warn, assist, and engage automatically, as well as protection 
systems that can already be activated in the pre-accident phase."
"— Phase 3: In the event of an accident – Protection systems that 
can intelligently protect all vehicle occupants as required in the 
given situation."
"— Phase 4: After an accident – Systems that can help after an acci-
dent."
"Accident research
Research about accidents in the area of commercial vehicles has 
played a key role for us for 50 years when it comes to improving the 
active and passive safety of our vehicles."
"Aspects of occupant and 
partner protection go hand in hand."
"Detailed accident analyses are 
carried out on a regular basis and the occurrence of real accidents 
involving heavy commercial vehicles is systematically recorded and 
evaluated."
"Traffic safety in the commercial vehicle sector has made 
considerable progress in recent decades as a result of the improve-
ments achieved from accident research."
"Based on this extensive and 
long-standing knowledge base, we were able to develop many of our 
technical safety solutions such as Emergency Brake Assist or Turn 
Assist in a targeted manner and launch them on the market before 
there were legal regulations for them."
"Specific accident data from our accident research concerning trucks 
with combustion engines has also helped to develop safety measures 
for the first generation of our vehicles with alternative drives (battery 
electric and hydrogen-based)."
"The focus here is, for example, on the 
targeted positioning, design, shielding and shutdown of high-voltage 
components, batteries and accumulators."
"To that extent, the electrical 
charging and filling processes with technical gases were also consid-
ered."
"Only the develop-
ment and application of new technologies enable the further develop-
ment of safety systems at the highest level."
"Our global advanced 
development plays a key role in this."
"With our research network, struc-
tured innovation and technology management and the ability to pre-
pare applications in prototypes for series use, we promote the power 
of innovation among other aspects in the area of traffic safety."
"Measures and implementations of safety systems
Our focus is on providing systems to prevent driving errors."
"A positive 
contribution can be expected when we introduce new systems onto 
the market, increase the performance of existing systems, for example 
through new sensors, or bring existing systems into wider use."
"All sys-
tems are extensively tested to explore the driving dynamics limits of 
the various safety features."
"In addition, up to 60 Daimler Truck vehi-
cles are undergoing endurance testing worldwide throughout the year."
"The kilometers driven to test the new systems from 2020 to the end of 
2023 amount to around five million kilometers before the first cus-
tomer use."
"This experience is used in customer tests before market 
launch to ensure not only correct functionality but also suitability for 
everyday use."
"In 2023, measures focused on disseminating existing systems across 
markets, brands and models."
"With the FUSO Next Generation eCanter, 
a comprehensive safety package was introduced into the Japanese 
and European light-duty market segments."
"This means that the 5th 
generation Active Brake Assist (detects vehicles and unprotected driv-
ers) active safety systems, traffic sign recognition, intelligent driving 
light control, rear area monitoring and driver status detection are avail-
able in light commercial vehicle."

4	 Performance Package 2024.
"We take all this into account with our Product Compliance Manage-
ment System (PCMS), our organization for Functional Safety  and our 
Cyber Security Management System."
"Product compliance is about 
ensuring that we comply with all applicable laws, standards and regu-
latory requirements already starting in the development of our safety 
systems."
"Further information on our PCMS can be found in the chap-
ter E Compliance."
"Functional safety
Vehicles are becoming increasingly complex, especially due to increas-
ingly electronic and software components."
"In order for a manufacturer 
to counter risks associated with the increasing complexity of modern 
vehicles, it is important to pay attention to functional safety, i.e., the 
correct functioning of electrical and electronic (E/E) systems."
"The 
technical standard ISO 26262, which relates to E/E-systems in road 
vehicles, is pioneering in this context."
"Because of increasing technical 
complexity, we consider the orientation towards ISO 26262 and the 
implementation of corresponding requirements and processes to be 
central in ensuring a high level of safety for our vehicles."
"Therefore ISO 
26262 has a significant impact on our development processes."
"The requirements 
and expectations of our customers and, where applicable, their cus-
tomers with regard to our products and possible interactions are con-
stantly increasing."
"The Cyber Security Management System (CSMS) 
for our vehicle portfolio is intended to ensure that current security 
requirements are met and that incidents are processed and resolved 
quickly."
"In this context, trucks and buses are monitored throughout 
their life cycle from the perspective of vehicle cyber security."
"One of 
the driving forces for this are regulations such as the UN R-155 “cyber 
security and cyber security management system” and industry stan-
dards such as ISO 21434 for the implementation of cyber security 
measures in vehicle development."
"In the reporting year for example, 
we completed the certification for UN R-155 within the framework of 
EU 2018/858 for Europe."
"Safety systems
Our contribution to greater traffic safety is the development and offer-
ing of high-performance assistance systems, passive safety measures, 
the implementation of active safety systems, as well as support during 
rescue and recovery."
"Our services and trainings also contribute to 
safety."
"With autonomous driving, we expect a further increase in traf-
fic safety as the approval of autonomous driving systems is tied to 
strict safety requirements."
"Effective safety systems deliver their societal benefits when they are 
widely used in transport."
"Active safety and assistance systems
Active safety systems are particularly important in trucks and buses."
"Especially with vehicles of this particular size and weight, it is impor-
tant to reduce the risks of accidents or to actively avoid accidents 
whenever possible, as the risk of a serious accident outcome is high."
"To achieve this, we develop new safety systems in regular develop-
ment cycles with which we can protect and assist drivers in their day-
to-day work."
"In addition to protection systems, this also includes tech-
nical innovations."
"We are currently working on the next safety 
package, which is planned for 2024."
"Innovative technologies from Daimler Truck have often been success-
fully introduced to the market and are now considered industry stan-
dard."
"The protection of unprotected road users is a very special focus 
for us."
"For our heavy commercial vehicles, for example, we offer a 
Brake Assist (“Active Brake Assist” for trucks, “Preventive Brake 
Assist” for buses) that detects pedestrians within its system limits and 
can react to them."
"We have also introduced an active turning assis-
tant, a system to reduce the consequences of accidents and going as 
far as avoiding accidents involving cyclists."
"In addition to active safety systems, our assistance systems also help 
drivers in their work and thus can contribute to preventing accidents."
"With these systems, our goal is to relieve the driver, raise their alert-
ness, prevent fatigue and encourage an adapted driving style, for 
example through prediction, automation, traffic sign recognition, 
enhanced all-round visibility and smart light control."
"Passive safety
Passive safety systems provide protection for vehicle occupants and 
other parties involved in an accident if a collision can no longer be pre-
vented in time."
"In addition to active restraint systems such as the driver’s airbag and 
seat belts with tensioners, a coordinated crash concept based on driv-
er’s cabs with a high level of rigidity, combined with the activation of 
energy-absorbing structures in the front section plays a fundamental 
role for us."
"The focus is also on possibly minimizing indirect risk of 
injury."
"This includes the design and configuration of components of 
the cab interior, fire protection and, if necessary, the deactivation of 
high-voltage systems in vehicles with alternative drives."
"The imple-
mentation of safety solutions in our vehicles is based on our findings 
from accident research and product monitoring."
"Rescue and recovery 
Another important part of our work is informing rescue and recovery 
services in a targeted way, for example through rescue guidelines, res-
cue sheets and towing brochures."
"Detailed knowledge of our vehicles 
and their safety systems helps rescue services get to injured persons 
faster and can therefore help save lives."
"Examples of supporting technical functions in vehicles are the auto-
matic activation of the hazard warning lights and automatic unlocking 
of the central locking system after an accident has been identified."
"Various measures contribute to increasing the safety of rescue ser-
vices, such as high-voltage rescue disconnection points, automatic 
impact detection and high-voltage deactivation."
"Further information on rescue and recovery can be found on  
w www.daimlertruck.com/en/sustainability/s-social/traffic-safety."
"Autonomous driving
Daimler Truck is considered one of the leading truck manufacturers in 
the development of autonomous trucks according to SAE Level 4 with 
safety-relevant redundant driving systems."
"The goal is to enter the US 
market in 2027."
"Autonomous driving is associated with high safety requirements for 
operating in traffic."
"Thus, driver assistance systems and safety systems 
are key for making autonomous driving possible in the future."
"These 
systems have the potential to make traffic safer in the future and 
reduce the risk of accidents or avoid accidents entirely."
"In addition, 
autonomous systems are more resilient to human risk factors such as 
tiredness or inattentiveness and therefore can help reduce the risk of 
an accident."
"At the same time, autonomous trucks can enhance our 
customers’ business and help society cope with the growing volume of 
freight, especially in times of driver shortages."
"In addition, autonomous 
trucks enable increased transport performance, because the vehicles 
can drive over long distances without breaks."
"For these key reasons, 
we continue to drive forward the development of this technology."
"The autonomous-ready Cascadia with redundant functions is based on 
our flagship model of the Daimler Truck brand, Freightliner."
"Critical sys-
tems, such as steering and braking, are available as a back-up in two 
versions and are continuously monitored by the vehicle."
"In the event of 
malfunctions or errors, the newly developed redundant systems can 
control the truck as safely as possible."
"The autonomous-ready Freight-
liner Cascadia is thus suitable for integrating autonomous software, 
hardware and computing systems."
"The autonomously driving truck’s 
system redundancy can contribute to improving traffic safety, which is 
an important step on the road to accident-free driving."
"(TORC) in 2019, we have made further progress in autonomous driving."
"For example, we have shown that driving on US highways, including 
entering and exiting and changing between highways, is possible to do 
safely."
"In the 2023 reporting year TORC acquired the object recogni-
tion specialist Algolux Inc."
"In the future, Algolux's technology 
in the interaction of deep learning, computer vision and computer-
based image generation will help to further expand one of the most 
important technical capabilities for the market launch of autonomous 
trucks."
"During the reporting year, TORC continued to work with leading 
US logistics companies to bring autonomous trucks into practical use."
"Digitalization & services
To provide our customers with the best possible support, we also offer 
modern services, which can contribute to traffic safety."
"The prerequi-
site for this is digitalization in the vehicle."
"Digitalization mainly deals 
with the connectivity of vehicles and the provision of data from the 
vehicle for smart digital services and customized solutions for our cus-
tomers."
"A forward-looking driving style, compliance with driving and rest peri-
ods as well as avoiding speeding are some examples where our fleet 
management system services provide targeted assistance."
"With our 
Mercedes-Benz Uptime and Detroit Connect services, we detect 
errors and accident risks on roads."
"A fully automatic telediagnosis sys-
tem continuously checks the status of the vehicle systems."
"Within sec-
onds the data is interpreted and specific recommendations for action 
are made available."
"In this way, for example, a possible breakdown can 
be avoided or, in the event of a critical condition (for example, leakage 
in the high-pressure circuit of the fuel supply), a recommendation for 
necessary actions can be made (for example, a repair)."
"Driver training and awareness-raising measures
We raise awareness of traffic safety through, for example driver train-
ing, educational programs and roadshows and provide information 
about safety technologies and innovations."
"Daimler Truck offers a vari-
ety of training options for truck and bus drivers, in which our trainers 
train customers on how to use our vehicles."
"We also look at our elec-
tric vehicles and their specific requirements."
"In addition to other con-
tent, for example fuel efficiency, downtimes and operating costs – the 
training aims to increase traffic safety."
"Among other things, drivers 
should be instructed to fully exploit the potential of our safety technol-
ogies."

"Production-related energy and environmental data
GRI 305-1/-2
The data in the Environment chapter is based on the Group structure 
as of the reporting date of December 31, 2023."
"This includes all pro-
duction sites, selected test tracks and R&D sites of the Group compa-
nies controlled by Daimler Truck as well as selected joint ventures with 
50% participation."
"Production sites include all “Completely Built Up” 
(CBU), “Completely Knocked Down” (CKD) and Remanufacturing 
(Reman) sites."
"If estimated values were used for the report for 2022, 
these have been replaced by the latest data in the current report."
"The environmental data is collected from the sites in our environmen-
tal data system."
"Where no actual figures were available in Febru-
ary 2024, estimates were made on the basis of the previous year's fig-
ures and the change in production."
"Air emissions are measured regularly and extrapolated to the year, and 
VOC emissions are also calculated on the basis of various input or out-
put parameters."
"Daimler Truck calculates and documents its CO2e emissions according 
to the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 2004 of the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, in accordance with the categories 
scope 1 & 2."
"Scope 1 & 2 emissions are reported in accordance with 
the Operational Control approach of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"In the previous reports, Daimler Truck's scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions 
were reported."
"From this report onwards, these emissions will be 
reported in CO₂ equivalents (CO₂e)."
"All direct CO2e emissions from our 
Company’s own sources (scope 1), indirect emissions resulting from 
the generation of the purchased electricity and district heat (scope 2) 
are documented."
"Scope 1: We calculate our direct emissions from the combustion of 
fuels, heating oil, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and coal with 
fixed CO₂e emission factors as specified by Government Digital Service 
(GDS) of the British government (GOV.UK)."
"CO2e accounting is carried out using the “market-
based” accounting approach."
"To this end, we collect the CO2e emission 
factors of the local electricity tariffs or electricity supply companies at 
our sites worldwide."
"Where these are not available, the current aver-
age emission factor published for the respective country by the Inter-
national Energy Agency (IEA) or for the USA by the US Environmental 
Protection Agency (US EPA) will continue to be used."
"For comparison 
purposes, CO2e emissions are also reported in accordance with the 
“location-based” method, which only includes the country-specific 
emission factors."
"Specific environmental and energy data
Resource consumption and emissions largely depend on the produc-
tion volume."
"Therefore, we calculate specific values for product areas 
of our Industrial Business."
"For this purpose, the data of the production 
plants is based on the number of vehicles produced in the product 
areas in the plants controlled by the Company."
"We collect the specific 
values according to the segment allocation that has been in force 
since December 2021."
"The specific data gained in this way can only 
represent general benchmarks, because they do not take into account 
the development of the vertical integration of production, the product 
variety and the special features of the production network, which in 
some cases extends across segments."

aspects in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act 
(CSR-RUG), can be found in the respective categories of the risk and 
opportunity report according to their cause."
"Risk management is based on the principle of completeness, which 
means that all identified risks enter the risk management process at 
the level of the individual units."
"The scope of consolidation for risk and opportunity management cor-
responds to the scope of consolidation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and, if necessary, goes beyond it."
"Risks and opportunities 
of the segments and operating units, significant associated compa-
nies, joint ventures and joint operations as well as the corporate 
departments are included."
"Furthermore, the employees responsible for risk management have 
the task of defining measures and, if necessary, initiating such mea-
sures to prevent, mitigate, or protect the Group against risks."
"The Daimler Truck Group is exposed to a great number of risks – risks 
associated with the business activities of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
and its subsidiaries and risks resulting from external influences."
"A risk 
is defined as the danger that events, developments or actions will pre-
vent the Group or one of its segments from achieving its goals."
"This 
includes financial and non-financial risks."
"At the same time, it is impor-
tant to identify opportunities in order to ensure and enhance the com-
petitiveness of the Daimler Truck Group."
"An opportunity is defined as 
the possibility to take advantage of events, developments or actions to 
ensure successful achievement or to even exceed the planned goals of 
the Group or of a segment."
"In order to identify, evaluate and actively manage entrepreneurial risks 
and opportunities at an early stage, effective management and control 
systems are used – these are pooled in a so-called risk and opportu-
nity management system."
Risks and opportunities are not offset.
"The cost-effectiveness of a measure is assessed before it is imple-
mented."
"The possible extent and the probability of occurrence of all 
risks and opportunities from the individual units as well as the respec-
tive measures that have been initiated are continuously monitored."
"Control takes place in the Company at segment level, based on indi-
vidual risks and opportunities."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG, the parent 
company of the Daimler Truck Group, monitors implementation by the 
segments as part of its regulatory, legal and compliance functions."
"The organizational embedding of risk and opportunity management is 
carried out by the risk management organization that has been estab-
lished at the Group."
"The responsibility for operational risk manage-
ment and for the risk management processes is borne by the seg-
ments, corporate functions, organizational units, and companies."
"They 
report on the concrete risks and opportunities at regular intervals to 
their superordinate units."
Unexpectedly occurring material risks must be reported immediately.
"The segments pass along this information to the corporate risk man-
agement unit, which presents it to the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board."
"The Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) 
is responsible for ensuring continuous improvement and evaluating the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system."
"The GRMC is composed of representatives from Accounting & Result 
Management, the Legal department, Compliance, Group Security and 
Investor Relations & M&A, as well as of the CFOs of the segments of 
the Daimler Truck Group."
"The GRMC is chaired by the member of the 
Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG responsible for 
Finance & Controlling."
"The internal Corporate Audit department con-
tributes key findings about the internal control and risk management 
system."
"The internal control system with regard to the accounting pro-
cess aims to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of accounting 
and financial reporting."
"The system includes principles and procedures as well 
as preventive and detective controls."
"The effectiveness of the internal control system is systematically 
assessed with regard to the accounting process."
"The first step involves 
a risk analysis and a control definition with the aim of identifying sig-
nificant risks for the accounting and financial reporting processes in 
the main companies, organizational units, and corporate functions."
"The controls required are then defined and documented in accordance 
with the Group-wide guidelines."
"In order to assess the effectiveness of 
the controls, random samples are tested at regular intervals."
"These 
form the basis for a self-assessment as to whether the controls are 
appropriate and effective."
"The results of this self-assessment are doc-
umented and reported in a Group-wide IT system, and identified con-
trol weaknesses are eliminated."
"The selected companies, organiza-
tional units, and corporate functions confirm the effectiveness of the 
internal control system with regard to the accounting process at the 
end of the annual cycle."
"The Board of Management and the Audit Com-
mittee of the Supervisory Board are regularly informed about potential 
significant control weaknesses and the effectiveness of the control 
mechanisms that have been set up."
"However, the internal control sys-
tem for the accounting process cannot provide absolute certainty that 
material misstatements in the financial reporting will be avoided."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG is responsible for monitoring the internal control and risk man-
agement system."
"The internal Corporate Audit department checks 
whether the statutory framework conditions and internal policies for 
the control and risk management system of the Group are being 
observed."
"Where necessary, measures are initiated in cooperation 
with the respective management."
"The external auditor examines the 
early warning system for risks integrated in the risk management sys-
tem and checks whether it is fundamentally able to detect risks 
threatening the continued existence of the Group at an early stage."
"He 
or she also reports to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board 
on any significant weaknesses found in the in the accounting-related 
internal control system and the early warning risk detection system."
"The processes and systems for both the internal control system and 
the risk management system are monitored on an ongoing basis."
"We 
have introduced appropriate improvement measures to eliminate iden-
tified weaknesses and ensure the continuous improvement of pro-
cesses and systems."
"The 
reporting on risks and opportunities generally takes place in relation to 
the individual segments."
"If no segment is explicitly mentioned, the 
risks and opportunities described apply to all segments."
"When assessing risks and opportunities, we generally consider both 
gross and net values."
"The gross opportunities and risks are presented 
below."
"In addition to the risks and opportunities described below, other risks 
that are not yet known to the Group or have been classified as insignif-
icant may affect the Daimler Truck Group’s profitability, liquidity and 
capital resources, and financial position in the future."

The content of this section was not subject to an audit of its contents in the con-
text of the statutory external audit of our combined management report."
"The 
overall economic framework has a significant influence on vehicle 
sales markets and thus on the Group’s success."
"As a consequence, 
adverse economic developments, either globally or in the markets in 
which the Group operates, may result in substantially diminished 
demand for the Group’s products."
"In addition, demand in the commer-
cial vehicle industry is cyclical, which means that periods of invest-
ment in commercial vehicles are generally followed by slower periods 
in which demand levels decline."
"The length, timing and intensity of 
specific demand cycles, which may affect individual market segments, 
customer groups and regions in which the Group operates, are subject 
to uncertainty."
"Cyclical or variable demand patterns may result in a 
prolonged or unexpected decline in demand for the Group’s products 
and services."
"The economic development in 2023 is described in chapter E Eco-
nomic Conditions and Business Development of the combined man-
agement report."
"Growth assumptions and forecasts for the overall 
development in 2024 are discussed in chapter E Outlook of the 
combined management report."
"Despite the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the real economy 
weakening in 2023 compared to 2022, the further development and 
potential further escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war or, in the worst 
case, its expansion to other countries, continues to pose a major risk."
"The most significant risks as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine war 
are described in the section “Risks and opportunities related to legal 
and political framework conditions”."
"At the country level, especially emerging economies  (e.g., Turkey) 
with high foreign debt and high current account deficits could come 
under pressure, resulting in significant currency devaluations."
"Finan-
cial market turbulence and even currency crises would be possible 
consequences and could put a massive strain on the business activity 
in the affected economies, which would have a negative effect on the 
Group’s sales prospects."
"The unresolved trade conflict between the USA and China, which has 
been going on for several years now, continues to pose a significant 
risk to the further development of global trade."
"More and more 
areas are now affected by the conflict, and there is a threat of increas-
ing technological and economic decoupling of the two countries."
"In return, unforeseen trade easing could generate positive 
impulses and lead to more trade and higher growth."
"In this case, the 
Daimler Truck Group could also benefit."
"Accordingly, changes in investment and consumer behavior will 
affect the development of unit sales."
"Inflation continues to be above 
the ECB target level, which may complicate or slow down an easing of 
the restrictive monetary policy."
"Furthermore, the growth of the econ-
omy in the European Union slowed down considerably in 2023 and is 
expected to continue to be weak in 2024."
"In the European Union (EU), 
the risk of political conflict is increased due to the Russia-Ukraine war."
"The risks triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war are described in the sec-
tion “Risks and opportunities related to legal and political framework 
conditions” below."
"In the USA, the economy developed better than expected during 
2023."
"However, inflation continues to be high, although it is expected 
to decrease during 2024."
"Since the Daimler Truck Group generates a 
substantial proportion of its revenue in the USA, further developments 
in the US economy may significantly impact the Group."
"Furthermore, 
stronger economic growth in the USA would have spillover effects on 
the rest of the world."
"However, increasing domestic political tensions 
in the USA could unsettle consumers and investors and dampen eco-
nomic growth accordingly."
"The assessment of market risks and opportunities is 
linked to assumptions and forecasts about the overall market develop-
ment in the regions in which the Daimler Truck Group is active."
"The 
possibility of markets developing better or worse than assumed or of 
market conditions changing is present for all segments of the Daimler 
Truck Group."
"Potential risks for the development of sales are simulated in risk 
scenarios."
"A lack of market acceptance of certain vehicle models in 
individual regions can have a negative impact on profitability."
"Declining 
vehicle sales may also result from the sometimes-unstable macroeco-
nomic environment and arise in the context of political or economic 
uncertainty."
"This applies in particular to the traditional cyclical con-
struction and logistics industry and the corresponding influence on 
Daimler Truck unit sales."
"Moreover, there is the risk that high demand 
cannot be met in a timely manner due to supply chain constraints."
"The 
developments of markets, unit sales and inventory are continually 
monitored and analyzed by the segments."
"Where necessary, specific 
marketing and sales programs are implemented."
"Volatilities with regard to market developments can also lead to the 
overall market or regional framework conditions for the commercial 
vehicle industry developing better than assumed in the internal fore-
casts and premises, resulting in business opportunities in the market."
"Opportunities may also arise from an improvement in the competitive 
situation or a positive development of demand."
"Realization of the 
opportunities is supported by sales and marketing campaigns."
"Due to the at times difficult financial situation of some dealerships and 
vehicle importers, support from the Daimler Truck Group may become 
necessary to ensure business partners stay afloat."
"The financial situa-
tion of strategically relevant dealerships and vehicle importers is contin-
uously monitored."
"The loss of important dealerships and vehicle import-
ers can lead to customer dissatisfaction and a decline in unit sales."
"Meeting costs where contracts are canceled and having to process out-
standing customer contracts where dealerships go out of business may 
become necessary and have a negative impact on profitability."
"The launch of new products by competitors, a more aggressive pricing 
policy and more difficult net pricing in the sales and aftersales business 
can lead to increasing competitive and price pressure in the vehicle 
segments and have a negative impact on profitability."
"Competitors are 
continually monitored in order to identify these risks at an early stage."
"Depending on the situation, product-specific and possibly regionally 
differing measures are taken to support markets with weaker sales."
"In 
addition, the Daimler Truck Group has introduced various sales-promo-
tional programs that include financial incentives for customers."
"When purchasing vehicles from the Daimler Truck Group, customers 
are offered a wide range of financing and leasing options."
"The 
resulting risks for the Financial Services segment lie primarily in a 
deterioration of the creditworthiness of borrowers, i.e., receivables 
may become fully or partially irrecoverable due to the insolvency of 
customers (counterparty or credit risk)."
"The Daimler Truck Group 
counters credit risks with credit checks based on standardized scoring 
and rating procedures, the collateralization of receivables and an 
effective risk management system with a strong focus on monitoring 
both internal and macroeconomic early warning indicators."
"In connection with lease agreements, risks arise if the resale value of a 
leased vehicle at the end of the agreed term differs from the residual 
value originally calculated and forecast at the time the contract was 
signed and the leasing rate was agreed upon."
"There are risks linked to 
negative developments in the used vehicle markets and associated 
with vehicles’ residual values."
"In order to counteract these risks, 
residual value management processes have been established."
"Depend-
ing on the region and the current market situation, the measures taken 
generally include continuous market monitoring and, where necessary, 
pricing strategies or sales-promoting measures to regulate vehicle 
stocks."
"The quality of market forecasts is verified by regular compari-
sons of internal and external sources, and residual values are adjusted 
as necessary and further developed with regard to methods, processes 
and systems."
"Risks and opportunities related to legal and political framework 
conditions
Around the world, the commercial vehicle industry is subject to far-
reaching statutory requirements."
"Legal and political framework condi-
tions have a considerable influence on the future business success of 
the Daimler Truck Group."
"Regulations concerning vehicles emissions, 
fuel consumption, safety and certification, as well as customs proce-
dures, play an important role."
"Many countries and regions have already implemented stricter regula-
tions to reduce the emissions and fuel consumption of vehicles 
or are currently in the process of introducing such legal requirements."
"They address, for instance, the environmental compatibility of vehi-
cles, including limits on noise emissions, as well as pollutants from the 
emissions caused by production facilities."
"Failure to comply with the 
relevant regulations in the individual regions may result in consider-
able penalties and reputational risks and can even lead to vehicles no 
longer being street legal in the affected markets."
"The regulations described for reducing vehicle emissions and fuel con-
sumption are also fraught with risks for Daimler Truck, as the strict 
legal requirements will be difficult to meet in some countries."
"This pri-
marily affects the markets of the USA, Europe, Japan and, increasingly 
in the future, China."
"The ambitious targets, especially in Europe, can-
not be achieved with conventional technology alone."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group must therefore use the latest technology in order to meet 
these requirements."
"The EU fleet targets for 2025 and 2030 already 
require significant reductions in CO₂-emissions that can only be 
achieved using battery-electric or fuel-cell based drive systems and 
with higher costs."
"Far-reaching risks may continue to arise from the Russia-
Ukraine war."
"The war in Ukraine could escalate further and, in the worst case, 
spread to other countries."
"Such an expansion would pose a significant 
risk to Daimler Truck’s market environment."
"The potential interruptions of supply chains and shortages of commod-
ities, parts or components may result in further increases in energy 
and commodity prices and the prices of parts and components, which 
could result in higher costs."
"Furthermore, as a result of higher infla-
tion, the Group’s cost base in general might be negatively affected."
"In 
addition, rising refinancing costs in the capital markets may lead to 
negative effects on Financial Services."
"Furthermore, the position of the Daimler Truck Group in key foreign 
markets could be affected by the conclusion or amendment of free 
trade agreements."
"If free trade agreements are concluded without 
the participation of countries with Daimler Truck Group production 
sites, the Group could face a competitive disadvantage compared with 
competitors who produce in the countries that are part of the free 
trade agreement."
"At the same time, 
however, the conclusion of new free trade agreements could also cre-
ate opportunities for the Daimler Truck Group vis-à-vis competitors, 
provided that the competitors do not produce in the countries con-
cerned, but the Daimler Truck Group does."
"There is a risk that individual countries will increasingly resort to inter-
ventionist and protectionist measures in an attempt to protect or 
improve their competitiveness on the world market."
"The vehicle indus-
try, including the commercial vehicle industry, is often seen as a key 
sector for generating domestic investments and increasing local value 
added along the entire value chain."
"This can lead to increased costs if 
production facilities have to be set up or expanded or local purchasing 
has to be increased."
"Cutting technological and economic links 
between major markets can also have an impact on earnings if 
research and development have to be conducted locally or value 
chains have to be adjusted because certain technologies cannot 
legally be used in the end products."
"Furthermore, attempts are being 
made to limit imports through market access barriers such as by mak-
ing certification processes more difficult, delaying certifications, 
and imposing complex customs procedures as well as tariffs."
"In addition, traffic policy restrictions to combat traffic jams, noise 
and emissions are becoming increasingly important in cities and met-
ropolitan areas around the world."
"Although they can dampen the sales 
development of conventional vehicles, they can also create demand 
for vehicles with alternative drive systems."
"Daimler Truck continuously monitors the development of the legal and 
political framework conditions and tries to anticipate foreseeable 
requirements and long-term objectives at an early stage in the process 
of product development."
"Compared to the prior year, the legal and 
political framework risks increased, reflecting the current geopolitical 
risk landscape and the possible spillover effects of different events 
around the global on the Daimler Truck Group."
"However, the probabil-
ity of occurrence of the new risks which were identified is low, explain-
ing the decrease of the overall probability of occurrence for this cate-
gory from medium to low compared to the prior year."
"Procurement market risks and opportunities
For the Industrial Business, risks and opportunities on the procure-
ment side are mainly due to fluctuations in raw material and energy 
prices."
"Financial bottlenecks at suppliers, capacity restrictions due to 
supplier failure or exits, limited scope for negotiating prices of sup-
plied parts, and the over- or underutilization of production capacities 
at suppliers can also lead to reduced earnings."
"The Industrial Business of the Daimler Truck Group requires certain 
raw materials, parts and components for the construction of vehicle 
parts and vehicles."
"These include steel, copper, aluminum, precious 
metals, rubber, plastics, particularly within parts and components con-
taining these and other raw materials."
"The cost of such raw materials, 
parts and components represents a significant portion of the Daimler 
Truck Group’s total costs."
"The Daimler Truck Group procures raw 
materials, parts and components from several suppliers."
"However, for 
the majority of parts, the Daimler Truck Group relies on a specific sup-
plier for each individual part (also referred to as “single sourcing”)."
"In general, the ability to pass on increases in raw material, parts and 
component prices in the form of higher prices for manufactured vehi-
cles is limited because of strong competitive pressure on the interna-
tional commercial vehicles markets."
"Rising prices for raw materials 
may therefore have a negative impact on the profit margins of the 
vehicles sold and thus lead to a decline in profitability for the respec-
tive segment."
"For some suppliers, the financial situation remains tense due to the 
market environment."
"The resulting possible production downtimes at 
suppliers may cause supply chain disruptions in the vehicle divisions 
of the Daimler Truck Group and prevent vehicles from being completed 
and delivered to customers on time."
"In order to counteract such dis-
ruptions in the supply chains, support measures may be necessary to 
ensure production and sales by suppliers."
"Taking into 
account the warning signals recorded and the internal classification, 
this involves regular reporting of key performance indicators to the 
Daimler Truck Group and, where necessary, support measures for the 
suppliers can be determined."
"Finally, rapidly rising demand for certain new technologies, such as 
electrified powertrains, could require significant changes to the 
Daimler Truck Group’s supply chain and result in higher product costs 
and supply bottlenecks."
"An increasing shift to e-mobility and digitaliza-
tion throughout the industry has resulted and is expected to continue 
to result in long-term increases in demand for battery cells, semicon-
ductors and certain critical materials, such as lithium, necessary to 
manufacture them."
"A quantification of these risks and oppor-
tunities is shown in table ä B.72."
"Production and technology risks and opportunities
Technical developments and innovations are of key importance for the 
safe and sustainable mobility of the future."
"Through the design of the 
product range, technical innovations are integrated into the strategic 
product planning of the vehicle segments."
"Technology risks can arise 
especially as a result of increasing technical complexity, the continually 
growing range of requirements that need to be met regarding emis-
sions, fuel consumption and safety and the need to meet and con-
stantly raise the quality standards of the Daimler Truck Group."
"These 
risks are prevalent in the automotive business, particularly with regard 
to launching and manufacturing products."
"Daimler Truck Group’s future suc-
cess depends on its ability to correctly assess and respond to the ZEV 
transformation with innovative, commercially attractive products and 
services that are able to compete in the market."
"When a product is launched in the vehicle segments, the required 
components and equipment have to be available."
"In order to avoid 
restrictions in this context, the associated processes are continuously 
evaluated and improved."
"In order to secure and improve the long-term 
future viability of production facilities in the vehicle segments, mod-
ernization as well as expansion, development and restructuring activi-
ties are carried out as required."
"The implementation of moderniza-
tion measures and the launch of new products are usually 
associated with high investments."
"This can also lead to inefficiencies 
in the production process and, as a result, to a temporary reduction in 
production volumes."
"In principle, there is a risk of internal bottlenecks due to low equip-
ment availability or failures of production plants or factories, which 
would result in costs being incurred."
"A prolonged disruption at a manu-
facturing facility could result in production downtimes or temporary 
operation at reduced capacity preventing the Daimler Truck Group 
from completing production orders in a timely manner."
"Loss of busi-
ness volume, reduced productivity or profitability at a particular pro-
duction site and significant repair costs that are not covered by the 
Daimler Truck Group’s insurance coverage."
"Production facilities are 
continuously maintained and modernized."
"As a precaution, spare parts 
are kept on hand for potentially affected systems, and spare machines 
are procured as necessary."
"Capacity restrictions on the availability of batteries for certain vehicle 
models, as well as interruptions in the supply chain can lead to bottle-
necks."
"Compared to the prior year, production and technology risks 
decreased from high to medium, mainly due to the stabilization of the 
global supply chains."
"This is also reflected in the production and tech-
nology chances."
"In the prior year the estimated impact was
medium."
"As of year end 2023, there are no significant production and 
technology opportunities."
"New technical requirements may also lead to restrictions on the sale 
of vehicles that have already been produced."
"Restrictions on certain 
equipment features in new vehicle models and the lack of availability 
of vehicle parts at the right time could also mean that the vehicles 
cannot be handed over to customers as planned."
"In order to avoid 
such bottleneck situations, it is important that capacity bottlenecks 
can be compensated for by forward-looking planning."
"In addition, as 
part of the management of the entire value chain, supply routes as 
well as the availability and quality of products are continuously moni-
tored."
"As a risk prevention measure, a supplier management system is 
in place to ensure the quantity and quality of the components required 
to manufacture the vehicles."
"Lack of availability and quality problems 
with certain vehicle parts can lead to production downtimes and 
higher costs."
"The Daimler Truck Group is subject to risks relating to deviation from 
planning in connection with large projects, including the development 
and launch of new vehicle generations, vehicles or powertrains."
"This 
may especially be the case when capital-intensive projects, such as 
factory buildouts or capacity expansions, e.g., the introduction of a 
new production line, are required."
"These risks may result from a num-
ber of factors, including inaccurate assumptions with respect to plan-
ning and implementation costs, unexpected technical challenges, 
weaknesses in project design and management, and poor perfor-
mance of third-party suppliers and business partners."
"These factors 
could result in significant cost overruns, delays in new product 
launches, delivery delays, quality issues and damage to customer rela-
tionships."
"Such warranty 
and goodwill cases as well as quality problems both with components 
in vehicles and in connection with technical innovations on vehicles 
that require adjustments can lead to financial burdens."
"Possible claims 
in connection with such risks are examined and, if necessary, appro-
priate measures are initiated for the affected products."
"Information technology risks and opportunities
The systematically pursued digitalization strategy opens up new 
opportunities for Daimler Truck and allows it to enhance customer 
benefits and the value of the Company."
"Nevertheless, the high pene-
tration level of information technology (IT) in all business areas also 
harbors risks for business and production processes as well as for 
their services and products."
"The ever-growing threat posed by cybercrime and the spread of 
aggressive malicious code give rise to risks that can affect the avail-
ability, integrity and confidentiality of information and IT-supported 
operating resources."
"Despite extensive precautions, in the worst-case 
scenario, this can lead to a temporary interruption of IT-supported 
business processes with severe negative effects on the Group’s earn-
ings."
"In addition, the loss or misuse of sensitive data may under cer-
tain circumstances lead to a loss of reputation."
"In particular, applica-
ble regulatory requirements such as the EU General Data Protection 
Directive (EU-GDPR) may, among other things, give rise to claims by 
third parties and result in costly regulatory requirements and penalties 
with an impact on earnings."
"For the globally active Daimler Truck Group and its comprehensive 
business and production processes, it is of vital importance that infor-
mation is available, up-to-date, complete and correct and that it can 
be exchanged as needed."
"The Group’s internal IT security framework is 
based on international standards and uses industrial standards and 
good practice as part of its protective measures."
"New regulatory 
requirements for cyber security and cyber security management sys-
tems are taken into account in the further development of our pro-
cesses and policies."
"When managing the increasing supply chain risks posed by ransom-
ware threats, Daimler Truck prioritizes comprehensive cyber 
protection strategies and measures to secure its collaboration with 
third parties."
"Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable IT infrastructure must 
be used to protect information."
"Cyber threats must be identified over 
the entire lifecycle of applications and IT systems, and dealt with in 
line with their criticality."
"Particular attention is paid to risks that could, 
at worst, result in an interruption of business processes due to IT sys-
tem failures and/or the loss and corruption of data."
"The advancing dig-
italization and connectivity of production equipment is supplemented 
by coordinated technical and organizational security measures."
"Due to growing demands concerning the confidentiality, integrity and 
availability of data, Daimler Truck has implemented a wide range of 
preventive and corrective measures in order to minimize the associ-
ated risks and limit possible damage."
"For example, the Group reduces 
potential interruptions of operating processes in data centers by 
means of mirrored data sets, decentralized data storage, outsourced 
data backups and IT systems designed for high availability."
"Emergency 
plans are developed and employees are trained and regularly sensi-
tized in order to maintain operating capability."
"Specific threats are 
analyzed, and countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active 
Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC)."
"The protection of products 
and services against the danger of falling prey to hacker attacks and 
cybercrime is under constant development."
"Personnel risks and opportunities
The Daimler Truck Group strives for good relationships with its 
employees, their trade unions as well as employee representative 
bodies and stakeholders."
"Any deterioration of 
the relationships with trade unions, works councils and other 
employee representative bodies could adversely impact the Daimler 
Truck Group’s business operations."
"The Group could face strikes or 
other types of conflicts with trade unions, works councils or its 
employees in the future."
"Any such strikes, conflicts, work stoppages or 
other industrial actions may disrupt the Group’s production and sales 
activities, damage its reputation and adversely affect its customer 
relations."
"The future success of the Daimler Truck Group also depends 
on the extent to which it succeeds in recruiting, integrating and per-
manently retaining specialist staff."
"The established human resources 
instruments take such personnel risks into consideration."
"A particular 
focus of human resources management is the targeted personnel 
development and further training of the Company’s workforce."
"In order 
to remain successful as a company, we continuously develop the way 
we work together and optimize our management culture."
"Demographic developments make it essential for the Group to deal 
with changes caused by a changing workforce and to secure a skilled 
new generation of specialists and future executives."
"Generation man-
agement addresses this by implementing measures that do justice to 
the scope of the issue."
"We counter economic, market and competitive 
fluctuations with the established time and flexibility instruments, 
enabling reactions that are suitable for the respective situation."
"Efficiency improvements and cost savings are crucial for the 
Group to maintain its competitiveness and improve its profitability."
"Daimler Truck is in the midst of implementing a number of operational 
performance and cost-saving initiatives to address fixed and variable 
costs affecting profitability."
"These operational performance and cost-
saving measures, or components thereof, may not deliver the intended 
benefits within the time the Group targets."
"This may result in imple-
mentation costs in excess of those originally budgeted by the Group 
and the actual results of the initiatives may differ from the targets."
"If 
the targeted operational performance and cost-saving measures are 
not fully realized or achieved within the intended time, this could have 
an adverse effect on the Group’s profit margins."
"Particu-
larly in the case of new technologies, associated companies can help 
boost synergy effects and improve cost structures in order to success-
fully face the competition in the commercial vehicle industry."
"The Daimler Truck Group generally participates in the risks and oppor-
tunities of associated companies and joint ventures in line with its 
equity interest."
"It is also subject to share-price risks and opportunities 
if those companies are listed on the stock exchange."
"The remeasurement of an interest in an associated company can 
result in risks and opportunities related to the investment’s carrying 
amount for the segment to which the associated company belongs."
"Risks can also arise from ongoing business activities, especially 
through the integration of employees, technologies and products."
"In addition, further financial obligations or addi-
tional financing requirements could arise."
"Associated companies are 
subject to a monitoring process so that, if necessary, decisions can be 
promptly made on whether or not measures should be taken to sup-
port or secure profitability."
"The recoverable amounts of investments in 
associated companies are also regularly monitored."
"Financial risks and opportunities
The following section deals with the financial risks and opportunities of 
the Daimler Truck Group."
"Risks and opportunities can have a negative or positive effect on the 
Group’s profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial posi-
tion."
"The probability of occurrence and impact of these risks and 
opportunities are listed in table ä B.73."
"In principle, the Group’s operating and financial risk exposures, on 
which the financial risks and opportunities are based can be divided 
into symmetrical and asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles."
"With 
the symmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g., currency expo-
sures), risks and opportunities are equally present, while with the 
asymmetrical profiles (e.g., credit and country exposures), the risks 
outweigh the opportunities."
"Daimler Truck is fundamentally exposed to risks and opportunities 
arising from changes in market prices such as exchange rates, interest 
rates and commodity prices."
"Changes in market prices can have a neg-
ative or positive effect on the Group’s profitability, financial and asset 
position."
"The Group is also exposed to credit, country and liquidity risks, and 
risks from changes in credit ratings."
"As part of the risk management 
process, Daimler Truck regularly assesses these risks by considering 
changes in key economic indicators and market information."
"Plan 
assets to cover pension and health care benefits (market-sensitive 
investments, including equity and interest-bearing securities) are not 
included in the following analysis."
"Exchange rate risks and opportunities
The Group’s global orientation means that its business operations and 
financial transactions are linked to risks and opportunities related to 
fluctuations in exchange rates."
"This applies in particular to fluctuations in the US dollar, the British 
pound, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen and other currencies, 
against the euro."
"An exchange rate risk or opportunity arises in busi-
ness operations primarily when revenue is generated in a different cur-
rency from that of the related costs (“transaction risk”)."
"While production costs are incurred primarily in US dollars, euros and 
yen, a portion of revenue is generated in other currencies."
"Daimler 
Truck is exposed to this type of transaction risk, but only to a lesser 
extent thanks to its global production network."
"Regularly updated cur-
rency risk exposures are successively hedged with suitable financial 
instruments (predominantly currency forwards) in accordance with 
exchange rate expectations, which are continually reviewed, limiting 
both risks and opportunities."
"Any overcollateralization caused by 
changes in exposure is generally resolved promptly using appropriate 
measures."
"There are also exchange rate risks and opportunities 
related to the translation of the net assets, income and expenses of 
companies of the Group outside the eurozone (“translation risk”), 
against which the Group generally does not hedge."
"Interest rate risks and opportunities
Changes in interest rates can create risks and opportunities for both 
business operations and financial transactions."
"Daimler Truck employs 
a variety of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to meet the 
liquidity requirements of its business operations on a day-to-day basis."
"Most of these financial instruments are linked to the financial services 
business of Financial Services."
"Interest rate risks and opportunities 
arise when fixed interest periods between the assets and liabilities 
side of the balance sheet are incongruent."
"By means of refinancing 
coordinated with the terms of the financing agreements, the risk of 
maturity mismatch is minimized from both an interest-rate and a 
liquidity point of view."
"Remaining interest rate risks are managed 
through the use of derivative financial instruments."
"Derivative interest rate instru-
ments, such as interest rate swaps, are used to achieve the desired 
fixed interest rates and asset/liability structures (“asset and liability 
management”)."
"Commodity price risks and opportunities
As described in the section on procurement market risks and opportu-
nities, Daimler Truck is exposed to risks from changes in commodity 
prices."
"A small proportion of the commodity price risks, primarily from 
the planned purchase of certain metals, can be reduced through the 
use of derivative financial instruments."
"Credit risks
Credit risk describes the risk of a financial loss resulting from a coun-
terparty failing to meet its contractual payment obligations."
"Credit risk 
encompasses both the direct risk of default and the risk of a deteriora-
tion of creditworthiness as well as concentration risks."
"The Group is subject to credit risks, which result primarily from the 
financial services business and the operations of the vehicle business."
"The risks from leasing and sales financing are addressed in the section 
on general market risks and opportunities."
Credit risks also arise from the Group’s liquidity investments.
"Should 
payment defaults occur, this would adversely affect the Group’s profit-
ability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial position."
"The limit 
methodology for liquid investments with financial institutions has been 
continuously refined over the past few years."
"When making investment 
decisions, we prioritize the issuer’s creditworthiness, as well as bal-
anced risk diversification."
"The majority of liquid assets are held in 
investments with an external investment grade or better rating."
"Country risks
Country risk describes the risk of a financial loss resulting from 
changes in political, economic, legal or social conditions in the respec-
tive country, for example due to sovereign measures such as expropria-
tion or a ban on currency transfers."
"Daimler Truck is subject to country 
risks, which primarily result from cross-border financing or collateral-
ization for Group companies or customers, from investments in subsid-
iaries or joint ventures, and from cross-border trade receivables."
"Further information on country risks in the context of the disclosure of 
events after the reporting period can be found in E Note 41."
"Events 
after the reporting period of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"In addition, country risks also arise from cross-border 
investments in financial institutions."
"The Group addresses these risks 
by setting country limits (e.g., for hard currency portfolios of Financial 
Services companies)."
"The Group also has an internal rating system, in 
which all countries in which Daimler Truck operates are divided into 
risk classes."
"Downgrades may 
adversely affect the Group’s financing if they increase the cost of bor-
rowing or limit the Group’s financing options."
"In addition, downgrades 
may discourage investors from investing in Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans
Daimler Truck has defined benefit pension commitments and, to a 
small extent, additional obligations for healthcare benefits, which are 
largely covered by plan assets."
"The balance of pension obligations and 
plan assets constitutes the carrying amount or funded status for these 
employee benefit plans."
"The measurement of pension obligations and 
the calculation of net pension expense are based on assumptions."
"Even small changes in those assumptions, e.g."
"a change in the dis-
count rate, have a negative or positive effect on the funded status and 
Group equity for the current financial year and, if they occur, lead to a 
change in the period-related net pension expense in the following 
financial year."
"The fair value of plan assets is largely determined by 
developments on the capital markets."
"Unfavorable or favorable devel-
opments, especially in shares and marketable debt securities, reduce 
or increase the carrying amount of plan assets."
"A change in the com-
position of plan assets can also have a positive or negative impact on 
their fair value."
"The broad diversification of investments, the selection 
of asset managers based on quantitative and qualitative analyses and 
the ongoing monitoring of returns and risk contribute to reducing the 
investment risk."
"The structure of pension obligations is taken into 
account when determining the investment strategy for plan assets in 
order to reduce fluctuations in the funded status."
"Further information on the pension plans and their risks can be found 
in E Note 24."
"Provisions for other risks of the Notes to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements."
"Additional information on financial risks, 
risk-limiting measures and the management of these risks can be 
found in E Note 34."
"Management of financial risks of the Notes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Information on the Group’s 
financial instruments can be found in E Note 33."
"Financial instru-
ments of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"It recognizes provi-
sions for these risks if and to the extent that those provisions are likely 
to be utilized and the amount of the obligations can be determined 
with sufficient accuracy."
"Legal risks
Regulatory risks
The vehicle industry, and hence also the commercial vehicle industry 
is subject to extensive government regulations all over the world."
"Leg-
islation in various jurisdictions regulates the occupant safety and envi-
ronmental impact of trucks, buses and other vehicles, including emis-
sion levels, fuel economy, and noise levels, as well as the emissions of 
the factories in which the vehicles or parts thereof are manufactured."
"Failure to comply with relevant regulations in individual regions may 
result in significant penalties and reputational risks, as well as the 
non-approval of products in the affected markets."
"To maintain high quality standards for its products and to comply with 
government-prescribed safety and other standards, the Group incurs 
substantial costs for monitoring, certification and quality assurance."
"Meeting government-mandated vehicle standards is costly and often 
technologically challenging, particularly where required standards con-
flict with one another."
"With the increasing complexity of commercial 
vehicles, also due to digitalization of components and their communi-
cation with each other, the risk of vehicle defects increases."
"The adop-
tion of new technologies, many of which are still being refined for use 
in the transportation industry, including autonomous driving technolo-
gies and battery-electric vehicles, may increase the Group’s exposure 
to vehicle defects and product liability."
"Applicable laws and govern-
mental standards require manufacturers to take action to correct defi-
ciencies related to vehicle safety and other standards, which may also 
result in recalls."
"Costs associated with delays in new model launches 
due to product defects and recall campaigns or warranty costs to rem-
edy defects in vehicles that have been sold can be substantial."
"Violations of applicable legal regulations in this respect are 
subject to sanctions, such as regulatory fines or criminal conse-
quences."
"In addition, any violation can lead to negative media cover-
age and affect the Group’s reputation."
"Risks from legal proceedings
The subsidiaries of Daimler Truck Holding AG (especially Daimler Truck 
AG) are confronted with various legal proceedings, claims as well as 
governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on a large 
number of topics."
"These include, for example, vehicle conformity and 
vehicle safety, dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships, 
financial services, industrial property rights (in particular patent 
infringement suits), warranty claims and antitrust proceedings (includ-
ing claims for damages)."
"If the outcome of such legal proceedings is 
negative for the Daimler Truck Group or such proceedings are settled, 
the Group may be required to pay substantial compensatory and puni-
tive damages or to undertake service actions, recall campaigns, mone-
tary penalties or other costly actions."
"Legal proceedings and related 
settlements may have an impact on the Group’s reputation."
"Antitrust law proceedings (including actions for damages)
Mercedes-Benz Group AG (formerly Daimler AG), the former parent 
entity of Daimler Truck AG, was addressee of an antitrust proceeding 
initiated by the European Commission."
"The European Commission found that 
Daimler AG participated in the relevant arrangements from January 17, 
1997 to January 18, 2011."
"The individual fine imposed on Daimler AG 
by the European Commission’s settlement decision amounted to 
€1.09 billion and was fully paid in 2016."
"Following the settlement decision by the European Commission, legal 
actions, class actions and other forms of legal redress for damages by 
direct and indirect truck customers have been filed or initiated in sev-
eral jurisdictions."
"Damage claims could result in substantial liabilities 
for the Daimler Truck Group as well as significant costs expended for 
defense measures, which may have a material adverse effect on the 
Daimler Truck Group’s operations and its liquidity and capital 
resources."
"In relation to the cartel infringement described above, most substan-
tial claims (including certain types of class actions or aggregator 
claims) are pending or have been initiated in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain."
"Claims are also pending in cer-
tain other European countries and in Israel (in a total of approximately 
20 countries)."
"The Daimler Truck Group takes appropriate legal remedies to defend 
itself and reflects the constantly evolving jurisprudence in its risk 
assessments and strategic decisions."
"It cannot be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks from legal 
proceedings discussed above, individually or in the aggregate, may 
materially adversely impact the profitability, liquidity and capital 
resources and financial position of the Group or any of its segments."
"As legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of uncertainty, it 
is possible that after their final resolution, some of the provisions that 
have been recognized for them could prove to be insufficient."
"As a 
result, substantial additional expenditures may arise."
"This also applies 
to legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no requirement to 
recognize a provision."
"Although the final result of any such litigation may influence the 
Group’s earnings and cash flows in any particular period, the Group 
believes that any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sustained 
effect on the Group’s financial position."
Further information on legal proceedings is provided in E Note 31.
"Legal proceedings of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
"Tax risks and opportunities
Daimler Truck Holding AG and its subsidiaries operate in many coun-
tries around the world and are therefore subject to numerous different 
statutory provisions and tax audits."
"It is therefore possible that the tax 
provisions and tax liabilities recognized may prove to be insufficient, 
which may have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flow and net 
profit."
"Positive effects on the Group’s net profit and cash flow are also possi-
ble as a result of retroactive legislation, future court rulings or changes 
in the opinions of the tax authorities."
"Any changes or interventions by the tax authorities are continuously 
monitored by the Tax department, and measures are taken if neces-
sary."
"In addition, if there is no or too little future taxable earnings, there is a 
risk that the tax benefit from loss carryforwards and tax-deductible 
temporary differences may not be recognized or may no longer be rec-
ognized in full, which could have a negative impact on net profit."
"On the other hand, there is an accounting opportunity that tax benefits 
currently not recognized in full may be used or recognized in future 
years and could thus have a positive impact on the Group’s net profit."
"In particular, legal risks or social violations by part-
ners and suppliers can have a negative effect on the reputation of the 
Daimler Truck Group, the environment and the employees of partners 
and suppliers."
"As one of the basic principles of corporate activity, 
Daimler Truck therefore pays particular attention to compliance with 
legal and ethical rules – including when selecting partners and suppli-
ers."
"In order to recognize risks and opportunities at an early stage and to 
successfully deal with the current risk and opportunity situation, the 
established risk and opportunity management system is continuously 
monitored and further developed."
"Despite the overall risk situation of the Daimler Truck Group remaining 
at a similar level compared with the prior year, the distribution in the 
different risk categories changes significantly."
"Procurement market 
risks decreased, reflecting the stabilization of the international supply 
markets, as well as of the energy and raw material prices."
"Notwith-
standing the reduction, procurement market risks remain high 
because of persisting regional and sectoral supply bottlenecks."
"Pro-
duction and technology risks decreased from high to medium, which is 
also due to the stabilization of the global supply chains."
"On the other hand, market risks have significantly increased, an indica-
tion of the ongoing sales and pricing constraints experienced on the 
local and regional level."
"The legal and political framework risks also 
increased, reflecting the current geopolitical risk landscape and the 
possible spillover effects of different events around the global on the 
Daimler Truck Group."
"Personnel risks developed from low to high com-
pared to the prior year, due mainly to the risks associated with the 
upcoming union negotiations in North America."
"The overall estimated financial impact of the opportunities of the 
Daimler Truck Group decreased compared to the prior year."
"A major 
driver of this change was the stabilization of the raw material prices 
from a high level in the prior year."
"However, like in the case of the pro-
curement risks, procurement market opportunities continue to be 
high, reflecting the differences observed on a local and regional level."
"Risks that, alone or in combination with other risks, could jeopardize 
the Group’s continued existence are reviewed regularly as part of the 
determination of risk-bearing capacity."
"No such risks were identified 
either on the balance sheet date nor at the time of preparation of the 
annual and consolidated financial statements."
"This planning takes into 
account current business development as well as possible opportuni-
ties and risks, which are explained in detail in the E Risk and Oppor-
tunity Report in the combined management report."
"The premises and 
assessments we have set regarding the overall economic conditions 
and the development of the commercial vehicle markets are taken into 
account."
"The estimates presented for the future course of business 
are based on the objectives of our segments."
"Against this background, 
we adjust our expectations for business performance in line with the 
current outlook regarding the development of the commercial vehicle 
markets."
"The statements made below are based on our level of knowl-
edge at the time the combined management report 2023 was pre-
pared."
"The definition of the sensitivities for the qualitative comparative 
description of changes in key figures (“on”, “slightly” and “signifi-
cantly” above or below the prior-year level) can be found in chap-
ter E Corporate Profile of the combined management report."
"The outlook is particularly subject to further geopolitical developments 
and their impact on the global economy."
"The future development of 
inflation continues to determine the monetary policy environment and 
influence the decisions of central banks."
"A comparison of the key figures of the outlook provided with the actual 
development in the 2023 financial year as well as the outlook for the 
2024 financial year is shown in table ä B.75 of chapter E Outlook."
"The world economy
We expect global economic growth to slow further in 2024."
"The 
restrictive monetary policy environment is likely to continue to 
dampen demand and inhibit consumer and capital expenditure."
"In 
addition, it cannot be ruled out that current geopolitical risks will have 
a negative impact on the real economy."
"However, the continued 
decline in inflation rates could trigger a reversal in the monetary policy 
stance of the leading central banks."
"This would support a recovery of 
the global economy in the second half of the year."
"According to our 
forecasts, the global economy will grow by up to 2.5% in 2024, once 
again below the long-term average growth rate."
"Economic output growth in the eurozone is likely to remain at a weak 
level in 2024 (+0.5%)."
"We assume that the German economy will stag-
nate in the current year."
"We expect an average increase in

consumer prices in the eurozone of up to 2.5% in 2024."
"A possible 
return of the inflation rate towards the ECB's inflation target makes 
interest rate cuts more likely over the course of the year."
"A decline in inflation towards the target corridor in the US may also 
lead to a change in monetary policy over the course of the year."
"Over-
all, we expect an average inflation rate of up to 3.0% and growth in the 
US economy of up to 2.5% in 2024."
"With growth of around 2.0%, the Brazilian economic output is expected 
to grow less strongly in 2024 than in the past year."
"We expect that 
China will continue to make an important contribution to global eco-
nomic growth in 2024 (+4,5%)."
"The overall economic development in 
Japan is likely to cool down (+0.5%)."
"From today’s perspective, we anticipate a market vol-
ume for heavy-duty trucks (“class 8”) in North America of between 
280 and 320 thousand units."
"The market for heavy-duty trucks in the 
EU30 region (European Union, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Nor-
way) will probably have a volume of between 260 and 300 thousand 
units."
"Unit sales
Based on our general assumptions about the global economy and the 
commercial vehicle markets that are important to us, we expect unit 
sales of between 490 and 510 thousand units for the Industrial Busi-
ness."
"In the Trucks North America segment, we assume that unit sales will 
be between 180 and 200 thousand units in a slightly weakening macro-
economic environment in North America."
"For the Mercedes-Benz segment, we expect unit sales of 140 to 160 
thousand units, which takes into account, among other things, an 
expected market decline in the EU30 region."
"In the Trucks Asia segment, we expect unit sales levels in a corridor 
of 130 to 150 thousand units."
"For the Daimler Buses segment, we are also forecasting a similar vol-
ume compared to the prior year with a unit sales corridor of between 
23 and 28 thousand units."
"Revenue and EBIT
We expect the Daimler Truck Group’s revenue to be between €55 and 
€57 billion in the 2024 financial year."
"For the Industrial Business, we 
assume revenue of between €52 and €54 billion and an adjusted 
return on sales of 9% to 10.5%."
"Based on our expected market outlook, the factors mentioned above 
and the planning of our segments, we expect the Group's EBIT in 2024 
to be at the same level as the previous year."
"We also expect the 
Group's adjusted EBIT to be at the same level as the previous year."
"An adjusted return on sales of 11% to 13% is expected for the Trucks 
North America segment."
"Despite the expected weakening of the 
commercial vehicle markets in North America, we expect the return on 
sales to develop stable."
"With an adjusted return on sales of 8.5% to 10.5% in the Mercedes-
Benz segment, we forecast that we will achieve a similar return on 
sales compared to the prior year despite the expected market decline 
in the EU30 region."
"In the Trucks Asia segment, we assume an adjusted return on sales in 
a corridor of 3% to 5% despite an expected weakening of relevant com-
mercial vehicle markets."
"For the Daimler Buses segment, we forecast an adjusted return on 
sales of 5% to 7%."
"We expect positive effects from net pricing and 
product mix due to a further recovery in the coach market."
"We forecast new business of between €11 and €13 billion for the 
Financial Services segment."
"This is driven in particular by the growth 
of business operations of the Financial Services segment in Europe 
and South America."
"For 2024, in a macroeconomic environment char-
acterized by uncertainty, we assume increased adjusted earnings and 
expect an adjusted return on equity of 9% to 11%."
"In future, to support 
the Daimler Truck rating, we will take into account the segment’s tar-
get of an average equity ratio of ten percent (previously nine percent) 
when setting the equity base of all financial services companies."
"Free cash flow and Liquidity
We assume that the free cash flow of the Industrial Business in 2024 
will be slightly above the level of the previous year."
"Based on the sta-
ble revenue and earnings development we expect, we are assuming a 
slight easing in inventories as well as a largely stable supply situation."
"In addition, we expect that the improved inventory development will be 
partially offset by higher investments in research and development 
and in property, plant and equipment."
"For 2024, we are aiming for a liquidity level that is appropriate to the 
general risk situation on the financial markets and the risk profile of 
our Company."
"When measuring the amount of liquidity, possible risks 
in refinancing, for example due to temporary distortions on the finan-
cial markets, are also taken into account."
"We assume that we will have 
good access to the capital markets and the banking market in 2024."
"We want to cover our financial needs primarily through bonds, short-
term bonds (commercial papers), bank loans and the securitization of 
receivables from financial services."
"The focus would be on bonds in 
the USD, CAD and EUR bond markets."
"Most central banks started a 
cycle of interest rate hikes since 2022, which has generally led to ris-
ing refinancing costs."
"We assume that the cycle of interest rate 
increases in the markets relevant to us will come to an end in 2024 
and that there may be possible interest rate cuts."
"In addition, our goal 
is to continue to ensure a high level of financial flexibility."
"Against the backdrop of the robust liquidity position, the Board of 
Management and Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
decided on July 10, 2023 to implement a share buyback program."
"On 
this basis, own shares worth up to €2 billion (excluding incidental 
acquisition costs) will be acquired on the stock exchange over a period 
of up to 24 months since August 2, 2023."
"We are now aiming for a payout ratio of 
40% to 60% (previously 40%) of the consolidated profit attributable to 
Daimler Truck shareholders."
"In addition, we take the free cash flow of 
the Industrial Business into account when calculating the dividend."
"According to the Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz or AktG), the 
dividend is distributed from the distributable profit reported in the 
annual financial statements of Daimler Truck Holding AG in accor-
dance with the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch or 
HGB)."
"The Board of Management and Supervisory Board will propose 
to the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2024 to distribute a divi-
dend of €1.90 per no-par value share entitled to dividends for the 2023 
financial year."
"Investment and research activities
We expect for investments in property, plant and equipment and 
research and development expenditure (including capitalization) in 
total a slight increase in 2024 compared to the prior year."
"We have 
summarized the essential content at Group and segment level below."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment
For the 2024 financial year, we will continue to invest heavily in prop-
erty, plant and equipment to further advance our company."
"This 
applies in particular to e-mobility and the expansion of our sales net-
works."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment at the Trucks North 
America segment are mainly characterized by the expansion of manu-
facturing and test facilities as well as the acquisition of new produc-
tion equipment to support the transformation to zero-emission vehi-
cles."
"Investments in property, plant and equipment at Mercedes-Benz is 
driven by the preparation of the plants for the introduction of further 
zero-emission vehicles."
"In addition, investments in the Company’s own 
spare parts business, following the spin-off from the former Daimler 
AG (now Mercedes-Benz Group AG) will continue."
"In the Trucks Asia segment, the focus in 2024 will continue to be on 
new technologies, including e-mobility and digitalization, on the devel-
opment of the existing product portfolio as well as on the moderniza-
tion of distribution centers, warehouses and plant optimization."
"For the Daimler Buses segment, investments in the expansion of the 
locations in Holysov (Czech Republic), Ligny (France) and Hosdere 
(Turkey) are planned."
"Research and development
With our research and development activities, we aim to increase com-
petitiveness against the backdrop of the mobility transformation and 
the associated technological challenges."
"We are focusing on zero-
emission vehicles, automated driving and ongoing development of 
existing products."
"Trucks North America will also continue to focus on investments in 
zero-emission vehicles, in improving fuel efficiency and performance 
of existing products."
"At Mercedes-Benz, development of battery- and hydrogen-powered 
vehicles will continue to be the focus in 2024."
"Another focal point will 
be the adaption of the cab to future legal regulations."
"For Trucks Asia, the aim is to continue the development of e-mobility 
and new technologies and to further develop the existing portfolio."
"At Daimler Buses, the significant shift toward zero-emission drive 
systems will continue in 2024."
"Investments will also be made, among 
other things, in meeting the Euro VII emissions standard for coaches 
by 2027."

corporate governance
Corporate Governance
The designation Daimler Truck Group includes Daimler Truck Holding 
AG and the companies of its Group."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG is a 
stock corporation organized under German Stock Corporation law, 
with registered office in Stuttgart and business address at Fasanen-
weg 10, 70771 Leinfelden-Echterdingen."
"It has three governing bodies: 
the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board and the General 
Meeting."
"The duties of the governing bodies are essentially derived 
from the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Articles of Incor-
poration of Daimler Truck Holding AG, and the Rules of Procedure."
"Daimler Truck Holding 
AG also voluntarily complied and complies with the recommendations 
of the GCGC."
"Principles guiding our conduct
Our business conduct is aligned with Groupwide standards and with 
our Company values that go beyond the requirements of the law and 
the GCGC."
"In order to achieve long-term and sustainable business suc-
cess on this basis, our goal is to ensure that our activities are in line 
with the interests of environment and society."
"This is because we, as 
one of the world’s leading manufacturers of commercial vehicles, also 
strive to bring vehicles onto the roads that have a future."
"We have 
defined the most important principles in our Daimler Truck Code of 
Conduct, which serves as a frame of reference for all employees of the 
Daimler Truck Group and supports them in making the right decisions 
even in difficult business situations."
"Our Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct defines our common understanding of how to 
behave properly and is a central component of our corporate culture."
"At the heart of our Code of Conduct are our four Purpose Principles: 
“We start with listening”, “We build to solve”, “We lead with the long 
view” and “We progress together”."
"In addition to the Purpose Princi-
ples, our Code of Conduct includes requirements and regulations con-
cerning respect for and the protection of human rights and dealing 
with conflicts of interest; it also prohibits all forms of corruption."
"The 
Code of Conduct was revised in the 2022 financial year and published 
at the beginning of February 2023."
"The implementation was supported 
by a Groupwide communication campaign."
"The Code of Conduct 
applies to all companies and employees of the Daimler Truck Group 
worldwide."
"It is available at w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/
compliance/daimler-truck-code-of-conduct."
"Policy statement on Social Responsibility and Human Rights
We are committed to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and 
Human Rights and the National Action Plan for Business and Human 
Rights of the German Federal Government."
"Respect for and protection 
of human rights is a fundamental element of our social responsibility."
"We are strongly committed to this in all our companies and expect our 
business partners to do the same."
"We confirm our commitment in our 
Policy Statement on Social Responsibility and Human Rights."
"It 
extends our obligation to respect human rights from our Code of 
Conduct and forms the basis for the assumption of social responsibil-
ity at Daimler Truck."
"Expectations for our business partners
In our Daimler Truck Business Partner Standards we define our 
requirements for our business partners with regard to respect for and 
protection of human rights, good working conditions, environmental 
protection and compliance."
"We require our business partners – in par-
ticular our direct suppliers – to comply with these standards and to 
communicate them to their employees and their upstream value chain."
"We also expect our business partners to assess whether these stan-
dards are being complied with."
"Compliance with these standards is the 
most important prerequisite for successful cooperation."
"Detailed regu-
lations on these standards and requirements are contained in our con-
tractual terms and conditions."
"Information about what we expect of 
our business partners can be found at w www.daimlertruck.com/ 
en/company/compliance/compliance-of-our-business-partners."
"The Board of Management ensures that these systems also 
cover sustainability-related objectives and that this includes processes 
and systems for the recording and processing of sustainability-related 
data."
"The risk management system is one component of the Group-wide 
planning, controlling and reporting process."
"This is to ensure that the 
Company management recognizes significant risks at an early stage 
and can initiate corrective actions in good time."
"The internal control 
system aims with regard to the accounting process to ensure the cor-
rectness and effectiveness of accounting and financial reporting."
"Our compliance management system, which is rooted in our culture of 
compliance, is designed to support the adherence to laws and policies 
by the Group and by its employees, to prevent misconduct and to sys-
tematically minimize compliance risks."
"The main characteristics of the 
compliance management system are described in chapter E Compli-
ance in the combined management report; it also contains the com-
ment upon the appropriateness and effectiveness of these systems."
"The independence of the internal audit function is assured by 
the fact that it is free from interference and biases in its planning and 
performance of its work, and has unhindered access to the necessary 
persons, resources and information."
"Internal audit itself shall be sub-
ject to an external quality audit at least every five years."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board shall discuss with the 
Board of Management the appropriateness, effectiveness and func-
tionality of the internal control system, the risk management system,

if, during the audit, they uncover facts that lead to an inaccuracy in the 
Declaration of Compliance with the GCGC of the Board of Manage-
ment and Supervisory Board."
"Composition and working method of the 
Board of Management
German law on stock corporations stipulates a dual management sys-
tem – with a strict separation between the Board of Management act-
ing as the management body and the Supervisory Board as the moni-
toring body."

managing the Company, while the Supervisory Board monitors and 
advises the Board of Management in this regard."

tleblowers worldwide the opportunity to report rule violations in a pro-
tected manner."

ment Report."

ment, including a deadline, and gave its reasons for doing so."

"The mem-
bers representing the shareholders and the members representing 
the employees are equally required by law to act in the Company’s 
interests."
"This is intended to ensure that a de-facto majority of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG at the General Meeting of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
does not lead to a control relationship and a related full consolidation 
obligation of Daimler Truck Holding AG at Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"This 
also applies to resolutions on the dismissal of Supervisory Board mem-
bers, insofar as they did not exercise their voting rights in the election 
of the relevant Supervisory Board members on the basis of the decon-
solidation agreement."
"In the reporting year, the General Meeting did not have to resolve on 
the election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, 
thus - unlike in 2022 - no nominations were submitted by Mercedes-
Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz Verwaltungsgesellschaft für 
Grundbesitz mbH."
"In 2022, nominations for eight shareholder repre-
sentatives were submitted which the Supervisory Board adopted and

the Board of Management, reviews it regularly, and on this basis 
determines the total individual remuneration of the individual mem-
bers of the Board of Management."
"On June 21, 2023, by a majority of 
96.62% of votes cast the General Meeting last approved the remunera-
tion system for the members of the Board of Management."

the co-determined Supervisory Board of Daimler Truck Holding AG 
was constituted and commenced its work only in June 2022."
"The self-
assessment was carried out with the support of an external advisor 
and addressed the work of the Supervisory Board as a whole, the 
Audit Committee and the Presidential and Remuneration Committee."
"As part of a comprehensive approach, Supervisory Board and Board of 
Management members were asked about the efficiency of the Supervi-
sory Board and its Committees using activity-based questionnaires 
and in individual interviews."
"In addition, a meeting was observed."
"The 
results of the self-assessment were presented and discussed at a 
meeting of the Presidential and Remuneration Committee and in a 
meeting of the Supervisory Board."
"Further information can be found in 
the E Report of the Supervisory Board."
"The next self-assessment is 
currently planned for the 2025 financial year."
"As of December 31, 2023, in addition to the Mediation Committee 
whose establishment is required by law, there were three other com-
mittees of the Supervisory Board."
"These committees perform the 
tasks assigned to them on behalf of and in the name of the full 
Supervisory Board, where permitted by law."
"The respective committee 
chairpersons report to the full Supervisory Board on the committees’ 
work at the latest at the next Supervisory Board meeting following 
each committee meeting."
"The Supervisory Board has adopted Rules of 
Procedure for each of its committees."
"They are available at  
w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/corporate-governance/
supervisory-board."
"The E Report of the Supervisory Board also states how many meet-
ings of the Supervisory Board and of the committees were held in per-
son or as video or telephone conferences, and how many meetings of 
the Supervisory Board and the committees the individual members 
attended in each case."
"Committees of the Supervisory Board
An overview of the composition of the committees as of December 31, 
2023 can be found in the E Report of the Supervisory Board."
"In 
addition, information on the current composition of the committees 
can be found at w www.daimlertruck.com/en/company/corporate-
governance/supervisory-board."
"The Presidential 
and Remuneration Committee also submits proposals to the Supervi-
sory Board on the concept of the remuneration system for the Board 
of Management and the appropriate level for the total individual remu-
neration of its members."
"It is responsible for the Board of Manage-
ment members’ contractual affairs."
"It decides on granting approval for 
secondary activities of the members of the Board of Management, and 
once a year submits to the Supervisory Board for a complete list of the 
secondary activities of each member of the Board of Management for 
its consideration."
"In addition, the Presidential and Remuneration Com-
mittee consults and takes decisions on matters of corporate gover-
nance, on which it also makes recommendations to the Supervisory 
Board."
"It supports and advises the Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
and his Deputy and prepares the meetings of the Supervisory Board 
within the limits of its responsibilities."
"In the reporting period, these were Marie Wieck and 
Roman Zitzelsberger."
"Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is tasked with making recommendations 
to the Supervisory Board for proposals to the General Meeting on the 
election of shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board, on 
which the Supervisory Board then passes a final resolution."
"In doing 
so, the Nomination Committee considers and seeks to satisfy the 
overall requirements profile adopted by the Supervisory Board for the 
entire board."
"Furthermore, it also takes into account, without being 
bound by them, the election proposals that Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
and Mercedes-Benz Verwaltungsgesellschaft für Grundbesitz mbH 
submit to the Supervisory Board on the basis of the deconsolidation 
agreement concluded with the Company."
"The duties of the Nomination Committee also include regularly review-
ing which mandates expire at which time and whether the respective 
mandate holders are eligible and willing to serve for a further term of 
office, taking into account the criteria described above."
"In its search 
for new members, the Nomination Committee can also avail itself of 
independent external human resources consulting services."
"The Nomination Committee comprises the Chairman of the Supervi-
sory Board and two other members, who are elected by the share-
holder representatives by majority of votes cast."
"As of December 31, 
2023, the members of the Nomination Committee were: Joe Kaeser 
(Chairman of the Nomination Committee), Renata Jungo Brüngger and 
Marie Wieck."
"In total, two of the three members are independent 
within the meaning of the GCGC."
"The Nomination Committee is the 
only committee of the Supervisory Board which – in accordance with 
the recommendation of the GCGC – is composed exclusively of share-
holder representatives."
"As of December 31, 2023, these were shareholder representatives 
Michael Brosnan (Chairman of the Audit Committee), Akihiro Eto, 
Harald Wilhelm and employee representatives Michael Brecht (Vice 
Chairman of the Audit Committee), Jörg Köhlinger and Thomas Zwick."
"The members of the Audit Committee are composed so that its mem-
bers as a whole are knowledgeable about the business sector in which 
the Company operates."
"The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Michael 
Brosnan, has worked for many years in auditing and occupied senior 
positions in the finance function  of various companies."
"He therefore 
has speciaistl knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial 
statements as well as in the application of accounting principles and 
internal control and risk management systems."
"Expertise also includes 
sustainability reporting or its audit and assurance."
"In the opinion of the 
shareholder representatives, he is independent within the meaning of 
the GCGC."
"The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the
accounting and the accounting process as well as the sustainability 
reporting, and for the audit of the financial statements."
"It discusses 
with the Board of Management the appropriateness, effectiveness and 
functionality of the internal control system and the risk management 
system, the compliance management system and the internal audit 
system at least once a year."
"Each member of the Audit Committee may 
obtain via the committee chairperson information directly from the 
heads of the central divisions of the Company who are responsible 
within the Company for the tasks that the Audit Committee performs 
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure."
"The chairman of the com-
mittee must communicate the information it receives to all members 
of the Audit Committee."
"If such information is obtained, the Board of 
Management must be informed without undue delay."
"The Audit Committee regularly receives reports on the work of the 
internal audit department and the Compliance organization as well as 
on pending litigation."
"At least once every quarter, the Audit Committee 
receives a report from the whistleblower system SpeakUp on any sus-
pected breaches of regulations - based on a catalog of breaches of 
regulations - and is informed regularly about how these suspected 
breaches are dealt with."
"The Audit Committee makes a proposal 
to the Supervisory Board on the adoption of the annual financial state-
ments of Daimler Truck Holding AG, on the approval of the consoli-
dated financial statements, and on the appropriation of distributable 
profit."
"The responsibilities of the Audit Committee also include discus-
sions on the interim financial reports with the Board of Management 
prior to their publication."
"The Audit Committee discusses the audit risk 
assessment, the audit strategy and audit planning as well as the audit 
results with the external auditor."
"In addition, the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee regularly discusses the progress of the audit with the 
external auditor, even outside of meetings, and reports its findings to 
the Committee."
"The Audit Committee regularly consults with the exter-
nal auditor, in absence of the Board of Management."
"Hereby, it agrees on the 
fees and determines the audit focus areas."
"Transactions between the Company and related parties within the 
meaning of Sections 111a et seq."
"of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG) require the prior consent of the Audit Committee, unless there 
are grounds for a reservation of consent by the entire Supervisory 
Board or one of its committees under the law or according to the 
Supervisory Board."
"The Audit Committee is also responsible for regu-
larly evaluating the internal procedure pursuant to Section 111a Sub-
section 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) for transactions 
made in the ordinary course of business and within arm’s length condi-
tions."
"Mediation Committee
The Mediation Committee consists of the Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board Joe Kaeser, his Deputy Michael Brecht and two members 
elected respectively by employee representatives and shareholder 
representatives to the Supervisory Board by a majority of votes cast."
"As of December 31, 2023, these were Marie Wieck for the shareholder 
representatives and Roman Zitzelsberger for the employee representa-
tives."
"The Committee is formed solely to perform the function laid 
down in Section 31 Subsection 3 of the German Co-Determination Act 
(MitbestG)."
"The Mediation Committee had no reason to be active in 
the 2023 financial year."
"As of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, the Board of Management has one woman, Karin Råd-
ström, among its seven members."
"The Board of Management of a listed or co-determined company must 
in turn set targets for the proportion of women at the two manage-
ment levels below the Board of Management."
"If the proportion of 
women is below 30% at the date when the Board of Management 
determines the targets, the targets may no longer fall below the pro-
portion already achieved."
"At the same time as the targets are set, 
deadlines for their achievement must be determined, which may not 
exceed five years."
"By resolution of December 10, 2021, the Board of Management of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG has set a target proportion of women of 0% 
for the first and second management levels below the Board of Man-
agement and a deadline of December 31, 2025."
"The Board of Manage-
ment was of the opinion that it was not reasonable to set a target for 
the proportion of women because the structure of the particular com-
pany needs to be taken into account when determining this target fig-
ure."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG is structured as a management holding 
company with the Board of Management and which provides manage-
ment services in the Group."
"Below the level of the Board of Manage-
ment, the Company – apart from a few employees with dual employ-
ment contracts – has no employees of its own."
"In the reporting period, 
Daimler Truck Holding AG had a total of less than five employees 
below the Board of Management, all of whom had a dual employment 
contract with Daimler Truck AG."
"According to current planning, no per-
sonnel increase is envisaged for Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"The Sec-
ond Management Positions Act (FüPoG II) assumes a larger number of 
employees and therefore also a larger number of management posi-
tions to be filled."
"For this reason, setting the target figure of 0 % 
appears justified as an exception."
"Furthermore, setting the target of 
0 % does not constitute a violation of the deterioration requirement."
"Since the listed Daimler Truck Holding AG is based on the provisions of 
the German Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), the Supervisory Board 
must comprise of at least 30% women and 30% men in accordance 
with Section 96 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG)."
"The quota is to be fulfilled by the Supervisory Board as a 
whole."
"If shareholder representatives or employee representatives 
object to the overall fulfillment to the Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board prior to the election, the minimum proportion for this election 
must be met separately by the shareholder representatives and the 
employee representatives."
"Since there was no objection to the overall 
fulfillment, the gender quota, in its entirety, had to be observed in the 
elections of the shareholder representatives and in the elections of the 
employee representatives of the Supervisory Board in 2022."
"As of December 31, 2023, three women were represented on the 
shareholder side on the Supervisory Board with Renata Jungo Brüng-
ger, Laura Ipsen and Marie Wieck and with Carmen Klitzsch-Müller, 
Andrea Reith and Andrea Seidel on the employee side."
"The Supervi-
sory Board was therefore made up of 30% women and 70% men."
"The 
statutory gender quota of Section 96 Subsection 2 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) has thus been met."
"In addition to Daimler Truck Holding AG itself, other companies of the 
Group such as Daimler Truck AG are subject to co-determination."
"Overall requirements profiles for the  
composition of the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board
The composition of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board 
is based on diversity concepts with regard to aspects such as educa-
tional and professional background, gender and age."
"The Supervisory 
Board has combined these diversity concepts with consideration of 
legal requirements and other demands on the expertise of the mem-
bers of these boards, in the overall requirements profiles for the com-
position of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board 
described below."
"The overall requirements profiles are reviewed each 
year and also serve as the basis for long-term succession planning."
"Board of Management
The aim of the overall requirements profile for the Board of Manage-
ment is to ensure that the composition of a board of management is as 
diverse and complementary as possible."
"The decisive factor in staffing of a specific Board of 
Management position shall always be governed by the Company’s 
interests in consideration of all circumstances in each individual case."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Board of Man-
agement comprised two degreed engineers: Dr. Andreas Gorbach 
and Karin Rådström."
"Expertise is the special knowledge and experience acquired in the 
course of vocational education or training or in-depth knowledge 
and experience gained through further professional or other activi-
ties."
"Environment:
	
— Zero-emission products
	
— CO₂-neutral production
	
— Supply chains
	 	 (respectively also with regard to resource consumption)."
"Governance:
	
— Responsible governance
	
— Compliance & ESG-risk management
	
— Transparent reporting."
"The Board of Management meets regularly, at least twice a year, as 
the Corporate Sustainability Board to discuss sustainability issues 
relevant to the Company."
"Members of the Board of Management 
also direct their attention to the focus topics of the sustainability 
areas outside of the meetings, in particular where such topics relate 
to their particular area of responsibility."
"All seven members of the 
Board of Management have special expertise in sustainability issues 
relevant to the Company."
"As of December 31, 2023 the sustainabil-
ity areas they cover are: With Martin Daum, Dr. Andreas Gorbach, 
John O‘Leary, Karl Deppen and Karin Rådström five members of the 
Board of Management have expertise in the Environment sustain-
ability area."
"With Jürgen Hartwig one member of the Board of Man-
agement has expertise in the Social sustainability area."
"All mem-
bers of the Board of Management have special expertise in the 
Governance sustainability area."
"— Gender Quota: According to Section 76 Subsection 3a of the Ger-
man Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in companies subject to this reg-
ulation at least one woman and one man must be a member of the 
Board of Management."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Board of Man-
agement had one woman, Karin Rådström, and six men among its 
seven members."
"When it set this age limit, 
the Supervisory Board deliberately decided in favor of a flexible 
benchmark allowing the required leeway for an appropriate decision 
in individual cases."
"As of December 31, 2023, five of the seven 
members of the Board of Management were younger than the gen-
eral age limit."
"Martin Daum was also younger than the general age 
limit at the beginning of his current term of office."
"John O’Leary, due 
to his outstanding experience and knowledge of the company, was 
reappointed to the Board of Management in the reporting year with 
effect from April 01, 2024, despite exceeding the general age limit."
"— Generation Mix: In addition, an appropriate generation mix among 
the members of the Board of Management is to be ensured, 
whereby, at least three members of the Board of Management 
should be 57 years or younger at the beginning of the relevant term 
of office."
"As of December 31, 2023 six of the seven members of the 
Board of Management in office were 57 years old or younger at the 
beginning of their current term of office."
"Irrespective of the many years of international experience a 
majority of members of the Board of Management have gained, this 
target was already met as of December 31, 2023 due to the interna-
tional background of John O’Leary and Karin Rådström."
"With regard to Karin Rådström, 
her mandate at Commercial Vehicle Charging Europe B.V."
"is a man-
date in a joint venture that falls in her area of responsibility and 
which therefore does not count as a comparable function for the 
purposes of calculating the maximum number of mandates accord-
ing to the overall requirements profile."
"This also applies to John 
O'Leary’s mandates at Torc Robotics, Inc."
"and Greenlane Infrastruc-
ture, LLC, therefore John O'Leary will not exceed the maximum num-
ber of mandates according to the overall requirements profile even 
with the assumption of a further supervisory board mandate as of 
January 01, 2024."
"The requirements for the maximum number of 
mandates in accordance with the overall requirements profile were 
fulfilled as of December 31, 2023."
"Notwithstanding this, in the Dec-
laration of Compliance a deviation to Recommendation C.5 of the 
GCGC was specified and explained."
"The aspects described above are to be taken into consideration when 
staffing a specific Board of Management position."
"On the basis of a 
target profile that takes specific qualification requirements and the 
aforementioned criteria into account, the Presidential and Remunera-
tion Committee then draws up a shortlist of available candidates with 
whom it conducts interviews."
"It then submits a recommendation to the 
Supervisory Board for its approval and gives the reasoning behind this 
recommendation."
"Decisions regarding appointments to the Board of 
Management are always governed by the Company’s interests in con-
sideration of all circumstances in each individual case."
"The Supervisory Board took the 
aspects described above into consideration when appointing the new 
member of the Board of Management for Finance and Controlling."
"The 
Supervisory Board has concluded that the requirements profile contin-
ues to be met, also including the appointment of Eva Scherer as new 
member of the Board of Management with effect from April 01, 2024."
"In this process, it is to discuss the 
duration of the contracts of current Board of Management members, 
the possibility of extending them, and potential successors."
"The duties 
of the Presidential and Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory 
Board also include holding discussions about the Group’s talented and 
exceptional executives at regular intervals."
"The succession planning process also 
includes a regular report from the Board of Management regarding the 
proportion and development of female executives."
"The Board of Man-
agement has the task of recommending a sufficient number of suitable 
candidates to the Supervisory Board."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG aims 
to primarily fill Board of Management positions with executives that 
have risen within the Group."
"Nonetheless, potential external candi-
dates may also be evaluated and included in the selection process on 
a case-by-case basis, if necessary with the support of external human 
resources consulting services."
"Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board is to be composed so that its members as a 
whole are knowledgeable about the business sector in which the Com-
pany operates."
"The aim of the overall requirements profile for the 
Supervisory Board as a whole is also to ensure that the composition of 
the Supervisory Board is as diverse and mutually complementary as 
possible."
"The Supervisory Board as a whole must understand the 
Company’s business model and also possess the knowledge, skills and 
experience needed to properly execute its task of supervising and 
advising the Board of Management."
"Overall, the members of the 
Supervisory Board should complement each other in terms of their 
expertise and professional experience in such a way that the entire 
Supervisory Board can draw on the broadest possible range of experi-
ence and different specialist knowledge."
"The Supervisory Board also 
views the diversity of its members in terms of age, gender, internation-
ality and other personal attributes as an important foundation for 
effective collaboration."
"Resolutions of the Supervisory Board regarding 
proposals for candidates for election to the General Meeting shall 
always be governed by the Company’s interests in consideration of all 
circumstances in each individual case."
"In the interest of 
greater clarity, the Supervisory Board amended and restructured its 
requirements profile."
"The requirements profile of the Supervisory 
Board, as amended in December 2023, and the status of implementa-
tion determined by the Supervisory Board in December 2023 are 
described below."
"The implementation status is also presented at the 
end of this Declaration on Corporate Governance in the form of a qual-
ification matrix."
"ä C.02 ä C.03
	
— Diversity
	
— Gender Quota: By law, at least 30% of the members of the 
Supervisory Board must be women and at least 30% must be 
men."
"As of December 31, 2023 three women are represented on 
both the shareholder and employee representative sides."
"Thus, 
women are represented respectively at 30% both for the Supervi-
sory Board in its entirety and on each side."
"Therefore, the gender 
ratio on the Supervisory Board complies with the legal require-
ments."
"— General Age Limit: Members who are proposed for election to 
the Supervisory Board for a full term of office should generally not 
be older than 72 years of age at the time of being elected."
"No member of the Supervisory Board in office on 
December 31, 2023 was older than the general age limit at the 
time of their election."
"–	
	
— Generation Mix: An appropriate generation mix among the 
­
members of the Supervisory Board is to be ensured."
"At least eight 
members of the Supervisory Board should be no more than 
62 years old at the date of their election or reelection."
"Of the 
Supervisory Board members in office as of December 31, 2023, 
17 members were aged 62 or younger at the time of their election 
or judicial appointment for the current term of office."
"Richenhagen and 
Marie Wieck on the shareholder side, with 80%, and with Shintaro 
Suzuki and Andrea Seidel on the employee side, resulting in 50% 
for the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"A member is to 
be considered independent in this sense if they are independent 
of the Company and its Board of Management, and of any control-
ling shareholder."
"There is no controlling shareholder in this sense 
at the Company; against the background of the deconsolidation 
agreement concluded with Mercedes-Benz Group AG, in particu-
lar Mercedes-Benz Group AG is not to be regarded as a control-
ling shareholder."
"Within 
the meaning of this recommendation, a Supervisory Board mem-
ber is to be considered independent, if they have no personal or 
business relationship with the Company or its Board of Manage-
ment that may cause a substantial and not merely temporary con-
flict of interest."
"It is up to the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory 
Board to assess the independence of its members."
"The 
shareholder representative side is expressly granted the right to 
consider a Supervisory Board member independent if one or even 
multiple indicators are met, although this assessment is to be 
explained in the Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"Against this back-
ground, neither is currently considered to be independent of the 
Company within the meaning of Recommendation C.7 GCGC."
"As a result – with the exception of Renata Jungo Brüngger and 
Harald Wilhelm – all shareholder representatives of the Supervi-
sory Board (thus 80%) were deemed to be independent, namely 
Joe Kaeser, Michael Brosnan, Jacques Esculier, Akihiro Eto, Laura 
Ipsen, John Krafcik, Martin H."
Richenhagen and Marie Wieck.
"An 
assessment of the independence of the employee representatives 
of the Supervisory Board was not conducted, as only the indepen-
dence of the shareholder representatives is to be assessed in 
accordance with the recommendations of the GCGC."
"Prior to each 
nomination, the Supervisory Board ensures that the candidates in 
question can devote the time required for the office."
"Dual mandates of Supervisory Board members in 
other supervisory bodies of the same group are to be disregarded 
for the purposes of the calculation of the maximum number of 
mandates in accordance with the overall requirements profile."
"Due to having dual mandates within the same group, Renata 
Jungo Brüngger, Joe Kaeser, Harald Wilhelm, and Jörg Köhlinger 
therefore do not exceed the maximum number of mandates set 
out in the overall requirements profile."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
only Martin H."
"Richenhagen exceeded the maximum number of 
positions set out in the requirements profile."
"Nevertheless, the 
Supervisory Board is of the opinion that the overall requirements 
profile is met overall - since in the view of the Supervisory Board - 
there is no doubt that Martin H."
"Richenhagen was and is able to 
exercise all mandates appropriately, in particular as his many 
years of experience allow him to devote the appropriate amount 
of time."
Changes in the mandates held by Martin H.
"Richenhagen 
that occurred and were communicated after the reporting date 
are recognized as part of the determination of the fulfillment of 
the requirements profile for the 2024 reporting year."
"With regard 
to Recommendations C.4 and C.5 of the GCGC, a deviation is 
explained and justified in the Declaration of Compliance with the 
GCGC."
"The requirement is met 
for all current members of the Supervisory Board."
"At 
least three members of the Supervisory Board should have knowl-
edge and experience in each of the following areas: 
–	
	
— Industry/Technology 
	
— IT/Digitalization
	
— Human Resources/Organization
	
— Strategy/Transformation
	
— Finance/Capital Market."
"In order to demonstrate knowledge and experience in the five 
areas mentioned above it is not necessary that the criteria for 
both topics are fulfilled; the proof of knowledge and experience 
with regard to one topic of an area is sufficient."
"The composition should also take into account that there could be 
a requirement to acquire new competencies in the course of 
product, market and other developments."
"As can be seen in detail from the qualification matrix, the Super-
visory Board as a whole in its current composition meets the 
defined requirements for Supervisory Board-related knowledge 
and experience."
"At least three members of the Supervisory Board 
have relevant knowledge or experience in each of the listed areas."
"In the interest of a clear presentation, the following details given 
in respect of the  members of the Supervisory Board who are 
mentioned by name should therefore be viewed as examples and 
are not necessarily exhaustive."
"ä C.02 ä C.03
Industry/Technology
In the area of Industry, Jacques Esculier, Joe Kaeser, John Krafcik 
and Martin H."
"Richenhagen have proven knowledge and experi-
ence due to their extensive professional experience in industrial 
companies active in metal processing or in the automotive sector."
"In addition, the knowledge and extensive experience of the Works 
Council Chairmen and Chairwomen Michael Brecht, Bruno Busch-
bacher, Carmen Klitzsch-Müller, Jörg Lorz, Andrea Reith, Shintaro 
Suzuki (President of the Mitsubishi Worker’s Union) and Thomas 
Zwick should be emphasized."
"Jacques Esculier, Laura Ipsen, John Krafcik, Andrea Seidel, Shin-
taro Suzuki and Marie Wieck have a technical university degree."
"In 
addition, Michael Brecht, Bruno Buschbacher, Jörg Köhlinger, Jörg 
Lorz, Andrea Reith, Roman Zitzelsberger and Thomas Zwick have 
an appropriate professional training in the area of Technology."
"IT/Digitalization
In the area of IT/Digitalization, the knowledge and experience of 
Laura Ipsen, Andrea Seidel and Marie Wieck are particularly note-
worthy."
"This also applies to John Krafcik due to his role as Chief 
Executive Officer to Google LLCs autonomous driving project."
"Renata Jungo Brüngger has knowledge and experience in the area 
of Digitalization due to her areas of responsibility as member of 
the Board of Management at Mercedes-Benz Group AG (responsi-
ble in particular for data protection, data governance and legal 
tech)."
"Human Resources/Organization
Renata Jungo Brüngger, Joe Kaeser and Marie Wieck in particular 
possess sound knowledge and experience in the area of Human 
Resources due to their extensive previous professional experi-
ence which they contribute to the Nomination Committee of the 
Supervisory Board."
"In addition to the members of the Supervisory 
Board who serve as works council chairmen/chairwomen, Shin-
taro Suzuki and the IG Metall (German Metalworker’s Union) rep-
resentatives Jörg Köhlinger and Roman Zitzelsberger, have proven 
knowledge and experience."
"In the area of Organization, the relevant knowledge and experi-
ence of all shareholder representatives as well as Michael Brecht, 
Jörg Köhlinger and Roman Zitzelsberger due to their work in exter-
nal supervisory bodies are particularly valuable for the work of 
the Supervisory Board."
"Finance/Capital Market
With Michael Brecht, Michael Brosnan, Jacques Esculier, 
Akihiro Eto, Joe Kaeser, Jörg Köhlinger, Harald Wilhelm, 
Roman Zitzelsberger and Thomas Zwick, nine members of the 
Supervisory Board have training or professional experience in the 
area of Finance."
"The area of Capital Market is well covered by Jacques Esculier, 
Joe Kaeser and Martin H."
"Richenhagen as they have served as 
chairmen of listed companies as well as by Michael Brosnan, Aki-
hiro Eto, Renata Jungo Brünnger and Harald Wilhelm due to their 
current or previous (Board of Management) activities in listed 
companies."
"— Financial Expertise according to GCGC: The Supervisory 
Board must have at least one member with special knowledge 
and experience in the application of accounting principles and 
internal control and risk management systems."
"At least one other 
member should have special knowledge and experience in audit-
ing of financial statements."
"The expertise in accounting and audit-
ing also includes sustainability reporting or its respective audits."
"Michael Brosnan also has professional 
expertise in the auditing of financial statements."
"The expertise of 
the three aforementioned members of the Supervisory Board in 
the areas of accounting or auditing also includes sustainability 
reporting or its respective audits."
"Expertise in this context relates to the 
special knowledge and experience which is acquired in the course 
of professional training or continuing education or deepened by 
the further professional or other activity."
"A person has expertise 
in a sustainability area within the meaning of the overall require-
ments profile if they have knowledge or experience in at least one 
of the defined focus topics of a sustainability area."
"The sustain-
ability areas and focus topics correspond to those described 
above in the overall requirements profile for the Board of Manage-
ment."
"–	
Environment
With regard to the dispersal of sustainability expertise within the 
Supervisory Board, the knowledge and experience of Joe Kaeser 
and Bruno Buschbacher particularly in the Environment sustain-
ability area is worth highlighting."
"Bruno Buschbacher has specific 
expertise with regard to the focus topic zero-emission products in 
the engine construction field, key for Daimler Truck, which primar-
ily relates to the manufacture of emission-free and low-emission 
truck engines."
"The Supervisory Board 
includes three further members with expertise in the Environment 
sustainability area."
"These are Michael Brecht (focus topic supply 
chains) and Roman Zitzelsberger and Thomas Zwick (each focus 
topic zero-emission products also with regard to resource con-
sumption)."
"Renata Jungo Brüngger, Michael Brecht and Jörg 
Lorz each have expertise in the focus topic social responsibility 
(respect for human rights)."
"Governance 
Owing to their professional careers, a large majority of Supervi-
sory Board members have competences in the Governance sus-
tainability area."
"In particular, worth highlighting is Marie Wieck’s 
expertise in the focus topic responsible governance due to the 
increased consideration and anchoring of sustainability issues in 
corporate decisions as part of her professional and social com-
mitment."
"The focus topic responsible governance is also covered 
by Laura Ipsen, Joe Kaeser and Renata Jungo Brüngger due to 
their particular expertise in the increased consideration and 
anchoring of sustainability issues in corporate decisions."
"Michael 
Brecht, Jörg Köhlinger and Roman Zitzelsberger also have exper-
tise in the governance sustainability area, each focusing on co-
determination issues, as do Renata Jungo Brüngger and Harald 
Wilhelm in the focus topic compliance and ESG-risk management."
"The focus topic transparent reporting is covered in particular by 
the two financial experts on the Audit Committee Michael Bros-
nan and Harald Wilhelm."
"The Nomination Committee then rec-
ommends a candidate to the Supervisory Board for its approval and 
includes an explanation of its recommendation."
"Resolutions of the 
Supervisory Board regarding proposals for candidates for election to 
the General Meeting shall always be governed by the Company’s inter-
ests in consideration of all circumstances in each individual case."

"Accounting policies
IFRS applied
The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023 
have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS applicable for 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"The accounting 
policies applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements therefore 
comply with the IFRS applicable in the EU as of December 31, 2023 
for all periods presented."
"IFRS issued, endorsed by the EU and adopted in the reporting 
period for the first time
In May 2023, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
issued changes to IAS 12 “Income Taxes” due to the reform of 
international tax law – model regulations for Pillar Two."
"The changes 
were adopted by the EU in November 2023."
"The Group applied 
amendments to IAS 12 following publication on May 23, 2023."
"The 
amendments contain a temporary, mandatory and immediately 
applicable exemption from the accounting of deferred taxes resulting 
from the introduction of the global minimum tax."
"They also prescribe 
specific disclosures in the notes on the impact of the minimum 
taxation."
The mandatory exception must be applied retrospectively.

"IAS 1 stipulates that companies must 
disclose all material accounting policies."
"Previously, the standard 
referred to significant accounting policies."
"The amendments define 
what is meant by “material accounting policies” and how to identify 
them."
"They also clarify that immaterial information about accounting 
policies need not be disclosed."
"However, if disclosed, this should not 
obscure material information about accounting policies."
"In addition to 
the amendment to IAS 1, IFRS Practice Statement 2 has also been 
amended to provide companies with guidance on the practical 
application of the concept of materiality to accounting policy 
disclosures."
"IFRS issued, but not yet adopted
In May 2023, the IASB published amendments to IAS 7 “Statement of 
Cash Flows” and IFRS 7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”, which 
provide for additional disclosure requirements for companies 
regarding supplier financing."
"The changes are mandatory for the first 
time for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024."
"Daimler Truck is affected by these disclosure requirements and will 
include the new requirements in the notes."
"The International Accounting Standards Board has issued further 
amendments and improvements to standards, which are partially 
endorsed and not yet applied and which are not expected to have a 
material impact on the Group's profitability, liquidity and capital 
resources and financial position."
"Presentation
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position
The presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 
differentiates between current and non-current assets and liabilities."
"Assets and liabilities are generally classified as current if they are 
expected to be realized or fall due within one year."
"Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions 
and similar obligations are generally presented as non-current items."
"Consolidated Statement of Income
The Consolidated Statement of Income is presented using the cost-
of-sales method."
"Measurement
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the 
historical-cost basis with the exception of certain items such as 
financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
derivative financial instruments, hedged items, and pensions and 
similar obligations."
"The measurement models applied to those 
exceptions are described below."
"Principles of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial 
statements of Daimler Truck Holding AG and the financial statements 
of all subsidiaries, including structured entities, which are directly or 
indirectly controlled by Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"If subsidiaries are not consolidated for reasons of materiality, the 
shares in these companies are valued at amortized costs."
"The 
materiality assessment is carried out on the basis of sales, earnings 
and total assets."
"The financial statements of consolidated 
subsidiaries which are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are prepared as at the reporting date of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"Investments in associated companies, joint ventures or joint 
operations
Joint operations that have no significant impact on the Consolidated 
Financial Statements are generally accounted for using the equity 
method."
"Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities of foreign companies for which the functional 
currency is not the euro are translated into euros using period-end 
exchange rates."
"Any resulting translation differences are recognized 
in other comprehensive income."
"The components of equity are 
translated using historical exchange rates."
"The Consolidated 
Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
are translated into euros using the average exchange rates for the 
quarters of the respective year."
"The exchange rates of the US dollar, the Brazilian real, and the 
Japanese yen – the most significant foreign currencies for the 
Daimler Truck Group – are as shown in table ä D.06."
"If a 
country is considered as hyperinflationary, IAS 29 “Financial 
Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” has to be applied from the 
beginning of the respective reporting period, i.e."
"from January 1 of 
the respective reporting year."
Argentina and Turkey are classified as hyperinflationary countries.
"The activities of the Daimler Truck Group in both countries are 
recognized in accordance with IAS 29 if the functional currency is the 
local currency."
"The accounting impact is included in retained 
earnings within “Other” in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity."
"Revenue recognition
When selling new and used vehicles, spare parts and other related 
products, control is regularly transferred to the customer upon 
delivery."
"The payments from the sales of new and used vehicles, 
spare parts and other related products are usually due immediately 
or within a short payment period."
"Dealers may finance their vehicle inventory by means of dealer 
inventory financing provided by Financial Services, as described in 
E Note 35."
"Furthermore, end-customers may be 
able to obtain financing in the form of a loan via Financial Services."
"Receivables from sales financing with end-customers and dealers are 
presented in receivables from financial services."
"Further information 
is provided in E Note 15."
Receivables from financial services.
"Revenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which the Group 
enters into a repurchase obligation is dependent on the form of the 
repurchase agreement."
"At contract inception of a sale with a 
residual value guarantee, revenue is therefore recognized which must 
be reduced by the necessary accrual for the potential compensation 
payment to the customer."
"Under a contract manufacturing agreement, the Daimler Truck Group 
sells assets to a third party service provider from which the Daimler 
Truck Group buys back the manufactured products after completion 
of the commissioned work."
"If the sale of the assets is not 
accompanied by the transfer of control to the third party service 
provider, no revenue is recognized under IFRS 15 “Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers”."
"The Group offers extended, separately invoiced warranties for certain 
products as well as service and maintenance contracts."
"Revenue 
from these contracts is deferred insofar as a customer has made an 
advance payment and is generally recognized over the contract 
period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred based on 
historical information."
"A loss on these contracts is recognized in the 
current financial year if the expected costs for outstanding services 
under the contract exceed unearned revenue."
"Usually, those 
contracts are paid in advance or in equal installments over the 
contract term."
"For multiple-element arrangements, such as when vehicles are sold 
with free or reduced-in-price maintenance programs or with free 
online services, the Group generally allocates revenue to the various 
elements based on their estimated relative stand-alone selling prices."
"To determine stand-alone selling prices, the Daimler Truck Group 
primarily uses price lists taking into account average discounts 
granted to its customers."
Vehicles may be initially sold to non-Group dealers.
"Subsequently, a 
customer may decide to enter into a leasing contract with Financial 
Services regarding such a vehicle."
"The vehicle is therefore sold by the 
non-Group dealer to Financial Services and a leasing contract is 
entered into with the customer."
"When control of the vehicle is 
transferred to the non-Group dealer, the Daimler Truck Group 
recognizes revenue from the sale of the vehicle."
"The incremental cost of obtaining contracts is recognized as an 
expense when incurred if the amortization period would not exceed 
one year."
"Revenue also includes revenue from the rental and leasing business 
as well as interest from the Financial Services business."
"Revenue 
generated from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the contracts."
"Revenue 
from receivables from financial services is recognized using the 
effective interest method."
"The programs 
include financial incentives for dealers and customers as well as 
lease subsidies or loans at reduced interest rates, which are reported 
as follows:
–
Revenue is recognized net of sales reductions such as cash 
discounts and sales incentives granted."
"–
When loans are issued below market interest rates, the related 
receivables are recognized at present value (using market rates) 
and revenue is reduced by the interest incentive granted."
"–
If subsidized leasing fees are agreed upon in connection with 
finance leases, revenue from the sale of a vehicle is reduced by 
the amount of the interest incentive granted."
"Government grants
Government grants related to assets are deducted from the carrying 
amount of the asset and are recognized in earnings over the life of a 
depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense."
"Government 
grants which compensate the Group for expenses are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income as other operating income in 
the period in which the expenses to be compensated are incurred."
"Profit/loss on equity-method investments, net
This item includes all income and expenses in connection with 
investments accounted for using the equity method."
"In addition to 
pro rata profits and losses from financial investments, it also includes 
profits and losses resulting from the sale of equity interests or the 
remeasurement of equity interests following a loss of significant 
influence or joint control."
"This item also includes impairment losses 
and/or gains on the reversal of such impairments of equity-method 
investments."
"Other financial income/expense, net
Other financial income/expense, net includes all income and 
expense from financial transactions which are included neither in 
interest income nor in interest expense or, in the case of the 
Financial Services segment, neither in revenue nor in cost of sales."
"For example, the expense from the compounding of interest on 
provisions for other risks is recognized in this line item."
"Furthermore, income and expenses from equity interests are included 
in the other financial income/expense, net, to the extent that they 
are not reported in the Profit/loss on equity-method investments, 
net."
"Interest income and interest expense
Interest income and interest expense include interest income from 
investments in securities and from cash and cash equivalents as well 
as interest expense from liabilities."
"Furthermore, interest and 
changes in fair values related to interest rate hedging activities as 
well as income and expense resulting from the allocation of 
premiums and discounts are included."
"The interest components of 
defined benefit pension obligations and other similar obligations as 
well as of the plan assets available to cover these obligations and 
interest on supplementary income tax payments or reimbursements 
are also presented in this line item."
"For the Financial Services segment, interest income and expense and 
gains or losses from derivative financial instruments related to the 
financial services business are disclosed under revenue and cost of 
sales respectively."
"Income taxes
The Group has determined that interest and penalties on income 
taxes, including uncertain income tax items, do not meet the 
definition of income taxes and are therefore recognized in 
accordance with IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets”."
"Furthermore, the Group has determined that the global minimum top-
up tax, which will be levied from 2024 in accordance with Pillar Two 
regulations, is an income tax in the scope of IAS 12."
"The Group has 
applied the temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting 
for the impacts of the top-up tax and accounts for it as a current tax 
when it is incurred."
"Intangible assets
Intangible assets are measured at acquisition or production cost less 
accumulated amortization."
"If necessary, accumulated impairment 
losses are recognized."
"Development costs for vehicles and components are capitalized if the 
conditions according to IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are fulfilled."
"Capitalized development costs include all direct individual costs as 
well as proportionately attributable overheads and are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the expected product life (in general with a 
maximum amortization period of ten years)."
"Capitalized development 
costs for which the projects have not yet been completed are only 
impaired if the project is either canceled or as a result of the annual 
impairment test, performed at the CGU level."
"Amortization of 
capitalized development costs is an element of manufacturing costs 
and is allocated to those vehicles and components for which they 
were generated."
"When inventories or vehicles are sold, they are taken 
into account in the cost of sales."
"Other intangible assets with finite useful lives are generally amortized 
on a straight-line basis over their useful lives (three to ten years)."
"If goodwill arises in the course of a company acquisition, the full 
goodwill method is used."
"Non-controlling interests are recognized at 
the corresponding share of the identifiable net assets measured at 
fair value."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recognized at acquisition or 
manufacturing costs less accumulated depreciation."
"If necessary, 
accumulated impairment losses are recognized."
"The costs of internally produced equipment and facilities include all 
direct individual costs and proportionately attributable overheads."
"Acquisition or manufacturing costs include estimated costs, if any, of 
dismantling, restoration and removals."
"Property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the useful lives 
as shown in table ä D.07."
"Leasing
Daimler Truck Group as lessee
Leases with Daimler Truck as lessee include, in the main, leases for 
real-estate."
"For these leases, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities 
for the outstanding lease payments are recognized."
"Right-of-use 
assets are reported under property, plant and equipment and the 
lease liabilities under financing liabilities."
"However, according to IFRS 
16 “Leases”, a lessee may elect, for leases with a lease term of 
twelve months or less (short-term leases) and for leases for which the 
underlying asset is of low value, not to recognize a right-of-use asset 
and a lease liability."
"The Daimler Truck Group makes use of these 
exemptions."
"The lease payments associated with those leases are 
primarily recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the 
lease term."
"For contracts that contain non-leasing components in addition to 
leasing components, the option of not separating these components 
is generally used with regard to the relevant lease payments."
"The Daimler Truck Group generally uses its incremental borrowing 
rate to discount leasing payments."
"This incremental borrowing rate 
as a risk-adjusted interest rate is derived for specific terms and 
currencies."
"The difference with regard to the different payment 
schedules of the reference interest rates (bullet bonds) and the 
leases (annuity) is taken into account by means of a duration 
adjustment."
"According to IFRS 16, the depreciation of right-of-use assets is 
recognized within functional costs."
"The interest due on the lease 
liability is a component of interest expense."
"A number of leases, particularly for real-estate, contain extension and 
termination provisions."
"When determining the term of the lease, all 
facts and circumstances that indicate an economic incentive to 
exercise extension or not exercise termination options are taken into 
account."
"In determining the lease term, such options are only 
considered if they are sufficiently certain."
"Daimler Truck Group as lessor
Daimler Truck, as a lessor, leases its Group products to customers."
"Based on the risk and rewards associated with a leased asset, it is 
assessed whether economic ownership of the leased asset is 
transferred to the lessee (finance leases) or remains with the lessor 
(operating leases)."
"by which economic ownership of the vehicle 
remains with the Daimler Truck Group, relate to vehicles that the 
Group produces itself and leases to third-parties."
"Additionally, an 
operating lease may have to be recognized when vehicles are sold for 
which the Group enters into a repurchase obligation:
–
Sales of vehicles where the Daimler Truck Group is obliged to 
repurchase the vehicles in the future are accounted for as 
operating leases."
"This also applies to a purchase option that 
merely grants the Daimler Truck Group the right to repurchase 
the asset."
"–
Sales of vehicles including a put option, where the customer can 
demand the repurchase of the vehicles from the company, are 
recognized as operating leases if the customer has a significant 
economic incentive to exercise that right at contract inception."
"Otherwise, a sale with a right of return is recognized."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group considers several factors when assessing whether a 
customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise his 
right."
"These include the relationship between the agreed 
repurchase price and the expected future market value at the 
time of repurchase of the asset or historical return rates."
"For operating leases in particular, certain assumptions are regularly 
made as part of the residual value management process, at local and 
central level, about the expected price level at which the returns from 
leasing transactions are measured."
"If there is a negative deviation 
from assumptions due to changing market developments, there is a 
risk of lower residual vehicle values."
"Depending on the region and the 
current market situation, the measures taken generally include 
continuous market monitoring and, if necessary, pricing strategies or 
sales-promotion measures designed to regulate vehicle inventories."
"The quality of market forecasts is verified by regular comparisons 
with internal and external sources, and, if required, the determination 
of residual values is adjusted and further developed regarding 
methods, processes and systems."
"When accounted for as operating leases, these vehicles are 
capitalized at (depreciated) cost of production as leased equipment 
and depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis applying 
the expected residual values."
"Changes in the expected residual 
values lead either to prospective adjustments of the scheduled 
depreciation or, if necessary, to an impairment loss."
"The vehicles are 
allocated to the segment which bears substantially all of the residual 
value risk."
"Operating leases also include vehicles, mainly products of the 
Daimler Truck Group, that Financial Services acquires from 
independent dealers or other third-parties and leases to end 
customers."
"These vehicles are recognized at (amortized) cost of 
acquisition under leased equipment in the Financial Services 
segment."
"If these vehicles are Group products and are subsidized, 
the subsidies are deducted from the cost of acquisition."
"After 
revenue is received from the sale to independent dealers, these 
Group products generate revenue from lease payments and 
subsequent resale on the basis of the separate leasing contracts."
"The 
Group estimates that the revenue generated with Group products 
when sold to dealers is in the order of magnitude of the 
corresponding addition to leased equipment at Financial Services."
"In 
2023, additions to leased equipment from these vehicles at Financial 
Services amounted to €484 million (2022: €868 million)."
"In the case of finance leases, the Group recognizes receivables in the 
amount of the net investment in the lease under receivables from 
financial services."
"The net investment in a lease is the gross 
investment (future lease payments and non-guaranteed residual 
value) discounted at the interest rate on which the lease is based."
"If an equity interest in an existing associated company is 
increased without change in significant influence, goodwill is 
determined only for the additionally acquired interest; the previous 
investment is not remeasured at fair value."
"The Daimler Truck Group reviews at each reporting date whether 
there is any objective indication of impairment or impairment reversal 
of equity-method investments."
"If such indications exist, the Group 
determines the impairment loss or reversal to be recognized."
"If the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of an investment, 
the carrying amount is written down to the recoverable amount."
"The 
recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use."
"An impairment reversal is carried out if there is 
objective evidence for an impairment reversal."
"If such an assessment 
is made, the recoverable amount is remeasured."
"An impairment 
reversal is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount has 
increased subsequent to the impairment and is limited to the amount 
by which an asset has been impaired."
"Gains or losses (to be eliminated) from transactions with companies 
accounted for using the equity method are recognized through profit 
or loss with corresponding adjustments of the investments’ carrying 
amounts."
"Gains or losses from the contribution of interests in 
subsidiaries to investments which are accounted for using the equity 
method are included in the elimination of intercompany profits and 
losses."
"Impairment test of non-current non-financial assets
At December 31, 2023, the Daimler Truck Group assessed whether 
there was an indication that an asset might be impaired or whether 
there was an indication that a previously recognized impairment loss 
might be reversed."
"If such indication exists, the Daimler Truck Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the asset."
"The recoverable 
amount is determined for each individual asset unless the asset 
generates cash inflows that are not largely independent of those from 
other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units or CGUs)."
"An assessment for assets other than goodwill is made at each 
reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously 
recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be 
reversed."
"If this is the case, a partial or entire reversal of the 
impairment is recorded; the carrying amount is thereby increased to 
the recoverable amount."
"However, the increased carrying amount 
may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined (net of depreciation) if no impairment loss had been 
recognized in prior years."
"Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as 
well as development costs for which the projects have not yet been 
completed are tested at least annually for impairment."
"This takes 
place at the level of the cash-generating units."
"If the carrying amount 
of an asset or of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable 
amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to 
sell and value in use."
"For cash-generating units, the Daimler Truck 
Group initially determines the respective recoverable amount as 
value in use and compares it with the respective carrying amount 
(including goodwill)."
"If value in use is lower than the carrying amount, 
fair value less costs to sell is additionally calculated to determine the 
recoverable amount."
"The cash-generating units of the Daimler Truck Group that were 
tested for impairment are Trucks North America, Mercedes-Benz, 
Trucks Asia, Daimler Buses and Financial Services."
"The Trucks Asia 
segment is comprised of the Trucks Asia CGU, and the at-equity 
investment in Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive Co."
"(BFDA) (not 
part of the Truck Asia CGU), refer to E Note 14."
"Equity-method 
investments."
"(TORC), is presented under 
reconciliation in the segment reporting as a further CGU."
"Value in use is measured by discounting expected future cash flows 
from the continuing use of the cash-generating units using a risk-
adjusted interest rate."
"Future cash flows are determined on the basis 
of the long-term plan approved by management at the date the 
impairment test is conducted."
"As a rule, the detailed planning period 
used for the impairment test covers five years."
"In order to take into 
account the scaling of TORC’s innovative product, a detailed planning 
period extended by four years was determined for this CGU."
"Terminal 
value calculations are based on a steady state."
"The planning is based 
on expectations with regard to future market shares, the general 
development of the respective markets and the profitability of the 
products, taking into account the transformation of the commercial 
vehicle business."
"The shift from combustion engine development projects to zero-
emission vehicles is strongly influenced not only by changing 
customer demand but also by technological and infrastructure 
developments, as well as emissions regulations."
"The assumptions 
used for planning are tested for reasonableness using both historical 
developments and external sources of information (including market 
surveys)."
"The effects of IFRS 16 (Lessee Accounting) are consistently 
taken into account in the calculation of the value in use and in the 
measurement of net assets."
"The discount rates are determined on the basis of the capital asset 
pricing model (CAPM), taking current market expectations into 
account."
"In calculating the risk-adjusted interest rate for impairment-
test purposes, specific peer-group information is used for beta 
factors, capital-structure data and cost of debt."
"Periods not covered 
by the forecast are taken into account by recognizing a residual value 
(terminal value), which does not include any growth rates."
"In addition, several sensitivity analyses are conducted."
"The entire 
commercial vehicle industry is subject to cyclical fluctuations and 
reacts differently depending on region and sector."
"This fact is taken 
into account by using a conservative approach for all vehicle CGUs."
"Actual values may deviate from the estimated values due to 
unfavorable changes in these underlying conditions that deviate from 
the assumptions and are beyond the control of the Board of 
Management."
"Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or 
manufacturing cost and net realizable value."
"The acquisition or 
manufacturing costs of inventories are generally based on the 
specific identification method and include costs incurred."
"Acquisition 
or manufacturing costs for large numbers of inventories that are 
interchangeable are allocated under the average-cost formula."
"Directly 
attributable transaction costs are taken into account for financial 
instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"In the case of regular purchases or sales of financial assets, the 
Daimler Truck Group uses the transaction date as the date of initial 
recognition or derecognition."
"The business 
model and characteristics of the contractual cash flows are two key 
criteria."
"Financial assets at amortized cost:
This measurement category includes, among other things, 
receivables from financial services, trade receivables and cash and 
cash equivalents."
"They are held with the aim of collecting the 
contractually agreed cash flows and have contractual payments that 
represent solely interest and principal payments on the outstanding 
nominal amount (SPPI criterion)."
"Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, checks 
and demand deposits at banks, as well as debt instruments and 
certificates of deposits with a remaining term when acquired of up to 
three months, which are not subject to any material value 
fluctuations."
"Cash and cash equivalents correspond to the 
classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows."
"These include, 
among other things, instruments in the item marketable debt 
securities and similar investments that are held for liquidity 
management purposes."
"This category also includes selected equity instruments that are not 
held for trading purposes and for which the option to recognize 
changes in fair value without affecting profit or loss was exercised."
"Financial assets recognized at fair value through profit or loss:
This measurement category includes financial assets that either fall 
within the definition of a derivative in accordance with IFRS 9 or do 
not meet the SPPI criterion."
"These include instruments in the item 
marketable debt securities and similar investments, equity and debt 
instruments and other financial assets."
"For debt instruments that are 
not receivables from financial services, a significant increase in credit 
risk is assessed, mainly based on past-due information or the 
probability of default."
"Objective evidence for a credit-impaired financial 
asset includes 91 days past due date and other information 
about significant financial difficulties of the borrower."
"For trade receivables, the simplified approach is applied whereby all 
trade receivables are allocated to stage 2 initially."
"Hence, no 
determination of significant increases in credit risk is necessary."
"The Daimler Truck Group applies the low credit risk exception to the 
stage allocation to quoted debt instruments with investment-grade 
ratings."
These debt instruments are always allocated to stage 1.
"For receivables from financial services, expected credit losses are 
calculated using a statistical model that incorporates three major risk 
parameters: probability of default, loss given default and exposure at 
default."
"The estimation of these risk parameters incorporates all 
available relevant information, not only historical and current loss 
data, but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking 
information is considered."
"This information includes macroeconomic 
factors (e.g."
"gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, 
cost performance index) and forecasts of future economic conditions."
"For receivables from financial services, these forecasts are 
determined using a scenario analysis (base scenario, optimistic and 
pessimistic scenario)."
"The impairment amount for trade receivables is 
predominantly determined on a collective basis."
"For information about the measurement of expected credit losses, 
refer to E Note 34."
Management of financial risks.
"A financial instrument is derecognized if it can reasonably be 
assumed that a financial asset cannot be realized in full or in part, i.e."
"if the collateral is no longer available and no further payments from 
the customer are expected after the end of insolvency proceedings or 
court decisions, for example."
"It is expected that material modifications to receivables from 
financial services can only occur in rare cases and to an immaterial 
extent."
"An exception are derivative financial 
liabilities and the puttable instruments explained below."
"The Group participates in reverse-factoring arrangements under 
which suppliers may elect to receive early payment from financial 
institutions and external banks by selling their receivables from the 
Group to a factor."
"The Daimler Truck Group classifies the financial 
liabilities eligible for reverse factoring arrangements as trade 
payables as the obligations to pay for goods or services are invoiced 
by a supplier."
"Daimler Truck considers trade payables as part of 
working capital."
"In general trade payables have an original maturity of 
less than 12 months."
"Related payments are included in cash flows 
from operating activities as they remain operational in nature."
"OHGs 
(1-4) and in Daimler Buses GrundstücksverwaItung GmbH & Co."
"OHG 
are reported under financial liabilities recognized at amortized cost."
"These non-controlling interests are classified as puttable instruments 
because the non-controlling shareholder, Mercedes-Benz Grund 
Services GmbH (refer to E Note 25."
"Financing liabilities), has the 
right to terminate and return its share in exchange for a severance 
payment."
"Therefore, the non-controlling interests are accounted for 
as financial liabilities according to IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: 
Presentation”."
"After initial recognition, the financial liabilities are 
subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method."
"The measurement of the puttable instruments in commercial 
real-estate partnerships equals the present value of the redemption 
amount in the event of termination of the shareholding."
"Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include 
derivative financial liabilities."
"The fair values of receivables 
from financial services with fixed interest rates are determined on the 
basis of discounted expected future cash flows."
"Discounting is based on the current interest rates at which similar 
loans with identical terms could have been obtained at December 31, 
2023 and December 31, 2022."
"The fair values of loans, commercial papers, notes/bonds and 
liabilities from ABS transactions reported as financing liabilities are 
calculated as the present values of the estimated future cash flows, 
taking credit premiums and credit risks into account."
"Market interest 
rates for the appropriate terms are used for discounting."
"The fair 
values of the puttable instruments in commercial real-estate 
partnerships approximately equal to the carrying amounts."
"For current receivables and liabilities, it is assumed that the fair 
values are equal to the carrying amounts due to the short terms and 
the fundamentally lower credit risk of these financial instruments."
"These include trade receivables and payables measured at amortized 
costs, other financial assets and liabilities, cash and cash 
equivalents, similar investments and obligations from sales 
transactions."
"Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
Marketable debt securities and equity instruments recognized at fair 
value were measured using quoted market prices at the end of the 
reporting period."
"If quoted market prices are not available for 
individual debt and equity instruments, fair value measurement is 
based on parameters for which either directly or indirectly derived 
quoted prices are available on an active market."
"The fair values are 
calculated using recognized financial mathematical models, such as 
discounted cash flow models or multiplier models."
"The marketable 
debt securities measured at fair value through profit or loss only 
include money market funds."
"Derivative financial instruments that are not included in hedge 
accounting are reported in the items other financial assets or 
liabilities."
"The fair value of listed derivatives is equal to their positive 
or negative market value."
"If no market values are available, these are calculated using standard 
financial valuation models such as discounted cash flow or option-
pricing models."
"The procedure is as follows:
–
For cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate hedging 
instruments (e.g."
"interest-rate swaps), the fair values are 
calculated on the basis of discounted, estimated future cash 
flows, taking account of credit premiums and default risks."
"The 
market interest rates applicable to the remaining terms of the 
financial instruments were used."
"–
For currency forwards, the valuation is based on forward curves 
quoted on the market."
"–
For power purchase agreements, the valuation is based on the 
discounted cash flow model, where observable, stock market 
prices and other fundamental data is used."
"Hedge accounting
The Group uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for 
hedging financial risks that arise from its operating or financing 
activities or liquidity management."
"Hedging relationships are created 
for currency and interest rate risks."
"Hedges in which the valuation effects from the underlying and 
hedging transactions largely offset each other in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income are largely not included in hedge accounting."
"Derivatives that are not or no longer included in hedge accounting 
continue to hedge financial risks from operational business."
"The 
hedging instrument is terminated when the underlying transaction no 
longer exists or is no longer expected."
"If the requirements of IFRS 9 for the accounting of hedging 
relationships (hedge accounting) are fulfilled, the Daimler Truck 
Group designates and documents the hedging relationship from this 
point on as a fair value hedge or as a cash flow hedge."
"Cash flow hedges are designated in connection with the hedging of 
currency and interest rate risks."
"The hedged underlying transactions 
represent highly probable expected transactions in the case of 
currency risks and variable-interest financial liabilities in the case of 
interest rate risks."
"Fair value hedges are designated in connection with the hedging of 
interest rate risks."
"The secured underlying transactions are fixed-
interest financial liabilities."
"The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the beginning and 
during the hedging relationship."
"The critical terms match method is 
used to prospectively measure the effectiveness of currency risk 
hedges, while regression analysis is used for the hedge of interest 
rate risks."
"If the option is taken to exclude the forward element or cross 
currency basis spread component from the hedging relationship, they 
are deferred as hedge costs in other comprehensive income."
"Further explanations on hedge currency and interest rate risks can be 
found in E Note 34."
Management of financial risks.
"The resulting net interest expense or 
income is recognized in profit or loss under interest expense or 
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income."
"The other 
expenses resulting from pension obligations and other similar 
pension benefits, which mainly result from entitlements acquired 
during the year under review, are recognized in the functional costs in 
the Consolidated Statement of Income."
"For very long maturities, 
there are no high-quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds available as 
a benchmark."
"The respective discount factors are estimated by 
extrapolating current market rates along the yield curve."
"Provisions for other risks
A provision for warranties is recognized when a product is sold or 
when a new warranty program is initiated."
"The measurement of 
warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience."
"Restructuring provisions are recognized in connection with programs 
that materially change the scope or nature of the business activities 
of a segment or business unit."
"In most cases, restructuring expenses 
include termination benefits and compensation payments to dealers 
and suppliers."
"Restructuring provisions are recognized when the 
Group has a detailed formal plan that has either commenced 
implementation or been announced."
"Contract and refund liabilities
Contract liabilities:
The Daimler Truck Group recognizes a contract liability for the 
obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the 
Daimler Truck Group has received (or will receive) consideration from 
that customer."
"Contract liabilities arise for the Daimler Truck Group especially from 
prepaid service and maintenance contracts and extended warranties."
"Refund liabilities:
A refund liability arises if the Daimler Truck Group receives 
consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of 
that consideration to the customer."
"A refund liability is measured at 
the amount of consideration received for which the Daimler Truck 
Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not included in the 
transaction price."
"Share-based payment
Share-based payment comprises cash-settled liability awards."
"The liability-based remuneration plans are measured at fair value on 
each balance sheet date until they are settled and the obligation is 
recognized as a provision under consideration of the vesting period."
"The profit or loss to be recognized in the reporting period 
corresponds to the addition to and/or the reversal of the provision 
during the reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid during 
the period and is included in functional costs."
"Presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
The Daimler Truck Group uses the indirect method for the 
determination of cash flows from operating activities."
"Interest paid as 
well as interest and dividends received are classified as cash flows 
from operating activities."
"The cash flows from short-term marketable 
debt securities with high turnover rates and significant amounts are 
offset and presented within cash flows from investing activities."
"Consideration of sustainability-related aspects in connection 
with the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities
Sustainability is an important component of the Daimler Truck 
Group’s long-term objectives and therefore of many of its strategic 
projects."
"The aim is to develop sustainable and consequently future-
proof transport solutions for goods traffic and passenger transport 
and to put them on the road."
"This also includes Daimler Truck 
Group’s objective to offer only new vehicles that are CO2-neutral in 
driving operation by 2039 in Europe, North America and Japan."
"Sustainability is an integral part of the core business and part of 
corporate responsibility."
"Complete zero emissions only works on the basis of battery-powered 
and hydrogen-powered vehicles."
"The Daimler Truck Group already 
has emission-free truck and bus models in series production in 
Europe, America and Asia (further information can be found in the 
sustainability section at Daimler Truck as part of the combined 
management report under E Responsible corporate governance)."
"In 
the coming years, not only more vehicles with battery drives, but also 
hydrogen-based vehicles will follow."
"In addition, the Group will 
continue to expand its technology path in the future and explore the 
potential of additional battery and charging options."
"Given the 
importance of ensuring the right infrastructure is in place to support 
these zero-emission vehicles on the road, the Daimler Truck Group is 
planning to develop an efficient charging infrastructure with selected 
partners."
"The climate-related impacts associated with the transformation of the 
commercial vehicle business are taken into account when 
recognizing and measuring the Group's assets and liabilities."
"In addition to changing 
customer demand, these development projects are strongly 
influenced by technology and infrastructure developments as well as 
emissions regulations."
"It can be assumed that the share of 
development costs for combustion vehicles will continue to decrease 
and the share of zero-emission vehicles will continue to increase."
"When determining and checking the useful lives of capitalized 
development costs, the expected product life is taken into account."
"The transformation of the commercial vehicle business to zero-
emission vehicles can impact the originally expected product life 
cycles."
"Due to the transformation to zero-emission vehicles, the useful lives 
of the Daimler Truck Group's property, plant and equipment must be 
assessed regularly."
"Daimler Truck plans to produce zero-emission 
vehicles largely at the same production facilities."
"This is already 
happening at the large production sites in Germany and the USA."
"This 
will allow us to respond flexibly to customer demand in the future."
"As 
at the reporting date, the review of the useful lives of property, plant 
and equipment revealed no need for adjustment due to the flexible 
use of production facilities within the Group."
"In addition, all necessary 
investments in property, plant and equipment relating to 
transformation have been considered in the corresponding planning."
"The impairment test of the CGUs reflects these transformation 
targets within the forecast planning periods and in  
the calculation of the terminal value."
"The determination of the 
terminal value is based on a steady state."
"Since the main transformation objectives are 
outside of the detailed planning period, assumptions about the 
shifting of revenues, costs (incl."
"development costs) and 
corresponding investments are reflected in the terminal value."
"These 
parameters are reflected in the annual impairment tests of our 
vehicle-related CGU."
"The increasing regulatory requirements on CO2 emissions are 
accelerating the Daimler Truck Group’s transformation to zero-
emission vehicles."
"If the regulatory requirements are not met or the 
emission limit values are exceeded, fines must be paid to the 
authorities."
"The provisions for potential fines are based on estimates 
and may increase further in the future due to stricter or new 
regulatory requirements."
"New regulatory requirements on CO2 
emissions from vehicle sales that come into force from 2025 are 
already known today."
"As at the reporting date, no provisions for 
payments to authorities due to the Daimler Truck Group exceeding 
the emission limit had to be recognized."
"The Daimler Truck Group has concluded Power Purchase Agreements 
with terms until 2044."
"These are accounted for either as leases in 
accordance with IFRS 16, derivatives in accordance with IFRS 9 or 
pending contracts in accordance with IAS 37."
"Overall, these 
contracts are currently of minor importance to the Group in relation 
to the total electricity demand and in terms of their significance for 
the liquidity and capital resources, financial position and profitability."
"The major items affected by such estimates and management 
judgments are described as follows."
"Actual amounts may differ from 
the estimates and management judgments."
"Changes can have a 
material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Recoverability of cash-generating units and equity-method 
investments
To determine the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units, 
estimates have to be used as part of impairment tests for non-
financial assets."
"Assumptions have to be made in particular with 
regard to future cash inflows and outflows for the planning period 
and the following periods."
"The estimates mainly relate to 
assumptions regarding future market shares and the growth of the 
respective markets, as well as regarding the products’ profitability."
"When objective evidence of impairment or impairment reversal is 
present, estimates and assessments also have to be made to 
determine the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment."
"In this context, assumptions must be made regarding future business 
developments in order to determine the expected future cash flows 
of that financial investment."
"Equity-method 
investments, for the presentation of carrying amounts of equity-
method investments."
"Recoverable amount of equipment on operating leases
The Daimler Truck Group regularly reviews the factors determining 
the values of its leased vehicles."
"In particular, it is necessary to 
estimate the residual values of vehicles at the end of their leases, 
which constitute a substantial part of the expected future cash flows 
from leased assets."
"In this context, assumptions are made regarding 
major influencing factors, such as the expected number of returned 
vehicles, the latest remarketing results and future vehicle model 
changes."
"The residual values thus determined serve as a basis for 
depreciation; changes in residual values lead either to prospective 
adjustments of the depreciation or, in the case of a significant 
decline in expected residual values, to an impairment."
"If depreciation 
is prospectively adjusted, changes in estimates of residual values do 
not have a direct effect but are equally distributed over the remaining 
periods of the lease contract."
"Recoverability of receivables from financial services
The Daimler Truck Group regularly estimates the risk of default on 
receivables from financial services."
"Many factors are taken into 
consideration in this context, including historical loss experience, the 
size and composition of certain portfolios, current economic events 
and conditions and the current fair values and adequacy of 
collaterals."
"In addition to historical and current information on losses, 
appropriate and reliable forward- looking information on factors is 
also included."
This information includes macroeconomic factors (e.g.
"GDP growth, unemployment rate, cost-performance index) and 
forecasts of future economic conditions."
"For receivables from 
financial services, these forecasts are determined using a scenario 
analysis (baseline scenario, optimistic and pessimistic scenario)."
"Further external information, which cannot be depicted in the 
scenarios, is – as far as necessary – included in the assessment 
through subsequent adjustments."
"Changes to the estimation and 
assessment of these factors influence the allowance for credit losses 
with a resulting impact on the Group’s net profit."
Receivables from financial services and E Note 34.
"Management of 
financial risks for further information."
"Product warranties
The recognition and measurement of provisions for product 
warranties is generally associated with a lot of estimates."
"The Group provides various types of product warranties depending on 
the type of product and market conditions."
"Provisions for product 
warranties are generally recognized when vehicles are sold or when 
new warranty programs are initiated."
"Based on historical warranty-
claim experience, assumptions have to be made on the type and 
extent of future warranty claims and customer goodwill, as well as on 
possible recall campaigns per model series."
"These assessments are 
based on past experience with regard to the frequency and extent of 
vehicle faults and defects."
"In addition, the estimates also include 
assumptions on the amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and 
the effects of possible time or mileage limits."
"The provisions are 
regularly adjusted to reflect new information."
"Further information on 
provisions for other risks is provided in E Note 24."
"Provisions for 
other risks."
"Liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings
Various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory investigations are 
pending against the Daimler Truck Group on a wide range of topics."
"If 
the outcome of such legal proceedings is detrimental to the Daimler 
Truck Group, the Group may be required to pay substantial 
compensatory and punitive damages, to undertake remedial work, 
product recalls, to pay fines, or to carry out other costly actions."
"Litigation and regulatory investigations often involve complex legal 
issues and are connected with a high degree of uncertainty."
"Accordingly, the assessment of whether a current obligation exists on 
the balance sheet date as a result of an event in the past, and 
whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obligation can be 
reliably estimated, largely depends on estimations by the 
management."
"The Daimler Truck Group regularly evaluates the 
current stage of legal proceedings, also with the involvement of 
external legal counsel."
"It is therefore possible that the amounts of 
provisions for pending or potential litigation will have to be adjusted 
due to future developments."
"Changes in estimates and premises can 
have a material effect on the Group’s future profitability."
"It is also 
possible that provisions recognized for some legal proceedings may 
turn out to be insufficient once such proceedings have ended."
"The 
Daimler Truck Group may also become liable for payments in legal 
proceedings for which no provisions were established."
"Although the 
final resolution of any such proceedings could have a material effect 
on the Daimler Truck Group’s operating results and cash flows for a 
particular reporting period, management believes that it should not 
materially affect the Group’s financial position."
"Further information 
on liability and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings is provided 
in E Note 31."
"Pensions and similar obligations
The calculation of provisions for pensions and similar obligations and 
the related pension cost are based on various actuarial valuations."
"The calculations are subject to various assumptions on matters such 
as current actuarially developed probabilities (e.g."
"As a result 
of changed market or economic conditions, the probabilities on 
which the influencing factors are based may differ from current 
developments."
"The financial effects of deviations of the main factors 
are calculated with the use of sensitivity analyses."
Pensions and similar obligations for further information.
"Income taxes
The calculation of income taxes is based on the legislation and 
regulations applicable in the various countries."
"Due to their 
complexity, tax items presented in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements are possibly subject to different interpretations by 
taxpayers on the one hand and local tax authorities on the
other."
"Different interpretations can occur especially in connection 
with the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items as well 
as in connection with the assessment of expenses and income."
"For 
the calculation of deferred tax assets, assumptions have to be made 
regarding future taxable income and the time of realization of the 
deferred tax benefits."
"In this context, the Daimler Truck Group takes 
into consideration, among other things, the projected operating 
results from subsidiaries, the effects on earnings of the reversal of 
taxable temporary differences, and realizable tax strategies."
"As future 
business developments are uncertain and are sometimes beyond the 
Daimler Truck Group’s control, the assumptions made for accounting 
for income taxes in connection with the recognition of deferred tax 
assets are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty."
"On each balance sheet date, the Daimler Truck Group assesses the 
recoverability of deferred tax assets on the basis of the planned 
taxable income in future financial years."
"Deferred tax assets are only 
recognized if it is probable that future taxable income will be 
available to realize tax benefits."
"Consolidated Group
Composition of the Group
Table ä D.08 shows the composition of the Group."
"A list of the 
companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
the shareholdings of the Daimler Truck Group pursuant to Section 
313 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) is provided in the 
statement of investments, refer to E Note 42."
"Structured entities
The structured entities of the Daimler Truck Group are rental 
companies and asset-backed-securities (ABS) companies."
"The 
purpose of the rental companies is primarily the acquisition, renting-
out and management of assets."
"The ABS companies are primarily 
used for the Daimler Truck Group’s refinancing."
"The assets 
transferred to structured entities usually result from the Daimler 
Truck Group’s leasing and sales financing business."
"Those entities 
refinance the purchase price by issuing securities."
"At the reporting date, the Daimler Truck Group has business 
relationships with four controlled structured entities."
"In addition, the 
Daimler Truck Group had relationships with five non-controlled 
structured entities."
"Assets and liabilities held for sale
As of December 31, 2023 there were no significant assets and 
liabilities held for sale (Further information can be found in the 
Fundamentals of the Group section in the combined management 
report under E Important Events)."

services and geographical regions – and presented in table ä D.11."
"The category type of products and services corresponds to the

contracts and extended warranties."
"It does not include performance 
obligations from customer contracts that have initial expected

"They consist of expenses which are not 
attributable to production, sales or research and development 
functions, such as personnel expenses, depreciation and 
amortization of fixed and intangible assets, and other administrative 
costs."
"The increase in 2023 was primarily due to higher personnel 
costs and IT costs."

"In the prior year, expenses from cost optimization programs 
in connection with the measures agreed with the General Works 
Council of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in December 2019 to cut the

The current tax expense includes tax income recognized for prior 
periods of €38 million (2022: expense of €4 million)."
"The deferred taxes are comprised of the components shown in table 
ä D.20."
"It consists of a 
federal corporate income tax rate of 15.0%, a solidarity tax surcharge 
of 5.5% on each year’s federal corporate income taxes, and a trade 
tax rate of 14.0%."
"The deferred taxes were measured using the 
substantively enacted tax rates of the respective tax jurisdictions."
"Table ä D.21 shows a reconciliation of expected income tax expense 
to actual income tax expense determined using the unchanged 
applicable German combined statutory tax rate of 29.8%."
"Tax-free income and non-deductible expenses include effects from 
non-German and German legal entities and operations, for example, 
from tax-free dividends and non-deductible expenses resulting from 
such dividends."
"The Other effects primarily relate to foreign currency effects, 
inflationary effects and withholding taxes."
"Tax expense that was recognized in comprehensive income is as 
shown in table ä D.25."
"After offsetting the deferred tax assets against 
deferred tax liabilities, the net deferred tax assets recognized at the 
Daimler Truck Group from these subsidiaries amount to €372 million 
at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: €449 million)."
"The 
Daimler Truck Group considers it probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available in the future to utilize these deferred tax 
assets."
"The current assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax 
assets that are considered recoverable by the Daimler Truck Group 
may change in the future and result in higher or lower deferred tax 
assets."
"From the current perspective, the retained earnings of non-German 
subsidiaries are largely intended to be reinvested in those 
subsidiaries."
"The Daimler Truck Group did not recognize deferred tax 
liabilities on retained earnings of non-German subsidiaries of €5,248 
million (December 31, 2022: €7,115 million), which are intended to 
be reinvested."
"If those earnings were paid out as dividends, an 
amount of 5.0% would be taxed under German taxation rules and, if 
applicable, would be subject to non-German withholding tax."
"Additionally, income tax consequences might arise if the dividends 
first have to be distributed by a non-German subsidiary to a non-
German intermediate holding company."
"Normally, the distribution 
would lead to an additional income tax expense."
"It is not practicable 
to estimate the amount of taxable temporary differences therefrom."
"In the Group, several years have not been finally assessed for tax 
purposes."
"The Daimler Truck Group believes that it has recognized 
sufficient liabilities for these open assessment years."
"Nevertheless, it 
cannot be ruled out that tax payments might exceed the liabilities 
recognized in the financial statements."
"The 
fair value of the liability is measured at zero."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG is headquartered in Germany which in 
December 2023 enacted a new legislation implementing the EU 
Minimum Taxation Directive to ensure a global minimum taxation for 
groups of companies (Minimum Tax Act)."
"The legislation introduces 
the global minimum top-up tax based on the “Pillar Two Model Rules” 
published by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD)."
"The Minimum Tax Act generally applies to all 
financial years beginning after 30 December 2023."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG, as the parent company of the Daimler 
Truck Group, is the ultimate parent entity for the Daimler Truck Group 
companies within the meaning of the Minimum Tax Act."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group is therefore directly affected by the worldwide 
implementation of the global minimum taxation."
"If the global minimum taxation had already come into force in 2023, 
this would not result in any top-up taxes for the Daimler Truck Group 
according to current assessments."
"Daimler Truck also assumes that 
no significant top-up taxes are to be expected from the future 
application of the German Minimum Tax Act or corresponding foreign 
legislation."
"Intangible assets
The development of intangible assets is shown in table ä D.30."
"Intangible assets that are not subject to scheduled amortization 
include assets with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, 
distribution rights and trademarks, and development costs for which 
the underlying projects are not yet completed."
"The Group intends to 
continue to use these assets."
"Table ä D.28 shows goodwill by 
segment and within reconciliation in the segment reporting."
"Intangible assets with indefinite lives, excluding goodwill, are €1,074 
million at December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: €1,077 million)."
"Development costs, where the underlying projects have not yet been 
completed, amount to €384 million at December 31, 2023 
(December 31, 2022: €342 million)."

Goodwill within reconciliation relates to the TORC Robotics, Inc."
"Other intangible assets includes the license agreement for the right-
to-use of the Mercedes-Benz brand with carrying amount of €932 
million (December 31, 2022: €932 million)."
"The use of the brand is 
for an indefinite period of time, and was agreed in 2021 between 
Daimler Truck AG with the Mercedes-Benz Intellectual Property 
GmbH & Co."
KG - a member of the Mercedes-Benz Group.
"The brand 
is part of the annual impairment test at the level of the CGUs 
Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Buses."
"The main assumptions used 
for cash flows are sales trends, which, for all tested CGUs, on 
average slightly increase over the detailed planning period, and 
return on sales, which generally also slightly increase."
"–
For the Financial Services CGU a risk-adjusted interest rate of 
10.0% after taxes/14.0% before taxes is applied (December 31, 
2022: 10.0% after taxes/14.0% before taxes)."
"The main 
assumptions used are the return on equity and growth in new 
business, which on average slightly increase over the detailed 
planning period."
"Return on equity is considered on an adjusted 
basis by excluding any special or one-off effects."
"–
For the TORC Robotics, Inc."
"CGU, a risk-adjusted rate of 20.0% 
after taxes/26.0% before taxes is applied, representing the 
innovative product of the CGU (December 31, 2022: 18.5% after 
taxes/25.0% before taxes)."
"The discount rate for the Financial Services CGU represents the cost 
of equity, whereas the risk-adjusted interest rate for the cash-
generating units of the automotive business and TORC Robotics, Inc."
are based on the weighted-average cost of capital (WACC).
"The impairment test as of December 31, 2023 did not require any 
impairment."

Income in which the total amortization expense for intangible assets

vehicles either from a dealer or directly from the Daimler Truck 
Group."
"Receivables from sales financing with dealers include loans for dealer 
inventory financing programs for vehicles sold by the Industrial 
Business to dealers."

"Receivables from finance lease contracts consist of receivables from 
lease contracts for which substantially all risks and rewards from the

"Table ä D.42 shows the maturities of future contractual lease 
payments and the development of lease payments with the carrying 
amounts of receivables from finance lease contracts."

difference between the additions to receivables from finance lease 
contracts and the carrying amounts of the underlying assets 
(especially in connection with the delivery of vehicles to consolidated 
companies)."
"Due to the fact that the Phase 2 transactions took place 
at various times during the financial year 2022, the impact on the 
previous year's figures is immaterial."
"In 2023, loss allowances of €88 million were charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Income in the Financial Services segment 
(2022: €174 million)."
"The decrease in loss allowances was driven by the normalization of 
the post-pandemic economic environment and improved portfolio 
performance."
"This was offset by the effect of the increase in the 
portfolio."
"In 2023, in addition to the utilization, loss allowances were 
gradually reduced in several markets due to good credit performance 
and improved macroeconomic outlook for the upcoming years."
"Future expectations are regularly updated to reflect the current 
macroeconomic outlook in loss allowance calculation."

share compared with an automotive-related index (STOXX Europe 
Auto Index)."
"The fair value of the medium-term portion of the annual 
bonus, which depends on this further performance, corresponds to 
the intrinsic value of the commitment as of the reporting date."
"With 
implementation of the remuneration system in 2023 the deferral is 
not applicable anymore."
"The annual bonus will be paid out completely 
in the following year after the reporting date."
"The pre-tax effects of the share-based payment transactions on the 
Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position are shown in table ä D.53."
"As from 2023 the Performance Phantom 
Share Plan (PPSP) was replaced by the Virtual Share-based Equity 
Plan (VSEP) and awarded to eligible employees."
"Under the PPSP and 
the VSEP, the Group grants virtual shares to eligible employees who 
are entitled to receive a cash payment after four years."
"During the 
four-year term between the allocation of the preliminary virtual 
shares and the payout of the plan at the end of the term, the virtual 
shares earn a dividend equivalent in the amount of the dividends paid 
in the respective year to actual Daimler Truck Holding AG shares."
The vesting period is therefore four years.
"For the existing plans, the price of the Daimler Truck Holding AG 
share is limited to 2.5 times the price at the date of grant."
"Furthermore, the payout for the members of the Board of 
Management is additionally limited to 2.5 times at PPSP and 3 times 
at VSEP the allotment value used to determine the preliminary 
number of virtual shares."
"The limitation of the payout for the 
members of the Board of Management also includes the dividend 
equivalents."
"For the VSEP 2023 currently granted, target achievement is 
determined on the basis of the relative share performance and 
selected sustainability targets of the Daimler Truck Group."
"The 
relative share performance measures the performance of the Daimler 
Truck Holding AG share including dividends (total shareholder return) 
over a three-year period compared to the performance of a pre-
defined peer group, the MSCI World Industrials Index."
"In addition to 
the financial performance indicators, the VSEP 2023 includes 
sustainability targets relating to environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics."
"These sustainability targets are derived 
from Daimler Truck´s sustainable business strategy and thus reflect 
awareness of the environment and society."
"In addition, the return on sales (ROS) of the Daimler Truck 
Group is compared to the ROS of a peer group (revenue-weighted 
average)."
"For the current PPSP 2020 and 2021 the share performance and the 
ROS for the periods up to the spin-off were calculated based on the 
performance of Mercedes-Benz Group AG (former Daimler AG), and 
for the periods after the spin-off based on the performance of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"In the period from the first trading day of 
the Daimler Truck Holding AG share on December 10, 2021 to 
December 31, 2021, the average of the prices of the shares of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG (former Daimler AG) and Daimler Truck 
Holding AG was taken into account for the relative share 
performance."
"The performance of ROS was calculated until the end of 
2021 based on Mercedes-Benz Group AG (former Daimler AG)."
"In this case, the deviation of the average ROS of 
the Daimler Truck Group from the average ROS of the peer group 
multiplied by 1.05 determines the level of the success factor."
"Furthermore, a limit on target achievement was agreed upon the ROS 
reference parameter."
"In the case of target achievement between 
195% and 200%, an additional comparison is made based on the 
achieved ROS in absolute terms."
"Accordingly, if, in the third year of 
the performance period, the actual ROS of the Daimler Truck 
Commercial Vehicles business is below the strategic target return 
value of 9%, the target achievement is restricted to 195%."
"The Group recognizes a provision for awarding the PPSP and the 
VSEP in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in 
provisions for other risks."
"Since payment per vested virtual share 
depends on the price of the Daimler Truck Holding AG share, that 
price essentially represents the fair value of each virtual share as of 
the reporting date."
"Pensions and similar obligations
Table ä D.54 shows the composition of provisions for pensions and 
similar obligations."
"The Daimler Truck Group operates defined benefit pension plans and, 
to a lesser extent, defined contribution pension plans, specific to the 
various countries."
"In addition, smaller healthcare benefit obligations 
are recognized, especially in the United States."
"The defined benefit pension plans provided by 
the Daimler Truck Group generally vary according to the economic, 
tax and legal circumstances of the country concerned."
"The defined 
benefit pension plans also generally provide benefits in the case of 
invalidity and death."
The Daimler Truck Group’s main pension plans are described below.
"German pension plans and pension plan assets
Most employees in Germany have defined benefit pension plans; 
most of the pension plans for the active workforce are based on 
individual retirement benefit accounts, to which the Daimler Truck 
Group makes annual contributions."
"The amount of the contributions 
for employees paid according to wage-tariff agreements depends on 
the tariff classification in the respective year or on their respective 
income, and for executives it depends on their respective income."
"For the commitments made until 2011, the contributions continue to 
be converted into capital components and credited to the individual 
pension accounts with the application of fixed factors related to each 
employee’s age."
"The conversion factors include a fixed value 
increase."
"For the commitments made as of 2011, the Daimler Truck 
Group guarantees at a minimum the value of the contributions paid 
into a cash-balance plan."
"Pension payments are made either as a life 
annuity, twelve annual installments, or a single lump sum."
"In addition, previously concluded defined benefit plans exist which 
primarily depend on employees’ wage-tariff classification upon 
transition into the benefit phase and which foresee a life annuity."
"As well as the employer-financed pension plans granted by German 
companies, the employees of some companies are also offered 
various deferred compensation models."
"The pension obligations in Germany relating to defined benefit 
pension plans are funded by investment funds."
"The assets are held 
within contractual trust arrangements (CTAs) between Daimler Truck 
Pension Trust e.V."
"and Daimler Truck AG, Daimler Buses GmbH 
(formerly known as EvoBus GmbH) and Daimler Truck Financial 
Services GmbH in Germany."
"US pension plans and pension plan assets
There are several defined benefit pension plans in the US that cover 
retirement and disability benefits and promise a balance at 
retirement age or monthly benefits."
"Most of plans are defined 
contribution plans and the plan benefits depend on the employee’s 
salary, years of credited service, or both."
"While most employee-
financed plans are still open for new entrants, most of the employer-
financed plans are closed for new entrants or no further benefit 
entitlements can be acquired."
"The contributions are deducted from 
the employee’s payroll and partially topped up by the employer."
"The 
promised benefits have an implicit return on plan assets."
"Most of the 
US pension plans are funded by contributions paid into a trust."
"Other countries’ pension plans and pension plan assets
Other significant plans exist primarily in Japan, where the majority of 
the plans are frozen and no significant new entitlements can be 
earned under these plans."
"The plans are related to final salaries as 
well as salary-based components."
"Most of the obligations outside 
Germany from defined benefit pension plans are funded by 
investment funds."
"In addition, a committee exists that 
approves new pension plans and amendments to existing pension 
plans as well as guidelines relating to company retirement benefits."
"The obligations from defined benefit pension plans and the pension 
plan assets can be subject to fluctuations over time."
"This can cause 
the funded status to be negatively or positively impacted."
"Fluctuations in the defined benefit pension obligations result at the 
Daimler Truck Group in particular from changes in financial 
assumptions such as discount rates and increases in the cost of 
living, but also from changes in demographic assumptions such as 
adjusted life expectancies."
"With most of the plans, expected long-
term wage and salary increases do not have an impact on the amount 
of the obligation."
"The fair value of plan assets is predominantly determined by the 
situation on the capital markets."
"Unfavorable developments, 
especially of equity prices and fixed-interest securities, could reduce 
that fair value."
"The broad diversification of investments, the selection 
of asset managers using quantitative and qualitative analyses, and 
the continual monitoring of returns and risk help to reduce the 
associated investment risk."
"The Group regularly makes contributions 
to plan assets to fund future obligations from defined benefit pension 
plans."
"As a general principle, it is the Daimler Truck Group’s objective to 
design new pension plans as defined benefit plans based on capital 
components or on annual contributions, or as defined contribution 
plans."
"The composition of the 
Daimler Truck Group’s pension plan assets is shown in table ä D.56."
"Market prices are usually available for equities and bonds due to their 
listings in active markets."
"Most of the bonds have investment-grade 
ratings."
"This includes government bonds with very good credit 
ratings."
"The investment strategy is reviewed regularly and adjusted if deemed 
necessary."
"The investment strategy is determined by Investment 
Committees, which are generally composed of representatives of the 
Finance and Human Resources departments of Daimler Truck AG, 
Daimler Truck Financial Services GmbH and Daimler Buses GmbH."
"The pension plan assets are generally oriented towards the structure 
of the pension obligations."
"Pension cost
The components of net pension cost included in the Consolidated
Statement of Income are shown in table ä D.57."
"The 
measurement date for the Daimler Truck Group’s net periodic 
pension cost is generally January 1."
"The assumptions used to 
calculate the defined benefit obligations vary according to the 
economic conditions of the countries in which the pension plans are 
situated."
"Calculation of the defined benefit obligations for the 
German plans uses life expectancy based on the 2018 G Heubeck 
mortality tables."
"The tables reflect the latest statistics of the 
statutory pension insurance system and of the German Federal 
Statistical Office."
"Comparable country-specific calculation methods 
are used for non-German plans."
"Table ä D.58 shows the significant weighted-average measurement 
factors used to calculate pension benefit obligations."
"Sensitivity analysis
An increase or decrease in the main actuarial assumptions would 
affect the present value of the defined benefit pension obligations as 
shown in table ä D.59."
"The calculations carried out by actuaries were done in isolation for 
the evaluation parameters regarded as material."
"This means that if 
there is a simultaneous change in several parameters, the individual 
results cannot be summed due to correlation effects."
"With a change 
in the parameters, the sensitivities shown cannot be used to derive a 
linear development of the defined benefit obligation."
"For the calculation of the sensitivity of life expectancy, by means of 
fixed (non-age-dependent) factors for a reference person, a one-year 
higher or lower life expectancy was assumed."
"For most non-German plans, expected increases in cost of living do not have a material impact on the 
amount of the obligation."
"The final amount is 
generally determined in the fourth quarter of a financial year."
"In 
2023, allocations to plan assets amounted to €90 million (2022: 
€318 million, of which €250 million was allocated on the basis of the 
2021 demerger agreement)."
"The Daimler Truck Group anticipates pension payments of
€237 million in 2024."
"The weighted-average durations of the defined benefit obligations are 
shown in table ä D.60."
"There are fundamentally no further contractual 
obligations or risks for the Daimler Truck Group in excess of the 
defined contributions."
"The Daimler Truck Group also pays 
contributions to governmental pension schemes."
"In 2023, the total 
expenses from defined contribution plans amounted to €607 million 
(2022: €584 million)."
"Of those payments, €495 million (2022: 
€479 million) was related to governmental pension plans and €111 
million (2022: €105 million) to defined contribution pension plans."
"Other post-employment benefits
Certain foreign legal entities and operations included in the Daimler 
Truck Group, mainly in the United States, provide their employees 
with post-employment health care benefits with defined entitlements, 
which have to be accounted for as defined benefit plans."
"Since the 
plans are unfunded, the balance sheet liability equals the present 
value of the defined benefit obligations of €561 million (December 
31, 2022: €556 million)."
"The net expense amounted to €39 million 
(2022: €32 million)."
"Risks in connection with commitments for other post-employment 
benefits (medical care) relate to rising healthcare costs and lower 
contributions to those costs from the public sector."
"In addition, these 
plans are subject to the usual risks for defined benefit plans, in 
particular the risk of changes in discount rates."
"Provisions for other risks
The development of provisions for other risks is summarized in
table ä D.61."
"Product warranties
The Daimler Truck Group issues various types of product warranties, 
under which it generally guarantees the performance of products 
delivered and services rendered for a certain period."
"The provision for 
these product warranties covers expected costs for legal and 
contractual warranty claims as well as expected costs for goodwill 
concessions and product recalls."
"The utilization date of product 
warranties depends on the incidence of the warranty claims and can 
span the entire term of the warranty and goodwill period."
"The cash 
outflows in relation to provisions for product warranties are primarily 
expected within a period until 2025."
"Personnel and social costs
Provisions for personnel and social costs primarily comprise 
expected expenses of the Daimler Truck Group for employee 
anniversary bonuses, employee and management bonuses, and early-
retirement plans."
"The additions recorded to the provisions for profit 
sharing and management bonuses in the reporting year generally 
lead to cash outflows in the following year."
"The cash outflows for 
provisions for personnel and social costs are primarily expected 
within a period until 2027."
"Cash outflows from provisions for liability and litigation risks as well 
as official proceedings are mainly expected within a period up to 
2027."
"Further information on liability and litigation risks and regulatory
proceedings is provided in E Note 31."
"Other
Provisions for other risks primarily comprise expected costs for 
provisions for environmental protection risks, decommissioning 
costs, sales expenses, other taxes and restructuring measures 
(including compensation payments)."
"They also include provisions for  
risks of loss from pending transactions and various other risks which 
cannot be allocated to any other class of provision."
"Financing liabilities
The composition of financing liabilities is shown in table ä D.62."
Information on the maturities is provided in E Note 34.
"Management 
of financial risks."
"In the financial year 2023, financing liabilities increased primarily due 
to the issuance of bonds of €5,960 million and Asset-Backed-
Securities (ABS) with a total volume to €1,913 million."
"This was offset 
by the repayment of bonds in the amount of €3,014 million."
"Liabilities to financial institutions include a current financial liability of 
€103 million from the maximum purchase obligation of the current 
share buyback program."
"The non-controlling interests included in the financing liabilities are 
held by Mercedes-Benz Grund Services GmbH in the entities Gamma 
(1-4) Daimler Truck Grundstücksverwaltung GmbH & Co."
"OHGs and 
Daimler Buses GrundstücksverwaItung GmbH & Co."
"OHG and are 
accounted for as financing liabilities in accordance with IAS 32."
"Other financial liabilities
The composition of other financial liabilities is shown in table ä D.63."
"Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss relate 
to derivative financial instruments, which are not used in hedge 
accounting."
"Further information on other financial liabilities is provided in E Note 
33."
"Deferred income
The composition of deferred income is shown in table ä D.64."
"The decrease during 2023 was mainly due to the deferral of sales 
revenue received from sales with residual value guarantees in 
companies of Industrial Business."
"Contract and refund liabilities
Table ä D.65 shows the composition of contract and refund 
liabilities."
"Other contract liabilities and other refund liabilities primarily include 
advanced payments and sales with a right of return, respectively."
"Other liabilities
Table ä D.66 shows the composition of other liabilities."
"Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Calculation of funds
As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents included 
restricted funds of €151 million (December 31, 2022: €102 million)."
"The restricted funds primarily relate to cash and cash equivalents 
held in subsidiaries where exchange controls apply so that the 
Daimler Truck Group has restricted access to the funds."
"During 2023, cash and cash equivalents increased by €1,123 million 
after adjusting for exchange-rate effects."
"This is primarily due to cash 
inflows from borrowings in the international money and capital 
markets, as well as cash outflows from operating activities, money 
market funds, and from the repayment of financing liabilities."
"The 
dividends paid and the share buyback program led to additional cash 
outflows."
"Cash provided by operating activities
In 2023 and 2022, the increase in receivables from financial services 
had a negative effect on cash flows from operating activities, which is 
primarily driven by new business in the Financial Services segment."
"Other non-cash expense and income primarily relates to the Group’s 
share of earnings from equity-method companies."
"Additionally, in 
2022, there was an impairment of the equity-method investment in 
Daimler KAMAZ Trucks Holding GmbH due to the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Furthermore, in 2022 cash flows from operating activities included 
cash outflow of €171 million as part of the acquired Financial 
Services business for the fulfillment of the pre-existing relationships 
between Daimler Truck Group and the acquired entities."
"The cash flows from operating activities in 2023 were also positively 
affected by trade receivables sold to external banks and financial 
institutions of €25 million (2022: €154 million) and are referred to in 
E Note 20."
"Composition of other operating assets and liabilities are shown in 
table ä D.67."

"Cash flows from investing activities in 2022 also included 
consideration paid to the Mercedes-Benz Group in connection with 
the acquired Financial Services business, of which €1,271 billion 
related to the repayment of financing liabilities and was allocated to 
the Industrial Business."
"Furthermore, as explained in E Note 33."
"Financial instruments, the 
short-term investments in mutual funds are also reflected as cash 
flows from investing activities."
"Table ä D.69 shows the changes in financing liabilities arising from 
financing activities, including cash flows from hedging the currency 
risks of financing liabilities, divided into cash and non-cash 
components."
"The net cash inflows from financing liabilities includes payments for 
the reduction of outstanding leasing liabilities of €217 million (2022: 
€192 million)."
"Legal proceedings
The subsidiaries of Daimler Truck Holding AG (especially Daimler 
Truck AG) are confronted with various legal proceedings, claims as 
well as governmental investigations and orders (legal proceedings) on 
a large number of topics."
"These include, for example, vehicle 
conformity and vehicle safety, dealer, supplier and other contractual 
relationships, financial services, industrial property rights (in 
particular patent infringement suits), warranty claims, and antitrust 
proceedings (including claims for damages)."
"If the outcome of such 
legal proceedings is negative for the Daimler Truck Group or such 
legal proceedings are settled, the Group may be required to pay 
substantial compensatory and punitive damages or to undertake 
service actions, recall campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly 
actions."
"Legal proceedings and related settlements may have an 
impact on the Group’s reputation."
"Class action lawsuits, if filed, 
and product liability, in particular, can have substantial financial 
consequences."
"The Group generally records warranty provisions in its Financial 
Statements based on past experience and known claims, but such 
provisions may not be adequate for any liability ultimately incurred as 
a result of potential vehicle defects."
"In addition, defective products, 
product liability claims, warranty claims, product recalls and other 
similar proceedings could damage the Group’s reputation."
"Antitrust law proceedings (including actions for damages)
Mercedes-Benz Group AG (formerly Daimler AG), as the former parent 
entity of Daimler Truck AG, was addressee of an antitrust proceeding 
initiated by the European Commission."
"The European Commission found that 
Daimler AG participated in the relevant arrangements from January 
17, 1997 to January 18, 2011."
"The individual fine imposed on Daimler 
AG by the European Commission’s settlement decision amounted to 
€1.09 billion and was paid in full in 2016."
"Following the settlement decision by the European Commission, legal 
actions, class actions and other forms of legal redress for damages 
by direct and indirect truck customers have been filed or initiated in 
several jurisdictions."
"Damage claims could result in substantial 
liabilities for the Daimler Truck Group as well as significant costs 
expended for defense measures, which may have a material adverse 
effect on its operations and financial resources."
"In relation to the cartel infringement described above, most 
substantial claims (including certain types of class actions or 
aggregator claims) are pending or have been initiated in Germany, 
the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain."
"Claims are also 
pending in certain other European countries and in Israel (in a total of 
approximately 20 countries)."
"The Daimler Truck Group takes appropriate legal remedies to defend 
itself and reflects the constantly evolving jurisprudence in its risk 
assessments and strategic decisions."
"Accounting estimates and management judgments relating to 
all legal proceedings
Risks resulting from legal proceedings sometimes cannot be 
assessed reliably or only to a limited extent."
"Consequently, provisions 
recognized for some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient 
once such proceedings have ended."
"The Group may also become 
liable for payments in legal proceedings for which no provisions were 
recognized and/or contingent liabilities were disclosed."
"Uncertainty 
exists with regard to the amounts or due dates of possible cash 
outflows."
"Contingent liabilities and other financial 
obligations
Contingent liabilities
As of December 31, 2023, the best-possible estimate of contingent 
liabilities was €575 million (December 31, 2022: €632 million)."
"The 
contingent liabilities mainly related to legal proceedings."
"Other financial obligations
At December 31, 2023, contractual obligations from the acquisition 
of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and equipment on 
operating leases amounted to €640 million (December 31, 2022: 
€440 million)."
"At December 31, 2023 other financial obligations 
amounted to €388 million (December 31, 2022: €404 million) which 
includes capital commitments to the joint ventures Greenlane 
Infrastructure, LLC and Commercial Vehicle Charging Europe B.V.."
"In addition, the Daimler Truck Group had issued irrevocable loan 
commitments at December 31, 2023 and 2022."
"These loan 
commitments had not been utilized as of that date."
"Further 
information on irrevocable loan commitments can be found in 
E Note 34."
Management of financial risks.
"Other financial obligations after the 2019 hive-down
In 2019, Mercedes-Benz Group AG hived down parts of its business 
operations into Daimler Truck AG and Mercedes-Benz AG."
"Pursuant 
to Section 133 of the German Transformation Act 
(Umwandlungsgesetz or UmwG), all three legal entities are jointly and 
severally liable for all liabilities of Mercedes-Benz Group AG that 
existed as of the registration date of the hive-down into the 
commercial register."
"The liability period for pension obligations based 
on the German Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz), the 
aforementioned period is ten years."
"Other financial obligations after the 2021 spin-off
In December 2021, Mercedes-Benz Group AG spun off and hived 
down its shares of Daimler Truck AG to Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"Daimler Truck Holding AG will be liable for those liabilities that 
existed before the spin-off took effect for a period of five years, 
starting as of the date of the announcement of the registration of the 
spin-off and hive-down into the commercial register of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG."
"The liability period for pension obligations based on 
the German Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz), the 
aforementioned period is ten years."
"Pension commitments are covered by planned assets (refer to 
E Note 23."
"Pensions and similar obligations) and are not included in 
the potential obligations."
"According to the current appraisal, a claim with respect to the 
subsequent liability relationship between the entities is considered to 
be unlikely."
"The equity instruments, which are 
recognized at fair value through other comprehensive income, are 
shown in table ä D.70 and comprise several investments not 
individually material."
"The Daimler Truck Group does not generally 
intend to sell the equity instruments presented at December 31, 
2023."
"The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date."
"Given the varying influencing factors, the reported fair values can 
only be viewed as indicators of the prices that may actually be 
achieved on the market."
"The fair values of financial instruments were calculated on the basis 
of market information available on the balance sheet date."
"The 
methods and premises used are explained in E Note 1."
"General 
information and significant accounting policies."
"Reverse factoring arrangements
At December 31, 2023, trade payables of €302 million are subject
to reverse factoring arrangements (December 31, 2022:
€260 million)."
"However, 
these arrangements do not meet the criteria for netting in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, as they allow netting 
only in the case of future events such as default or insolvency on the 
part of the Group or the counterparty."
"Table ä D.71 shows the carrying amounts of the derivative financial 
instruments subject to the described arrangements as well as the 
possible financial effects of netting in accordance with the master 
netting arrangements."

The other financial liabilities which are subject to a master netting arrangement comprise derivative financial instruments that are included in hedge accounting 
and financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss (refer to Note 26."
Other financial liabilities).
"At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the necessity 
for reclassification between the fair-value hierarchies."

Cash flow hedges
The Daimler Truck Group designates cash flow hedges for hedging 
currency risks and interest rate risks."
"Table ä D.82 shows the reconciliation of the reserves for derivative 
financial instruments."
"The realization 
of the hedged item is expected to correspond with the maturity 
ranges of the hedging transactions shown in table ä D.83."
"At December 31, 2023, the Daimler Truck Group held derivative 
financial instruments with a maximum term of 117 months 
(December 31, 2022: 109 months) in the portfolio in order to hedge 
currency risks arising from future operating cash flows."
"Further information on the hedging of currency and interest rate risks 
can be found in E Note 34."
Management of financial risks.
"A share price risk results from 
investments in listed companies."
"In addition, the Daimler Truck Group 
is exposed to credit risks from its leasing and financing activities and 
from its other business operations (trade receivables)."
"Furthermore, 
the Daimler Truck Group is exposed to liquidity and country risks 
relating to its credit and market risks or a deterioration of its 
business operations or financial market disturbances."
"If these 
financial risks materialize, they could adversely affect the Daimler 
Truck Group’s profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and 
financial position."
"The Daimler Truck Group has established internal policies for risk 
controlling procedures and for the use of financial instruments, 
including a clear segregation of duties with regard to financial 
activities, settlement, accounting and the related controlling."
"The guidelines and systems are regularly reviewed and 
adjusted to changes in markets and products."
"The Daimler Truck Group manages and monitors these risks primarily 
through its operating and financing activities and, if required, through 
the use of derivative financial instruments."
"The Daimler Truck Group 
uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial 
risks that arise from its business operations or refinancing activities 
or liquidity management."
"If not used, the Daimler Truck Group would 
be exposed to higher financial risks."
"Daimler Truck AG hedges 
currency risks through forward exchange contracts."
"Long-term supply 
contracts exist for the hedging of raw materials, so it is not necessary 
to build up further hedges."
"Additional information on financial 
instruments and especially on the volumes of the derivative financial 
instruments used is included in E Note 33."
"The Daimler Truck Group regularly evaluates its financial risks with 
due consideration of changes in key economic indicators and up-to-
date market information."
"The market sensitive instruments, including equity and debt 
securities, that the plan assets hold to finance pension and other 
post-employment benefits are not included in the following 
quantitative and qualitative analysis."
"For further information on 
pension and other post-employment benefit related liabilities, refer to 
E Note 23."
Pensions and similar obligations.
"Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of economic loss arising from a counterparty’s 
failure to repay or service debt in accordance with the contractual 
terms."
"Credit risk encompasses both the direct risk of default and the 
risk of a deterioration of creditworthiness as well as concentration 
risks."
"The maximum risk positions of financial assets which are generally 
subject to credit risk are equal to their carrying amounts at the 
balance sheet date (without consideration of collateral, if available)."
"There is also a risk of default from irrevocable loan commitments 
which had not been utilized as of that date, as well as from financial 
guarantees."
"The maximum risk position in these cases is equal to the 
expected future cash outflows."
"Table ä D.85 shows the maximum 
risk positions at the reporting date."
"With the investment of liquid 
assets, banks and issuers of securities are selected very carefully and 
diversified in accordance with a limit system."
"Liquid assets are 
primarily held by financial institutions with high credit ratings within 
and outside Europe and also in money market funds."
"In connection 
with investment decisions, priority is placed on the borrower’s very 
high creditworthiness and on balanced risk diversification."
"The limits 
and their utilization are reassessed continuously."
"In this assessment, 
the Daimler Truck Group also considers the credit risk assessment of 
its counterparties by the capital markets."
"In line with the Daimler 
Truck Group’s risk policy, most liquid assets are held in investments 
with an external investment grade rating."
"Liquid assets are thus not 
subject to a material credit risk and are allocated to Stage 1 of the 
impairment model, which is based on expected credit risk."
"As a consequence of these activities, 
the Daimler Truck Group is exposed to credit risk, which is monitored 
and managed based on defined standards, guidelines and 
procedures."
"Statements concerning the credit risk of Financial 
Services refer to the entire financing and leasing business, unless 
otherwise specified."
"Exposure to credit risk from financing and lease activities is 
monitored based on the portfolio subject to credit risk."
"The portfolio 
subject to credit risk consists of the receivables from financial 
services."
"These comprise receivables from sales financing with end 
customers and dealers, receivables from finance leasing contracts 
and (overdue) leasing payments from operating lease contracts."
"The 
operating lease portfolio is reported under equipment on operating 
leases in the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Leasing payments 
due from operating lease contracts are recognized in receivables 
from financial services."
"The Financial Services segment of the Daimler Truck Group has 
policies setting the framework for effective risk management at a 
global as well as a local level."
"In particular, these rules deal with 
minimum requirements for all risk-relevant credit processes, the 
definition of financing products offered, the evaluation of customer 
quality, requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured loans 
and non-performing claims."
"The limitation of concentration risks is 
implemented primarily by means of global limits, which refer to single 
customer exposures."
"As of December 31, 2023, exposure to the 
biggest 15 customers did not exceed 19% of the total portfolio 
(December 31, 2022: 19%)."
"With respect to its financing and lease activities, the Daimler Truck 
Group holds collateral for individual transactions limiting actual credit 
risk through its fair value."
"The value of collateral generally depends 
on the amount of the financed assets."
"At the start of the contract, 
security of at least 100% of the book value is regularly agreed in the 
form of the vehicles on which the contracts are based."
"Over the 
duration of the contracts, the development of the value of the 
collateral is continuously included in the calculation of the risk 
provisions to be formed, so that the net carrying amounts of the 
credit-impaired contracts are essentially secured by the vehicles."
"Furthermore, Financial Services limits credit risk from financing and 
lease activities, for example through advance payments from 
customers."
"For the assessment of the default risk of retail and small business 
customers, scoring systems are applied to evaluate their 
creditworthiness."
"Corporate customers are evaluated using internal 
rating instruments."
"Both evaluation processes use external credit 
bureau data if available."
"The scoring and rating results as well as the 
availability of security and other risk mitigation instruments, such as 
advance payments, guarantees and, to a lower extent, residual debt 
insurances, are essential elements for credit decisions."
"The decrease in loss allowances was driven by the normalization of 
the post-pandemic economic environment and improved portfolio 
performance."
"This was offset by the effect of the increase in the 
portfolio."
"In 2023, in addition to the utilization, loss allowances were 
gradually reduced in several markets due to good credit performance 
and improved macroeconomic outlook for the upcoming years."
"Future expectations are regularly updated to reflect the current 
macroeconomic outlook in loss allowance calculation."
"For information on credit risks included in receivables from financial 
services, refer to E Note 15."
Receivables from financial services.
"Information on the measurement of expected credit losses is 
provided in E Note 1."
"General information and significant accounting 
policies."
"Trade receivables
Trade receivables are mostly receivables from worldwide sales of 
vehicles and spare parts."
"The credit risk from trade receivables 
encompasses the default risk of customers, e.g., authorized dealers 
and general distribution companies, as well as other corporate and 
private customers."
"In order to identify credit risks, the Daimler Truck 
Group assesses the creditworthiness of customers."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group manages its credit risk from trade receivables using 
appropriate IT applications and databases on the basis of internal 
policies which have to be followed globally."
"A significant proportion of the trade receivables from each country’s 
domestic business is secured by various country-specific types of 
collateral."
"This collateral includes conditional sales, guarantees and 
sureties, as well as mortgages and advance payments from 
customers."
"For trade receivables from the export business, the Daimler Truck 
Group also evaluates its customers’ creditworthiness by means of an 
internal rating process with consideration of the respective country 
risk."
"In this context, the year-end financial statements and other 
relevant information on the general distribution companies, such as 
payment history, are used and assessed."
"Depending on the customers’ creditworthiness, the Daimler Truck 
Group establishes credit limits and limits credit risks with the 
following types of collateral:
–
credit insurances,
–
first-class bank guarantees and
–
letters of credit."
"These procedures are defined in the export credit guidelines,
which have Group-wide validity."
"For loss allowance of trade receivables, a simplified approach is 
applied, whereby these receivables are allocated to stage 2."
"The 
expected credit losses over the entire term are taken into account 
upon initial recognition."
"Further information on trade receivables and the status of loss 
allowances refer to E Note 20."
"Derivative financial instruments
The Daimler Truck Group uses derivative financial instruments 
exclusively for hedging financial risks that arise from its operating 
activities, financing activities or liquidity management."
"This 
system limits and diversifies the credit risk."
"As a result, the Daimler 
Truck Group is exposed to credit risk only to a small extent with 
respect to its derivative financial instruments."
"In accordance with the 
Group’s risk policy, the majority of derivatives were concluded with 
counterparties which have an external investment grade rating."
"Other receivables and financial assets
With respect to other receivables and financial assets included in 
other financial assets in 2023 and 2022, the Daimler Truck Group is 
exposed to credit risk only to a small extent."
"Irrevocable loan commitments
The Financial Services segment in particular is exposed to credit risk 
from irrevocable loan commitments to end customers and retailers."
"At December 31, 2023, irrevocable loan commitments amounted to 
€370 million (December 31, 2022: €163 million)."
"These loan 
commitments had a maturity of less than one year and are not 
subject to a material credit risk."
"Financial guarantees
The maximum potential payment obligations resulting from financial 
guarantees as of December 31, 2023 amounted to €271 million 
(December 31, 2022: €300 million) and at December 31, 2023 
included liabilities of €11 million (December 31, 2022: €17 million)."
Financial guarantees principally represent contractual arrangements.
"These guarantees generally provide that in the event of default or 
non-payment by the primary debtor, the Daimler Truck Group will be 
required to settle such financial obligations, generally up to a 
contractually agreed amount."
"Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk comprises the risk that a company cannot meet its 
financial obligations in full."
"The Daimler Truck Group manages its 
liquidity by holding adequate volumes of liquid assets and by 
maintaining syndicated credit facilities in addition to the cash inflows 
generated by its business operations."
"Additionally, the option of 
securitizing receivables (“ABS transactions”) also reduces the 
Group’s liquidity risk."
"Liquid assets comprise cash and cash 
equivalents and marketable debt securities and similar investments."
"The Daimler Truck Group can dispose of these liquid assets at short 
notice."
"The funds raised are used to finance working capital and capital 
expenditure as well as the cash needs of the leasing and financing 
business and unexpected liquidity needs."
"In accordance with internal 
guidelines, the refinancing of the leasing and financing business is 
generally carried out with matching maturities so that financing 
liabilities have the same maturity profile as the leased assets and the 
receivables from financial services."
"At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents amounted to 
€7,067 million (December 31, 2022: €5,944 million)."
"In 2023, 
significant cash inflows resulted from the operations of the Industrial 
Business as well as cash inflows and outflows in connection with the 
cash provided by financing activities."
"From an operating point of view, the management of the Daimler 
Truck Group’s liquidity exposures is centralized by a daily cash 
pooling process."
"This process enables the Daimler Truck Group to 
manage its liquidity surplus and liquidity requirements according to 
the actual needs of the Daimler Truck Group."
"The Daimler Truck 
Group’s short-term and mid-term liquidity management takes into 
account the maturities of financial assets and financial liabilities and 
estimates of cash flows from business operations."
"In general, the Daimler Truck Group makes use of a broad spectrum 
of financial instruments to cover its funding requirements."
"Depending 
on funding requirements and market conditions, the Daimler Truck 
Group issues commercial papers, debt obligations and financial 
instruments secured by receivables in various currencies."
"On October 
28, 2021, the Daimler Truck Group was issued with a long-term 
issuer credit rating of A3 by Moody’s Investor Service and BBB+ by 
S&P Global Ratings; nonetheless, potential downgrades of the 
Daimler Truck Group’s credit ratings could have a negative impact on 
the Group’s financing."
"In August 2021, an agreement was concluded with a consortium of 
international banks to provide a syndicated credit facility, of 
€5 billion."
"The facility has an initial term of five years with two one-
year extension options."
"Both extension options are expired and were 
not utilized."
Daimler Truck does not intend to utilize the credit facility.
"In September 2022, a further revolving credit facility of €1 billion was 
concluded with an international banking group."
"This credit facility has 
a term of 24 months and includes an option to increase by €500 
million during the first 18 months."
"The option to increase and the 
credit line have not been utilized as of the reporting date."
"Information on the Daimler Truck Group’s financing liabilities is also 
provided in E Note 25."
b) Interest payments on financial instruments with variable interest rates are calculated on the basis of forward rates.
"2
The stated cash flows of financing liabilities consist of their undiscounted principal and interest payments."
"3
The undiscounted sum of the cash flows of the derivative financial liabilities is shown for each of the respective years."
"4
The cash outflows of trade payables are shown as undiscounted."
"5
The maximum available amounts are stated."
"6
The maximum potential obligations under the issued guarantees are stated."
It is assumed that the amounts are due within the first year.
"The Daimler Truck Group is exposed to country risk mainly resulting 
from investments in subsidiaries, associated companies, joint 
ventures and joint operations, as well as from cross-border trade 
receivables."
"Country risks also arise from cross-border cash deposits 
at financial institutions."
"The Daimler Truck Group manages these risks via country exposure 
limits (e.g., for hard currency portfolios of financial services entities)."
"An internal rating system serves as a basis for risk-oriented country 
exposure management; it assigns all countries to risk classes, with 
consideration of capital market indications of country risks."
"Financial market risks
The global nature of its businesses exposes the Daimler Truck Group 
to significant market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign 
currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices."
"The 
Daimler Truck Group is also exposed to equity price risk in 
connection with its investments in listed companies."
"The Daimler Truck Group calculates its overall net exposure to these 
market risks to provide the basis for hedging decisions, which include 
the selection of hedging instruments and the determination of 
hedging volumes and the corresponding periods."
"Decisions regarding 
the management of market risks from foreign exchange rates and 
commodities, as well as asset/liability management (interest rates), 
are regularly made by the relevant Daimler Truck Group risk 
management committees."
"Net exposures are the basis for the 
hedging strategies and are updated regularly."
"Certain benchmark interest rates, including those of the London 
Interbank Offer Rate (for US dollar, British pound, Swiss franc and 
Japanese yen), have comprehensively reformed internationally by the 
end of 2022."
"As a result, those interest rates were gradually 
abolished and replaced with alternative risk-free reference rates."
"Alternative interest rates are being developed on a national level in 
the context of the respective legal systems and currencies; they can 
therefore vary with regards to their structure, methodology and 
period of publication."
"In 2023, part of the derivatives affected by the benchmark reform in 
CAD switched to the risk-free reference rate CORRA."
"The 
corresponding underlying transactions are not affected."
"The Daimler 
Truck Group expects that the remaining conversion of reference rates 
of hedging instruments and their underlying transactions to be 
identical and without any significant delay in time."
"The Daimler Truck 
Group continues to consider the economic relationship and thus the 
continuation of hedge accounting to be still existing."
"The nominal values of the affected derivative financial instruments 
can be found in table ä D.83."
"As part of its risk management system, the Daimler Truck Group 
employs value-at-risk analyses."
"In performing these analyses, the 
Daimler Truck Group quantifies its market risk caused by changes 
such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and certain 
commodity prices on a regular basis by calculating a potential loss 
given a confidence level and a holding period."
"The value-at-risk calculations are based on the following 
assumptions:
–
potential losses related to fair value changes, and
–
a 99% confidence level at a holding period of five days."
"The Daimler Truck Group calculates the value at risk for exchange 
rates according to the variance-covariance approach."
"When calculating value at risk using the variance-covariance 
approach, the Daimler Truck Group first computes the current market 
value of the Group’s financial instruments portfolio."
"Then, the 
sensitivity of the portfolio value to changes in the relevant market 
risk factors, such as particular foreign currency exchange rates or 
interest rates of specific maturities, is quantified."
"Based on volatilities 
and correlations of these market risk factors, which are obtained 
from the RiskMetrics™ dataset, a statistical distribution of potential 
changes in the portfolio value at the end of the holding period is 
computed."
"The loss which is reached or exceeded with a probability 
of only 1% can be derived from this calculation and represents the 
value at risk."
"Exchange rate risk
Transaction risk and currency risk management."
"The global nature of 
the Daimler Truck Group’s businesses exposes cash flows to risks 
arising from fluctuations in exchange rates."
"These mainly relate to 
the euro, the US dollar, the British pound, the Australian dollar and 
the Japanese yen."
"The Daimler Truck Group’s exchange rate risk 
primarily arises when revenue is generated in a currency that is 
different from the currency in which the revenue related costs are 
incurred."
"It may be inadequate to cover the costs if the value of the 
currency in which the revenue is generated declines in the interim 
relative to the value of the currency in which the costs were incurred."
"The Daimler Truck Group is exposed to transaction risks, but only to 
a minor degree because of its global production network and the 
overall lower foreign currency volume."
"In addition, the Daimler Truck 
Group is indirectly exposed to transaction risk from its equity-method 
investments."
"The Daimler Truck Group’s overall currency exposure is reduced by 
natural hedging, which consists of the currency exposures of the 
business operations of different entities and segments partially 
offsetting each other at a Group level."
"These natural hedges eliminate 
the need for hedging to the extent of the matched exposures."
"To 
provide an additional natural hedge against any remaining transaction 
risk exposure, the Daimler Truck Group generally strives to increase 
cash outflows in the same currencies in which the Daimler Truck 
Group has a net excess inflow."
"In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
for the Group’s operations (future transactions), the Daimler Truck 
Group continually assesses its exposure to exchange rate risks and 
hedges a portion of those risks by using derivative financial 
instruments."
"The Daimler Truck Group manages its exchange rate 
risk and its hedging transactions through currency derivatives."
"The 
corporate treasury department implements the foreign currency 
hedging through transactions with international financial institutions."
"Suitable measures are generally taken without delay to eliminate any 
over-hedging regarding hedging transactions caused by changes in 
exposure."
"The designated hedging relationships are also reviewed 
with respect to any requirements to discontinue hedge accounting."
"On 
the one hand, the hedging horizon is naturally limited by uncertainty 
related to cash flows that lie far in the future; on the other hand, it 
may also be limited by the fact that appropriate currency contracts 
are not available."
"This reference model aims to limit risks for the 
Daimler Truck Group from unfavorable movements in exchange rates 
while preserving some flexibility to participate in favorable 
developments."
"Based on this reference model and depending on the 
market outlook, the committee determines the hedging horizon, 
which usually varies from one to three years, as well as the average 
hedge ratios."
"Reflecting the character of the underlying risks, the 
hedge ratios decrease with increasing maturities."
"Foreign currency exposure risks of the vehicle business operations 
are managed primarily with the use of forward foreign exchange 
contracts."
"The instruments applied depend on the assessment of 
market conditions."
"Value at risk is used to measure the exchange 
rate risk inherent in these derivative financial instruments."
"Table ä D.87 shows the value at risk at period-end of the exchange 
rate risk for the 2023 and 2022 portfolios of derivative financial 
instruments, which were entered into primarily in connection with the 
vehicle business operations."
"The underlying transactions on which 
the derivatives are based are not included in the following value-at-
risk presentation, since they primarily comprise forecasted cash 
flows."
Also refer to table ä D.83.

Hedge accounting."
"When designating derivative financial instruments, 
a hedge ratio of 1 is applied."
"In addition, the respective volumes, 
interest rate curves and currencies of the hedge and the underlying 
transaction as well as maturity dates are matched."
"The Daimler Truck 
Group ensures an economic relationship between the underlying 
transaction and the hedging transaction by ensuring consistency of 
currency, volume and maturity."
"Forward components are not 
designated into the hedge relationship, but are deferred as hedging 
costs with no effect on income and recognized in the income 
statement or as an adjustment to the cost of non-financial assets 
when the underlying transaction matures."
"Effectiveness is assessed 
at initial designation and during the hedge term."
"Possible sources of 
ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship are:
–
Changes in the credit risk when measuring the hedging 
instrument used, which are not reflected in the change of the 
hedged currency risk."
"–
Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions."
"In 2023, the development of the value-at-risk from foreign currency 
hedging was mainly driven by a sharp decrease in foreign currency 
rate volatility."
"The Daimler Truck Group’s investments in liquid assets or refinancing 
activities are generally selected so that possible currency risks are 
minimized."
"The 
Daimler Truck Group uses appropriate derivative financial 
instruments (e.g., cross-currency interest rate swaps) to hedge 
against currency risk."
"Since currency risks arising from the Daimler Truck Group’s 
investment or refinancing in foreign currencies and the respective 
hedging transactions generally offset each other, these financial 
instruments are not included in the value-at-risk calculation 
presented."
Effects of currency translation risk (“Translation risk”).
"For purposes of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements, the income and expenses and 
the assets and liabilities of non-euro reporting subsidiaries are 
converted into euros."
"Therefore, period-to-period changes in average 
exchange rates may cause translation effects that have a significant 
impact on, for example, revenue, segment results (EBIT) and assets 
and liabilities of the Daimler Truck Group."
"Unlike exchange rate 
transaction risk, exchange rate translation risk does not necessarily 
affect future cash flows."
"The Daimler Truck Group’s equity position 
reflects changes in carrying amount caused by exchange rates."
"In 
general, the Daimler Truck Group does not hedge against currency 
translation risk."
"Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of 
a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates."
"The Daimler Truck Group uses a variety of interest rate 
sensitive financial instruments to manage the Group’s liquidity needs."
"However, a substantial volume of interest rate sensitive assets and 
liabilities results from the leasing and sales financing business 
operated by the Financial Services segment."
"The Financial Services 
companies enter into transactions with customers that primarily 
result in fixed-rate receivables."
"The Daimler Truck Group’s general 
policy is to match funding in terms of maturities and interest rates 
wherever economically feasible."
"However, for a limited portion of the 
receivables portfolio in selected and developed markets, Financial 
Services does not match funding in terms of maturities in order to 
take advantage of market opportunities."
"As a result, the Daimler 
Truck Group is exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates."
"The measurement of the interest rate risk of the Daimler Truck Group 
has been carried out through a value-at-risk analysis."
"An expert group from the Daimler Truck Group, comprising members 
of the Group Treasury, Financial Services Controlling and Group 
Controlling, manage the interest rate risk by setting targets for the 
interest rate risk position."
"Group Treasury and the local subsidiaries 
are jointly responsible for achieving these targets."
"Group Treasury 
Controlling and the Financial Services Controlling and Reporting 
department monitor target achievement on a regular basis as 
separate functions."
"In order to achieve the targeted interest rate risk 
positions in terms of maturities and interest rate fixing periods, the 
Daimler Truck Group also uses derivative financial instruments such 
as interest rate swaps."
"The Daimler Truck Group assesses its interest 
rate risk position by comparing assets and liabilities for 
corresponding maturities, including the impact of the relevant 
derivative financial instruments."
"The Daimler Truck Group manages the funding 
activities of the vehicle segments and financial services segment at 
Group level."
"Table ä D.87 shows the value-at-risk at the end of the reporting 
period for the interest rate risk in 2023 and 2022 for the derivative 
financial instruments."
"Leasing liabilities are not included in the value-
at-risk of the interest rate risk."
"These leasing liabilities have fixed 
interest rates and changes in interest rates therefore have no effect 
on the Daimler Truck Group’s net profit."
"When designating derivative financial instruments, 
a hedge ratio of 1 is generally applied."
"The respective volumes, 
interest rate curves and currencies of the hedged item and the 
hedging instrument as well as maturity dates are matched."
"In the 
case of combined derivative financial instruments for interest 
currency hedges, the cross-currency basis spread is not designated 
into the hedge relationship, but deferred as a hedging cost in other 
comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss over the 
hedge term."
"The Daimler Truck Group ensures an economic 
relationship between the underlying transaction and the hedging 
instrument by ensuring consistency of interest rates, maturity terms 
and nominal amounts."
"The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at 
the beginning and during the economic relationship using the 
hypothetical derivative method."
"Possible sources of ineffectiveness of 
the hedge relationship are:
–
Changes in the credit risk when measuring the hedging 
instrument in use which are not reflected in the change in the 
hedged interest rate risk."
"–
Changes in the parameters of the underlying hedged 
transactions."
"Commodity price risk
The Daimler Truck Group is exposed to the risk of changes in 
commodity prices in connection with procuring raw materials and 
manufacturing supplies used in production."
"Risk is limited through 
long-term supply contracts."
"The relevant committees of the Daimler 
Truck Group review the risk and take actions to reduce this risk 
arising from fluctuation of commodity prices, if necessary."
"In 
addition, long-term electricity supply contracts from renewable 
energies, so-called power purchase agreements, are concluded to 
hedge electricity prices and the purchase of green energy."
"The fair 
value of these contracts corresponds to the difference between the 
market price and the contractually agreed price multiplied by the 
contract volume."
"At December 31, 2023 for commodity derivatives 
no hedge accounting took place."
"The future use of derivatives is 
possible in principle, as described above."
"When designating 
commodity derivatives, the respective volumes and parameters 
relevant for the valuation of the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument as well as maturity dates are matched."
"The Daimler Truck 
Group ensures an economic relationship between the hedged item 
and the hedging instrument by ensuring consistency of volumes, 
parameters relevant for valuation and maturity terms."
"Effectiveness is 
assessed at initial designation and during the hedge term."
"Possible 
sources of ineffectiveness of the hedge relationship are:
–
Changes in the credit risk on the measurement of the derivative 
instrument in use which are not reflected in the change in the 
hedged commodity price risk."
"–
Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions."
"Equity price risk
The Daimler Truck Group predominantly holds investments in shares 
of companies which are classified as long-term investments, some of 
which are accounted for using the equity method."
"These investments 
are not included in a market risk assessment by the Daimler Truck 
Group."
"Segment reporting
Reportable segments
The Board of Management of Daimler Truck Holding AG, as the chief 
operating decision maker, allocates resources to the operating 
segments of the Group and assesses their performance on a regular 
basis."
"Therefore, the reporting based on operating segments 
retrospectively reflects the internal reporting and management 
structure of the Daimler Truck Group."
"The segments are largely organized and managed separately, 
according to geographical areas, nature of products and services 
provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers."
"The 
Daimler Truck Group’s activities are divided into the segments Trucks 
North America, Mercedes-Benz, Trucks Asia, Daimler Buses and 
Financial Services."

trucks under the Freightliner and Western Star brands in North 
America."

trucks and buses under the Mercedes-Benz brand."

trucks are imported to China."
"Furthermore, trucks are produced 
under the Mercedes-Benz and Auman brands as part of the Beijing 
Foton Daimler Automotive Co., Ltd."
joint venture with Foton.
"The Daimler Buses segment develops, manufactures, and sells buses 
under the Mercedes-Benz and Setra brands."
"The segment’s product 
range also includes bus chassis under the Mercedes-Benz brand."
"The Trucks North America, Mercedes-Benz, Trucks Asia and Daimler 
Buses segments comprise the vehicle segments."

"The Financial Services segment supports the sales of the trucks and 
buses worldwide."
"Its product portfolio primarily comprises tailored 
financing and leasing packages for end customers and dealers, 
brokering of commercial vehicles insurance and banking services."
"Internal management and reporting structure
The internal management and reporting structure at the Daimler 
Truck Group is principally based on the accounting policies that are 
described in E Note 1."
"General information and significant 
accounting policies, in accordance with IFRS."
"The measure of the Daimler Truck Group’s profit or loss used by the 
Group’s management and reporting structure is referred to as “EBIT”."
"Transactions between entities within the same segment are generally 
eliminated in the respective segment."
"Transactions between the 
segments are generally eliminated within reconciliation."
"The 
elimination of effects connected with intra-Group transfers of equity 
investments takes place in the segments involved."
"Some 
simplifications have been made in the segment reporting with regard 
to accounting for leases in connection with intra-group transactions."
"For example, intra-group leases are accounted for as operating 
leases."
"Segment assets principally comprise all assets related to the 
operating activities."
"The vehicle segments’ assets exclude income tax 
assets, assets from defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment benefit plans, as well as certain financial instruments 
(including liquidity)."
"Segment liabilities principally comprise all 
liabilities related to the operating activities."
"The vehicle segments’ 
liabilities exclude income tax liabilities, liabilities from defined benefit 
pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, and certain 
financial instruments (including financing liabilities)."
"The residual value risks associated with the Daimler Truck Group’s 
operating leases and finance lease receivables are generally borne by 
the vehicle segments that manufactured the leased vehicles."
"Risk 
sharing is based on agreements between the vehicle segment and 
Financial Services; the terms vary by vehicle segment and geographic 
region."
"Capital expenditures for intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment reflect the cash-effective additions to these intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment to the extent that they do 
not relate to capitalized borrowing costs or goodwill."
"Depreciation and amortization may also include impairments, 
provided that they do not relate to goodwill impairment according to 
IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”."
"Reconciliation
The reconciliation includes other business activities and investments, 
in particular in the area of autonomous driving."
"Moreover, functions 
and services provided by the Daimler Truck Group’s headquarters as 
well as by other companies of the Group not allocated to the 
segments are included."
"In addition, the reconciliation includes 
projects managed by headquarters."

"Capital management
The capital management of the Daimler Truck Group is based on 
operating net assets as the capital base for the Industrial Business as 
well as equity as the capital base for Financial Services."
"The 
operating assets and liabilities of the segments in accordance with 
IFRS provide the basis for the determination of the operating net 
assets of the Industrial Business."
"The segments of the Industrial 
Business are accountable for all assets and liabilities for which they 
are responsible in day-to-day operations and therefore are allocated 
to them."
"The operating net assets of the Industrial Business also 
include reconciliation items of the Group that are not assigned to the 
segments."
"Items related to liquidity, income taxes and pensions are 
not part of the operating net assets."
"Performance measurement in 
the Financial Services segment is on an equity basis, in line with the 
usual practice in the banking business."
"The steering of the Industrial 
Business and Financial Services is based on the respective average 
capital base of the year."
"It is calculated from the average capital 
bases of the quarters, which are the averages of the beginning and 
end of the respective quarter."
"Based on the respective capital bases, we calculate the return on 
capital employed for the Industrial Business and the return on equity 
for Financial Services."
"To evaluate the profitability of the invested 
capital, the return ratios are compared with the respective cost of 
capital rates."
"If the ratio exceeds the cost of capital rate, this creates 
value for our shareholders."
"The cost of capital rates of the Daimler 
Truck Group are derived from the minimum rates of return that 
investors expect on their invested capital."
"The cost of capital rate of 
the Industrial Business is determined from the weighted cost of 
equity and cost of debt rates."
"In line with usual business practice, the 
cost of equity rate is used as the cost of capital rate for Financial 
Services."
"The calculation of the cost of equity rate is based on the 
CAPM method."
"For internal steering in the reporting year 2023, a 
cost of capital rate of 12% before taxes was used for the Industrial 
Business."
"For Financial Services, the cost of equity rate applied was 
14% before taxes for 2023."
"The objective of capital management is to optimize the cost of 
capital."
"This is achieved by optimizing the operating net assets, 
including working capital, within the operating responsibility of the 
segments."
"In addition, taking legal regulations into account, the 
Daimler Truck Group strives to optimize the costs and risks of its 
capital structure and, consequently, the cost of capital."
"Examples of 
this include a balanced ratio between equity and debt as well as an 
appropriate level of liquidity, oriented towards operating 
requirements."
"Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on 
the profit attributable to shareholders of the Daimler Truck Group."
"There were no dilution effects in respect of the shares in 2023 or 
2022."
"The profit attributable to shareholders of the Daimler Truck 
Group (basic and diluted) amounted to €3,775 million (2022: €2,665 
million)."
"The weighted average number of outstanding shares used for 
calculating earnings per share is calculated after deducting the 
treasure shares acquired as of December 31, 2023."
"During the financial year 2023 the weighted average number of 
outstanding shares were 818 million and for the fourth quarter of 
2023 it were 806 million."
"Table ä D.91 shows the numerator and the denominator for the 
calculation of earnings per share."

Information on equity and earnings and information on investments pursuant to Section 313 Subsection 2 No."
"4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) has been omitted since, according to Section 313 Subsection 3 Sentence 4 of the HGB, such information is of minor 
relevance for a fair presentation of the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, or financial position of the Daimler Truck Group."
"In all material 
respects, the combined management report is consistent with the 
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal 
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks 
of future development."
"Our opinion on the combined management 
report does not cover the elements of the combined management 
report referred to in the “Other information” section of our auditor’s 
report."
"Pursuant to Section 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 HGB [Handelsgesetz-
buch: German Commercial Code] we declare that our audit has not led 
to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consoli-
dated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Basis for the Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and 
of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subse-
quently as the “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German 
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promul-
gated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors 
in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, 
principles and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s 
report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with 
the requirements of European law and German commercial and pro-
fessional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in 
accordance with Article 10 paragraph 2 letter f) of the EU Audit Regu-
lation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services pro-
hibited under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We 
believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropri-
ate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined management report."
"In addition, we have audited the report 
on the situation of the Company and the Group (hereinafter referred to 
as the ”combined management report”) of Daimler Truck Group AG for 
the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal regulations, we have not audited 
the contents of the elements of the combined management report 
referred to in the “Other information” section of our auditor’s report."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and, in forming our opin-
ion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"The loss allowances on these receivables amounts at the 
reporting date to EUR 524 million."
"The calculation of the loss allowances is based on expected credit 
losses and therefore also includes expectations regarding the future."
"The expected credit losses are recognised by means of a three-param-
eter procedure for the determination of loss allowances."
"Furthermore, mac-
roeconomic scenarios (base scenario, optimistic and pessimistic sce-
narios), the identification of which to a high degree includes 
discretionary judgements and uncertainties, flow into the calculation 
of allowances."
"The risk for the financial statements is that the credit-
worthiness of customers and the amount of the payment dates of 
future cash flows are misjudged or that the calculation of the risk pro-
vision parameters is incorrect so that loss allowances are not recog-
nised or are insufficient."
"We audited the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal con-
trol system with regard to the risk classification process and risk mod-
els and the identification of the factors determining the value and the 
loss allowances, also by rechecking the calculations."
"To this end, we 
also evaluated the relevant IT systems and internal procedures."
"In 
addition to the audit by our IT specialists of the propriety of the IT sys-
tems affected and related interfaces to ensure the completeness and 
correctness of the data, the audit also included the audit of automatic 
controls for data entry and data processing."
"The main focus of our audit was the evaluation of the methodical 
approach in the definition of risk categories of default probabilities and 
loss rates that are derived from historical data."
"We obtained an under-
standing of these calculations based on a risk-oriented selection of 
credit portfolios."
"We satisfied ourselves with regard to the appropri-
ateness of significant risk parameters based on the results of a valida-
tion performed by Daimler Truck Financial Services and evaluated the 
adjustments of the parameters to the current market situation."
"In this 
connection, we audited the data supporting the validations on the 
basis of a conscious sample."
"The risk for the consolidated financial statements
The provision for product warranties and goodwill costs amounts to 
EUR 2,231 million and is included in the provisions for other risks."
"The Daimler Truck Group grants various kinds of product guarantees, 
or grants various kinds of product warranties, which are entered into 
for the error-free functioning of a sold product or service rendered 
over a defined period of time."
"In order to confirm or reassess future 
guarantee, warranty and goodwill expenses, continuously updated 
information on the nature and volume and the remedying of faults that 
have occurred is recorded and analysed at the level of the business 
unit, model series, damage key and sales year."
"Significant uncertainty for the calculation of the provision arises with 
regard to the number of cases of damage occurring and the expenses 
required to rectify the damage."
"The risk for the consolidated financial 
statements is that the provision is not properly measured."
"These include primarily assumptions on 
expected susceptibility to and the course of damage, and in addition 
the monetary value of the damage per vehicle based on actual war-
ranty, guarantee and goodwill losses."
"Based on historical analyses, we 
assessed the accuracy of the forecasts of past warranty, guarantee 
and goodwill costs."
"We also checked that updated assessments of the 
future repair costs and procedures were taken into account."
"We 
obtained an understanding for the underlying numbers of vehicles 
through the actual unit sales."
"Our observations
The calculation methods and the assumptions made are proper."
"The risk for the consolidated financial statements
The Daimler Truck Group is exposed to a large number of damage 
claims in various countries in connection with EU antitrust proceed-
ings."
"Hereby truck customers raise damage claims from potentially 
excessive prices in connection with the involvement of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and other truck manufacturers in anti-competitive behav-
iour."
"In July 2016, the European Commission imposed a fine of EUR 
1.09 billion on Mercedes-Benz Group AG in this context, which was 
paid in full in 2016."
"The risk for the consolidated financial statements is that the recording 
of any future damage claims in connection with EU antitrust proceed-
ings against the Daimler Truck Group is not completely and properly 
measured."
"We furthermore obtained information from the attorneys and 
external advisors acting for the Daimler Truck Group and evaluated the 
underlying documents."
"The written assessment of the legal representatives was made avail-
able to us by the Company."
"As of the reporting date, evaluations of the 
assessment of the risks in connection with the antitrust proceedings 
against the Daimler Truck Group, which support the assessment of the 
risks by the legal representatives, were available from external attor-
neys."
"Finally, we evaluated the appropriateness of the description of the 
aforementioned legal proceedings in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Our observations
The discretionary assessments and assumptions of the legal represen-
tatives are proper."
"Other information
The legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are responsible 
for the other information."
"The other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual 
report."
"The other information does not comprise the consolidated 
financial statements, the audited disclosures in the combined manage-
ment report and our related auditor’s report."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report do not cover the other information, and 
consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assur-
ance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a 
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact."
We have nothing to report in this regard.
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal represen-
tatives are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as 
applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are 
responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of 
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to 
cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group`s finan-
cial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the combined management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud 
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic deci-
sions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial state-
ments and this combined management report."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepti-
cism throughout the audit."
"The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement or one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, inten-
tional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
controls."
"— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the 
legal representatives and the reasonableness of estimates made by 
the legal representatives and related disclosures."
"If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention 
in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements and in the combined management report or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going con-
cern."
"— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial 
information of the entities or business activities within the Group to 
express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on 
the group management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We remain solely 
responsible for our opinions."
"— Evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with 
the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] 
law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence, we evaluate, in 
particular, the significant assumptions used by the legal representa-
tives as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the 
proper derivation of the prospective information from these 
assumptions."
"We do not express a separate opinion on the prospec-
tive information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a 
substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially 
from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in inter-
nal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, 
we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period 
and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless laws or other legal regulations preclude 
public disclosure of the matter."
"Our responsibil-
ity in accordance therewith is further described below."
"Our audit firm 
applies the IDW Quality Management Standard: Requirements for Qual-
ity Management in the Auditing Practice (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of pre-
paring the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process."
"Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional 
non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 paragraph 1 
HGB."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the assurance work."
"— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assur-
ance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance proce-
dures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
 
purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of 
these controls."
"whether 
the file made available containing the ESEF documents meets the 
requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as 
amended as at the reporting date, on the technical specification for 
this electronic file."
"— Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering 
with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial state-
ments and the audited combined management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit  
Regulation
We were elected as group auditor at the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting 
held on June 21, 2023."
"We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on 
June 24, 2023."
"We have been the group auditor of Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG without interruption since the financial year 2021."
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are 
consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant 
to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (longform audit report)."
"Other matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report
Our auditor´s report must always be read together with the audited 
consolidated financial statements and the audited group management 
report as well as the examined ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance 
opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the 
examined ESEF documents made available in electronic form."
"German Public Auditor Responsible for the 
Engagement
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Marcus 
Rohrbach."
"Furthermore, management is 
responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary to 
enable the preparation of a non-financial statement of the Group that 
is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (manipula-
tion of the non-financial statement of the Group) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereun-
der contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable 
interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet 
been published in every case."
"Therefore, management has disclosed 
their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated 
Acts adopted thereunder in section “EU-Taxonomy” of the non-finan-
cial statement of the Group."
"They are responsible for the defensibility 
of this interpretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate 
legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the 
interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on 
the non-financial statement of the Group based on our assurance 
engagement."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with Interna-
tional Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): 
""Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information"" issued by the IAASB."
"The contents of the 
non-financial statement of the Group in the section “Sustainability at 
Daimler Truck” are marked with the following symbols: ▾▴."
"In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed are 
less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
accordingly, a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The 
selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional 
judgment of the assurance practitioner."
"Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may 
be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation 
and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to 
uncertainties."
"Restriction of Use / General Engagement Terms
This assurance report is solely addressed to the Supervisory Board of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG, Stuttgart."
"By reading and using the infor-
mation contained in this assurance report, each recipient confirms 
having taken note of provisions of the General Engagement Terms 
(including the limitation of our liability for negligence to EUR 4 million 
as stipulated in No."
"9) and accepts the validity of the attached General 
Engagement Terms with respect to us."
