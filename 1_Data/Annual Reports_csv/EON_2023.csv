             Energy Networks 
Our distribution networks are the backbone of the new 
energy world."
"We are gradually developing them into 
intelligent platforms that control complex energy and 
data flows and provide customers with new options for 
dealing with energy."
"Without distribution networks there 
can be no energy transition and no climate protection."
"The 
expansion, modernization, and operation of distribution 
networks support security of supply and ensure the most 
efficient use of green electricity."
"This makes our networks 
the foundation of livable cities, communities, and regions."
"Customer Solutions 
Our solutions help customers meet their personal energy 
needs and decarbonization goals."
"This includes energy 
sales, which offers a wide range of green electricity and 
green gas tariffs, as well as our solutions business, which 
provides innovative, sustainable, and digital products and 
services."
"Solar power systems, eMobility, energy storage, 
sensible energy control, and solutions for sector 
integration enable our customers to reduce their costs 
and emissions and also to increase their comfort and 
quality of life."
"This applies equally to residential 
customers and small businesses as well as large 
companies and municipalities."
"Europe’s energy system is becoming 
ever lower in CO2, more decentralized, 
and more digital."
"In short: more 
sustainable."
"Our two core businesses—energy networks 
and customer solutions—are playing a big role 
in making this happen."
"E.ON is one of Europe’s 
largest operators of energy networks and 
energy infrastructure and providers of 
innovative customer solutions."
"The 
contribution of our roughly 75,000 employees 
is therefore crucial to successfully propelling 
the energy transition in Europe."
"The three key elements of 
E.ON’s strategy—sustainability, digitalization, and growth—are the centerpiece of our business model and deeply embedded in the way 
we think, work, and impact people’s lives."
This overview is guided by the International Integrated Reporting Council’s (“IIRC”) framework.

compared with €9.33 at year-end 2022."
"High inflation, prime interest rate hikes along with 
concerns about more interest rate increases, economic uncertainty, the ongoing war in 
Ukraine, and the escalation of the Middle East conflict had a significant impact on the 
performance of European and German stocks in 2023."
"Continuous Dividend Growth  
At the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting on May 16, 2024, the Management Board and 
Supervisory Board will propose paying out a cash dividend of €0.53 per share for the 2023 
financial year (prior year: €0.51)."
"Based on E.ON stock’s year-end 2023 closing price, the 
dividend yield is 4 percent."
"The payout ratio (as a percentage of adjusted net income) is 45 
percent."
"Our dividend policy aims to offer our shareholders attractive dividend growth of up 
to 5 percent annually."
3Based on ordinary shares outstanding at year-end.
"Investors in Germany hold about 42 percent of E.ON stock, those outside 
Germany about 58 percent."

"The current recommendations can be viewed at 
www.eon.com/en/analysts-estimates."
"Our mission is to provide prompt, precise, and relevant 
information at our periodic conferences and road shows     
worldwide—because maintaining regular communications and 
relationships is essential for good investor relations."
"The subsiding 
of the Covid-19 pandemic enabled us to carry out a significant part 
of our investor relations activities in 2022 in person."
"A hybrid 
approach of virtual and in-person activities has proven to be 
effective."
"This helps us communicate with capital markets 
efficiently and purposefully and meet our investors’ needs."
"Foresightful Funding, Stable Credit Rating 
Debt capital represents a very important financing source for the 
E.ON Group."
"That is why we focus on satisfying the demands of 
creditors as well as those of shareholders."
"During the year under 
review, the credit ratings of Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch 
remained stable, reflecting the confidence in E.ON’s 
creditworthiness and thus supporting its competitiveness for 
future financing activities."
"E.ON issued euro-denominated bonds totaling €3.3 billion in the 
2023 financial year and, at year-end 2023, had a solid funding 
situation that serves in part as prefinancing for the 2024 financial 
year."
"In addition, E.ON continually aims to maximize the diversity 
of its investor base to ensure that it has cost-optimized access to a 
variety of funding sources at all times."
"This periodically exploring 
opportunities for issuing bonds in other currencies."
"E.ON has a €10 billion Commercial Paper (“CP“) program and a 
US$10 billion CP program, under which it can issue short-term 
notes."
"Financial Framework for Sustainable Funding 
Sustainability aspects play an increasingly important role in many 
international investors’ decision for or against a particular 
investment."
"In 2021 E.ON became the first company to fully align 
its Green Bond Framework, under which it issues debt instruments 
whose issuance proceeds fund sustainable investment projects, 
not only with the ICMA Green Bond Principles but also with the EU 
Taxonomy."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation defines which economic 
activities are classified as environmentally sustainable, thereby 
setting a Europe-wide standard for sustainable investment."
"E.ON 
generally intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual 
financing requirements with green bonds."
"Green bonds accounted 
for about 75 percent of total bond financing of just under €2.5 
billion in 2023."
"We provide detailed information on the topic of 
financing in the Financial Situation chapter."

E.ON Integrated Annual Report 2023
The E.ON 
Management 
Board 
The Management Board manages the Company’s 
business, with all its members bearing joint 
responsibility."
"It determines E.ON’s corporate 
objectives, fundamental strategic course, 
corporate policy, and organizational setup."
"A lot has happened 
since then: the Covid pandemic, natural and climate disasters at many E.ON locations 
around Europe, the war in Ukraine and the attendant energy crisis, the uptick in interest 
rates, and Europe’s economic downturn."
"All of this has presented us with enormous 
challenges."
But none of it has altered our solid growth prospects.
"On the contrary, in 2023 
we again defied difficult circumstances."
"We again delivered strong earnings—€9.4 billion in 
Group adjusted EBITDA—that exceeded our expectations for the 2023 financial year."
"And 
we again recorded growth in our financial results and investments."
"Our growth strategy, 
which is propelled by the trend toward sustainability and the need for full digitalization, 
remains valid."
"Our billions of euros of investments in the energy transition enable us to 
provide what Europe needs now more than ever: new energy infrastructure for sustainable, 
secure, and affordable energy."
Renewables expansion is happening worldwide and in all types of locations.
"In France 
despite nuclear power."
In Poland despite hard coal.
"In Asia despite the simultaneous 
expansion of conventional generation."
"In southern states of the USA despite the fact that 
climate action is almost a dirty word there."
"Part one of the transition is therefore well 
advanced and continues to progress inexorably."
But part two is still almost at the beginning.
The transition is no longer just about big wind and solar farms.
"It’s about solutions for 
decarbonizing households and industry that, after the experiences of the energy crisis, are 
increasingly considered to be safeguards for a stable and affordable energy supply."
"It’s 
about electrifying transportation and heating and air conditioning systems for buildings."
"And all of this requires network connections and a global expansion and upgrade of existing 
networks."
"The IEA’s most recent World Energy Outlook predicts that global network 
infrastructure will need to be doubled."
We strategically aligned E.ON to precisely these needs.
"And we increasingly benefit from 
them."
"In the 2023 financial year, our two core segments—Energy Networks and Customer 
Solutions—grew in almost all of our European markets relative to the prior year."
"We’re 
investing even more and even faster in the energy transition."
"We’ll again massively expand 
our planned investments for 2024–2028 to a total of €42 billion compared with the €21 
billion we’d planned for the five years starting in 2021."
"After all, the network business in particular has 
metamorphized in recent years."
"It has become a growth business that’s increasingly 
attracting the attention of policymakers, the general public, and investors."
"For good reason: 
our networks are critical for the energy transition."
"The final weeks of the 2023 calendar year almost marked something of a turning point in 
this regard."
"First, the European Commission adopted a Grid Action Plan, thereby putting 
grid expansion at the top of its energy transition agenda—something that would have been 
unthinkable just a few years ago."
"Second, just before Christmas, European policymakers 
also agreed on a constructive reform of Europe’s electricity market design."
"All calls for more 
government intervention were met with a clear and correct message: the key to a 
sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy future is private investment."
"And in particular 
this means investments in network infrastructure and decarbonization solutions like those 
made by E.ON, one of Europe‘s leading companies in this area."
I consider this to be a great opportunity for our Group.
"And we want to seize it by making 
our leading role in the energy transition even more visible."
"In the interests of our customers, 
in the interests of our shareholders, and in the interests of society at large."
"This means that 
we’ll continue to invest to satisfy the rising demand for energy infrastructure."
"But it also 
means that we’ll lead the way where others hesitate—like in the promising area of network 
flexibility."
And it also means that in the future our corporate image will change.
"We’ve purposely not rebranded E.ON during the Group’s recent years of fundamental 
changes and restructuring."
"We think it’s time for our brand image to 
reflect our central role and our new self-confidence."
"And that’s why we on the Management 
Board have made the unanimous decision to align the E.ON brand with our future growth 
and our leadership ambitions in the energy world."
"These days, the public is getting to know E.ON in a new guise and with clear ambitions that 
go far beyond marketing."
"We’re showing who we want to be: the playmaker of Europe’s 
energy transition."
And we’ll do what a playmaker does: shape the game.
"Best wishes, 
Leo Birnbaum

"The 
Group’s core business is divided into two segments: Energy 
Networks and Customer Solutions."
"Corporate functions, equity 
interests managed directly by E.ON SE, and non-strategic 
operations are reported under Corporate Functions/Other."
"Corporate Functions 
Corporate Functions’ main task is to lead the E.ON Group."
"This 
involves charting E.ON’s strategic course and managing and 
funding its existing business portfolio."
"The E.ON Group’s non-strategic 
activities, such as the operation of nuclear power stations until 
April 15, 2023, and their dismantling (managed by the 
PreussenElektra unit) and the generation business in Turkey are 
reported here as well."
"Energy Networks  
This segment consists of E.ON’s power and gas distribution 
networks and related activities."
"It is subdivided into three regional 
markets: Germany, Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey 
(which consists of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Poland, 
Croatia, Slovakia, and the stake in Enerjisa Enerji in Turkey, which 
is accounted for using the equity method)."
"Customer Solutions 
This segment serves as the platform for working with E.ON’s 
customers to actively shape Europe’s energy transition."
"This 
includes supplying customers in Europe (excluding Turkey) with 
power, gas, and heat, and providing them with solutions that 
enhance their energy efficiency, energy autonomy, and eMobility."
"E.ON’s activities are tailored to the individual needs of customers 
across all categories: residential, small and medium-sized 
enterprises, large commercial and industrial, sales partners, and 
public entities."
"The E.ON Group’s main presence in this business is 
in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Nordics (for 
example, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), Italy, the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania, Poland, and Slovakia."
"In 
addition, Energy Infrastructure Solutions engages in activities 
aimed at decarbonizing commercial customers, cities, and 
communities, such as sustainable city solutions and district 
heating."
"Significant Changes to the Business Model Effective 
January 1, 2024  
Some of the Energy Network segment's regional markets were 
reclassified effective January 1, 2024."
"East-Central 
Europe/Turkey is now divided into East-Central Europe (which 
includes the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland) and 
Southeastern Europe (which includes Hungary, Croatia, Romania, 
and our stake in Enerjisa Enerji in Turkey, which is accounted for 
using the equity method)."
"In addition, the Customer Solutions segment was renamed Energy 
Retail."
"Furthermore, the Energy Infrastructure Solutions (""EIS"") 
was transferred from Energy Retail and has been an independent 
segment since January 1, 2024."
"We thus now report on its 
activities separately."
"Furthermore, the E.ON Group's central commodity procurement 
unit, E.ON Energy Markets, is reported at Energy Retail effective 
January 1, 2024."
"It was part of Corporate Functions/Other until 
December 31, 2023."
"ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement    
ESG Materiality 
GRI 3-1, GRI 3-2 
E.ON has conducted an annual materiality analysis since 2006."
"The purpose is to identify and evaluate the sustainability topics 
that are most important to the Company and its stakeholders."
"This 
report contains information on the topics that the materiality 
analysis deemed to be particularly significant."
"It also partially 
addresses less material sustainability topics."
"E.ON thus aims to 
meet the different expectations of stakeholders as well as the 
requirements of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) 
rankings and ratings."
"We provide an overview of the material and 
other topics in the Non-Financial Statement (“NFS”) Index."
"Identification of Material Topics 
In 2023 E.ON conducted a materiality analysis in accordance with 
the requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive 
(“NFRD”)."
"The requirements of the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) were taken into account, but not 
applied."
"We applied the double materiality principle: we considered 
the financial perspective as well as the impact perspective."
"The 
process had four steps, which are described below: 
Step One: Topic Identification and Collection 
E.ON first gathered information and evidence on potentially 
material topics."
"We consulted a variety of sources, including 
regulations, reporting standards as well as statements from 
customers, competitors, investors, and non-governmental 
organizations (“NGOs”)."
"We used this to create an overview of 
possible material topics."
"These were then compared with our 
existing material topics and collated."
"The basis for this was an 
evaluation that correlates a topic’s frequency of mention to its 
importance for the industry."
"Experts from Sustainability, Group 
Accounting, and Investor Relations divisions reviewed and finally 
agreed on a short list of E.ON’s potentially material topics."
"We gave them a questionnaire containing the topics identified in 
step one and asked them to rate them."
"The questionnaire’s 
findings were then examined in greater depth in stakeholder 
interviews."
"Representatives from the Sustainability, Group 
Accounting, Investor Relations, and Group Risk functions 
evaluated the survey’s findings in a workshop, which concluded 
the impact analysis."
"Step Three: Financial Perspective 
E.ON evaluated the financial perspective by examining the risks 
and opportunities associated with the ESG topics contained in its 
Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) system."
"Another workshop, 
consisting of the same participants, was then held to assess and 
validate the financial materiality of the topics identified."
"Step Four: Materiality Threshold 
E.ON finalized the list of topics by defining a common materiality 
threshold for the impact and financial perspectives."
"Only topics 
that exceeded it were considered material."
"To determine them, we 
held a third workshop consisting of the above-mentioned 
participants."
"The findings were then presented to the 
Sustainability Council, which approved E.ON’s materiality analysis 
for 2023."
The council is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer.
"He reports periodically to the E.ON Management Board on 
progress made."
"Material Topics 
E.ON’s sustainability reporting for the 2023 reporting year must 
for the last time reflect NFRD requirements."
"We therefore did not 
conduct a comprehensive update of our sustainability analysis 
pursuant to NFRD requirements."
"Instead, we conducted a Group-
wide materiality analysis oriented toward the European 
Sustainability Reporting Standards 2 (“ESRS 2”) in order to prepare 
for our first reporting pursuant to the Corporate Sustainability 
Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) for the 2024 reporting year."
"We 
integrated the approval of the update of our sustainability analysis 
pursuant to NFRD requirements from 2022 and assessed the prior 
year’s findings to ensure they are up to date."
"Our CEO Leonard 
Birnbaum and our CFO Marc Spieker performed the final 
validation."
"The findings of our NFRD materiality analysis for 2023, which are 
listed below, reaffirm the findings of the analysis from the prior 
year."
"Since both 
aspects—general climate-change mitigation and customer 
solutions that mitigate climate change—are extensive, they are 
presented in separate chapters in the Integrated Annual Report 
2023."
"The ESG chapters of this report provide information on E.ON’s 
approach to managing its material topics and outline the 
Company’s progress in the reporting year."
"The description of the 
management approach is based on GRI 3-3, Management of 
material topics."
"Stakeholder Engagement 
GRI 2-28, GRI 2-29 
E.ON continually seeks dialogue with its various stakeholders."
"We 
want to listen to and understand their points of view and also to 
talk to them openly about the potential short- and long-term 
impacts of our business activities."
"This is an important objective of 
our daily work at the local, national, and European level."
"A 
stakeholder is any person who or any group that has an interest in 
a company."
"Stakeholder engagement is thus a core process of 
E.ON’s corporate governance."
"The dialogue formats we choose 
vary by stakeholder and topic."
"They range from information 
campaigns and discussion forums with associations and NGOs to 
face-to-face discussions and lobbying."
"For example, E.ON is 
actively involved in the global investor initiative CDP (Carbon 
Disclosure Project), works with the United Nations Environment 
Programme (“UNEP”), and supports the UN Decade on Ecosystem 
Restoration."
"Furthermore, since 2021 E.ON has been part of the 
LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest 
Finance), which is committed to biodiversity and the protection of 
tropical forests."
"More information on CDP and the LEAF Coalition 
can be found in the “Climate Protection” chapter."
"E.ON is also a 
member of SolarPower Europe, a European association of energy 
suppliers and solar companies."
"The Solar Stewardship Initiative 
(“SSI”) was set up as part of this association."
"Its aim is to create 
more transparency for solar-power supply chains and to ensure 
compliance with human rights."
"E.ON actively participates in policy debates on issues that affect 
the Company."
"We use a variety of channels for this, including 
lobbying, media interviews with our executives, and their 
appearances as public speakers."
"In addition, policymakers and 
regulators frequently invite E.ON to provide its technical and 
energy expertise as part of their decision-making processes."
"The 
Company offers its expertise proactively as well."
"This type of 
advocacy is important because the energy sector is significantly 
influenced by policy and regulatory decisions."
"Energy policy 
discussions in Brussels and Berlin focused on a future market 
design for the electricity market and the necessary expansion of 
infrastructure."
"Furthermore, E.ON takes part in discussions on 
energy, environmental, and climate policy in a variety of other 
forums."
"For example, Leonhard Birnbaum is part of the European 
CEO Alliance, an alliance of EU-wide business leaders who discuss 
ways to provide additional support to the EU Green Deal."
"Eurelectric is an umbrella 
organization representing more than 3,500 European companies 
active in electricity generation, distribution, and supply."
"Direct 
members of Eurelectric are the national associations, including the 
German Association of the Energy and Water Industries (German 
abbreviation: “BDEW”), Swedenergy, and Energy UK."
"› The Climate Advocacy and Associations Report provides an 
overview of E.ON’s lobbying approach as well as the associations 
and initiatives which the Company is part of and the key positions 
it holds in conjunction with its efforts to propel the energy 
transition."
"All of E.ON’s lobbying activities and dialogue formats 
comply with national and European laws and guidelines on 
representing corporate interests and responsible lobbying."
"‹  
Below is an overview of E.ON’s most important stakeholders, their 
significance for E.ON, and their expectations of E.ON."
"They 
enable companies to share information about climate protection, 
customer needs, and industry trends, and to represent shared 
interests to policymakers and regulators."
"Examples of these 
memberships include:  
• German Association of Energy and Water Industries (German 
abbreviation: “BDEW”): through the BDEW E.ON is also 
represented in two European trade associations, Eurelectric and 
Eurogas."
"• Federation of Germany Industries (German abbreviation: “BDI”): 
E.ON is engaged in the BDI through its membership in the 
Association of the German Interconnected Grid Systems 
Economy (German abbreviation: “VdV”)."
"E.ON also supports the 
BDI through the Association for the Promotion of Germany 
Industry."
"BDI is a member of BusinessEurope, a European 
umbrella organization."
"• German Industry Initiative for Energy Efficiency (Deutsche 
Unternehmensinitiative Energieeffizienz, or “DENEFF”): a multi-
industry network of companies and organizations dedicated to 
enhancing energy efficiency."
"• Bitkom: through this industry initiative for a digital economy the 
Company is also represented in the Federal Association of 
German Industry (Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie) and 
its European umbrella organization, BusinessEurope."
"• E.ON executives take part in the Economic Council of the CDU 
e.V."
and the Economic Forum of the SPD e.V.
"• European Distribution System Operators for Smart Grids 
(“EDSO for Smart Grids”): European association promoting 
smart grids and the digitalization of the energy sector."
"• Energy UK: a trade association for energy in the United 
Kingdom."
"• Swedenergy: a private association of companies involved in 
electricity production, sale, and trading in Sweden."
"Stakeholder Dialogue on Safe Post-Operations and Plant 
Dismantling  
E.ON subsidiary PreussenElektra is responsible for the safe post-
operation and dismantling of its nuclear power plants (“NPPs”)."
Ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is essential.
"PreussenElektra 
communicates with a broad spectrum of stakeholders through 
press releases and briefings."
"The Company also uses events and 
forums to speak directly with its stakeholders and benefit from 
their feedback."
"The aim of all these measures is to provide 
transparent information and build trust."
Dialogue remains important during NPPs’ dismantling as well.
"In 
2023 PreussenElektra held press events at nearly all its NPPs."
"Annual power plant talks with key local stakeholders took place in 
the fall as well."
"Some plants also have dialogue groups for nearby 
residents, in which PreussenElektra also participated in 2023."
"People who live near Brokdorf, Isar, and Grafenrheinfeld NPPs and 
other stakeholders were given the opportunity to visit the plants 
on selected dates."
"Strategy 
2023: Markets Calm Down, E.ON’s Strategy Remains Right 
on Course 
Overall, the situation on energy markets in 2023 improved 
compared with the severe turbulence of 2022."
"At E.ON, we 
perceive this in all our regions."
"The tensions are still noticeable, 
however, and our prudent planning reflects this."
"E.ON mastered 
last year’s challenges by consistently implementing our strategy 
focusing on sustainability, digitalization, and growth—because this 
strategy has proven to be robust even in times of crisis."
"Our 
strategy to be and remain the green energy transition company in 
Europe therefore remains right on course."
"We are the playmaker of 
Europe’s energy transition and made significant progress in 2023."
"The energy crisis in 2022 accelerated the energy transition by 
putting the need for sustainable energy systems into even sharper 
focus."
"The energy transition is therefore not only an urgently 
necessary response to climate change, but also an opportunity for 
Europe and Germany to simultaneously remain competitive and 
resilient and thus pursue a sustainable path out of the energy 
crisis."
"The policy decisions of Germany’s Easter package of 
renewables legislation show that the emphasis on energy security 
and energy autonomy—along with the resilient and digital energy 
infrastructure it requires—has become even more important."
"E.ON 
is one of Europe‘s largest operators of electricity and gas 
networks, and the growth strategy we launched in 2021 therefore 
puts us right on track to continue propelling and ensuring supply 
security and multisector decarbonization."
"The crisis has also made 
us realize that we must always think about sustainability, supply 
security, and energy affordability together and that the maxim of 
E.ON‘s actions must be to achieve a balance between these three 
requirements."
Germany is part of Europe‘s energy market.
"The shutdown of 
Germany‘s last nuclear power plants in April 2023 and its plan to 
phase out coal by 2030 make this fact increasingly important."
"Ensuring supply security and energy affordability can only be 
achieved by expanding renewables faster."
"Renewables expansion, 
in turn, promotes sustainability, but can only succeed if it is 
accompanied by significantly more and faster network expansion."
We are also at a turning point.
"The energy transition is now 
primarily a heating transition, which already directly affects every 
individual or will do so in the future."
"For example, 2023 was 
already characterized by a strong desire among customers for 
more autonomy and sustainability."
"One of the upshots of this was 
high demand for heat pumps."
"The heating transition was thus 
already readily apparent in 2023."
"We are underlining the importance of this turning point by making, 
from 2024 onward, our decentralized infrastructure solutions 
business, Energy Infrastructure Solutions (“EIS”), a strategic 
business unit alongside our two existing segments, Energy 
Networks and Customer Solutions/Energy Retail."
"› Without the requisite expansion and digitalization of networks, 
the energy transition will fail."
"It is technically feasible, but the 
question is at what price."
"Investments in networks can only be 
made in a reliable and economically attractive regulatory 
environment."
"Less bureaucracy and more innovation are 
necessary, too."
"‹  
At Energy Networks, 2023 was primarily characterized by organic 
growth and the consistent implementation of our strategy."
"Ongoing renewables expansion led to a further increase in demand 
to connect these facilities to networks and to expand network 
capacity."
"Investments in the 2023 financial year went mainly 
toward network expansion and infrastructure modernization and 
digitalization."
"A significant proportion of Europe’s renewables 
capacity is connected to the E.ON Group’s grids; indeed, the one 
millionth renewables facility was connected to E.ON’s network in 
Germany in October 2023."
"These networks are not only the 
backbone of the green energy transition—which E.ON’s 
considerable investments continue to propel—but also one of the 
most critical pieces of social infrastructure."
"It is clear that the 
energy transition will not be possible without the underlying 
network infrastructure."
"The successful implementation of our growth strategy which 
emphasizes our promise to provide secure and affordable energy 
was also reflected at Customer Solutions in 2023."
"Our dynamic 
management of prices, customer churn, and our portfolio made a 
significant contribution to stabilization after the crisis."
"Our focus 
was always on supply security, affordability, and a sustainable 
energy supply."
"Wherever it was economically feasible, E.ON 
always passed lower market prices through to households and 
reduced end-customer prices after the significant increases that 
resulted from the crisis in 2022."
"Overall, this too demonstrates that the strategic course we set—
measured by the high demand for intelligent solutions and 
products for decarbonizing households and industry—remains 
stable and will become increasingly important in the future."
"► E.ON’s wide range of products and services enables our 
customers and partners to displace over 100 million metric tons of 
CO2 annually."
"◄ 
The primary feature of 2023 at our Energy Infrastructure 
Solutions (“EIS”) business was the obtaining of new contracts that 
will enable us to offer our customers additional decarbonization 
solutions in the future."
"› At our partner Imerys in Belgium, for example, we installed a 
generating unit that runs entirely on industrial synthesis gases that 
result from Imerys’s production processes."
"The unit can supply not 
only Imerys’s production facility but also 40,000 households in the 
region with electricity year-round."
"In Poland we signed a contract 
to develop a project to generate energy from waste heat."
"These 
two projects alone will result in annual carbon savings of 81,000 
metric tons per year."
"These kinds of assets are still lighthouse 
projects, but we want to make them the standard."
"Among other 
things, they make a significant contribution to the competitiveness 
and decarbonization of Europe’s economy."
"We therefore made 
tangible year-on-year progress, not only in further developing this 
business and growing E.ON, but also in delivering on E.ON’s 
ambitions to make Europe’s energy system more sustainable."
"‹ 
Demand for our sustainable energy solutions is likewise continuing 
to rise."
"Not only did our Future Energy Home business record 
growth by offering decarbonization solutions for households, 
primarily in newly tapped markets."
"Our eMobility business 
continued to expand by means of a Europe-wide strategic 
partnership with BMW for home charging as well as our 
acquisition of startup elvah."
"Elvah’s app is designed to make it 
easier to find available, reliable, and affordable charging stations 
and also helps us better utilize our charging network."
"Alongside our existing partnerships with Berlin and Malmö, in 
2023 we forged our first strategic energy partnership in England 
with the city of Coventry—the headquarters of E.ON UK plc—to 
jointly develop and propel decarbonization as well as social 
projects."
"The pace of our digitalization, which is a key success driver, is swift 
as well."
We are digitalizing across E.ON.
"We defined technological 
standards for the entire E.ON Group in order to harmonize our IT 
landscape."
"Our common technology platform is designed to ensure 
our IT landscape’s efficiency and reliability while maintaining a 
high degree of flexibility by means of a modular setup centered on 
an application-programming interface (“API”)."
"This includes a 
continued focus on a clear cloud strategy."
"Using the cloud enables 
us to achieve greater stability and shorter recovery times, while at 
the same time enhancing the flexibility of our workloads’ 
performance."
"E.ON has migrated more than 95 percent of 
applications from its data centers to the cloud, and we are already 
seeing that the cloud makes our data landscape more stable and 
secure."
"It forms the basis for the modernization of our business 
processes and simplifies and accelerates the development of new 
digital services for the energy transition."
"The digitalization of our 
Group provides us with greater efficiency, higher security, and 
more flexibility for swifter scaling."
"In a dynamic market 
environment like ours, digitalization can give us a significant 
competitive advantage."
"In addition, we are committed to providing 
our entire workforce with adequate training and development."
"We 
rolled out a new digital learning platform that provides all our 
employees with the skills they need to propel the digitalization of 
our business processes and products according to their individual 
requirements."
"In 2023 E.ON also reassigned its central innovation activities to its 
digital division."
"The new organizational setup reflects E.ON’s 
conviction that digital innovations in particular—like Elna, a smart 
meter service we launched in Sweden, and Evercharge, a solution 
for preventing charging point outages—are key value drivers in the 
energy transition."
"These are all important steps on the path to a sustainable 
transformation of the energy system."
"It is a long-term task and 
requires political support and appropriate framework conditions."
"It 
is becoming increasingly clear that the energy transition has 
reached one of its larger challenges: the heating transition."
"This 
will require considerable investments in networks and a 
fundamental reconfiguration of the entire infrastructure."
"Being an 
active partner to around 6,000 municipalities in Germany positions 
E.ON well to successfully support and implement municipal heat 
planning and Germany’s Building Energy Act."
"E.ON laid the foundation stone for the energy transition in the 
heating sector by creating a digital heat map for municipalities and 
citizens, which we officially presented to the Federal Minister for 
Housing, Urban Development, and Construction in November 
2023."
"The use of hydrogen as a substitute for coal, gas, and oil in 
industry will continue to play an important role in the 
transformation of the energy system."
"Extensive investment in 
energy infrastructure is necessary here, too."
"All of this offers us 
new opportunities and again reaffirms E.ON’s strategic course."
"“Making new energy work” 
We are the playmaker of change in the energy industry."
"Leading 
the way for innovative, sustainable, digital-first solutions that 
transforming the way Europe is powered for all."
This clear purpose send an unmistakeable message.
"It indicates—
as our mission statement already implies—that we will continue to 
emphatically implement our established strategy whose three key 
elements are sustainability, digitalization, and growth."
"Sustainability 
E.ON’s strategy fits seamlessly with the European Union’s 
decarbonization agenda."
"Europe’s distribution networks—E.ON’s 
biggest business—are where the energy transition is happening."
"The investments necessary to upgrade, expand, and digitalize 
these networks through 2030 are estimated at over €425 billion."
"The European Commission’s desire to accelerate this expansion 
will be an additional driver."
"Climate protection will be one of the key drivers of E.ON’s future 
growth."
"The Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) validated 
E.ON’s climate targets in May 2022."
"They are consistent with 
keeping global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels."
"In 
addition, E.ON pledges for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions to achieve 
climate neutrality by 2040 (and to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
roughly 75 percent by 2030)."
"E.ON intends for its Scope 3 
emissions to be climate-neutral by 2050 (and to reduce them by 
about 50 percent by 2030)."
All reductions are relative to 2019.
"These objectives set a course that is both ambitious and viable: a 
reduction path consistently aligned with the new energy world and 
E.ON‘s strategy."
"In addition, E.ON voluntarily offsets a portion of 
the emissions it is currently unable to avoid."
"Offsets help fund 
measures that prevent or remove carbon emissions outside our 
value chain."
"All offsets are currently not factored into E.ON’s 
climate targets, but rather are made at the product level."
"E.ON’s 
most important offsetting program is the partnership it has had 
since 2021 with the LEAF Coalition, which stands for Lowering 
Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance."
"LEAF offsets help 
protect tropical forests and manage them sustainably."
"E.ON’s 
LEAF program will initially run through year-end 2027."
"ESG aspects are systematically embedded into E.ON’s central 
control and management processes."
"In addition, each business 
unit’s management team is responsible for taking action to 
enhance sustainability and to meet the unit’s sustainability targets."
"This decentralized approach enables the units to contribute to 
E.ON’s Group-wide targets for issues like climate protection and 
corporate governance, while also tailoring their actions to their 
specific needs."
"Each unit has sustainability staff who reinforce 
awareness, coordinate projects and initiatives, and monitor 
progress toward targets."
"They share information at regular 
intervals with our Sustainability Council and the E.ON Group’s 
Sustainability team."
"Digitalization 
Digitalization will be a cornerstone of the energy landscape of the 
future."
"The transition toward an interconnected, volatile, and 
networked energy world is being accompanied by increasing 
complexity that can only be managed through comprehensive 
digitalization."
"Digitalization is thus an important lever in E.ON’s 
growth strategy and the basis for generating additional value in its 
core business over the long term."
"E.ON’s objective is to become 
one of the leading digital energy companies and to fundamentally 
transform its products, processes, and services into data-driven 
and highly interconnected solutions."
"Our digital transformation is 
proceeding along four strategic pathways: optimizing internal 
operations, engaging customers and partners, transforming and 
developing new business areas, and enhancing employees’ digital 
skills."
"The centerpiece of our digital transformation is a common 
technology platform (“CTP“) for the entire Group."
"The CTP will 
serve as the basis for standardizing and harmonizing all 
applications in the E.ON Group necessary for the energy transition 
now and in the future."
"It will enable us to develop new digital 
energy solutions while maintaining the highest security standards."
"The foundation of E.ON One has enabled the E.ON Group to pursue 
the objective of offering and operating innovative digital energy 
solutions for the external market and for E.ON Group companies."
"E.ON One’s portfolio is formed by targeted investments in E.ON’s 
own innovations and in startups."
"E.ON One focuses on three business areas: grid 
management, grid operations, and energy management solutions."
These areas form the basis of a successful energy transition.
"E.ON 
One offers a wide range of energy management solutions that give 
customers more transparency about their consumption and that 
aims to optimize consumption and generation."
"Energy Networks’ top priorities include standardization, 
smartification, and the development of new digital solutions‚ all 
with the highest cybersecurity standards."
"Digitalization helps E.ON 
operate its networks even more efficiently and optimally manage 
the growing proportion of power from renewable generating 
facilities."
"The development of digital solutions like smart eMobility 
charging solutions as well as new services in front of and behind 
standard residential meters and smart meters are also part of 
E.ON’s growth strategy."
"Growth  
E.ON’s core business consists of two segments: Energy Networks 
and Customer Solutions."
"E.ON operates power and gas networks 
in various regions of Europe and offers a broad range of customer 
solutions."
"The two businesses complement each other amid the 
transformation of global energy systems."
"They are also clear 
growth businesses that benefit from the sustainable 
transformation of various customers and industrial sectors."
"As a 
result, E.ON’s business opportunities are expanding as well."
"According to the most 
recent statements by the German Federal Network Agency, about 
€150 billion of investments will be required for distribution 
networks in Germany alone."
"E.ON’s distribution networks alone 
will connect several million new renewables facilities over this 
time period."
"In addition, the growth in the aggregate energy 
demand of E.ON’s customer groups is estimated to increase by 
more than 100 percent between 2020 and 2050."
"A sustainable 
transformation of the economy is necessary for this as well."
"E.ON 
is aiming for earnings growth in both the Energy Networks and 
Customer Solutions segments, supported by continual efficiency 
improvements."
"The focus is primarily on achieving operational 
excellence."
"We are likewise aware that our growth strategy will 
only be successful if it is accompanied by changes within our 
organization, such as cultural change, diversity, and education."
"Growth in the Energy Networks Segment  
The transition to a new, sustainable, and interconnected energy 
world will require considerable investments in physical and digital 
assets."
"As stated above, this applies above all to the Energy 
Networks segment, whose Networks are the platform for a 
successful energy transition."
"Ongoing renewables expansion in 
particular will require grids to grow at a similar pace."
"New network 
connections and connected load will increase sharply amid the 
energy transition owing to changes in customer behaviour."
"The 
energy transition alone therefore represents an unprecedented 
growth opportunity for E.ON, an opportunity that is being further 
accelerated by the current developments in Europe’s energy 
system."
"Consequently, this growth will be accompanied by a 
suitable and sensible digitalization of networks because they are a 
key component of E.ON’s growth strategy and a prerequisite for 
the implementation of the energy and climate transition in 
distribution networks."
"The use of smart-grid technology (such as 
smart energy meters and smart transformer stations), the 
integration of external data, and the standardization of 
construction and operating processes will make it possible to 
realize considerable potential."
"Where necessary for technical 
reasons and economically feasible, E.ON will acquire the capability 
to monitor and control its distribution networks across all voltage 
levels in order to optimize their operation."
"Sensors and smart 
metering and control technology will enable real-time control of 
distributed generation and consumption."
"The energy and heat transitions will alter the role of gas networks 
as well."
"E.ON is already working on plans, such as making gas 
network infrastructure hydrogen-ready."
"E.ON will therefore, 
where legally possible and economically sensible, make its existing 
gas networks hydrogen-ready."
"These investments will help pave 
the way toward climate-neutral gas networks."
"This is among the reasons why E.ON is one of Europe’s leading 
distribution system operators."
"E.ON has a regulated asset base 
(“RAB”) of €42 billion, and its regulated business generates a large 
share of its EBITDA."
"E.ON’s strategic objective is therefore to 
remain Europe’s leading energy and infrastructure partner."
"A large 
portion of investments during the 2024–2028 planning period will 
again go toward network expansion and a variety of network 
projects."
"The Forecast Report contains details about planned 
investments."
"This is a 
scalable business model with comparatively low capital 
requirements and focuses on private households and small and 
medium-sized enterprises."
"So 
that this objective can be achieved at competitive costs, E.ON 
systematically pursues digitalization‚ which promotes optimal 
operational efficiency, superior customer satisfaction and loyalty 
(customer relationship management), and cross-selling 
opportunities."
"In addition, E.ON focuses primarily on offering 
distributed energy systems for households, such as the self-
generation of green solar power, energy storage, heat, and 
eMobility solutions."
"The European Commission’s solar strategy for 
the EU, which includes the target of doubling Europe’s solar power 
capacity by 2025, remains an additional growth driver."
"The eMobility market continues to undergo change 
and is characterized by strong growth: policymakers want at least 
15 million electric vehicles to be registered in Germany by 2030."
"The time for rapid growth activities is now, because all attractive 
locations for the charging infrastructure necessary for this 
objective will presumably have been allocated in the years ahead."
"Our objective is to enlarge our current market position and become 
one of Europe’s leading operators of charging infrastructure by 
2030."
"► In 2023 E.ON sold 23,923 charging points for residential and 
business customers in many European countries."
"◄ 
EIS’s activities encompass innovative energy solutions that aim to 
help cities, municipalities, and industrial customers achieve their 
climate targets cost-effectively."
"E.ON aims for its EIS business unit 
to achieve additional growth and become the preferred 
transformation partner for sustainable, innovative energy 
solutions."
"EIS’s core business consists of a portfolio of solutions for 
decentral power, heat, and cooling plants as well as solutions for 
energy efficiency and decarbonization along with other energy 
services."
"E.ON sees green hydrogen in particular as a key strategic 
growth opportunity over the medium term, and founded E.ON 
Hydrogen GmbH to meet rising demand for green gases in the 
future."
"Hydrogen will play an essential role in the climate-neutral 
energy system of the future."
"E.ON plans to develop a national and 
international hydrogen business."
"Our international footprint in 
Europe gives us optimal local conditions for future hydrogen 
clusters, for example in the North Sea region."
"Selected 
partnerships for developing this business include, for example, 
French energy company EDF, Everwind Fuels, Tesla, and 
Fortescue Future Industries."
"E.ON is thus well positioned to propel the energy transition and 
satisfy the increasing demand for sustainable solutions."
"All 
business units benefit from robust growth in the demand for green 
power and gas across all sectors (households, transportation, 
buildings, and industry)."
"Commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
› The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“SDGs”) of 
its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provide a blueprint 
for a better and more sustainable future."
"Adopted in 2015, the 17 
SDGs and 169 subgoals address a wide range of global challenges."
We recognize the SDGs’ importance.
"Our Management Board 
underscored this support by issuing a self-commitment to the 
SDGs in June 2018."
"E.ON’s core business activities enable it to 
play a considerable role in fostering the SDGs 7 (Affordable and 
Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), and 13 
(Climate Action)."
"All of E.ON’s other contributions to the UN SDGs 
can be found in the SDG Index."

"Innovation 
Innovations: Pioneering New Solutions En Route to Climate 
Neutrality 
At E.ON, we focus on innovations to develop new solutions en 
route to climate neutrality."
"They help us quickly and reliably design 
safe, user-friendly digital products, processes, and systems for our 
Energy Networks and Customer Solutions segments as well as the 
E.ON organization."
"Our Innovation division focuses on developing new customer 
solutions and deploying new technologies while assessing the 
opportunities and possibilities as well as the risks associated with 
the use of modern technology."
"The public and scientific-
technological debate about artificial intelligence (“AI”) and 
generative AI or Gen AI has led E.ON, too, to take a close look at 
their opportunities and risks."
"For example, E.ON is testing various 
Gen AI solutions for integrated knowledge and information flows, 
information on strategic trends, improved operational planning, 
the design and implementation of business processes, and for the 
creation of value for customers and employees."
"Collaboration in Global Networks and Partnerships 
Accelerates Innovations 
E.ON has worked in recent years to establish Group-wide 
structures and processes for in-house collaboration and 
partnerships to develop innovations."
"E.ON is convinced that new 
business models that are significant for its future business can be 
developed better, more easily, and faster in collaboration with 
universities and other scientific institutions as well as various 
partners and networks of a global innovation ecosystem."
"In 2023 
this integrated partnership approach enabled E.ON to extend its 
position in the implementation of energy transition projects as well 
as in innovation."
"EGI 
is also responsible for our partnerships with universities, such as 
the Energy Research Center, a joint venture between E.ON and 
RWTH Aachen University, and our partnership with the 
Bits&Watts program at Stanford University in California."
"• E.ON One GmbH (see page 34) is a growth and sales platform 
for market-ready digital solutions."
"E.ON One acquires startups, 
integrates their digital solutions into E.ON’s system architecture 
to ensure their scalability and operational reliability, and markets 
them to distribution network and sales companies in and outside 
E.ON."
"These innovation engines and close collaboration with the business 
units’ innovation activities enable E.ON to ensure that it 
implements its innovation strategy effectively and efficiently."
"Energy Research: Foundation for Developing Climate-
neutral Innovations  
E.ON conducts extensive research activities to gain important 
insights into key strategic technologies and developments of the 
future."
"We focus on four topics: technology forecasts and 
analyses, the establishment and design of distributed sustainable 
energy systems, and the development of programs for 
comprehensive decarbonization and sustainable heat supply."
"In 2023 E.ON’s research and technology team again extended its 
international academic influence through a collaboration with 
Stanford University in California."
"Global Innovation Ecosystem Affords Access to New 
Technologies and Solutions 
In 2023 E.ON successively expanded its collaboration with global 
partners, whose networks yield innovation projects and the 
development of new business models."
"E.ON is thus pursuing its 
goal of drawing on a consistently well-filled innovation pipeline to 
continually deploy innovations in its operating business."
"Global Partner Network Helps Deploy Innovations across 
E.ON Group 
Since 2018, E.ON has worked with six other multinational energy 
utilities from Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia in Free 
Electrons, a global accelerator program."
"The aim is to jointly 
identify promising startup solutions that enable and accelerate the 
energy transition."
"E.ON held its successful Grid Startup Challenge innovation 
program for the fifth year running in 2023."
"All 18 E.ON network 
companies participated."
"The 2023 event again yielded six new 
pilot projects that help make network infrastructure more efficient, 
sustainable, and resilient."
"For example, international startups Qube 
and Aeromon support E.ON subsidiary Westenergie by providing 
autonomous, compact laser sensors for detecting methane leaks in 
gas distribution networks."
"Another startup, Neuron Soundware, 
supplies E.ON with an AI-based technology that uses acoustic 
signals to swiftly detect and analyze faults in substations."
"Seagrass: A New Concept for Trading Carbon Certificates 
Seagrass Limited, a new E.ON subsidiary founded in 2023, is 
tapping the potential of the voluntary carbon market to accelerate 
the transition to net-zero emissions and propel decarbonization 
globally."
One example is the Seagrass Carbon Map.
"It shows the 
locations and projects that back carbon certificates."
"Seagrass also 
increases transparency in the carbon certificate market by 
providing additional information—such as satellite images, land 
use, and biomass data—on the projects’ locations."
"A prototype of 
the Seagrass Carbon Map was presented at COP28, the UN 
Climate Change Conference in Dubai."
"Seagrass holds a financial services permission, which allows it to 
act as an intermediary on the carbon certificate market and bring 
together the market’s supply and demand sides."
"Seagrass 
cooperates with an established exchange (ACX) to process carbon 
certificate purchases and sales."
"Central Innovation Projects and Scale Hubs: Two 
Successful, Mutually Beneficial Approaches to Innovation 
E.ON’s central innovation projects are initiated in response to 
specific challenges and requests from its units."
"The central 
Innovation division alone managed 117 innovation projects in 
2023."
"It also launched 76 new projects and handed 40 over to our 
units to be integrated into the operating business."
"The innovation 
projects handed over in 2023 alone currently promise an 
estimated €230 million in sales growth over the next five years."
"An example of these innovations is an pilot project for dynamic 
pricing for public electric-vehicle charging that E.ON is currently 
conducting in Copenhagen."
"The Industry Innovations team is 
running another project called Zero.ON, which aims to help small 
and medium-sized enterprises record and quantify their carbon 
emissions."
"The 
purpose is to identify new business ideas and develop them further 
with the aim of scaling up the most promising projects."
"We call 
these business initiatives scale hubs."
"The Adeje Verde (“Green 
Adeje”) and Evercharge projects are two such initiatives."
"Adeje 
Verde (Adeje, Tenerife) aims to make solar energy available to an 
entire energy community consisting of almost 200 households."
"Surplus solar energy is no longer simply fed into the network, but 
shared with neighbors within a 2-kilometer radius of the Adeje’s 
solar farm."
"Evercharge helps E.ON expand its existing charging infrastructure 
while also lowering costs."
"Evercharge uses AI-based software that 
detects faults in the system before they are noticed by users or 
vehicles can no longer be charged."
"This predictive maintenance 
can shorten service times and reduce costs."
"Management Control System 
Our big objective is for E.ON to be the sustainable platform for 
Europe’s energy transition."
"In line with our guiding principle 
“Making new energy work,” E.ON wants to be the driving force for 
change in the energy industry."
"The long-term and sustainable 
increase in shareholder value remains the focus of our strategy, 
which is geared toward sustainability, digitalization, and growth."
"A uniform Group-wide planning and controlling system is used for 
the value-based management of the Group as a whole and its 
individual businesses."
"This system forms the basis for a uniform 
mindset Group-wide, while at the same time allowing targeted 
steering impulses for individual business units."
"E.ON’s Management System  
Effective as of the 2022 financial year, adjusted EBITDA, 
investments, and earnings per share based on adjusted net income 
(“EPS“) have been the most significant indicators for managing our 
aspired growth."
"The use of additional key financial and non-
financial performance indicators is intended to ensure that our 
growth is in line with the various interests of our stakeholders and 
enable a holistic view of our performance."
"In particular, we focus 
on our customers, employees, shareholders, and bondholders‚ 
always in line with our environmental, social, and governmental 
responsibility as a leading international energy company."
"Including 
key non-financial indicators explicitly anchors sustainability 
indicators in particular in the ongoing management of our 
businesses."
"The following chart summarizes the key performance indicators 
used for management purposes."
"In addition to the management system, the compensation system 
for the Management Board is also designed to support the 
implementation of our strategy and thus the long-term success of 
E.ON through the sustainable, long-term, and value-oriented 
management of the Group."
"For this reason, the compensation of 
the members of the Management Board has also been linked to 
the development of selected key performance indicators."
"The new 
Management Board compensation system has been in place since 
January 2022."
"Adjusted EBITDA is an earnings figure before interest income, 
income taxes, depreciation and amortization that has been 
adjusted to exclude non-operating effects."
"The adjustments 
include net book gains, certain restructuring expenses, the mark-
to-market valuation of derivatives, and other non-operating 
earnings."
"Therefore, adjusted EBITDA is the indicator of 
sustainable earnings capacity and the appropriate key figure for 
determining the performance of our business."
"Investments are equal to investments in property, plant, and 
equipment, intangible assets, and share investments shown in the 
E.ON Group’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows."
"Investments are the engine for the future growth and digitalization 
of E.ON’s business as well as decarbonization."
"As a reflection of 
our strategy, they therefore continue to be a key indicator for 
managing our activities."
"Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) is equal to adjusted net 
income divided by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding in the financial year."
"This allows a 
holistic assessment of the earnings situation from the perspective 
of the shareholders of E.ON SE."
"Significant Key Performance Indicators 
In order to suitably take into account the interests of our 
stakeholders in addition to our focus on growth, our management 
system also includes other significant key performance indicators."
"As a customer-oriented company, the ability to acquire new 
customers and retain existing ones is crucial to our success."
"Net 
Promoter Score (“NPS”) measures customers’ willingness to 
recommend E.ON to a friend or colleague (the Customer 
Satisfaction chapter contains more information)."
"The 
attractiveness of our Company for investors is reflected in total 
shareholder return (“TSR”) and dividend per share (“DPS”), which is 
part of TSR.  
We have made sustainability the core of our corporate strategy."
"In 
everything we do, we keep in mind the consequences of our 
actions."
"In addition, our ESG ratings 
are incorporated into our management system."
"This provides a 
comprehensive assessment of our actions with respect to 
environmental, social, and governance matters."
"Solid financing of our business activities is of great importance to 
realize our aspired long-term and sustainable growth in line with 
the fulfillment of our financial ambitions."
"For this reason, cash-
conversion rate, which is an indicator of E.ON’s ability to transform 
operating earnings into cash inflows, and debt factor, which is a 
proxy for our capital structure and ratings, are significant key 
figures in our management system."
"In addition, ROCE is included in 
the management system as a key performance indicator to assess 
the efficiency of capital employed."
"Other Key Performance Indicators 
Alongside the performance indicators described above, other 
financial and non-financial indicators play a role in the success of 
our business and our corporate responsibility."
"Operating cash flow, 
power and gas wheeling volumes, sales volume, as well as 
selected employee-related information are examples of other key 
performance indicators."
"The use of fossil energy 
results in the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”)."
"Renewable 
and low-carbon energy generation along with efficient energy use 
play a key role in reducing emissions and thus limiting global 
warming."
"The current geopolitical challenges to securing Europe’s 
energy supply are not making this demanding task any easier."
"The 
transition to a low-carbon economy thus requires more joint 
efforts by all energy producers and consumers."
"This transition 
period poses a challenge to energy suppliers’ competitiveness."
"But 
it also offers an opportunity to expand their business."
"Many 
countries, communities, and companies are already focusing on 
climate-friendly energy generation and energy-efficiency 
measures to achieve their carbon-reduction targets."
"E.ON’s 
strategic focus on customer solutions for the efficient use of 
energy and smart energy networks fully aligns its business model 
with these global trends."
"E.ON’s Approach 
Distribution networks like E.ON’s are the platform of the energy 
transition: they integrate renewables, connect producers and 
consumers, and manage complex energy flows in line with 
demand."
"Our solutions help customers of all kinds use energy 
more efficiently, produce their own renewable or low-carbon 
energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint."
"In short, climate 
protection is an integral part of E.ON’s business model."
"Our 
business activities help combat climate change, improve people’s 
lives, and create a future worth living."
"For example, we support 
companies and communities in reducing their carbon emissions 
and expanding their eMobility charging infrastructure."
"E.ON wants to reduce the size of its environmental footprint as 
well."
"Since 2004, the Company has disclosed the annual carbon 
emissions from its power and heat generation and from other 
business activities not directly related to generation."
"These include 
upstream and downstream emissions associated with E.ON’s 
business activities."
"E.ON calculates emissions using the globally 
recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (“GHG Protocol”) issued by the World 
Resources Institute (“WRI”) and the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development (“WBCSD”)."
"The E.ON Management 
Board updated the Company’s climate targets in 2020."
"To achieve 
them, we have defined specific actions to reduce our emissions in 
all three scopes of the GHG Protocol (see “Goals and Performance 
Review” below)."
"We use the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) 
Accounting and Reporting Standard to compile our Scope 3 
emissions."
"In addition, E.ON has included the achievement of its 
climate targets (Scope 1 and 2) in the Management Board’s 
compensation system by means of the E.ON Sustainability Index."
"The purpose is to further embed ESG aspects like reducing carbon 
emissions into how E.ON runs its business."
"Guidelines and Policies 
In October 2021 E.ON revised its Health, Safety, Environment and 
Climate Protection Policy Statement."
"It clarifies that 
environmental and climate protection, just as occupational health 
and safety, are integral to E.ON’s business operations."
"E.ON 
considers environmental and climate protection important and 
integral management tasks."
"The policy statement obligates E.ON 
to consider environmental and climate protection in all business 
decisions."
"E.ON’s promise to use the best-possible technologies 
and procedures in its business processes will reduce its 
environmental impact and enhance its energy efficiency."
"In 
addition, it commits E.ON to comply with all health, safety, and 
environment (“HSE”) laws and regulations and defines the 
appropriate management systems for this (ISO 45001, ISO 14001, 
and ISO 50001)."
"In addition, in late 2021 E.ON adopted an Environmental 
Protection Guideline."
"Information about it can be found in the 
Environmental Management chapter."
"Two other HSE policies that are more specific in nature—the HSE 
Function Policy and the HSE People Guideline—took effect back at 
the beginning of 2018."
"The Function Policy defines HSE roles, 
responsibilities, management approaches and tools, and minimum 
requirements for the entire organization."
"It empowers the HSE 
division to monitor our units’ compliance with the obligation to 
have an environmental management system certified to ISO 
14001 or the Eco-Management Audit Scheme (“EMAS”)."
"In 
addition, the Function Policy defines HSE standards for incident 
management."
"It thus replaces and updates the standards 
stipulated in previous company policies."
"The HSE People Guideline 
goes into greater detail, underlining the importance of 
environmental and climate protection and defining specific tasks."
"Our Code of Conduct contains general HSE rules with which all 
employees must comply."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
The Group’s Sustainability department took the lead in developing 
the Group-wide climate targets."
"It also monitors progress toward 
them (see “Goals and Performance Review” below)."
"The units are 
supported in their decarbonization efforts by their HSE team and 
our wider HSE organization, which helps design energy-efficiency 
measures and shares ideas and best practices."
"This setup has 
enabled E.ON to make progress toward its company-wide 
reduction targets for direct and indirect emissions since the targets 
were adopted."
"E.ON has systematized the management of climate-related risks 
as well."
"In 2020 we further embedded climate-risk reporting into 
Group-wide risk management."
"More information can be found in 
the Risks and Chances Report."
"In addition, our reporting is guided 
by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)."
"In 2022 the Group Sustainability department was incorporated 
into the Strategy, Sustainability, and Innovation division in order to 
integrate sustainability and climate protection even more closely 
into the Group’s overall strategy."
"The principles of good corporate governance guide E.ON’s 
responsible and value-oriented management."
"The focus is on 
efficient collaboration between the Management Board and the 
Supervisory Board, transparent disclosures, and appropriate risk 
management."
"The clear organization of sustainability and climate 
activities ensures that everyone involved works together 
efficiently and that we continually improve our performance."
"Information about E.ON’s progress toward its climate targets is 
first presented to the Chief Sustainability Officer, who is also Chief 
Executive Officer, and the Sustainability Council."
"The Chief 
Sustainability Officer, who chairs the council, reports to the E.ON 
Management Board about the progress achieved on a regular 
basis."
The council met four times in 2023.
"Specific Actions 
E.ON has had an ESG Reporting Manual since 2021."
"The manual’s 
detailed descriptions and requirements instruct the units how to 
compile and report ESG key performance indicators (“KPIs”)."
"E.ON 
then used the manual’s climate-related KPIs to develop a Group-
wide carbon management plan that breaks down the Group-wide 
climate targets to the business units."
"Its purpose is to measure 
progress toward these targets separately for each of E.ON’s 
business units, factoring in the characteristics of their particular 
business, their strategic ambitions, and the climate policies of the 
country or countries where they operate."
"The plan reflects E.ON’s 
general management approach: the Group sets the strategic 
course and governance framework, while the units have broad 
operational decision-making authority."
"The carbon management 
plan took effect in the third quarter of 2022."
"CDP is one of the largest international associations of investors 
that independently assess the transparency and quality of 
companies’ climate reporting."
"E.ON has reported data on its carbon 
emissions to CDP since 2004."
"In 2023 CDP again gave E.ON an A 
rating for tackling climate change: this rating recognizes the 
Company’s leading role in climate protection."
"E.ON is therefore 
among the best 346 that in 2023 achieved an A rating out of 
nearly 21,000 that were assessed."
"According to CDP, E.ON’s 
demonstrable actions have made it one of the world’s leading 
companies in environmental ambition, action, and transparency."
"In 
addition, for the 2022 assessment period (published in 2023) CDP 
recognized E.ON once more as a Supplier Engagement Leader."
"Under E.ON’s holistic climate strategy, decarbonization measures 
follow a clear hierarchy: avoidance and reduction of emissions 
have the highest priority."
"E.ON primarily uses emissions 
certificates to offset those emissions that are currently 
unavoidable."
"All of E.ON’s offsets by means of certificates are 
completely voluntary and in addition to our climate targets."
"The Company funds measures to avoid or eliminate emissions 
outside its own value chain by means of offsets and corresponding 
emissions certificates."
"The associated projects are often located in 
developing and emerging countries."
"E.ON uses emissions 
certificates to offset emissions at the product level and does not 
factor the amounts offset into its own carbon footprint or the KPIs 
collected for its own climate targets."
"At the same time, we are aware that carbon offsets will play a role 
in reducing emissions in the long term."
"The process can be used to 
offset a small portion of remaining emissions."
"Voluntary carbon 
markets and the purchase of highly reputable certificates are 
becoming even more important."
"That is why E.ON developed a 
comprehensive strategy for offsetting carbon dioxide emissions 
from 2021 onward."
"LEAF, which stands 
for “Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance,” is the 
largest private-public initiative against the deforestation of tropical 
rainforests."
"Participants include the Norwegian, British, American, 
and South Korean governments and more than 20 companies."
"LEAF’s offset certificates aim to finance the protection of these 
forests and to support sustainable management approaches that 
closely involve policymakers and local stakeholders."
"In 2020 the E.ON Management Board therefore set 
new climate targets that are explained below."
"In parallel, the 
Company developed KPIs that are relevant for management 
control purposes; they are used, among other purposes, to 
calculate the long-term compensation for Management Board 
members."
"In May 2022 the Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”) confirmed 
that E.ON’s climate targets are consistent with the Paris 
Agreement’s 1.5°C target."
"This means that E.ON’s planned 
emissions reductions contribute to limiting global warming to 
1.5°C relative to preindustrial levels."
"To achieve this, we plan to 
reduce our Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by at least 50 percent by 
2030 relative to a 2019 baseline."
"On the one hand, E.ON intends, by reducing its own GHG 
emissions, to become climate-neutral by 2040; our reduction path 
for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions therefore foresees reducing these 
emissions by 75 percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2040."
"On 
the other hand, we aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50 
percent by 2030 and by 100 percent by 2050."
"Both reduction 
paths are relative to a 2019 baseline."
"Scope 3 emissions occur 
primarily during the generation of the power E.ON purchases and 
resells and during the use of the gas E.ON sells."
"They account for 
most of E.ON’s Group-wide carbon footprint."
"The adoption of our climate strategy initiated actions to help us 
achieve the aforementioned climate targets for 2030, 2040, and 
2050 and thus to support Europe’s energy transition."
"E.ON 
systematically monitors its progress toward these targets."
"It is 
important to remember that year-on-year comparisons of energy 
consumption can be affected by temporary fluctuations caused by 
weather patterns and other factors."
"A period of several years is 
necessary to determine whether E.ON’s actions are effective and 
where we stand with regard to our targets."
"Since 2016 we 
therefore assess the trend in more detail every three years."
"The 
trend indicated that so far the reduction rate is in line with the 
forecasts."
"Along with the adoption of the aforementioned carbon 
management plan in 2022 we refined this process by setting 
reduction rates for our individual business units as well."
"The units 
have to conduct controls on an annual basis so that we can see 
more exactly whether we are making progress along the 
prescribed path."
"In addition, each unit has the authority to pursue 
its own reduction targets that go beyond the target for E.ON as a 
whole."
CO2 is by far our biggest GHG.
"Other GHGs like SF6 and 
CH4 contribute to E.ON’s climate impact."
"But they account for a  
much smaller share of our GHG emissions than CO2."
"The Global 
Warming Potential (“GWP”) indicates how much GHGs affect 
global warming over a period of time compared with CO2."
"All GHG 
emissions can be expressed as CO2 equivalents (“CO2e”) and 
therefore be accounted together."
"The GHG Protocol defines three scopes (Scopes 1 to 3) for GHG 
accounting and reporting."
"This improves transparency and 
provides guidance for different types of climate policies and 
business objectives."
"They also include fugitive methane 
emissions from our gas distribution networks."
"Scope 2 are indirect GHG emissions from the generation of 
electricity that the Company purchases to power its buildings, 
operations, and electric vehicles or that is classified as network 
losses in its power distribution networks."
"These emissions do not 
physically occur at E.ON’s facilities but rather at the facility where 
the electricity is generated."
"This is why power distribution losses 
are classified as Scope 2 emissions but gas distribution losses as 
Scope 1 emissions."
"Emissions attributable to network losses are 
lower in grid segments with lots of renewables feed-in."
"In line with 
the GHG Protocol, we calculate Scope 2 emissions using a 
location-based method and a market-based method."
"For its own 
management decision-making, E.ON uses the figure determined 
by the location-based method, which is based on the respective 
national generation mix."
"The market-based method yields a 
different figure because it is based on the contractually 
attributable generation mix of the Company’s electricity suppliers."
"However, the effort required to identify every single provider that 
feeds electricity into each of E.ON’s networks would be 
considerable."
"We therefore use the emission factor of each 
country’s residual generation mix."
"In most cases, this factor is 
significantly higher than the factor of the national generation mix."
"Network losses accounted for approximately 3 percent of the 
power E.ON distributed in 2023."
"Scope 3 are indirect emissions that occur upstream and 
downstream along E.ON’s value chain."
"They result primarily from 
the generation of the electricity the Company purchases and 
resells to its customers and the use of the gas sold to them."
"Scope 3 also includes the emissions attributable to the production 
and use of the goods and services E.ON purchases."
"In line with the 
GHG Protocol, since 2020 we have divided our emissions from 
power and heat generation into emissions from “plants owned and 
operated” (Scope 1) and “plants owned but leased to and operated 
by lessee” (Scope 3) for increased transparency."
"Since E.ON removed large-scale fossil-fueled power generation 
from its generation portfolio, it has procured power mainly from 
wholesale markets where the source of generation is often not 
traceable or information about the source is not reliable."
"When 
primary data are unavailable or of insufficient quality, the GHG 
Protocol recommends calculating emissions by using secondary 
data, such as industry-average data or government statistics."
"We 
therefore calculate the Scope 3 emissions from the generation of 
this power by using the official national emission factors of the 
countries in which we purchase power resold to end-customers."
"Furthermore, we also use market-based methods to calculate the 
emissions of power resold to end-customers."
"The Company can 
actively influence this figure by selling green power."
"This figure is 
therefore relevant for management control purposes."
"Our direct and indirect CO2e emissions totaled 70.70 million 
metric tons in 2023; of these, 3 percent were direct Scope 1 
emissions, and 97 percent were indirect Scope 2 and 3 emissions."
"Scope 1 emissions decreased by 30 percent compared with the 
previous year, indirect emissions by around 20 percent."
"The 
emissions figures relevant for management control purposes were 
used for these calculations: location-based Scope 2 emissions and 
market-based Scope 3 emissions."
"They were thus significantly lower than the prior-
year figure of 2.88 million metric tons of CO2e."
"The decrease is
mainly attributable to the fact that our CH4 tool, whose rollout was
completed in 2023, gives us a more accurate method of 
calculating fugitive emissions in our gas distribution networks."
"This method’s adoption Group-wide ensures the comparability of 
fugitive CH4 emissions."
"Emissions from power and heat generation were primarily due to 
our distributed combined heat and power (“CHP”) plants."
"Our 
disclosure of Scope 1 emissions from power and heat generation 
at leased plants has been more transparent since 2020."
"We report 
emissions from downstream plants leased by us as Scope 3 
emissions."
"These are plants that we installed at customers’ 
premises and that they operate as lessees for their own needs."
"For 
heat, 61 percent of emissions come from owned generation plants 
and 39 percent from leased plants."
"For power, 38 percent of 
emissions come from owned power plants and 62 percent from 
leased plants."
"Fugitive emissions at E.ON consist predominantly of methane 
(CH4) from leaks in gas infrastructure as well as leaks of sulfur 
hexafluoride (SF6) and coolants used in energy distribution 
equipment."
"2In accordance with the GHG Protocol, emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from plants leased to, and 
operated by, customers (Scope 3)."
This improves our ability to manage our emissions and make progress toward our targets more transparent.
3The GHG Protocol and BEIS attribute no direct CO₂ emissions to energy generated at renewables facilities and nuclear power stations.
"4This figure does not include 2,292 metric kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions, in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
"5This figure does not include 2,177 metric kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions, in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
"6This figure does not include 2,876 metric kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions, in accordance with the GHG Protocol."
"7In 2023, we completed the groupwide introduction of the CH4 tool."
"The decrease in emissions is mainly due to the transition from the previous calculation methods to the now more accurate technical 
accounting method."
This now takes into account the actual fugitive emissions associated with our gas distribution networks.
"8In 2021, we began introducing our tool for calculating CH4 emissions, which takes into account the latest regulatory requirements and enables gas grid losses to be separated into different categories in 
order to improve data quality and transparency."
"In 2022, we rolled out the tool further across the group."
"The higher figure compared with the 
previous year resulted from the less green generation mix in our 
markets."
"We reduced power transmission and distribution losses 
and power procured externally for our own needs in absolute 
terms."
"E.ON’s investments to maintain its networks help reduce network 
losses as well."
E.ON’s approach depends on the type of loss.
Technical losses can be reduced through network optimization.
"For 
this purpose, we are upgrading our networks using smart-grid 
technology (more information can be found in the Security of 
Supply chapter)."
"This enables the lines and transformers to adapt—
in many cases automatically—to the actual production and 
consumption in a given grid segment."
"However, technical losses 
can only be reduced to a certain extent owing to the physical 
attributes of power grids."
"Alongside technical losses there are also 
commercial losses, which result primarily from theft."
2Based on the emission factors of the national electricity mixes for specific geographic regions (source: IEA).
3Based on the emission factors of the national residual mixes for specific geographic regions.
"A country’s residual mix emission factor represents the emissions and generation that remain after 
certificates, contracts, and supplier-specific factors have been claimed and removed from the calculation (source: EPA)."
4Power distribution losses in Sweden were almost completely offset by the purchase of green electricity.
"We recorded a significant 
reduction of over 10 percent year on year, mainly because of the 
electricity and gas we sell to end-customers."
"The factors again were portfolio streamlining as part of our B2B 
strategy, mild weather, and crisis-driven energy conservation."
"The 
market-based figure for power resold to end-customers declined 
even more—by more than 17 million tons of CO2e—relative to the 
prior year."
"One of the reasons is an increase in green power’s share 
of total power sold (the Sustainable Products and Services chapter 
contains more information about our green power products)."
"Furthermore, primary data from external travel service providers was used for the calculation."
2Scope 3 emissions from purchased electricity and the combustion of natural gas sold to end consumers (energy sold to our private and B2B customers) in accordance with the GHG Scope 3 Protocol.
"The 
emissions from the distribution losses of energy sold to distribution partners and the wholesale market are recorded accordingly under our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions."
3Includes the purchase of electricity at E.ON-owned and publicly accessible charging stations.
4Including capital goods.
"5From 2022, emissions were calculated using an updated method for calculating upstream effects."
"6In accordance with the GHG Protocol, emissions from electricity and heat generation are divided into emissions from facilities owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions from facilities leased to 
and operated by customers (Scope 3)."
This enables us to better manage our emissions and make progress towards our targets more transparent.
7This figure does not include 3.8 kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
8This figure does not include 3.5 kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
9This figure does not include 2.5 kilotons of CO2 from biogenic emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol.
10We estimate that approximately 40 percent of our employees have worked from home.
"11We estimate that, on average, half of our employees have worked from home due to Covid-19."
"12From 2023, emissions from hotel stays were considered and an updated method for calculation emissions from air travel was used."
13The figures for leased vehicles relate to 2020.
"14This figure includes compensation of around 780 tons of CO2, which has not been deducted from the stated value."
"15This figure includes compensation of around 451 tons of CO2, which has not been deducted from the stated value."
"16This figure includes compensation of around 98 tons of CO2, which has not been deducted from the stated value."
17Partly based on previous year's figures.
"The focus of environmental management, 
however, has shifted significantly over the past eight years."
"The 
transformation into the new E.ON—a specialist for infrastructure 
and customer solutions to decarbonize the energy world—
substantially changed E.ON’s asset portfolio and environmental 
footprint."
"E.ON operates distribution networks in various European 
countries."
"Environmental management therefore places particular 
emphasis on protecting and promoting natural habitats and the 
diversity of ecosystems and species in the vicinity of this network 
equipment."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON’s environmental management is guided by the precautionary 
principle endorsed by the United Nations, and E.ON has explicitly 
supported the UN Global Compact’s ten principles since 2005."
"In 
addition, E.ON is working to define its own environmental 
standards, such as ecological corridor management (see “Specific 
Actions” below for more information), in order to set a strategic 
course for the entire Group and to guide the units’ environmental 
protection activities."
"We developed an Environmental Protection Guideline in late 2021 
that describes E.ON’s holistic approach to environmental 
protection."
"It enables us to reduce 
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and thus also plays an 
important role in environmental management, which is a key 
component of E.ON’s operational health, safety, and 
environmental (“HSE”) management."
"Combining these topics 
underscores that E.ON is equally committed to protecting people 
and the environment."
"In addition, bringing together health and 
safety, environmental, and energy management in a joint HSE 
organization enables us to leverage synergies because the 
approaches and systems are fundamentally similar."
"E.ON only wants to do business with companies that share its 
commitment to environmental protection."
"Consequently, we strive 
for our suppliers and contractors to comply with our 
environmental standards, and our HSE Policy stipulates that they 
must have a certified environmental management system in place."
"› At year-end 2023, 85 percent of E.ON employees worked in 
business units that met this requirement."
"‹  
E.ON uses the environmental management system it has deployed 
(ISO 14001) to identify relevant environmental aspects and to 
evaluate the resulting opportunities and risks."
"The aim is for the 
Group to minimize and/or continually reduce its impact on the 
environment."
"Energy Management Systems (“EnMS”)  
ISO 50001 is an international standard whose purpose is to enable 
organizations to continually improve their energy efficiency."
"In accordance with the German Energy Services Act (German 
abbreviation: “EDL-G”), E.ON has also introduced ISO 50001 
certification in units that already have an HSE management 
system."
"› At year-end 2023, 73 percent of E.ON employees worked in 
business units with ISO 50001 certification."
"‹ 
E.ON measures and analyzes the energy use of facilities, vehicle 
fleets, and buildings at all of these units."
"The data help us identify 
opportunities for energy conservation and take cost-effective 
measures to improve energy efficiency."
"As part of the EnMS, the energy team of E.ON companies in 
Germany and other countries sets annual targets and conducts 
systematic audits to monitor the effectiveness of the measures 
taken to achieve them."
"It also conducts an annual management 
review, which is audited by an accredited certification 
organization."
"These mechanisms confirmed the EnMS’s 
effectiveness."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
The Group’s Sustainability department played a leading role in 
developing company-wide climate protection targets and has since 
then been monitoring progress toward them."
"E.ON’s units are 
responsible for taking steps to reduce their emissions, those 
caused by their business activities, and other environmental 
impacts."
"The Climate Protection chapter contains 
information on E.ON’s new carbon management plan."
"The E.ON Environmental Network (“EEN”) is a forum for sharing 
information about business-related environmental issues, 
environmental management, sustainability, and related law."
"The 
EEN brings together experts from the Energy Networks and 
Customer Solutions segments and the HSE and Sustainability 
teams."
"They work together closely in the EEN, which meets on a 
quarterly basis, usually virtually."
"Since the EEN was founded, its 
reach in the Group has extended continually."
"It addresses the 
requirements that our business units must meet as a result of the 
sites ordinance’s amendment and the new materials ordinance."
"E.ON also has an international EEN, which brings together E.ON 
colleagues outside Germany."
"Both forums met several times in 
2023."
"We intend to expand these networks in the years ahead and 
transform them into Group-wide information-sharing platforms."
"Specific Actions 
E.ON employees and managers are required to report 
environmental incidents."
"They use an IT application called PRISMA 
(Platform for Reporting on Incident and Sustainability 
Management and Audits) for this purpose (the Occupational 
Health and Safety chapter contains more information on PRISMA 
and E.ON’s incident management)."
"Energy Management  
E.ON has taken several steps to improve the energy efficiency of 
its facilities in Germany."
"Its heat supply companies implement 
measures to optimize their networks."
"Its gas and power network 
companies conduct measures to improve the energy efficiency of 
network equipment."
"Other steps include installing sensor-
controlled LED lighting in buildings and parking garages and 
reducing the energy consumption of ventilation and air-
conditioning systems."
"We also adjust the heat in our buildings to 
demand (the Energy Affordability chapter contains more 
information about energy conservation)."
"eMobility  
In 2017 E.ON began offering its employees in Germany incentives 
to embrace eMobility."
"They include discounted leasing contracts 
for electric vehicles (“EVs”), at-home charging points, and certified 
renewable power tariffs, which enable employees to charge their 
EVs with clean energy."
"E.ON’s Car Policy for the procurement of 
company cars and leased vehicles unambiguously supports the use 
of all-electric and hybrid vehicles."
"More information on our 
eMobility efforts can be found in the Sustainable Products and 
Services chapter."
"Environmental Impact Assessments  
For projects to build new power lines, gas pipelines, and other 
large industrial facilities with a foreseeable environmental impact, 
E.ON conducts an environmental impact assessment during the 
development phase to obtain construction and operating permits."
"We also frequently monitor a facility’s operation to verify that the 
initial assessment was correct."
"In addition, E.ON maintains an 
ongoing dialogue with local stakeholders and interested parties on 
numerous environmental issues."
"Biodiversity  
In 2022 E.ON analyzed the extent to which its business model 
impacts biodiversity."
"The analysis took into account the 
frameworks of the Science Based Targets Network (“SBTN”) and 
the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (“TNFD”)."
"The findings are divided into the dependencies of E.ON’s business 
activities on ecosystem services and these activities’ impacts on 
ecosystem services."
"E.ON’s highest dependency on ecosystem 
services is hydroelectricity."
"The most important ecosystem 
services for E.ON’s overall business are flood and storm protection."
"The production processes with the highest impact are energy from 
biomass, hydropower, and heat plants."
"We continue to view our 
powerline corridors as a significant lever for enhancing biodiversity 
and are using ecological corridor management to address it."
"E.ON wants to use the findings to develop additional measures to 
further promote biodiversity in its business."
"A follow-up project 
was launched for this purpose in 2023."
"It is analyzing what 
measures will enable E.ON to improve its impact on biodiversity."
"E.ON’s business units are already implementing local biodiversity 
measures."
"For example, LEW Wasserkraft, our hydropower 
subsidiary, places a great emphasis on sustainability and 
biodiversity and promotes them in a wide variety of projects."
"These include irrigating riparian forests, creating gravel spawning 
grounds, and fashioning semi-natural riverbank structures."
"E.ON also takes steps to protect wildlife and landscapes and to 
promote biodiversity."
"Bird safety, for example, is an important 
issue for many E.ON distribution system operators (“DSOs”)."
"Their 
activities in this area include installing nest platforms for storks, 
eagles, falcons, and other bird species."
"Many business units have 
also launched tree-planting projects."
"In addition, E.ON has set up a 
Group-wide digital platform for biodiversity and environmental 
protection projects to improve the visibility of the issue and the 
exchange of information about it."
"E.ON has developed an approach for ecological corridor 
management (“ECM”) and introduced it Group-wide in 2023 as a 
standard for vegetation management in all areas under and near 
110 kV high-voltage overhead power lines where ECM is 
potentially practicable."
"We intend to extend this approach to all of 
the Group’s DSOs in Europe by 2029."
"ECM enables E.ON to make 
a significant contribution to creating and maintaining permanently 
stable biotopes and structures and to promoting species 
protection, biodiversity, and the interlinking of valuable 
biospheres."
"ECM is already in place for an 
area the size of roughly 8,500 hectares."
"Through 2029, we plan to 
invest a figure in the double-digit million range and to implement 
ECM along the 13,000 kilometers of our high-voltage lines, which 
is roughly the area of around 100,000 soccer fields."
"ECM was 
applied to 12 percent of relevant areas in 2023 (previous year: 
8 percent)."
"Our ECM approach has been acknowledged outside 
E.ON as well and received the Renewables Grid Initiative’s (“RGI”) 
2023 Grid Award in the Environmental Protection category."
"RGI is 
an alliance of NGOs, transmission system operators, and distribution 
system operators from across Europe engaged in promoting the 
energy transition by means of fair, transparent, and sustainable 
grid development."
"The aim is to enable renewables growth to 
achieve full decarbonization in line with the Paris Agreement."
"Waste Management and Circular Economy 
E.ON periodically compiles environmental key performance 
indicators for waste."
"At the start of 2023 we began to catalog, in a 
structured way, our activities relating to a circular economy and to 
develop a circular economy strategy."
"CE.ON, our circular economy 
project, consists of a cross-discipline team of employees draw 
from the Strategy and Purchasing departments to determine this 
issue’s relevance for E.ON and design specific activities."
"Examples include the transformer and switchgear workshops at 
E.ON distribution system operators Westnetz and Bayernwerk."
"These workshops have been in operation for many years and will 
be an important element of the energy transition in the future."
"They refurbish large transformers and other components, thereby 
extending their service life and thus contributing to the 
achievement of various environmental targets."
"In 2024 E.ON plans 
to adopt a circular economy strategy, which will also cover waste 
issues."
"Goals and Performance Review 
The E.ON Management Board is informed about serious 
environmental incidents (category 3 in our Standard on Incident 
Management) by means of monthly reports from HSE and periodic 
consultations with the Senior Vice President for HSE."
"In the case of 
a major incident (category 4), the unit at which it occurred reports 
it directly to the E.ON Management Board member responsible for 
the respective unit and to Group HSE within 24 hours."
"Progress and Measures    
Energy Consumption within the Organization 
GRI 302-1 
E.ON consumed 49 million GJ of energy in 2023, 4 million GJ less 
than in the prior year (2022: 53 million GJ)."
"Savings Delivered by Emissions-reduction Projects 
E.ON regularly carries out projects to reduce its own GHG 
emissions."
"In 2023 these projects delivered over 18,000 metric 
tons of CO₂e savings."
"The measures to achieve them included 
upgrading the boilers in the plants of our district heating business, 
converting from natural to green gas, and reducing pipeline 
pressure in our gas networks prior to construction or maintenance 
in order to prevent fugitive methane emissions."
"Circular Economy, Waste Avoidance, and Recycling 
E.ON always tries to avoid creating waste and, when this is not 
feasible, to recover as much of it as possible."
"If neither avoidance 
nor recovery is possible, we ensure, in accordance with legal 
requirements, that waste is disposed of correctly and responsibly."
"E.ON’s operating business generates hazardous and non-
hazardous waste, as does the retirement of some assets, such as 
the dismantling of the Company’s nuclear power plants (“NPPs”) in 
Germany."
"There was an increase in 2023 that was attributable to an 
expansion of the companies reporting."
"The figures’ comparability is 
therefore limited."
"E.ON recycled 94 percent of its non-hazardous 
waste."

E.ON produced 205.4 metric kilotons of hazardous waste in 2023,

"The year-on-year rise 
was likewise caused by an expansion of the companies reporting, 
which limits the figures’ comparability."
"Of this, 83 percent was 
recycled."
2Prior year values have been adjusted.
"Fossil-fueled power plants emit nitric oxide (“NOX”), sulfur dioxide 
(“SO2”), and dust."
"This type of power generation is no longer a core 
E.ON business."
It is therefore no longer considered a core KPI.
"E.ON now focuses on small-scale, embedded generation units."
"NOX, SO2, and dust emissions result mainly from small gas-fired 
CHP plants and larger plants for district heating networks."
"The 
year-on-year rise in NOX and SO2 emissions is mainly attributable 
to an expansion of the companies reporting and to higher plant 
utilization."
"Responsible Water Management 
Water is a vital resource that is becoming increasingly scarce in 
some parts of the world."
"Many companies are therefore placing 
greater emphasis on identifying and managing water risks at their 
operations and along their supply chains."
"The same is true for 
investors and their portfolios."
"In addition, LEW operates a number of small and 
medium-sized run-of-river power plants in Germany with an 
installed capacity of 0.5 to 12 MW per plant, which only accounts 
for a small share of E.ON’s electricity generation."
"The water supply 
companies RWW and Avacon Wasser as well as LEW are part of 
E.ON's portfolio."
"Accordingly, this business involves the extraction of water as a 
resource and its treatment as well as final distribution to end-
users; it also includes the reuse of wastewater and thus the closing 
of the water cycle."
"Although water operations account for only a 
small proportion of the Group’s total sales, we pay particular 
attention to the associated consequences from the perspective of 
resource conservation and supply security."
"We use two KPIs to 
assess the water utility business’s risks: total withdrawal and 
distribution losses."
"Withdrawal is the amount of water supplied to 
end-users; that is, not water used in our own operations."
"The basis 
for a permanent supply of water is a climate with sufficient 
precipitation to allow surface and groundwater to reform."
"This can 
generally be anticipated in RWW’s and Avacon Wasser’s service 
regions."
"The regions’ available surface water and groundwater 
reserves will secure drinking and process water requirements."
"Based on available data, E.ON assesses the current, and the 
possibility of future, water scarcity in the relevant regions in which 
E.ON uses fresh water for its activities to be generally low."
"Additional disclosures on E.ON’s water withdrawal and risks areas 
can be found in the ESG Figures."
"The cessation of electricity 
generation at Isar 2 NPP in April 2023 means that E.ON no longer 
consumes cooling water to operate its facilities."
"For example, we 
are designing plans for smart water use in new residential areas 
and working on flood-protection systems in municipalities."
"Conducting research and development projects enables us to 
investigate innovative solutions for qualitative and quantitative 
water protection, such as additional potential resources for 
irrigation."
"In addition, RWW and Avacon Wasser provide information on the 
careful use of water as a resource."
"Important channels are the 
company websites and press releases."
"For example, during the 
summer months RWW gives its customers advice on the careful, 
appropriate use of fresh water."
"In addition, RWW has operated 
educational facilities—Aquarius and Haus Ruhrnatur—since 1992, 
in which visitors can learn about topics related to water supply and 
preventive water protection."
"Museum educators at the two 
educational facilities offer various lessons on water and 
environmental protection to schools in RWW’s service territory."

"Infrastructure leakage index (“ILI”) enables water utilities to 
measure and compare water losses."
"ILI is a KPI for assessing water 
losses that is widely used and recognized internationally."
"ILI 
factors in not only the amount of water loss, but also the relevant 
parameters (such as pipeline system length and pressure)."
"By international standards, E.ON’s ILI of less than 
1.5 puts it in the best leakage performance category of A (ILI ≤2)."
"Drinking water reduction targets in our water utility business have 
to do with reducing leakages at water utility facilities."
"Pursuant to 
Technical Annex 5.1 of the EU taxonomy, E.ON has set a target of 
reaching and consistently maintaining an ILI of less than 1.5 (very 
efficient performance, target figure of low leakage)."
"We intend to 
achieve this target by conducting targeted maintenance measures 
to minimize damage rates at water distribution facilities."
"In 
addition, continual network monitoring and water leakage 
analyses will make it possible to recognize damage at water 
distribution facilities early and to actively eliminate it."
"We measure 
the amount of water delivered to our customers by using 
metrologically highly efficient water meters and thus by 
minimizing metering errors."
"Water Management at PreussenElektra 
The NPP in Germany operated by our subsidiary PreussenElektra 
(”PEL”) accounted for a significant share of E.ON’s water 
consumption and used."
"Its NPPs use water for cooling and 
processes."
"PEL is committed to using water efficiently and 
sustainably and to maintaining high quality in the river from which 
its plants withdraw water."
It also strove continually to use less.
"PEL observes all laws and regulations regarding water withdrawal 
and discharge."
"The most important law for PEL in this context is 
the Federal Water Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz, or “WHG”)."
"PEL 
protects aquatic flora and fauna by using mechanical purification 
processes instead of biocides and by constantly monitoring the 
temperature of discharge water."
"PEL also expects its contractors 
to use water sparingly and has binding water management 
provisions in its agreements with them."
"PEL used freshwater, 
which came almost exclusively from rivers, primarily as cooling 
water."
"Water consumption dropped sharply compared with the 
previous year because significantly less cooling water was needed 
after the shutdown of Isar 2 NPP in April 2023."
"The withdrawal of 
water not used for cooling declined as well."
"This is related to the 
progress of dismantling at Unterweser, Brokdorf, and Grohnde 
NPPs."
"PEL returned 93.8 percent of withdrawn water to its 
source."
"Safe Handling of Radioactive Waste 
PEL is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and 
dismantling of its NPPs."
Both activities result in radioactive waste.
"E.ON is well aware of the high responsibility that is associated with 
both."
"E.ON aims to minimize the amount as well as the volume of 
radioactive waste."
"We do this in part by separating it from 
uncontaminated waste and by subjecting it to certain treatments 
that reduce its volume."
"Examples of LLW 
include protective clothing, cleaning equipment, tools, and 
building rubble from plant control areas."
"ILW includes, in 
particular, the reactor pressure vessel’s near-core mounting 
parts."
"Together, both waste categories contain less than 1 
percent of an NPP’s total radioactivity."
"• HLW contains more than 99 percent of an NPP’s total 
radioactivity and consists primarily of the fission products of 
uranium in the irradiated fuel assemblies."
"NPP operators are responsible for packaging LLW and ILW safely 
and according to approved standards."
"After regulatory 
certification, packaged LLW and ILW becomes the responsibility of 
the German federal government."
"The Law on the Reorganization of 
Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal transferred the 
responsibility for operating defined storage facilities for LLW and 
ILW."
"Pursuant to this law, the German federal government is 
responsible for the storage of PEL’s LLW and ILW effective 
January 1, 2020."
"This applies to the following PEL facilities: Stade 
NPP, Würgassen transport staging hall, Grafenrheinfeld staging 
hall, Unterweser radioactive waste storage facility, and 
Unterweser storage facility."
"The Konrad repository for LLW and 
ILW is currently being built by BGE, the German Federal Company 
for Radioactive Waste Disposal."
"BGE expects Konrad to be 
commissioned in 2029."
"All central tasks related to the handling and disposal of radioactive 
waste have been combined at PEL’s Nuclear Waste Management 
department since July 1, 2023."
"This optimizes the on-schedule 
and efficient coordination of all strategically important aspects of 
nuclear waste disposal at PEL’s fleet of NPPs undergoing 
dismantling."
"The head of Nuclear Waste Management reports 
directly to the PEL’s CEO."
"As with LLW and ILW, irradiated fuel assemblies are placed in 
approved transport and storage containers and stored in interim 
storage facilities at the NPPs."
"Under the Law on the 
Reorganization of Responsibility in Nuclear Waste Disposal, the 
interim storage facilities and containers of irradiated fuel 
assemblies became the property and responsibility of the German 
federal government effective January 1, 2019."
"Fuel assemblies 
will remain in the interim storage facilities until Germany has a 
state-owned receiving facility or repository for HLW."
"When this 
will happen is unclear."
"The responsibility for final disposal lies with 
the German federal government."

"As in 
the prior year, HLW amounted to 0 metric tons due to the 
decommissioning of NPPs."
"New fuel rods were installed in Isar 2 
NPP—which continued to operate temporarily until April 15, 
2023—for the last time in October 2021."

Greenhouse gas emissions cannot be limited only by the way 
energy is generated."
"Energy efficiency and other methods of 
reducing consumption as well as energy recovery can lower 
emissions, too."
"E.ON has a broad portfolio of such solutions, which 
it markets to residential customers and to industrial, commercial, 
and municipal customers."
"E.ON continually adjusts this portfolio to 
better meet its customers’ needs, respond to market changes, and 
utilize new technologies."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON offers distributed energy systems for households under the 
brand name Future Energy Home."
"Customers can use a variety of 
solutions: solar modules for generating their own energy and 
battery systems for storing it as well as charging stations for 
electric vehicles (“EVs”), heat pumps, and other heating solutions."
"The devices are connected to E.ON Home, an energy-management 
app; launched in 2018, it was available in six countries in the year 
under review."
"Regardless of where they are, customers can use the 
app to view their home’s energy output and consumption, control 
their devices, and reduce their energy use and carbon emissions."
"E.ON added new functions to the app in 2023, particularly for 
electromobility (“eMobility”)."
"The aim is to enable customers to 
conveniently and automatically charge their EV when energy is 
cheaper and greener."
"Other features that provide our customer 
with additional services for energy optimization and thus savings 
in smart charging and for improved use of stored solar power are 
planned for 2024 and are currently in the development and test 
phase."
"For digital energy-management solutions to function seamlessly, 
smart energy meters are essential."
"An EU Directive from 2021 
stipulates that, to the degree technically and financially feasible, all 
customers should have a smart energy meter."
"Member states 
must transpose this directive into national law."
"For example, 
Germany’s Act on the Digitalization of the Energy Transition, 
which was amended in 2023, specifies that all customers must be 
equipped with a smart energy meter by 2032."
"More information 
can be found below under “Goals and Performance Review.” 
Also, eMobility will play a significant role in the energy transition."
"Germany’s transport sector emitted around 148 million metric 
tons of CO₂ equivalents (“CO2e”) in 2021."
"The German Climate 
Protection Act, which was amended in 2021, calls for these 
emissions to be reduced to a maximum of 85 million metric tons of 
CO2e per year by 2030."
"To achieve this, passenger car and road 
freight transport must be climate-neutral and the range of 
alternative drivetrains and the infrastructure to supply them with 
energy must be massively expanded."
"One million publicly 
accessible charging points are to be installed in Germany alone by 
2030."
"In addition, there will be charging points in eCar drivers’ 
private and business environments and at the premises of EV fleet 
operators."
"E.ON’s objective is to use its experience in the energy 
sector to enable EV charging in public places, at work, and at 
home."
"E.ON offers comprehensive infrastructure solutions to make 
charging both economical and climate-friendly."
"Under its E.ON 
Drive brand, E.ON plans and installs charging stations and 
connects them to the power grid."
"E.ON is also responsible for 
supplying energy and operating the equipment."
"Our eMobility 
business continues to focus on three areas: E.ON Drive Solutions 
serves private and business users."
"Its focus is on offerings for 
charging at work, on the go, and at home, which include a variety 
of charging stations as well as related installation and energy 
services."
"In addition, E.ON Drive eTransport is engaged in charging 
solutions for the electrification of commercial vehicles."
"E.ON Drive 
Infrastructure is a charge point operator (“CPO”) and thus provides 
charging infrastructure in public places."
"Distributed, flexible, and connected supply systems are crucial for 
the future energy world."
"E.ON wants to propel their development 
with its Energy Infrastructure Solutions (“EIS”) business."
"This 
business develops energy units to supply cities and communities 
as well as commercial and industrial customers with sustainable 
heat (steam), cooling, and electricity."
"Its portfolio includes district 
heating and cooling, distributed solutions for city districts and 
industrial and commercial customers as well as products and 
services for greater energy efficiency."
"Some solutions are complemented by software-
based solutions and analytics that enable customers to reduce 
their energy consumption, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions by 
visualizing and optimizing their energy use."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
Our Chief Operating Officer–Commercial, who is a member of the 
E.ON Management Board, has overall responsibility for the entire 
customer business, including the Customer Solutions segment."
"E.ON Energy Infrastructure Solutions (“EIS”) and Business-to-
Customer (“B2C”) work with various E.ON business units on a wide 
range of topics, such as product development, plant operation, and 
sustainability management."
"Responsibility for this lies with the 
regional units for their respective market (including Western, 
Central, and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom, and 
Scandinavia)."
"E.ON’s distribution system operators (“DSOs”) across Europe, 
which are part of the Energy Networks segment, are responsible 
for installing smart energy meters in their service territories; the 
exception is the United Kingdom, where E.ON’s retail organization
provides them to its customers."
"German law created two roles for 
the provision of smart energy meters."
"The first role, the default 
metering provider, is responsible for the mass rollout of the 
standard smart energy meter mandated by German law."
"At E.ON, 
this role is performed by its DSOs."
"The second role, the 
competitive metering service provider, offers the standard smart 
energy meter as well as other metering solutions."
"At E.ON, this 
role is performed by its German retail sales unit."
"In addition, E.ON 
subsidiaries act as smart-meter service providers for municipal 
utilities and regional energy suppliers in Germany."
"Of E.ON’s three business units active in eMobility, E.ON Drive 
Solutions plays a Group-wide role as a competence center for 
effective and attractive charging solutions."
"E.ON Drive Solutions is 
represented across Europe, and its task areas include sales, 
operations, and IT management."
"Specific Actions 
E.ON Plus enables residential customers in Germany to bundle two 
or more energy contracts for power or gas and to benefit from 100 
percent green power at no extra charge."
"By meeting certain 
conditions, they can receive an annual discount of €60 per 
contract."
E.ON contracts throughout Germany are eligible.
"Moreover, customers can bundle their own contracts or participate
in E.ON Plus with family members, friends, or neighbors."
"As an eMobility provider (“EMP”), we give eCar drivers access to 
our charging network."
"This network also includes charging points 
from other providers that are available to E.ON customers as 
roaming options."
"In addition, we offer residential customers 
innovative charging stations and specific electricity tariffs."
"We 
supply our commercial customers with both regular and fast 
charging stations."
"Furthermore, we support them with solutions 
for EV fleet management."
"On the commercial vehicle side, E.ON Drive aims to capitalize on 
growth in the market segments of electric road haulage and public 
passenger transport as well."
"Battery-powered commercial vehicles 
are still the exception, especially in the heavy-duty category."
"Unlike the passenger car market, the transportation sector is only 
at the beginning of its evolution toward zero-emission mobility."
"But interest among companies and municipalities in electrifying 
their truck, bus, and van fleets is growing."
"Climate targets, 
increasing freight transport, and the growth trajectory of electric 
drives in local and long-distance public transport will pose greater 
challenges for charging infrastructure, land use, and grid 
connections as well."
"E.ON wants to help fleet operators meet 
these challenges by significantly expanding its portfolio of 
products and services for charging fleets of electric commercial 
vehicles."
"EIS pursues a partnership-based business approach in developing 
integrated solutions for heating, cooling, electricity, and mobility."
"These holistic concepts that integrate the individual sectors—for 
example, electricity from photovoltaic systems can be used to 
power heat pumps and eMobility charging infrastructure."
"E.ON 
enters into long-term partnerships, such as the energy partnership 
it concluded with Messe Berlin for a sustainable supply of heat and 
cooling."
"By 2025, EIS will convert the trade fair ground’s heat and 
cooling supply to climate-friendly technologies."
"Various heat 
sources will work together and thus yield significant energy, 
carbon, and cost savings and also ensure greater independence 
from individual energy sources."
"EIS customers increasingly link their sustainability targets to the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDGs”), 
especially SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 11 (Sustainable 
Cities and Communities), and 13 (Climate Action)."
"EIS formed 
partnerships with municipal, industrial, and real estate customers 
across Europe in 2023 to support them in achieving their 
sustainability targets."
"By assisting them with development 
projects that have long-lasting effects, we also aim to help 
safeguard their assets’ long-term value."
"E.ON continues to take part in research projects at universities and 
research institutions."
"The purpose is to develop the technologies, 
systems, and approaches that will make it possible to meet the 
needs of tomorrow’s energy world."
"Our flagship partnership is 
with the E.ON Energy Research Center at RWTH Aachen 
University."
"Its research has an interdisciplinary approach and 
focuses mainly on distributed generation, smart grids, and efficient
building technologies."
"Goals and Performance Review 
E.ON wants to offer its customers pioneering energy solutions for 
the energy world of today and tomorrow."
"We want our solutions 
to help them save money, use less energy where possible, and 
emit less carbon dioxide."
"E.ON has set a target for this: by 2030, 
the Company aims to reduce customers’ carbon dioxide emissions
by 50 percent relative to 2016 (you can find out more about 
E.ON’s climate targets in the Climate Protection chapter)."
"However, regulatory 
delays in the certification of the communication units, known as 
smart energy meter gateways, prevented DSOs in Germany from 
starting to gradually rollout smart energy metering systems until 
February 2020."
"Until the responsible federal authority withdrew 
the market declaration in May 2022, the rollout of smart energy 
metering systems in Germany proceeded according to plan."
"Since 
then, it has continued on a reduced scale."
"A renewed ramp-up 
required an amended law that took effect in mid-2023."
"The E.ON Drive Infrastructure team invests in, builds, and operates 
charging infrastructure at publicly accessible locations to support 
the development of a Europe-wide network."
"The impact that EIS’s projects in the industrial sector have on our 
customers’ sustainability can be measured by a variety of KPIs."
"These KPIs range from carbon-emissions savings to reductions in 
energy costs and consumption including reductions in final energy 
consumption (such as electricity) as well as primary energy usage 
(for example, fuel consumption to generate electricity or heat)."
"Due 
to country-specific standards and reporting obligations, however, 
these KPIs are not consistently consolidated Group-wide."
"Depending on the project and customer requirements, we also use 
a variety of KPIs to evaluate the effectiveness of EIS solutions for 
customers in the real estate and housing sector."
"These KPIs 
include primary energy consumption (such as the use of gas to 
generate heat), avoided emissions (typically CO2), and the 
deployment of renewable generation technologies (such as 
geothermal energy and heat pumps) in new property 
developments."
"Targets for these KPIs differ based on customer 
demands and market standards."
"Teams from our regional units 
monitor these EIS projects on a regular basis."
2The company VSEH operating in Slovakia was deconsolidated in the end of 2023.
"This 
encompasses ensuring our employees’ safety in the workplace, 
promoting their health, and also supporting their mental well-
being."
"Many employees perform high-risk work, such as on energy 
networks, gas pipelines, and other industrial facilities."
"Stringent 
safety standards are therefore of particular importance to E.ON, 
because employees’ health is E.ON’s top priority."
"E.ON’s Approach 
Health and safety (“H&S”) have long been firmly embedded in 
E.ON’s corporate culture and its organizational setup, policies, and 
procedures."
E.ON’s approach is proactive and preventive.
"We are unambiguously committed to the principle of zero 
tolerance of accidents."
"E.ON’s main objective is to prevent 
occupational accidents from the outset."
"This applies to E.ON 
employees as well as contractor employees who work on its 
behalf."
"E.ON’s ambition is to extensively promote employees’ well-being 
and enable them to maintain their performance and employability."
"In particular, we try to prevent those health conditions that most 
frequently result in incapacity for work."
"E.ON’s health 
management includes designing and providing health services 
(such as flu vaccinations) as well as target-group-specific 
individual measures to maintain health in the different phases of 
employees’ lives."
"It typically encompasses issues that are relevant 
for all employees or for certain target groups."
"Issues include 
general health maintenance, nutrition, exercise, mental health, 
stress management, and addiction prevention."
"E.ON promotes 
them by means of training sessions, information leaflets, 
presentations, and digital formats."
"Its use of the latter was again 
high due to hybrid work."
"Guidelines and Policies 
E.ON is committed to a culture of prevention."
"We reaffirmed this 
in 2009 by signing the Düsseldorf Statement on the Seoul 
Declaration on Safety and Health at Work as well as the 
Luxembourg Declaration on Workplace Health Promotion."
"E.ON has had a Group Company Agreement on Health for all 
employees in Germany since 2015; it was last revised in 2018."
"Its 
purpose is to foster a healthy work environment and promote the 
health of all employees."
"It defines four action areas: occupational 
health management, addiction prevention and intervention, 
occupational integration management, and employee counseling."
"The E.ON Health, Safety, Environment & Climate Protection Policy 
Statement, which was originally published in 2018, was updated 
in 2021 to reflect E.ON’s Vision Zero for safety targets as well as 
its climate and environmental targets in the context of the EU 
taxonomy."
"In addition, we simplified the document’s language and 
eliminated redundancies."
"A Group-wide standard for managing risks to health, safety, and 
the environment (“HSE”) has applied in the Company since the 
start of 2021."
"It defines the minimum requirements for identifying, 
analyzing, evaluating, managing, and monitoring HSE and other 
sustainability-related dangers and opportunities."
"The standards’ 
requirements are also supported by IT solutions, which are mainly 
used to create risk assessments and/or indices as well as activity-
related danger evaluations."
"Our employees have the opportunity to 
view danger evaluations relevant to them and the resulting 
protection measures."
"The Group HSE Function Policy defines HSE roles, responsibilities, 
management expectations, and reporting channels."
"It sets 
minimum requirements and defines management tools needed to 
prevent physical and mental harm in the workplace."
"› At year-end 2023, 83 percent of our employees worked at 
business units certified to ISO 45001."
"‹ 
E.ON refined the Group HSE Function Policy in 2022."
"For example, 
we added or sharpened the definition of tasks and task areas and 
formulations, in part to better integrate sustainability aspects 
Group-wide, including task areas such as the environment and 
biodiversity, sustainability reporting, and supply chain."
"In addition, the People Guideline on HSE communicates E.ON’s 
HSE aspirations and states the expectation that all employees 
embrace HSE on the job."
"It also describes E.ON’s Safety F1RST 
principles for the safety mindset and behaviors necessary to 
prevent accidents."
"The guideline contains extra tasks for managers 
because their responsibilities include leading by example with 
regard to HSE."
"The Group Standard for Incident Management, which applies to 
E.ON contractors as well, establishes consistent rules for 
classifying, investigating, analyzing, and reporting HSE incidents 
and for sharing information."
"It 
addresses occupational safety and accident prevention as well as 
the safety of E.ON’s technical facilities, products, and services over 
their entire life cycle, HSE in project management."
"The chapter 
entitled Data Protection, Cybersecurity, and Product Safety 
contains more information about product safety."
"E.ON developed 
an Expectations Maturity Assessment Tool (“EMAT”) to simplify 
implementation and assess the status of management systems 
and rolled it out in April 2023."
"The tool is a specification of the 
aforementioned Group Standard on HSE Management 
Expectations adopted in 2022."
"In addition, the HSE division works closely with the Human Rights 
Center of Expertise and Group Compliance with regard to 
Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act to monitor compliance 
with procurement policies and standards and to ensure adherence 
to E.ON’s minimum standards for HSE."
"This collaboration likewise 
resulted in additional HSE issues being embedded in procurement 
processes, such as dealing with smaller suppliers."
"Harmonized 
minimum HSE requirements for contractors now apply at all E.ON 
companies in Germany; these requirements may be supplemented 
by additional requirements depending on the services the 
companies procure."
"The implementation of a Group-wide standard 
for contractor management continues at E.ON companies and 
their processes for contractor management are being adjusted 
accordingly."
"This new standard defines minimum requirements 
and roles and responsibilities to ensure the consistent 
management and evaluation of HSE issues and risks in the 
collaboration with contractors."
"E.ON companies must integrate the 
requirements into their processes by May 2024."
"They are 
supported by a catalogue of contractor management measures, 
which also serves as an assessment tool for the implementation of 
the standard."
"More than 40 E.ON companies in Germany are now certified to 
ISO 45001 (occupational safety), ISO 14001 (environmental 
protection), and ISO 50001 (energy management) by means of a 
multisite process called E.ON Matrix Certification."
"Most of these 
companies are network companies and their subsidiaries, sales 
companies, and companies that offer integrated energy 
infrastructure solutions."
"This is another step to manage these 
companies in terms of occupational health and safety and 
environmental protection, to leverage synergies, and to harmonize 
processes."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON is committed to protecting people and the environment."
"Because the approaches and systems for both are similar, E.ON 
combines environmental management and occupational H&S 
management in a single HSE organization."
"The E.ON Management 
Board and the management of our units are responsible for E.ON’s 
HSE performance, which includes compliance as well as 
improvement."
"They set strategic targets and update policies to 
foster continuous improvement."
"They are supported and advised 
by the HSE department at Corporate Functions and the E.ON HSE 
Council."
"The council is composed of senior executives and 
employee representatives from different business areas and 
countries in which E.ON is active."
"It meets at least two times a 
year and is chaired by the member of the E.ON Management Board 
responsible for HSE."
"The second HSE Council meeting was 
rescheduled to January 2024 because of a change in division 
heads."
"E.ON units have their own HSE councils and expert teams 
as well."
"They define the HSE requirements for their unit and plans 
to implement them."
"Every unit must ensure that it meets E.ON’s 
corporate and HSE standards, design and implement HSE plans 
according to local needs, and follow E.ON’s HSE Strategy 
Roadmap for 2021–23."
"E.ON’s International Health Experts team intensified its 
collaboration to foster health-related improvements and 
innovations and thus its health strategy."
"Since 2022 the team has
again been sharing knowledge and experience between countries 
to identify and leverage collaboration synergies."
"Specific Actions 
The HSE department oversees strategic H&S training sessions."
"This includes the training provided to the E.ON Group’s top 100 
executives, programs for senior managers in the operating 
business, and training for staff who conduct incident 
investigations (such as root-cause analysis)."
"With regard to the 
Group HSE Strategy Roadmap, E.ON’s units conduct their own 
operational H&S training, programs to enhance HSE culture, and 
training required by law."
"E.ON managers in Germany can enroll in Healthy Leadership, a 
training module on how to address health issues and thereby 
promote health in their team."
"This training continued to be 
conducted digitally in 2023 and covered issues such as 
psychological security in teams, stress reduction, mental health, 
and tips for an ergonomic workplace."
"E.ON employees in Germany 
had free access to online ergonomics advisors, including for their 
home office."
"In addition, workshops for a common understanding of E.ON’s 
caring culture were held for the top 100 executives and senior 
managers from operations and administration."
"Furthermore, training formats for employees and managers were 
revised in 2023."
"The findings of extensive use analyses (the 
employee survey and in-depth interviews with senior 
management) were used to make target-group-specific 
adjustments."
"Training content given a sharper focus included psychological 
safety, communications, and appreciation."
"This was accompanied 
by an ambassador campaign in which selected top 100 
personalities describe what caring culture means for their area of 
responsibility."
"This includes a constructive culture of 
failure as well."
"We thoroughly investigate incidents by conducting 
root-cause analyses (“RCA”)."
"For this purpose, E.ON has 
introduced a specific Group standard and, in 2023, further 
expanded the related training and continuing skills development 
offerings."
"The training courses on offer cover topics such as 
investigation methods and communication."
"Lessons learned from 
incident investigations are shared throughout the Group and are 
incorporated into the units’ activities and into working groups."
"E.ON also uses the lessons learned to institute preventive 
measures."
"PRISMA, an integrated IT solution, is the main component of 
E.ON’s online incident management system and is used by all E.ON 
units."
"It enables us to reach many users, report and manage data, 
and ensure a high degree of transparency."
"Incident investigations 
are entered and stored directly in PRISMA, ensuring that all 
companies and Corporate Functions always work with the same 
database."
"Incident reporting is prompt, and the situation should be 
clear for everyone involved."
"All this is intended to help prevent 
incidents."
E.ON has five categories of incidents.
"They range from 0 
(low) to 4 (major)."
"E.ON’s HSE Standard on Incident Management 
requires the units to use PRISMA to report category 4 incidents to 
the HSE department at Corporate Functions within 24 hours; in 
addition, the units immediately forward the information to the 
Management Board."
"Employees must report all incidents, 
regardless of their severity, using PRISMA."
"No employee needs to 
fear any disadvantages."
"In addition, their personal data are always 
protected and can only be accessed by limited user groups."
"E.ON 
analyses all incidents."
"If employees or contractors who find 
themselves in a situation that they believe is potentially 
dangerous, they have clear instructions to suspend work 
immediately and, if necessary, leave the work area."
"They are also 
instructed to alert their colleagues to potentially dangerous 
situations."
"E.ON’s managers fulfil their responsibility as health and safety 
leaders in part by going on safety walks and engaging in dialogue 
with employees."
"During management visits, known as gemba 
walks, they can take a close look at workplaces, talk directly with 
employees, and deepen their understanding of HSE issues, 
including risks."
"The Group-wide HSE app (formerly “Go, See & 
Talk”), which can be downloaded on PRISMA, facilitates the 
process."
"Among other things, it contains questions for each type of 
work environment, including safety culture and workplace health 
issues."
"E.ON managers also use the app to submit answers they 
received, their own observations, and photos and documents."
"The 
information is automatically entered into PRISMA for additional 
analysis."
"Since 2022, near misses and unsafe conditions or 
behaviors can also be recorded in the app."
"More functions will 
follow as part of a program called Digitalization@HSE that was 
launched in the year under review."
"For example, the app’s 
functions for conducting safety walks will be simplified to better 
involve all employees."
"The overarching objective is to improve 
E.ON’s entire HSE performance."
"The HSE division has conducted 
quick checks since August 2021."
"They involve an outside partner 
evaluating E.ON’s safety culture and identifying possible risks."
"So 
far, 21 quick checks have been conducted at our operating units."
"E.ON runs an HSE Community that extends across all regions and 
segments."
"It helps us be a learning company and serves in 
particular to share knowledge and experience."
"The community 
meets regularly and, as needed, in special expert groups."
"Experts 
work together to achieve improvements in key areas like incident 
prevention."
"The units and Corporate Functions also work together on Connect, 
E.ON’s Group-wide social media platform."
"The form and content of 
HSE topics on the platform are continually expanded and updated."
"The additions in 2023 included an HSE live dashboard that 
displays HSE key performance indicators for the entire E.ON Group 
and updates them daily."
The dashboard went live in May.
"Employees and managers who have questions or concerns about 
their physical or mental health can contact the Employee 
Assistance Program (“EAP”)."
"The EAP is a free health-advisory and 
life-coaching service available in multiple languages to E.ON staff 
in Germany, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Czech 
Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary."
"We have similar programs in 
other countries where we operate."
"Alongside the EAP, E.ON offers 
employees and managers one-on-one psycho-social counseling."
"There are also supplementary functions and roles at E.ON, 
including social, addiction, and health counseling."
"Across the 
Company, these functions and roles are performed by employees 
alongside their regular duties."
"These employees are obliged to 
maintain confidentiality."
"E.ON employees can also take advantage of specific preventive 
measures (for example, nutrition counseling, and colon and skin 
cancer screening), consult company physicians, and take 
advantage of EAP benefits as well as use company fitness 
facilities."
"Goals and Performance Review 
The E.ON Management Board is informed about category 3 and 4 
incidents, developments relating to accidents, and related 
measures and programs by means of monthly reports from HSE 
and regular consultations with the Senior Vice President Group 
HSE."
"The units report fatal and life-threatening incidents directly 
to the Management Board within 24 hours."
"The purpose of E.ON’s incident analyses is to understand causes, 
take measures to prevent them, and identify risks."
"In addition, Group Audit 
may conduct an HSE audit at the unit."
"The findings of the incident investigations and HSE audits 
completed in 2023 show that HSE management systems are 
largely effective."
"The units have adopted the auditors’ resulting 
recommendations and have generally used them to design 
corrective and preventive actions."
"It also became clear, however, 
that employees’ safety awareness was not fully adequate in all 
teams."
"It therefore remains extremely important to continually 
point out to E.ON employees and contractor employees all the 
requirements of HSE management and their own responsibility: 
they must look after themselves and their colleagues and speak up 
immediately if they detect a potential safety risk."
"Overall, E.ON has 
observed for several years that occupational safety in its units is 
improving continually."
"We can clearly see that our measures to 
prevent serious occupational accidents are having an effect."
"One 
example is a discernable shift from serious incidents to less serious 
incidents."
"Furthermore, E.ON views audits—and the findings and 
recommendations they yield—as opportunities to foster 
continuous improvement."
"Health and safety concerns have always been a high priority for 
the E.ON Management Board."
"In 2020 E.ON adopted a new HSE 
strategy (“Roadmap 2021–23”), endorsed by the HSE Council, 
whose aim is to position E.ON as a leading HSE company."
"The 
strategy contains underlying targets for the operating units, 
including H&S, and their respective board members."
"In addition, 
the Management Board set personal H&S targets for top 
executives."
The targets for top executives and units are individual.
"Their purpose is to further reduce the frequency of serious 
incidents and fatalities (“SIF”) and thus to reach E.ON’s ultimate 
objective of zero major harm as soon as possible."
"The changes took 
effect on January 1, 2021."
"The primary focus in 2023 was on 
contractor management and digitalization."
"In addition, a review 
program called DSS Quick Checks was used to design additional (in 
some cases company-specific) measures to improve HSE 
processes that will be implemented beginning in 2024."
"Furthermore, stakeholders from E.ON’s operating business and 
HSE managers thoroughly discussed and analyzed the business’s 
challenges and drivers and the resulting key issues for the new 
health strategy for 2024–2026."
"These findings were drawn on to 
design the strategy, which the HSE Council approved at the end of 
2023 for implementation at the units and at Group HSE beginning 
in 2024."
"The extent to which E.ON’s health strategy is successful depends 
in part on whether employees receive information about health 
and prevention and whether this motivates them to participate in 
related programs."
"To increase willingness to participate, health 
programs are often tailored to the needs of specific target groups."
"E.ON’s network operators in Germany, for example, target their 
employees aged 50 and over in particular as well as employees in 
their field offices."
"Actions include workshops on healthy living in 
older age and preparing for retirement."
"There are also special 
offers, for example, for operational employees such as fitters and 
administrative staff."
"The return on investment (“ROI”) of many 
health programs is calculated by comparing costs with avoided 
absenteeism based on research and statistics."
"So that all 
employees feel comfortable, valued, and supported in their work 
environment, E.ON places particular emphasis on mental health."
"We provide information on the importance of stress management
and show how to recognize signs of mental health issues."
"In 
addition, E.ON has assistance and training on stress reduction, 
self-assessment tests, and a direct support offering, including 
through the EAP."
"To propel its health strategy in a targeted way, E.ON is also 
conducting a health inventory across all its companies in Germany 
and elsewhere in line with its HSE vision."
"The project’s purpose is 
to actively foster employees’ health and well-being and to improve 
Group-wide transparency regarding health and well-being."
"Data 
collected in the health inventory will be used to support E.ON’s 
ongoing efforts for greater collaboration in its HSE organization 
and to address current challenges and trends."
"The data will also 
promote the sharing of best practices across all units and countries 
in order to further improve our HSE culture and health 
management and to jointly set strategic targets and the direction 
of further HSE culture and health strategies."
"Progress and Measures 
Accident Statistics 
Serious incidents and fatalities (“SIF”) measures accidents and 
incidents that caused serious or fatal injuries and that surpass a 
predefined severity threshold."

hours of work."
"At 0.03 , employee SIF was below the prior-year level (2022: 
0.04)."
› Contractor SIF increased to 0.06 (2022: 0.05).
"Combined SIF was
0.04 in 2023 (2022: 0.05)."
"Lost-time injury frequency (“LTIF”) measures work-related 
accidents resulting in lost time per million hours of work."
Employee LTIF was 2.2 (2022: 2.1).
› Contractor LTIF improved to 1.6 (2022: 2.0).
"Combined LTIF was 
1.9 in 2023 (2022: 2.0) and thus in line with the previous year."
"‹  
Total recordable injury frequency (“TRIF”) is one of E.ON’s KPIs for 
safety."
"It measures the number of recorded work-related injuries 
and (acute) illnesses per million hours of work."
"E.ON has calculated 
it since 2010 (employee TRIF) and included contractor employees’ 
in its safety performance since 2011 (combined TRIF)."
The TRIF for employees was 2.8 in 2023.
"› Contractor TRIF of 2.0 was lower than in the prior year (2022: 
2.3)."
Combined TRIF declined from 2.6 to 2.4 .
"All accidents were 
carefully examined, both individually and in comparison."
"In some 
cases, this enabled us to identify patterns or multiple predominant 
causes and respond directly to them, for example, by means of 
work groups."
"TRIF declined mainly because of fewer pandemic-
related restrictions and higher investments at some units, which 
resulted in an increase in the number of construction sites and 
thus in the number of working hours."

"► Near-miss frequency rate (“NMFR”) measures unplanned 
incidents that had the potential to result in an accident (but did 
not) per million hours of work."
"E.ON analyzes how and why near 
misses happened and then puts in place controls to minimize or 
eliminate similar risks in the future."
"We actively encourage 
employees to report near misses so that we can continually 
improve our safety performance."
"E.ON’s NMFR was 40 in 
2023."
"◄ 
Fatal Accidents at Work 
Regrettably, one contractor employee died in 2023 due to an 
occupational accident."
"He was an electrician who suffered severe 
burns from an arc flash in a transformer station."
"Although first aid 
was administered immediately and he received medical treatment 
for three weeks, he ultimately died from his injuries."
"Each fatal 
accident is thoroughly investigated so that we understand the 
exact course of events that led to it."
"Identifying root causes 
enables us to take the measures necessary to prevent similar 
accidents in future."
"Nevertheless, serious and even fatal accidents 
still occur."
E.ON cannot and will not accept this.
"It has therefore 
further intensified its efforts to prevent accidents."
"Examples are 
the Company’s decision to extend the evaluation of HSE maturity 
to all E.ON network operators and to make adjustments to the HSE 
Strategy Roadmap 2021–2023, which place a greater emphasis 
on risk and contractor management (see “Goals and Performance 
Review” above)."
"Occupational Health and Safety at PreussenElektra 
E.ON’s subsidiary PreussenElektra (“PEL”) is responsible for the 
operation, decommissioning, and dismantling of the Company’s 
nuclear power plants (“NPPs”)."
"Its top priorities in all these 
activities are the health and safety of employees—its own as well 
as contractors’—and environmental protection."
"PEL is fully 
integrated into E.ON’s safety organization and is subject to its high 
standards."
"PEL’s extensive experience in plant operations and 
decommissioning helps it continually optimize its HSE processes 
and procedures and thus to minimize possible risks in conducting 
its activities."
"Special focus actions, practical training sessions, and 
health promotion measures foster and support the safe behavior of 
PEL and contractor employees."
"Together, the systematic 
application of safety standards, the conducting of various training 
and awareness-raising measures (including for contractors), and 
continual HSE advice directly at the work site again helped prevent 
serious accidents in 2023."
"Working Conditions and Employee Development  
GRI 2-7, GRI 2-30, GRI 3-3, GRI 401, GRI 404, GRI 405 
► E.ON’s vision is to provide everyone with good energy."
"More 
than 72,000 employees worldwide (core workforce in FTE) are 
working to make it happen."
"E.ON’s human resources (“HR”) 
creates the conditions for all of them to make their contribution."
"The HR function’s cornerstones, which are part of E.ON’s vision of 
HR management, are: attracting great people, developing people, 
creating a winning culture, and driving digital."
"They describe how 
E.ON wants to be the employer of choice and to use innovative 
formats to continually develop its talent."
"They also aim to establish 
a culture of inclusion as well as the greater digitalization of HR 
processes and the creation of a digital mindset."
"The HR vision thus 
serves as the lodestar for HR work in the Group."
"The medium-term HR objectives specify this overarching vision as 
it is reflected in our Group People Strategy, or GPS@E.ON."
"This 
strategy defines the four Group-wide People Priorities."
"These 
priorities are the future of work, diversity and inclusion, 
sustainability, and leadership."
"HR activities across the Group are 
aligned with GPS@E.ON and must fundamentally contribute to the 
People Priorities and their respective key ambitions."
"The strategy 
is implemented through Group-wide and local activities."
"◄ 
E.ON’s Approach    
GRI 2-30 
A common culture, toward which the Company continually works, 
is crucial for E.ON’s success."
"Our fundamental corporate values 
guide employees’ actions and interactions with each other, 
customers, and business partners."
"They answer the question of 
what makes E.ON special, what is important to us, and what 
principles guide our actions."
"Grow@E.ON, E.ON’s Group-wide competency model, is derived 
from E.ON’s values and is an integral part of GPS@E.ON."
"It defines 
the specific behaviors to which the Company is committed."
"Grow@E.ON is integrated into all HR-related processes and 
describes how employees and managers should behave toward 
each other and customers."
"Its purpose is to enable us to recruit the 
right employees for the right positions, retain them, and foster 
their ongoing development."
"Grow@E.ON provides guidance to 
staff in their daily work and sets out a clear path for their personal 
development and professional growth."
"It is designed to prepare the 
Company for the continually evolving world of work, in which 
agility, future-oriented skills, and greater individualization and 
diversity are at the forefront."
"All new managers and employees are 
informed about Grow@E.ON and trained accordingly."
A strong feedback culture is extremely important.
"Feedback helps 
employees perform at a high level, to identify opportunities for 
personal development, and to promote continuous improvement."
"Such a feedback culture is firmly embedded in GPS@E.ON, E.ON’s 
Group-wide HR strategy."
"E.ON offers its employees periodic 
performance and development reviews."
"The Company also takes a 
number of steps to foster a feedback culture, including offering 
training, guidelines for feedback, and support on Connect, its in-
house social network."
"In addition, YourVoice@E.ON, which we 
launched in 2023, represents a central and innovative approach to 
making giving feedback even easier and more efficient for 
everyone (see “Specific Actions” below)."
"Guidelines and Policies  
Our HR management model assigns the central HR function 
(Group HR/Executive HR) responsibility for Group-wide HR tools 
and processes as well as binding HR policies."
"These are defined in a 
functional policy guideline, which also stipulates the associated 
tasks."
"Executive HR, for example, is responsible for the complete 
life-cycle management of E.ON’s top executives."
"Group HR is 
responsible for a variety of Company-wide matters."
"E.ON has in place numerous policies and directives to make work 
conditions more flexible."
"These include agreements for home 
offices and rules on flexible work arrangements such as 
sabbaticals, part-time work, and special leave."
"The principles 
contained in these policies and directives are supported by our 
codetermination committees and are binding for the entire E.ON 
Group."
"The units implement them according to their respective 
legal, cultural, and business circumstances."
"The compensation principles for our employees are in many cases 
stipulated by collective bargaining agreements, which cover 82 
percent of employees."
"Whenever possible, E.ON offers permanent 
employment, which applies to 94 percent of employees."
"We 
provide fair pay that enables our employees to live a decent life."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON’s HR management is largely decentralized so that it is closer 
to the business."
"In 2022 E.ON decided to fine-tune its HR 
governance model so that topics of Group-wide strategic 
significance—talent management/diversity and inclusion, learning 
and development, EVP, and HR tech—are managed and 
implemented more centrally."
"In this context, the Senior Vice 
President Group HR/Executive HR and the HR leaders of the 
individual units agree on annual targets."
"An important central task of the HR function is HR management 
for the Group’s top leadership positions."
"This includes the 
identification of potential, staffing, succession planning and related 
long-term talent management."
"The aim is to continually improve 
the staff of leadership positions by, for example, having a 
transparent recruitment process and thus ensuring equal 
opportunity and diversity."
"We use overarching criteria and 
common tools, such as local and global talent boards, to identify 
talent and potential."
"Talent boards serve as a forum in which HR 
and the specialist departments discuss employees with 
development potential for management roles and their 
development needs."
"Within this defined framework, units and 
facilities can adjust processes to meet their specific needs and 
challenges."
"E.ON takes its employees’ interests very seriously and cooperates 
closely with employee representatives."
"Almost all E.ON units and 
Corporate Functions itself have works councils or other forms of 
employee representation."
"We can build on the long-standing, 
constructive, and trusting partnership with employee 
representatives, especially in times of change; moreover, we 
actively involve the workforce in all relevant upcoming changes."
"Employee representatives are involved in employee-related issues 
in a timely manner in accordance with the laws of individual 
countries."
In Germany this law is the Works Constitution Act.
"The 
cooperation between E.ON and E.ON employee representatives is 
characterized by respectful and open dialog."
"Early and open 
exchange with employee representatives on employee-related 
issues, which is a particularly important aspect of this proven 
social partnership, is therefore enshrined in a declaration of 
principles."
"In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, E.ON 
established hybrid work as a Group-wide standard."
"We did this to 
make working at E.ON even more attractive and to position our 
Company as a modern employer in the future as well."
"Employees 
at E.ON companies based in Germany can take a workation."
"The 
aim is to give them additional options to make where they work 
more flexible."
"In a workation, employees may—to the degree 
operationally possible and in conformity with agreed-on 
framework arrangements—temporarily perform their work from 
an EU country other than the one of their contractual workplace."
"The aim is to make working at E.ON even more flexible and to 
respond even more individually to employees’ needs."
"E.ON offers its employees benefits in addition to their contractual 
compensation."
"In addition to the benefits of the Company pension 
scheme or employer-financed accident insurance, E.ON supports 
its employees in non-work-related situations or in special life 
situations, such as when a family member falls ill."
"Employees in 
Germany, for example, can take advantage of various services 
provided or arranged by the Company."
"These services range from 
stress and addiction counseling to support in caring for elderly or 
sick relatives."
"Employees who fall ill for more than six weeks 
within a 12-month period receive help with reintegration."
"In 
granting these benefits no distinction is made between full-time 
and part-time employment."
"Training and development are very important for E.ON’s 
attractiveness as an employer and pivotal for E.ON’s 
transformation into a learning organization."
"All employees receive 
training at their onboarding, HSE training, and functional training 
relevant to their role, as well as soft-skills training and access to 
talent and leadership development programs."
"These include many 
digital, self-directed learning opportunities that employees can 
access from anywhere at any time."
"In addition to Group-wide 
training opportunities, the units have standardized digital learning 
offerings."
"E.ON offers them for onboarding new employees and in 
part for training strategically important topics like digitalization or 
health and safety."
"To simplify their learning, employees can take 
learning journeys on specific specialist topics."
"The journeys are 
offered by the central HR function’s People Development team 
and the central IT function’s Digital Empowerment team."
"Currently, each department is conducting projects to develop 
strategically important learning content."
"This involves identifying 
critical skills and learning needs in line with E.ON’s strategy and 
external market requirements."
"During the year under review, for 
example, we identified which core competencies our employees 
need in which areas to continue managing our digital 
transformation."
"We will subsequently offer department-specific 
learning opportunities so that we can develop the necessary skills 
in-house."
"We are currently designing a new process for 
competence and skills management."
"We want to use it to 
automatically identify future-critical skills based on market trends; 
the process will also draw on new digital functionalities to 
continuously identify missing skills and learning needs for 
specialist departments, managers, and employees."
"The basis for 
this is an E.ON-wide standardized skill taxonomy."
"It is managed 
centrally and continually refined in collaboration with specialist 
departments."
"E.ON believes that the most effective way for employees to learn 
is through experience and practice."
"The Company adopts a 70-20-
10 learning approach: 70 percent of learning happens on the job, 
20 percent through social interaction and knowledge sharing with 
others, and 10 percent by means of programs such as eLearning, 
seminars, and formal training."
"E.ON keeps up with the faster pace 
of the digital age by increasingly replacing long formats with short 
digital learning formats and self-directed learning."
"It is part of 
employees’ workflow, it is tailored to their individual needs as 
much as possible, and it is accessible anytime and anywhere."
"In 2023 E.ON established a one-stop shop for all learning content 
in order to make learning opportunities for employees even more 
attractive and easier."
"This digital platform will combine all E.ON-
wide learning opportunities in a single place and improve user-
friendliness."
"In addition, E.ON drew up a catalog of learning and 
development measures by the end of 2022 in order to achieve the 
goal of becoming a learning organization in the coming years."
"It 
ensures a Group-wide, new framework for learning and employee 
development and was introduced in all units with initial measures 
in 2023."
"In the coming years, this will be accompanied by an 
ongoing internal communication campaign, such as the three-
week Learning Weeks in September 2023 and a Fail and Learn 
video series with managers."
"The Learning Weeks took place 
throughout the Group as an online format."
"In this context, 72 
events were held and over 9,000 employees took part."
"E.ON helps people launch their careers by offering apprenticeships 
for various vocations as well as internships, working student 
activities, and other programs."
"Our offerings in Germany include 
local initiatives to help interested people start their careers with 
the help of school projects, internships, courses, and expert 
guidance."
"We also employ working students who can gain work 
experience at E.ON and simultaneously finance their education."
"In 
2022 we also launched a new, Group-wide E.ON International 
Graduate Program (“EIGP”) to develop next-generation talent 
personally and professionally and to retain them at E.ON."
"Cross-
functional, national, and international assignments enable 
participants to get to know our business and network Group-wide."
"We support them with mentoring, coaching, and training."
"The 
trainees also work on a joint business project."
"In 2023 the project 
involved having trainees conduct a survey to ascertain employees’ 
attitudes towards E.ON’s sustainability culture and thus provide 
important impetus for its evolution."
"In 2023 the EIGP was expanded to include specialist tracks for 
Customer Solutions, Digital, Finance, and Energy Networks."
"Entrants in 2023 consisted of 22 university graduates of nine 
different nationalities."
"A total of 37 participants are currently 
completing the EIGP."
"Goals and Performance Review 
We support our predominantly decentralized HR organization on 
issues of Group-wide significance or Group-wide value 
propositions."
"This includes setting central targets for topics with a 
Group-wide value proposition."
"The HR Board-which consists of the 
Senior Vice President (“SVP”) Group HR and representatives of the 
local HR organizations—defines, prioritizes, and decides on the 
specific annual HR targets for the implementation of Group-wide 
value propositions and their measurement criteria."
"The targets will 
be reviewed periodically based on the previously defined 
measurement criteria."
"E.ON wants to retain its people (and their expertise) and enable 
them to grow professionally."
"One of E.ON’s objectives is therefore
also to fill management positions internally."
"At talent boards, 
E.ON’s HR representatives use a special tool to assess how many 
candidates have participated in an application process and who 
ultimately filled a vacant position."
"It also enables E.ON to monitor 
whether selected candidates come from its own development pool 
and whether they meet its diversity targets."
"E.ON’s talent boards 
not only focus on identifying talent and planning succession, but, 
since 2021, also on diversity aspects."
"The objective is in part to 
increase the proportion of women and employees from 
underrepresented groups among managers."
"That is why, since 
2020, E.ON has been strengthening its commitment and has made 
diversity a People Priority in GPS@E.ON, its HR strategy."
"Our 
talent strategy in 2023 focused on a more inclusive and flexible 
approach in order to enhance diversity in talent management as 
well."
"To support this, we piloted a smart digital platform called My 
Career Hub in 2023 as well."
"The platform suggests opportunities 
to employees that match their skills, interests, and ambitions."
"Examples include suitable jobs, mentoring opportunities, and 
project assignments."
"E.ON has conducted an annual employee survey since 2014 to find 
out how its people feel about their job, their supervisor, the work 
atmosphere in their unit, and other topics."
"The periodic finetuning 
of our survey approaches led to the decision to implement a 
Group-wide employee engagement strategy (YourVoice@E.ON) in 
2023."
"Engagement takes into account a large number of different 
factors that together contribute to an engagement score."
"A high 
score, for example, indicates a high level of employee well-being 
and a lower risk of fluctuation."
"A characteristic feature of the new 
strategy is that employee feedback is recorded and evaluated more 
regularly."
"This will enable organizational units such as 
departments and individual teams to identify engagement issues 
swiftly and independently, to discuss them as a team, and to have 
the opportunity to initiate improvements together."
"Following the 
gradual implementation of YourVoice@E.ON, it will be the central 
approach to employee surveys in the E.ON Group, supplemented 
only selectively by specific, concise surveys on certain topics."
"The centerpiece of the new YourVoice@E.ON approach is a 
technology platform that, at certain intervals, emails employees 
questions that address aspects of well-being and the current work 
situation."
"Answering the questions is anonymous and voluntary 
and can be integrated into everyday work with little effort."
"Managers can access the findings of this ongoing feedback on 
their dashboards at any time, react to individual aspects or trends, 
and work with their teams on improvements."
"This makes 
YourVoice@E.ON more than a traditional employee survey and 
supports our feedback culture."
"› We conducted our periodic survey of Employee Net Promoter 
Score (“eNPS”) in 2023 as well."
"eNPS measures employees’ 
willingness to recommend E.ON as an employer."
"In the 2023 
survey, eNPS improved by eight points (+36)."
"At year-end 2023, the E.ON Group’s core workforce had 
72,242 employees."
"This figure includes part-time positions on a 
pro rata basis."
"The number of employees increased—by 2,864 
FTEs, or 4 percent—in 2023."
"The proportion of employees working 
outside Germany (34,715 FTEs) decreased slightly to 48 percent 
compared with year-end 2022 (49 percent)."
The number of employees at Energy Networks increased.
"This was 
mainly attributable to the implementation of our growth strategy, 
associated network expansion, network modernization and 
digitalization."
"The deconsolidation of the VSEH Group in Slovakia 
had a countervailing effect."
Customer Solutions’ core workforce increased as well.
"This was 
mainly due to capacity expansion to meet increased customer 
requirements and to roll out smart energy meters in the United 
Kingdom."
"There was also significantly more growth-driven new 
hiring in most of the other countries, in particular the Netherlands, 
Germany, and Hungary."
"The deconsolidation of the VSEH Group in 
Slovakia had a countervailing effect at Customer Solutions as well."
"The number of employees at Corporate Functions/Other rose year 
on year as well, mainly because of hiring and incourcing of 
digitalization and IT support capabilities."
"By contrast, the number 
of employees at PreussenElektra declined owing to the 
dismantling of its nuclear power plants."
"Core Workforce by Country1

2 The company VSEH operating in Slovakia was deconsolidated in the end of 2023.
"This corresponds to an apprenticeship ratio of 
5.6 percent."
"Of the 587 apprentices who completed their training 
in 2023, 538 were given a permanent or temporary employment 
contract."
"This is a very high takeover rate of 92 percent (2022: 
553 of 598, or 93 percent)."
"A consistently high takeover rate of 
apprentices is one of the ways E.ON is actively addressing the 
shortage of skilled workers."
"Workforce Age Distribution  
GRI 405-1 
At year-end 2023, the average age of E.ON employees was 42, as 
in the previous year."
"This is comparable with the average age at 
other DAX 40 companies."
"The age distribution of E.ON’s workforce 
reflects the demographic trend of working-age people."
"In 2023 
around 22 percent of our employees were under the age of 31, 
49 percent between 31 and 50, and around 29 percent older than 
50."
"New Employee Hires and Turnover Rate  
GRI 401-1 
E.ON hired 11,308 new employees in the year under review."
"This 
too reflects the systematic implementation of our strategy 
focusing on growth, sustainability, and digitalization."
"The voluntary 
turnover rate in 2023 was 4.6 percent (2022: 6.1)."
"Customer Satisfaction     
GRI 3-3 
Customers of all types—households and businesses, cities and 
government entities—understand that a digital and decarbonized 
future means that they will not only consume, but also 
increasingly make and store their own clean energy."
"These 
customers are extremely knowledgeable and discerning."
"They 
expect E.ON not only to listen to and anticipate their needs, but 
also to design innovative and sustainable energy solutions, deliver 
best-in-class services, and provide a consistently good customer 
experience."
"Earning and retaining their trust and loyalty is very 
significant for us to sustainably grow our business."
"Loyal 
customers tend to stay with us longer, to purchase additional 
products and services, and to recommend us to their family and 
friends."
"2023, too, was a difficult year for our customers: energy prices 
remained at a high level, which was only partially mitigated by 
government subsidy programs."
"E.ON companies made 
customers aware of support opportunities by including 
information about alternative tariffs and government subsidy 
programs in their bills."
"In addition, customers could use special 
apps and other tools to better understand their electricity 
consumption and ways to conserve energy."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON continually measures and improves the experience we offer 
to our customers, in order to retain—and, ideally, deepen—their 
loyalty."
It is essential for us to be systematically customer-centric.
"The E.ON brand promises to give our customers what they want in 
the future energy world: consistently positive experiences with our 
services and smart, sustainable solutions."
"E.ON transports energy 
from where it is produced to where it is needed."
"We also work to 
empower people, companies, and cities across Europe to create 
the sustainable world that they want to live in."
"The purpose is to 
build energy communities in which everyone can do their part and 
meet these needs—from a household opting for green electricity to 
an entire city committing to sustainability."
"Delivering on this 
promise will make the E.ON brand distinctive and enable us to 
successfully expand our business."
"E.ON’s objective is to become 
the number one energy-solutions company in all of its markets and 
thus to live up to its ambition of being the leading company of the 
energy transition."
"In 2023 E.ON revised its market positioning to underscore its 
leading role in the energy transition."
"As part of this process, we 
surveyed customers and consumers about what characteristics 
they think such a company should have."
"They told us that it should 
have the necessary size and market strength and above all

from an existing or potential customer with the same request, for example via the chatbot."
technical innovativeness and a vision of the future energy world.
All this was accompanied by a desire for reliability and stability.
"Organization and Responsibilities 
The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) coordinates, from Corporate 
Functions, our brand and marketing strategy with the aim of 
further developing and strengthening the E.ON brand."
"The Chief 
Operating Office—Commercial (“COO—C”) supports the sales and 
energy solutions business for all customer segments and in all 
E.ON markets."
"The regional units’ Customer Experience teams are 
responsible for customer satisfaction."
"They carry out projects and 
measures in their respective sales territories and exchange 
information on successful approaches and progress on a monthly 
basis."
"There are Customer Experience teams in Germany, the 
United Kingdom, Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, 
Hungary, Poland, and the Netherlands."
"E.ON’s Global Customer Leadership team, which consists of senior 
Customer Experience leaders from the entire Group and 
representatives from the Customer and Market Insights team, 
successfully continued its work in 2023."
"Its purpose is to listen to 
customers more and foster customer centricity in all E.ON 
markets."
"The team met four times in the year under review to 
assess Customer Experience activities, identify areas of focus for 
cross-regional collaboration, and give customers a stronger voice."
"The Customer and Market Insights team studies which trends 
shape our customers’ attitudes and behaviors."
"It conducts 
consumer studies, broad-based market research, and advanced 
data analyses and models possible scenarios."
"The aim is to obtain 
practical knowledge and incorporate it into business processes."
"Specific Actions 
E.ON measures the loyalty and trust of its existing and potential 
customers by means of Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), which was 
introduced in 2009 and became a Group-wide program in 2013."
"NPS indicates customers’ willingness to recommend E.ON and its 
services."
"It also helps us identify which issues are currently of 
particular importance to customers and thus to adapt our activities 
to current customer needs."
"E.ON measures two types of NPS: 
• Strategic NPS compares E.ON’s performance with that of its 
competitors and is based on the feedback of customers 
regardless of whether they have had any interaction with E.ON."
"• Journey NPS measures the loyalty of current and potential 
customers who have completed one or more interactions1 with 
E.ON – for example, if E.ON helped them transferring their 
energy service to their new residence when they move."
"NPS is used by our regional units in Germany, the United Kingdom, 
Italy, Romania, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and 
the Netherlands."
"A methodology introduced in 2017 enables us to measure 
strategic NPS consistently across all markets and thus to identify 
and resolve customer issues experienced in multiple markets."
"It 
also makes it easier for us to recognize the areas in which useful 
innovations can be offered to customers."
"The methodology is 
based on an automated reporting process."
"It therefore avoids the 
errors of manual data entry and improves data quality and 
auditability."
"Goals and Performance Review 
Every year, E.ON sets company-wide targets for strategic and 
journey NPS."
"E.ON uses both indicators at the segment and unit 
level for purposes of management control."
"Strategic NPS is highly 
relevant for management control because of the information it 
provides about competitors."
"The E.ON Management Board has 
received a monthly NPS report since September 2020."
"In addition, 
periodic market reports enable the Chief Operating Officer—
Commercial and the CEOs of the regional units to exchange views 
on NPS issues and customer topics."
"NPS also plays a role in 
executives’ variable compensation."
"This consists of two 
components: one factor reflects an executive’s individual 
performance, the other the company performance."
"Progress in 
strategic and journey NPS has accounted for 20 percent of the 
calculation of the company performance since 2020."
"The 
achievement of NPS targets is also factored into determining the 
E.ON Management Board’s compensation."
"In 2023, which operational journey NPS data must be measured 
by all regions was defined centrally for the first time."
"From 
January 2024 onward, these are the data on complaint 
management and the payment process."
"The regions completed a 
self-assessment in order to have a uniform basis for data 
collection."
"Baseline measurement began in the fourth quarter of 
2023."
"Since 2017, each unit has also established its own measures to 
systematically improve customer perception."
"These activities are 
initiated and overseen by the units’ CEO and board members 
because they are personally responsible for their unit’s NPS 
performance."
"They review the measures annually and readjust 
them."
They increasingly include sustainability criteria.
"The 
measures’ duration can cover several years, depending on the 
scope of the planned adjustments."
"Security of Supply    
GRI 2-6, GRI 3-3, GRI G4 Sector Disclosures Electric Utilities 
E.ON’s objective as an energy company and distribution system 
operator is to ensure a secure supply of electricity to its customers."
"A reliable electricity supply is essential for industrialized countries 
to be able to maintain their economy and meet their inhabitants’ 
basic needs."
"For example, industrial customers that operate high-
precision production facilities require a constant network 
frequency."
"If frequency fluctuates, machinery can break down, 
resulting in additional costs."
"A complete interruption of the 
electricity supply can have serious consequences, and not just for 
industrial customers."
"At companies, government agencies, and 
households, most processes are no longer possible without 
electricity."
"One challenge in power supply is that energy is 
increasingly being generated decentrally and consequently fed into 
the E.ON network from many different points."
"Moreover, 
renewables feed-in fluctuates because it depends on the weather 
and other factors beyond E.ON’s control."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON wants to operate secure and stable networks in a future 
energy world as well and thus offer its customers a reliable 
electricity supply at reasonable costs."
"That is why E.ON is 
upgrading to smart grids by equipping networks with sensors and 
control technology, increasing the level of automation, and adding 
a digital layer."
"This will enable us to manage energy flows in line 
with demand and to monitor our grids in real time and with much 
greater granularity than today."
"Additionally, as is described in 
greater detail below under “Specific Actions,” smart-grid 
technology makes it possible for us to partially avoid or delay some
grid expansion."
"Going forward, smart grids will serve as the platform for the 
innovative technologies and new business models that contribute 
to the energy transition’s success."
"In Arnsberg/Sundern and Lüneburg, Germany, E.ON is 
testing the extent to which various aspects of a future energy 
world are feasible, useful, and scalable."
"E.ON is expanding its 
digital equipment in these communities and assessing the value 
that such smart solutions add for customers and networks."
"We are 
also exploring whether and how current energy-market regulation 
can better reflect customer needs."
"E.ON’s smart solutions promote 
secure and efficient network operation."
"This gives us a transparent 
view of the operating status of network equipment and energy 
flows and enables us to make targeted use of the flexibility 
available in our networks."
"Guidelines and Policies 
In 2021 E.ON adopted a strategy for deploying more smart 
technology (smartification) in its low- and medium-voltage grids."
"The strategy applies in Germany and all other countries in Europe 
where the Company operates."
"E.ON’s smart-tech deployment 
targets vary by country but generally far exceed those set by each 
country’s regulatory agency."
"We monitor progress using key 
performance indicators (“KPIs”) on a regular basis."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON’s regional network companies are responsible for the safe 
and reliable operation of its distribution networks."
"They are also responsible for 
resolving unforeseeable outages in their service territory."
"E.ON’s 
crisis management system defines the responsibilities and 
procedures for dealing with widespread disruptions."
"The Incident 
and Crisis Management policy provides guidelines for such 
situations."
"The Chief Operating Officer–Networks (“COO–N”) 
oversees the Energy Networks segment."
"Under his leadership, 
three departments (Energy Networks Europe, Energy Networks 
Germany, and Energy Networks Technology & Innovation) at 
Corporate Functions manage the segment’s regional units."
"These 
departments’ tasks include strategic development, investment 
planning, and asset management."
"Specific Actions 
E.ON has investment and maintenance programs under which it 
expands and maintains its networks in line with demand."
"E.ON will 
invest €33 billion from 2023 to 2027, of which €26 billion will go 
toward network expansion."
"This is intended to enable us to ensure 
that all our network customers are connected to the network and 
receive a reliable energy supply."
"Our regional network companies 
are responsible for carrying out the measures, which are planned 
for one or more years."
"E.ON invested about €5.2 billion in network 
expansion in 2023."
"Part of the investment budget went toward the 
gradual expansion of smart grids: E.ON’s network structure is 
being progressively equipped with sensors, control and relay 
technology, as well as being automated and digitally networked."
"The increasing use of smart-grid technology makes it possible to 
avoid or delay costly investments in network expansion, for 
example, by using new technology to making better use of existing 
overhead lines."
"Investment decisions always consider the 
efficiency of each measure alongside security of supply."
"This 
means that E.ON chooses those solutions that make the most 
sense from both a technical and business standpoint."
"This is 
because network investments also affect network fees, which 
account for a portion of the electricity price paid by customers."
"Goals and Performance Review 
E.ON’s regional network companies record all planned and 
unplanned service interruptions in their distribution networks."
"The 
data collected are aggregated into the system average interruption 
duration index (“SAIDI”) for electricity."
"It indicates the average 
interruption duration per customer and year."
"E.ON reports the SAIDI of its fully consolidated network 
companies by country."
"The figures for Germany reflect the 
weighted average of its fully consolidated network companies  
 
there."
"They are calculated using the method prescribed by the 
Federal Network Agency (known by its German acronym, 
“BNetzA”)."
"The calculations are based on service interruptions that 
have been verified by the BNetzA."
"All other countries in which 
E.ON operates networks have similar quality standards."
"Their 
national regulatory agencies verify and validate network operators’ 
outage reports."
"The SAIDI figures for each country therefore 
reflect the methodology prescribed by its regulatory agency."
"These 
key figures are generally reported without interruptions due to 
force majeure; exceptions are indicated accordingly."
2Including influence of force majeure.
3Increase in 2023 (2022 data) due to several days of extreme weather conditions and storms.
"This measures the average 
number of interruptions per customer and year."
"The data collection 
process for SAIFI is the same as for SAIDI."
"‹ 
By the end of the data collection period in 2023, no regulatory 
agency had completed the process of validating outages for 2023."
"This report is intended to contain final figures on the continuity of 
supply that have been officially validated."
"Consequently, the 
country-specific figures for the prior year are disclosed below."
"Although E.ON does not use SAIDI and SAIFI for management 
control purposes, these figures provide important information on 
network service quality."
"At regular intervals, our network 
operators inform the E.ON Management Board member 
responsible for network operations about their supply reliability."
"The following presentation of key figures on service quality 
considers different causes when classifying disruption-related 
interruptions in individual countries because their respective 
national regulatory agencies use different methodologies."
"These 
key figures are generally reported without interruptions due to 
force majeure; any exceptions are indicated."
"Community Involvement     
GRI 3-3 
E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON is part of the countries and communities where it does 
business."
"We therefore feel obliged to make a contribution to their 
prosperity, economic development, sustainability, and quality of 
life."
"We do this primarily by creating jobs and by offering energy 
solutions that enhance our customers’ sustainability and comfort."
"In addition, E.ON engages in community involvement and supports 
employee volunteering in all regions where it operates."
"Our unit representatives know their country’s needs and 
challenges best."
"So E.ON lets them decide which projects and 
organizations to support."
"We believe that local decision-making is 
more suitable than central directives for giving our community 
involvement activities a societal impact."
"In order to better coordinate Group-wide and regional activities as 
well as the commitment of the E.ON Foundation and to increase its 
social impact, we have bundled E.ON SE’s and the E.ON 
Foundation’s activities and linked them more closely."
"In this way, 
we want to ensure that responsibility for content coordination, 
decisions on projects, and process design lies in one hand."
"Our Community Investments 
E.ON reports its corporate giving by the categories below."
"Alongside corporate giving, E.ON makes strategic investments in 
community involvement, which are typically more long-term in 
nature."
"In 2023 the financial resources for sponsorships went 
toward three focus areas: climate protection, access to energy, and 
support for the next generation."
3Gas grid Croatia reported for the first time in 2023.
"E.ON Foundation 
The E.ON Foundation aims to promote a sustainable 
transformation of the energy system that reflects people and their 
social practices."
"Guided by the conviction that a purely 
government-mandated, over-regulated energy transition will not 
succeed, it supports projects, events, and practical formats relating 
to energy and society."
"In 2023 the foundation made about € 1.1 
million in donations and provided more than € 1.9 million in 
funding to the projects it supports."
"Because the foundation is 
independent, this funding is not included in E.ON’s community 
investments."
"Corporate Volunteering 
In 2023 employees were again actively involved in non-profit 
projects in all regions in which E.ON operates."
"In total, 3 672 E.ON 
employees performed 22 129 hours of volunteer work in 2023."
"This figure may include double counting of employees who 
volunteer more than once."
"Data Protection,  
Cybersecurity, and Product Safety     
GRI 3-3, GRI 418 
E.ON processes personal data of a variety of stakeholders, 
primarily customers, employees, enterprise partners, and 
suppliers."
"We have a Group-wide data protection organization, 
which we continually improve."
"E.ON evaluates its processing 
activities on an ongoing basis in order to comply with applicable 
regulations and to protect data subjects’ rights and personal data."
"In addition, E.ON has a broad-based cybersecurity organization 
whose aim is to efficiently protect systems and data regardless of 
where they are accessed from, which devices are used, and where 
the data are processed."
"Safeguarding all company information—in 
oral, written, and digital form—is crucial in order to prevent 
damage to E.ON competitive position, brand, and reputation."
"E.ON offers its customers digital solutions (like the E.ON Home 
app and the E.ON Drive app) as well as a steadily expanding range 
of products installed at their premises."
"This includes solar and 
battery storage systems, heating systems (including heat pumps 
and boilers), and electric vehicle charging points."
"Ensuring that 
these products are safe is essential for E.ON to protect its 
customers’ health, retain their trust, and continue to serve them 
successfully."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON takes compliance with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (“GDPR”) and national regulations seriously and aims to 
protect natural persons—above all customers, employees, 
suppliers, and other third parties—when processing their personal 
data."
"In principle, all natural persons may themselves determine 
the extent to which their personal data are processed."
"E.ON 
Group’s Data Protection Management System (“DPMS”), which is 
based on IDW PS 980, an audit standard for compliance 
management systems, describes the minimum standards for data 
protection within the E.ON Group."
"The DPMS is implemented by 
the individual units and, at the same time, serves to ensure a 
structured, coordinated, and consistent approach to data 
protection."
The DSMS was extensively reviewed in 2023.
"In 
addition, E.ON studied major data breach cases of other companies 
that became public and used these insights to further improve its 
own data protection and IT security measures and to harden its IT 
infrastructure."
"In 2022 E.ON revised its data protection contracts, in particular EU 
model clauses, and other documents relevant to data protection."
"Among other things, E.ON focused on implementing and updating 
contracts for third-country transfers and assessments of the level 
of protection in third countries (transfer impact assessment)."
"Data 
protection is an ongoing task amid rapidly evolving technologies 
and practices."
"Using the plan-do-check-act (“PDCA”) method 
enables E.ON to continually improve these processes (for more 
information, see “Goals and Performance Review” below)."
"These 
activities continued in 2023."
"To protect all company information, E.ON has in place an 
Information Security Management System (“ISMS”) based on the 
standards of the ISO 2700x series, widely recognized international 
standards for information security."
"The ISMS is certified for those 
parts of the organization where it is required by law."
"E.ON works 
to ensure and maintain the confidentiality, availability, and 
integrity of its information resources."
"This includes monitoring 
infrastructure, vulnerabilities, and threats as well as detecting and 
responding to security events like cyberattacks."
"For this purpose, 
in-house and outside experts conducted extensive security tests of 
the systems on a regular basis."
"In 2023 E.ON again updated its 
cybersecurity strategy and designed a roadmap for implementing 
it."
"Items on the roadmap include improving security awareness, 
identity and access management, cloud security, and new 
detection and prevention capabilities."
"E.ON extend its high standards for occupational health and safety 
to the products it offers customers."
"The Company sets uniform 
standards to ensure that its products are safe throughout their life 
cycle, from development to recycling."
"Our ambition is to comply 
fully with all existing laws and regulations."
"This applies likewise to 
applicable safety laws and regulations."
"If, in the case of innovative 
products, current laws and regulations lag behind the state of the 
art, E.ON meets more stringent safety standards."
"Due to 
confidentiality constraints and the sensitivity of such data, E.ON 
cannot provide information about complaints concerning data 
breaches, regardless of whether these complaints were 
substantiated or not."
"Guidelines and Policies  
E.ON’s Data Protection Policy defines roles and responsibilities in a 
uniform manner across the whole Group."
"The information security 
standards introduced in 2018, which are based on the ISO 2700x 
series of standards, apply to the entire Group as well."
"E.ON’s People Guideline “Cybersecurity” 
summarizes the most important cybersecurity rules relevant for all 
employees."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
Each unit in the Group is responsible for complying with data 
protection regulations, above all the GDPR, and implementing the 
DPMS."
"E.ON has established processes across the Group to 
comply with data protection requirements, for example to respond 
to data subject inquiries and report data protection breaches."
"This 
set of processes also provides guidance when individual units 
implement the necessary processes."
"The units are responsible for responding to all requests from data 
subjects, such as access to information on data processing, 
rectification, deletion, and data portability."
"The units’ systems and 
policies must also comply with their national data protection 
regulations and those of any other countries where they operate."
"Where required by law, the units have appointed Data Protection 
Officers (“DPOs”)."
"E.ON’s Group DPO is responsible for higher-level data protection 
issues at the Group level."
"In addition, the units’ DPOs and 
employees are informed on a regular basis about relevant 
developments relating to data protection by means of periodic 
information-sharing meetings between the Group DPO and the 
units’ DPOs."
"This and other information is disseminated by email 
and through internal communications channels, such as the 
corporate intranet."
"Furthermore, the Group DPO reports 
periodically to the Cybersecurity and Data Protection Council, 
which also includes Management Board members, and to the 
Supervisory Board’s Audit and Risk Committee."
"The Cybersecurity function prevents the danger that technology 
and information from having an adverse impact on E.ON’s 
business and customers."
"Its tasks include designing a Group-wide 
cybersecurity strategy, monitoring its implementation, and 
coordinating the cybersecurity organization across E.ON."
"E.ON’s 
Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) oversees the Group-
wide cybersecurity organization and assigned to the Management 
Board’s digital remit."
"His responsibilities include formulating 
E.ON’s cybersecurity strategy and monitoring its implementation."
"The Group-wide cybersecurity organization includes Information 
Security Officers (“ISOs”) appointed by the business units."
"They 
report to the CISO as well as to their unit’s board on all relevant 
matters arising in their organizations."
"The CISO reports on a 
regular basis—as well as ad hoc in the event of serious security 
incidents—to the E.ON SE Management Board and the Supervisory 
Board."
"These vertical and horizontal reporting pathways ensure 
transparent and consistent reporting."
"E.ON’s regional units know their customers, their products, and 
the local market conditions and requirements."
"Consequently, their 
Product Development teams take the lead in product safety, 
supported by their unit’s Health, Safety, and Environment (“HSE”) 
department."
"They also work closely with several divisions and 
departments at Corporate Functions, primarily B2C/B2SME 
Solution Management, Innovation, HSE, and Sustainability."
"In 
addition, B2C has its own product safety and compliance team."
"Specific Actions 
All new E.ON Group employees receive data protection training 
during their first year as part of their onboarding process."
"In 
addition, E.ON conducts specific training for entities and 
departments—such as call centers and sales organizations—that 
process personal data on a bigger scale."
"Employees use an 
eLearning module to familiarize themselves with the GDPR’s rules 
annually."
"By the end of 2023,  82 percent of employees completed 
the module."
"E.ON uses training, phishing simulations, and in-house workshops 
such as live hacking demonstrations to familiarize its employees 
with cybersecurity risks and their obligation to keep confidential 
company information secure."
"To enable its employees to handle 
information properly, E.ON uses a classification tool, including 
electronic document labelling, which was introduced in 2022."
"E.ON conducts an ongoing phishing awareness campaign that 
involves simulated phishing emails sent to employees several 
times a month."
"In addition, E.ON periodically performs 
penetration-testing for crucial services in order to further harden 
key services against cyberattacks."
"E.ON takes a variety of steps to address health and safety issues 
across the entire life cycle of its products."
"During product 
development, E.ON closely observes current standards and 
guidelines and monitors emerging issues."
"The regional units test all 
market-ready products, including eMobility solutions, for 
CE/UKCA conformity in their own test labs or have them tested in 
E.ON’s test lab in Essen or by outside testing firms."
"Products that 
are CE-compliant meet EU-wide requirements for safety, health, 
and environmental protection, while UKCA-compliant products 
meet the British market’s compliance requirements."
"This provides 
E.ON with a comprehensive assessment of risks, their likelihood, 
and other potential implications."
"Contractors who install and 
maintain products on E.ON’s behalf must undergo prequalification 
prior to hiring to ensure that they meet specific standards and 
values."
"In addition, E.ON engages in ongoing dialogue with its 
contractors and trains them to ensure that they adhere to all 
requirements and the latest technical standards."
"Safety training, 
for example, is mandatory for all installers of solar and battery 
solutions in Germany."
"If a product has a safety-related issue, E.ON 
needs to be able to recall it immediately."
"E.ON therefore checks 
and tracks all hardware product changes so that it can contact 
customers immediately in the event of safety-related issue."
"We 
work to continually improve these processes."
"These include establishing a system to ensure 
product traceability and putting in place a plan for corrective 
measures."
"Other requirements include product certification, 
CE/UKCA labeling, the issuance of E.ON’s own EU/UKCA 
Declaration of Conformity, and the creation and maintenance of a 
product’s full technical documentation."
"In the event of safety-
related issues, E.ON immediately informs the appropriate market 
surveillance agency about the issue and the intended corrective 
measures, such as withdrawal, warning, and recall."
"E.ON is also 
obligated to take necessary corrective actions."
"Goals and Performance Review 
The recurring PDCA cycle results in the DPMS’s processes being 
continually planned, implemented, managed, and improved."
"This 
enables E.ON to permanently monitor the DPMS’s effectiveness, 
proactively and repeatedly look for potential blind spots, and take 
action if the need for improvement arises."
"E.ON units report on the 
status quo of their compliance with the GDPR on a quarterly basis."
The review also includes regular assessments by Group Audit.
"The 
units implement Group Audit’s recommendations in a timely 
manner."
"Where it was possible to conclude ongoing proceedings 
with data protection agencies, this was done without sanctions."
The existing DPMS is therefore effective and robust.
"E.ON assesses the maturity of its ISMS domains regularly and 
reports the findings to the Cyber Security and Data Protection 
Council on a quarterly basis."
"E.ON defined a minimum maturity 
level for all areas and units."
"If deficiencies or improvement 
potential are identified, E.ON adjusts its cybersecurity roadmaps 
accordingly."
"Product safety incidents are documented at the unit whose 
product was involved and at the Group level."
"The investigation and 
analysis of such incidents help us identify their causes and 
determine how to prevent them in future."
"E.ON shares the insights 
gained in this process with all relevant departments."
"Business Resilience Management    
GRI 3-3 
The health, safety, and security of employees and customers, 
environmental protection, and the reliability of the energy supply 
are particularly important to E.ON."
"We work continually to ensure 
the safety, security, and reliability of our infrastructure and 
customer solutions and to become even more resilient to 
operational interruptions and disruptions."
"If a crisis occurs despite 
comprehensive precautions, E.ON responds swiftly and handles 
the situation professionally."
"The impact of the war in Ukraine in particular continued to present 
a challenge in 2023."
"As in the prior year, we faced, among other 
things, a potential energy shortage and an overall increased threat 
to energy infrastructure."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON has a comprehensive framework in place consisting of 
various minimum requirements for the purpose of conducting 
business resilience management."
"It addresses physical security 
issues and includes specifications for implementing crisis and 
business continuity management."
"Nevertheless, the Company 
cannot rule out the possibility of crises caused by, for example, a 
natural disaster, human or technical failure, a cyberattack, or 
another security-related incident, or a corresponding event."
"That is 
why integrated business continuity management encompasses, 
for example, elaborate contingency plans."
"They specify both 
organizational and operational measures to enable a fast, efficient, 
and predefined response and the continued operation of critical 
activities."
"In the event of a crisis, E.ON has a Group-wide crisis 
organization with several highly specialized crisis management 
teams that are organized locally and centrally; they conduct 
exercises on a regular basis in order to be able to respond quickly 
to critical events."
"E.ON prepares thoroughly to respond to such 
exceptional situations in the best possible way and prevent 
escalation and acts quickly and purposefully at the first signs."
"The 
main objective of crisis prevention and management measures is 
to protect human life, the environment, the business, and property."
This approach has proven its worth in past crises.
"Guidelines and Policies 
E.ON’s Business Resilience function policy defines responsibilities 
and roles as well as organizational requirements and provides 
recommendations on how the business units can establish, 
operate, and continually refine an effective business resilience 
management system."
"The E.ON SE Management Board is 
responsible for approving the function policy."
"The policy’s theme 
encompasses the following overarching areas of operational 
resilience: physical security, business continuity management, 
emergency and crisis management, and travel security."
"In addition, 
the policy requires the units to report critical incidents, serious 
security incidents, and incidents with crisis potential to the 
Security Response Center, which is operational at all times."
"These 
requirements make it possible to manage, as soon as possible, 
unpredictable and complex situations that could have a significant 
impact on E.ON’s business, assets, stakeholders, and/or 
reputation."
"If necessary, the central Business Resilience function 
supports the business units in establishing the mechanisms and 
meeting the minimum requirements."
"An overarching Business 
Resilience Community provides additional support and information 
sharing."
"More information on the Business Resilience Community 
can be found below under “Specific Actions.” 
Organization and Responsibilities 
Ultimate responsibility for preventing and managing crises lies 
with the E.ON Management Board."
"Strategic implementation of 
physical security topics for the Group as well as operational 
implementation for E.ON SE are carried out by the Business 
Resilience function, which is part of the Legal, Compliance, and 
Security department."
"With the exception of travel security, 
operational implementation at the business units is conducted by 
their respective business resilience organizations, which are 
responsible for meeting Group-wide minimum standards for 
business resilience."
"It is divided into 
the respective operational business/regional or country level and 
at the Group level."
"The Security Response Center is the central 
reporting point for dealing with crises."
"Specific Actions 
To be able to respond quickly and adequately to crisis situations at 
all times, E.ON designs and conducts several realistic crisis 
simulations and training sessions each year."
"In 2023 E.ON 
conducted two Group-wide crisis simulations in national and 
international environments, several local crisis exercises at 
business units, and ongoing training and continuing education for 
designated crisis management teams."
"All members of these teams 
are required to participate in regular exercises and training 
sessions."
"In addition, all members of the crisis management team 
receive a one-time onboarding training session for their respective 
functions as well as additional training if required."
"Among other 
things, crisis team leaders are trained to lead a team in complex, 
stressful, time-critical, and uncertain situations."
"In addition to crisis management activities, the Business Resilience 
function conducts other measures to enable E.ON to achieve 
lasting operational resilience."
"This enables the Company to continually 
increase its own operational resilience."
"E.ON has set the following 
objectives for this purpose:  
Proactive crisis management enables E.ON to identify crises at an 
early stage and respond to them rapidly and effectively and 
ensures the necessary Group-wide crisis management capabilities."
"Another aim is to carry out regular checks to make sure that the 
necessary infrastructure for crisis teams is in place and 
operational."
"The Company also assesses, documents, and uses 
findings from all crisis management exercises, training sessions, 
and actual incidents to design and implement improvement 
measures."
"Business continuity management is designed to ensure that E.ON 
can deal with emergencies and continue operating critical activities 
in the event of a disruption."
"For this purpose, a business impact 
analysis must identify and examine all critical processes at least 
once a year."
"Its findings are used to design, update, and test 
business continuity plans and solutions."
"With the help of Group-wide services, E.ON aims to minimize the 
risk for employees when travelling and at any place at work."
"This 
includes the use of widely accepted digital solutions."
"E.ON’s objective for physical security is to protect its employees, 
property, and assets."
"For this purpose, the current security 
situation and threats are continuously analyzed and incorporated 
into physical security plans and solutions."
"One focus in the 2023 reporting year was to achieve a high 
awareness of business resilience issues in the organization and 
enhance collaboration and information sharing in the Business 
Resilience Community."
"Cross-departmental involvement and 
engagement with business resilience raised the visibility and also 
helped sharpen the profile of the Business Resilience function."
"Crisis Prevention at PreussenElektra 
PreussenElektra (“PEL”) is only allowed to operate a nuclear power 
plant (“NPP”) if it can demonstrate that it has taken all practicable 
steps to prevent a severe accident."
"PEL demonstrates its 
compliance on an ongoing basis to the relevant authorities, such as 
the Federal Ministry for the Environment, the Reactor Safety 
Commission, and state-level agencies."
"In 2023 there were no known security- and safety-related 
incidents that significantly affected the security and safety level at 
PEL’s NPPs."
"They remained at the normal long-term security and 
safety level."
"On average, ten to 15 reportable events per year 
occur at PEL’s NPPs."
"PEL headquarters conducts periodic reviews 
in which it discusses incidents and the findings derived from them 
with the NPPs that are in operation and those being dismantled."
"In 
line with Germany’s nuclear ordinances and regulations, the 
incidents, findings, and any measures taken in response are 
communicated to state and federal authorities."
"PEL regularly conducts statutory nuclear emergency and crisis 
exercises, notifies Business Resilience Management at E.ON SE, 
and reports on its results."
"Customers, 
business partners, or other stakeholders should not be deceived, 
lied to, or otherwise deliberately harmed."
"We are committed to 
ensuring that laws are strictly obeyed, and that integrity and 
compliance are systematically promoted as core components of 
our corporate culture."
"This is the only way for us to retain and 
deepen our stakeholders’ trust for the long term."
"Negligence or deliberate violations could lead to fines and criminal 
prosecution for the employees in question and could harm E.ON’s 
reputation."
"Corruption is unacceptable for another reason as well: 
it leads to decisions being made for the wrong reasons."
"It can thus 
impede progress and innovation, distort competition, and do 
lasting damage to E.ON and its stakeholders."
"E.ON therefore takes potential compliance violations very 
seriously."
"If they are substantiated, we systematically pursue and 
punish them."
"E.ON’s approach to compliance and anticorruption is 
applicable for all business units and Corporate Functions and 
extends to suppliers as well."
"Information on compliance notices 
can be found in the “Progress and Measures” section below."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON is committed to combating corruption in all its 
manifestations and supports national and international efforts 
directed against it."
"The Company’s participation in the United 
Nations Global Compact underscores its rejection of any form of 
corruption."
"The E.ON Management Board has the ultimate 
responsibility for ensuring that E.ON conducts its business legally,
and at all times refrains from criminal practices in achieving its 
business objectives."
"To ensure this for all business units, E.ON has 
established a central compliance function."
"Its task is to support the 
E.ON Management Board in its responsibility to prevent, detect, 
and eliminate corporate crime."
"E.ON has in place a compliance management system (“CMS”) to 
mitigate the risk of compliance violations."
"The CMS is based on a 
number of widely recognized practices, including measures to 
foster a compliance culture and a commitment to compliance 
targets (see “Goals and Performance Review”)."
"It also enables us to 
identify and analyze compliance risks, design a risk-adequate 
compliance program, and expand our compliance organization."
"These include human rights, anticorruption, fair 
competition, and compliant relationships with business partners."
"The E.ON Code of Conduct also contains an integrity test that 
employees can use to check whether they are doing the right 
thing."
"All employees are obligated under their employment 
contract to act in accordance with the Code of Conduct’s rules."
"In 
addition, ten People Guidelines, which apply to all business units, 
explain in detail how employees can be sure that they are doing 
things right."
Our Code of Conduct is widely recognized by experts.
"The quarterly magazine of BCM, a professional association for 
compliance managers in Germany, last reviewed our Code of 
Conduct in 2021 and awarded it the highest mark among all DAX 
companies."
"An important People Guideline that supports the Code of Conduct 
addresses anticorruption."
"It contains a decision-making scheme 
that uses the familiar green, amber, and red of traffic lights to 
indicate when accepting or granting offers or gifts is permissible, 
potentially problematic, or forbidden."
"Gratuities (such as donations 
and sponsorships) above a certain threshold, which varies by 
national law, must be approved by the local Compliance Officer."
"Particularly strict requirements apply to invitations and gifts from 
public, elected, or government officials and their representatives."
"The Code of Conduct clearly states E.ON’s prohibition against 
Company donations to political parties, political candidates, 
political officeholders, or representatives of public agencies."
"E.ON’s Compliance Function Policy defines basic compliance
structures, roles, and responsibilities."
"In 2023 we began to reedit all compliance policies on the basis of 
legal design principles to make them more readable and 
comprehensible."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON refines and optimizes its CMS on an ongoing basis."
"Pursuant
to the Compliance Function Policy, we have established a Group-
wide organizational setup for this purpose."
"It consists of the Chief 
Compliance Officer (“CCO”), the Global Head of Compliance & Data 
Protection along with his Group Compliance team, and the 
business units’ compliance officers."
"The CCO reports on a quarterly 
basis to the E.ON Management Board and to the Supervisory 
Board’s Audit and Risk Committee on the CMS’s effectiveness and 
current developments and incidents."
"In the event of serious 
incidents, the Management Board and the Audit and Risk 
Committee are informed without delay."
"Suspected fraudulent 
activities directed against the Company are investigated Group 
Audit."
"The central Group Compliance and Data Protection function 
is responsible for investigating fraud within the Company."
"Specific Actions 
In 2023 we continued to make eLearning courses available to all 
employees and managers Group-wide."
"They are offered by a variety 
of departments."
"The training plan’s topics include compliance and 
anticorruption as well as other legal areas such as data protection, 
cybersecurity, and human rights."
"Since 2010 all employees have 
had to complete a Code of Conduct eLearning module on a regular 
basis."
"Employees in units without Internet access receive this 
training in written form and also at a face-to-face event."
"It 
familiarizes them with Company rules and whom to contact if they 
have questions or feel uncertain about a decision."
"In addition, new 
managers receive integrity training that helps them fulfill their 
function as role models in E.ON’s compliance culture."
"E.ON also uses a variety of tools to identify the areas of activity 
where the risk for certain compliance breaches is particularly high."
"Such compliance risk assessments (“CRAs”) are conducted on an 
ongoing basis."
"CRAs employ various methods, ranging from 
spreadsheet-style questionnaires to personal (and confidential, if 
applicable) discussions with executives and employees."
"Based on 
the findings, Group Compliance determines whether specific 
measures need to be taken to amend and refine the CRAs in order 
to appropriately address any (new) potential risks identified."
"In addition, Group Compliance continually engages in dialogue 
with the compliance officers appointed by local units’ 
management and monitors their work."
"If employees suspect 
misconduct or a violation of laws or Company policies, they are 
instructed to report it."
"For this purpose, they may use—if they 
prefer, anonymously—internal reporting channels or an IT-based 
Whistleblower system."
"The system meets the requirements of 
Germany’s Whistleblower Protection Act."
"It is available Group-
wide and can be accessed via the E.ON home page or by telephone."
"Not only E.ON employees, but also business partners, their 
employees, and other third parties can contact the hotline 
confidentially."
"Group Compliance forwards the information to the 
relevant department or unit."
"E.ON wants to ensure that its compliance standards are adhered to 
in its supply chain as well."
"We therefore subject potential suppliers 
to a compliance check to assess whether they act in accordance 
with our values and principles."
"To ensure that they meet our 
compliance standards, we also conduct a prequalification process 
to verify potential suppliers’ identity."
"This includes, for example, 
determining whether a supplier appears in the media in connection 
with compliance issues such as corruption or on an official 
sanction and terrorism lists."
"In some cases, potential suppliers 
must also complete a questionnaire, which E.ON evaluates 
carefully."
Prequalification is mandatory for all new suppliers.
"The 
Human Rights and Supply Chain Management chapter provides 
more information on the supplier onboarding process."
"Our Know Your Counterparty (“KYC”) principle also defines 
minimum requirements for certain business partners and 
scenarios, other than suppliers."
"It is covered in our 
Know Your Counterparty People Guideline."
E.ON is a member of a variety of compliance organizations.
"One 
example is the German Institute for Compliance (whose German 
acronym is DICO), where E.ON also serves as Chairman of DICO’s 
Criminal Law Working Group and participates in the Internal 
Investigations and Whistleblower Systems working group."
"DICO’s 
mission is to promote the role of compliance and the 
establishment of recognized compliance standards in corporate 
governance in Germany."
"The institute also serves as a networking 
platform for compliance experts in and outside Germany."
"The Group Compliance and Data Protection department at E.ON 
SE conducted an interdisciplinary research project with the Max 
Weber Institute for Sociology at Heidelberg University, the Max 
Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, and its spinoff, 
Simply Rational GmbH."
"One finding was that the traditional 
medium of compliance knowledge transfer, training, has a 
measurable and lasting impact on participants’ compliance 
awareness."
"Innovative, interactive teaching methods also create an 
awareness of the positive effects of structural measures like 
diversity promotion and job rotation among managers."
"The 
findings were presented to the E.ON Management Board, the 
Supervisory Board’s Audit and Risk Committee, and the Group-
wide compliance community in early 2024."
"The latter will take the 
insights into account when designing future compliance training 
and communications measures and actively put them into practice."
"Goals and Performance Review 
We continuously evaluate the CMS’s effectiveness to ensure that 
E.ON is able to prevent, detect, and take appropriate remedial 
action against illegal or criminal conduct or other rules violations."
"The CMS’s effectiveness is monitored by the E.ON Management 
Board, the Supervisory Board’s Audit and Risk Committee, and also 
Group Audit."
"The latter, an independent entity, is the third line of 
defense of E.ON’s CMS."
"The CMS’s effectiveness depends on how serious and credible our 
compliance efforts within the Company are."
"This is reflected by, 
for example, the resources we devote to compliance as well as the 
quality, control, and monitoring of our measures."
"Evaluating 
E.ON’s compliance culture and the perception of its compliance is 
also relevant for the CMS’s effectiveness."
"Special consideration is 
given to violations that lead to an internal audit."
"The audit 
determines whether a violation resulted from negligence or 
misconduct by an individual or individuals or from shortcomings in 
the CMS."
"We use the findings to implement measures to avoid 
similar incidents in future."
"Their assessment was based 
in part on audits as well as surveys of employees and 
stakeholders."
"The CMS at E.ON is structured and follows a uniform roadmap 
with defined steps for refining our business units’ compliance 
measures."
"All Compliance Officers must present the status of their 
unit's compliance roadmap regularly to their board and to Group 
Compliance."
"The implementation of the compliance roadmap in 
2023 proceeded as planned."
"As every year, in 2023 we asked employees who had contacted 
Group Compliance regarding Code of Conduct violations for 
feedback about their experiences."
"We used it to assess Group 
Compliance and Data Protection’s readiness to address such 
violations or behaviors and to determine whether the information 
in our Group-wide People Guidelines is appropriate."
"The findings 
indicated that most respondents trust E.ON’s compliance 
professionals and feel protected when reporting unethical 
behavior."
"E.ON divides compliance notices into four categories: 
business integrity concerns, fraud against the Company concerns, 
HR-related concerns, and other concerns related to the Code of 
Conduct."
"The resulting investigations found that none of the 
incidents reported were serious."
"Fines for Non-compliance 
E.ON paid a total of about €911,000 in fines for non-compliance
with laws in 2023."
"Energy Affordability    
GRI 3-3  
Since the war in Ukraine began, energy has increasingly played a 
role in geopolitics."
"This presents E.ON with more challenges 
alongside those posed by the energy transition."
"One thing is 
certain: the energy supply must remain reliable, secure, and 
affordable for industry and consumers."
"E.ON’s long-standing 
approach is for its business to meet societal expectations 
regarding energy by pursuing three objectives simultaneously: 
climate protection, security of supply, and affordability."
"The 
public’s interest, however, is shifting noticeably toward 
affordability."
"E.ON therefore advocates swift and decisive action 
by policymakers and the energy industry to ensure that energy 
remains available and affordable for all."
"E.ON’s Approach 
To ensure fair prices for our customers and to be able to plan long 
term, we generally procure energy in advance."
"However, we cannot 
permanently insulate ourselves from market developments and 
must factor in all cost components into our pricing—both when 
these components fall and rise."
"Procurement prices on energy 
markets increased significantly in 2022."
"In comparison, markets 
eased considerably in 2023, but they still remain above the prewar 
level."
"This is now affecting our customers as well, who in some 
cases had to accept additional expenditures."
"E.ON therefore 
lowered its power and gas prices for a portion of customers in 2023 
to the degree that and as soon as market conditions allowed."
"E.ON believes that it would be sensible to find a (social) policy 
solution or at least to initiate measures to support businesses and 
consumers in crisis situations in which the market is clearly out of 
balance."
"During the legislative process, E.ON called for the 
mechanisms to compensate gas and power suppliers to be as 
consistent, pragmatic, and legally secure as possible."
"In particular, 
liquidity risks and a high administrative workload should be 
avoided."
"The dramatic developments necessitated rapid action by 
policymakers, above all to ensure secure and affordable supplies 
for industry and consumers."
"Taxes, levies, and surcharges still 
account for a large portion of energy costs."
"A reduction in energy 
taxes and levies remains sensible."
E.ON has long advocated both.
"Ideally, these options should be exhausted before market 
interventions to regulate prices are considered."
"It is important, 
however, to address the causes of market uncertainties."
"In the 
case of natural gas, a reduction in supply has been the primary 
factor since the beginning of the war in Ukraine."
"Policymakers in 
Germany are responding to this situation by creating additional gas 
supply capacity, in particular by importing liquefied natural gas 
(“LNG”), and by offering commercial and residential consumers 
(and gas-fired power plants) incentives to conserve energy."
"In the 
medium term, this can be remedied by more rapid renewables 
growth; in the short term, energy conservation is imperative."
"E.ON supports the measures enacted by German policymakers to 
reduce energy costs and has implemented them accordingly."
"For 
example, we endeavor that the government support payments 
foreseen in relief packages reach customers quickly."
"This included 
the German federal government’s payment of heating bills for 
December 2022 as well as to the gas and electricity price caps, 
which took effect on March 1, 2023, retroactively for the period 
beginning January 1, 2023, and which E.ON fully implemented."
"Governments are enacting consumer assistance programs in other 
countries where E.ON operates."
"The Netherlands, for example, 
introduced a price cap for electricity and gas in January 2023, 
while variable standard tariffs were capped in the United Kingdom 
by the so-called Energy Price Guarantee."
"In these and other E.ON 
regions, we focus on designing customer-specific solutions and 
communicating openly so that our customers can identify what 
makes the most sense for them."
"In addition, we have taken steps 
for E.ON itself to conserve energy."
"“Specific Actions” below 
contains more information."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON responded quickly to the altered situation and established a 
variety of task forces at Corporate Functions and at some of its 
regional units to deal with the energy crisis."
"These task forces 
coordinate with each other on a regular basis regarding current 
developments and initiatives at the units."
"In addition, initiatives are in place to share best practices and thus 
help the E.ON Group address the high prices faced by end-
customers."
"The regional units can implement the initiatives in a 
way that is tailored to their needs."
"The focus is on energy 
conservation, support for vulnerable customer groups, 
communications (with customers, employees, and the media), and 
the lobbying of policymakers."
"E.ON has already introduced several 
of the project’s initiatives to support customers."
"For example, we 
have expanded the range of installment payment plans and cash 
payment vouchers."
"The latter option enables customers to pay in 
cash by means of QR code at places like supermarkets and gas 
stations."
"This makes it particularly easy for them to settle 
outstanding amounts."
"Specific Actions 
We want to provide our customers with effective and reliable 
assistance in dealing with their challenges."
"Our German sales units 
offer individual advice through a variety of channels (telephone, 
online, mail) and stay in touch with our customers."
"The energy-
saving advice and tips we offer on our website and other channels 
are important as well."
"Our customers in Germany can turn to the payment assistance 
team."
"It supports customers facing financial difficulties by working 
with them to find a suitable installment payment plan."
"One 
solution, for example, would provide installment payments 
without interest or fees."
This team also helps customers in financial emergencies.
"Its 
services include arranging contact with job centers, telephone debt 
counseling, and third-party debtor portals."
"We also explain to 
them how they can conserve energy effectively, what options are 
available for adjusting their payments, and how they can avoid 
high additional payments in the next annual bill."
"If customers 
encounter payment difficulties, we have always tried to work with 
them to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Disconnection should 
always be the last resort."
"There is usually a lengthy process before 
a disconnection is announced or actually takes place."
"We dialogue 
extensively with customers who could potentially face a 
disconnection to prevent it from happening."
"Support for vulnerable customers is based on their individual 
needs, the market situation, and the government programs 
available in different countries."
"This support is therefore the 
responsibility of the regional units."
"For example, their advisors help 
customers with payment difficulties find out whether they qualify 
for government support programs."
"They also check what 
opportunities are available from other organizations, such as 
obtaining prefinancing for insulation for a customer’s home."
"We think individually tailored advice is important: individual 
solutions are often more effective than a blanket incentive, such as 
a lump sum payment for everyone."
"Some people may be less 
interested in a cash benefit than others; instead, they are more 
likely interested in switching to renewables in the near future."
"For 
them and us, there are always good reasons to consider climate 
protection when making energy decisions: the transition to a 
climate-neutral energy supply independent of fossil fuels is 
essential."
"That is why our own short-term conservation measures 
are accompanied by efforts to use energy and heat at our facilities 
as efficiently as possible and to deploy smart technologies to 
progressively optimize energy consumption."
"We are also gradually 
converting our buildings to green electricity and heat and, 
wherever possible, installing solar panels to power them."
"In 
addition, we are optimizing building controls, exterior lighting, and 
heat systems, and using the flexible options of our hybrid working 
arrangements to reduce energy consumption."
"In general, we factor 
in the characteristics of our various facilities into our conservation 
measures and work to ensure that we systematically comply with 
all applicable occupational health and safety rules."
"E.ON’s goal was therefore to 
reduce the energy consumption of its own buildings by 20 percent 
compared with a similar period in the previous year."
"Our sales 
companies in Germany achieved this by reducing their 
consumption in 2022 by about 23 percent relative to the prior 
year."
"Across all its facilities in Germany, E.ON limited the 
illumination of all non-essential light sources, such as logos and 
outdoor lighting, or to switch them off entirely."
"Room 
temperatures were reduced, and hot water was switched off 
where possible."
"A particularly effective measure was to shut down 
entire sections of a building and only heat them to a temperature 
at which the building and its infrastructure are not damaged, as 
was done at our main office buildings in Essen and Munich."
"Even before the current developments, E.ON had set a target of 
making the operation of its own buildings climate-neutral by 
2030."
"The E.ON SE Management Board reaffirmed this target by 
reiterating its support for the CEO Alliance’s Sustainable Corporate 
Building Climate Pledge."
"The CEO Alliance is an international, 
cross-sector coalition of the CEOs of 13 major European 
companies; its targeted projects are intended to help shape a more 
sustainable and resilient Europe."
"The aim of their Building Pledge is 
to make the operation of their corporate buildings climate-neutral 
by 2030 and to encourage other companies to join in."
"Diversity and Inclusion      
GRI 3-3, GRI 405 
Society is diverse."
"At E.ON, people work 
together who are likewise diverse in many ways, including 
nationality, generation, gender, culture, religion, physical and 
mental abilities, sexual orientation and identity, as well as ethnic 
and social background."
"E.ON encourages and benefits from this 
diversity and creates an inclusive environment, because the 
interaction of people with different backgrounds, abilities, and 
personalities results in good ideas."
"We want to become a diversity 
pacesetter, yet are aware that changing a corporate culture takes 
time."
"We are therefore tackling the issue step by step and would 
like to implement the necessary measures with conviction."
"E.ON’s Approach 
Diversity is one of the dimensions of E.ON’s sustainability strategy 
and an essential aspect of our vision and values."
"We want to 
ensure equal opportunity for all our employees."
"Diversity is a 
prerequisite for creativity and innovation, and we therefore aim to 
take a targeted approach to promoting it."
"E.ON signed the German 
Diversity Charter in 2008, publicly affirming its long-standing 
commitment to a tolerant and inclusive corporate culture."
"The 
Company has been an active member since 2020."
"In 2023 we 
again participated in initiatives organized by the charter, such as 
those in conjunction with German Diversity Day."
"Our motto for the 
day was “corporate networks.” Our Company intranet posted a list 
of diversity and inclusion networks for employees."
"We also 
published information and instructions on what a network is and 
how to set up one."
"Guidelines and Policies 
The E.ON Management Board and SE Works Council signed the 
Diversity and Inclusion Declaration in 2016."
"It pledges their 
commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment 
that empowers all employees to realize their individual potential."
"Likewise in 2016, the Company, the SE Works Council, and the 
Group representation for severely disabled persons signed the 
Shared Understanding of Implementing Inclusion at E.ON, creating 
an important foundation for integrating people with disabilities 
into the Company."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
E.ON views diversity as crucial for a successful work environment."
The challenges vary by country.
"E.ON’s approach to HR is mostly 
decentralized; each of our units therefore addresses diversity in its 
particular cultural context."
"This gives them the opportunity to 
meet challenges purposefully and to develop programs that reflect 
the country or regions in which they operate."
"Diversity is managed 
by Group HR/Executive HR together with a network of HR 
professionals that meets face-to-face or virtually on a regular 
basis."
"Supported by Group HR/Executive HR, the E.ON 
Management Board is responsible for setting diversity targets for 
E.ON as a whole and its units."
"Some targets may reflect the laws 
of a particular country."
"Specific Actions 
E.ON promotes diversity and equal opportunity through a variety 
of programs and networks, such as a mentoring program in 
Germany to prepare female employees for management positions."
"The Women@E.ON network aims to increase the visibility and 
influence of women at E.ON."
"In addition, the LGBT+ & Friends 
network promotes equality, diversity, and an inclusive work 
environment."
"Also, E.ON is a member in various initiatives, such as 
the Initiative Women into Leadership (“IWiL”) and the European 
Round Table (“ERT”)."
"In March 2021 the E.ON Management Board adopted measures to 
achieve more diversity and inclusion in the near term at E.ON in 
Germany."
"It also recommended that the measures be 
implemented, to the degree feasible, at E.ON units in other 
countries as well."
"One example is the promotion of co-leadership, 
in which two part-time executives share a leadership position, 
giving them greater flexibility in balancing their professional and 
private lives."
"Another flexible option is a part-time leadership 
position, in which an executive works at least 80 percent, with full 
time as an option."
"In addition, recruitment policies for 
management positions were adjusted so that at least one 
candidate on the shortlist is from the underrepresented gender."
Other measures include diversity training for executives.
"Workshops on using inclusive language in job advertisements will 
also be conducted."
"The E.ON Management Board continued its support for diversity 
networks in 2023."
"They currently sponsor the following networks: 
• adaptABILITY, an initiative for disability and mental health."
"Sponsor: Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) 
• LGBT+ & Friends, the second-placed diversity initiative at the
2021 CEO Award for D&I."
"Sponsor: Chief Financial Officer 
(“CFO”) 
• Women@E.ON, an alliance of and for women, which won the
2020 CEO Award for D&I as best network group."
"Sponsor: Chief 
Operating Officer–Networks (“COO-N”)."
"In 2023 the winners of the CEO Award for Diversity 
and Inclusion were chosen in a Group-wide vote."
"Oliver Henricks 
was honored in the Leader category."
"As a member of the 
Westenergie AG Management Board, he has proven to be an 
active supporter of the E.ON LGBT+ and Friends Network for 
Essen/Ruhr."
"He is also personally committed to the interests of 
employees with disabilities of all kinds."
"The CEO Award for 
Diversity and Inclusion in the Innovation category went to the 
enviaM Diversity Circle, an ongoing group that periodically holds 
(information) events."
"Its members are employees of different 
generations who, alongside their regular duties, are devoted to 
diversity and inclusion."
"In 2023 E.ON and six other companies participated in the pilot 
phase of the Diversity Compass, which was initiated by the 
Stifterverband and the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter)."
"The 
pilot’s aim is to design structures, tools, and measures to include 
diverse groups of people in everyday working life to consider them 
in all Company areas and processes, and to firmly engrain 
diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DE&I”) in corporate culture."
"The 
project was supported by an outside process consultant."
"The 
Diversity Compass runs for about 15 to 18 months and will be 
completed in the second quarter of 2024."
"In August 2023 E.ON was officially represented for the first time 
at the 20th Christopher Street Day in Essen, known as “Ruhr 
Pride.” On this day, about 40 E.ON employees demonstrated our 
support for openness, diversity, and acceptance."
"Participation in 
Ruhr Pride was initiated by the LGBT+ & Friends corporate 
network."
"The CEO Listening Tour, which was developed in 2021, continued 
in 2023 as well."
"This format is less about talking to employees and 
more about listening to them."
"The focus is on the work 
environment at E.ON, discrimination in the workplace, corporate 
networks, and many other topics."
"In 2023 the focus was on 
relocation within the E.ON Group and barrier-free, IT-supported 
work."
The tour will continue in 2024.
"We ran an in-house campaign on microaggression to mark 
International Day for Tolerance on November 16."
"It presented 
situations covering the various dimensions of diversity in a 
communicative manner and explained in detail the extent to which 
they can be considered microaggressions."
"Goals and Performance Review  
E.ON SE and E.ON companies in Germany must comply with the 
German Law for the Equal Participation of Women and Men in 
Leadership Positions in the Private Sector and the Public Sector, 
which took effect on May 1, 2015."
"In February 2022 the E.ON 
Management Board set new target quotas for E.ON SE for the new
implementation period beginning on July 1, 2022."
"The target 
quotas are 36 percent for the proportion of women occupying 
both the first and the second levels of management below the 
Management Board."
"The targets are to be met by June 30, 
2027.The proportion of women occupying the first level of 
management below the Management Board was 23 percent at the 
end of the 2023 financial year, that of the second of management 
below the Management Board was 29 percent."
"In addition, it was recommended that other relevant E.ON Group 
companies set appropriate quota targets even if they are not 
legally obligated to do so."
"The companies of the E.ON Group have 
heeded this recommendation."
"In addition, in 2021 E.ON set a 
voluntary Company-wide target that goes beyond statutory 
requirements."
"The target is to increase the proportion of women in 
management positions in all business units in all countries to at 
least 32 percent by year-end 2031."
"This figure corresponds to the 
proportion of women in E.ON’s workforce at year-end 2021."
"Group HR monitors progress toward the target once a year and 
reports the findings to the E.ON Management Board."
"E.ON 
discloses the respective figures at year-end for the E.ON Group as 
a whole."

"E.ON aims to provide equal pay to women and men for comparable
jobs at all Group companies."
"Due to its decentralized management 
approach, E.ON does not collect data at the Group level or assess 
the pay gap (with the exception of the United Kingdom due to its 
legal requirements)."
"2Due to the changes in segment reporting, the previous year's figures have been adjusted 
accordingly."
"The proportion of female employees increased slightly year on 
year."
"At year-end 2023, women accounted for 32 percent of our 
workforce."
"2Due to the changes in segment reporting, the previous year's figures have been adjusted

The Human Rights Policy Statement commits E.ON to freedom, 
equality, and respect for all people without distinction."
"The aim is 
to provide a fair and mutually trustful working environment to all 
employees."
"E.ON therefore does not ask for or collect information 
about employees’ ethnicity, marital status, and so forth."
"In fact, the 
laws of some countries prohibit doing so."
"Germany, however, 
obliges companies to collect and publish data about the number of 
employees with severe disabilities at their operations."

Sustainability is integral to E.ON’s corporate strategy and guides 
its actions today and will do so in the future as well."
"This obliges us 
to ensure respect for human rights in all aspects of our business, 
including our supply chain."
"E.ON therefore expects its suppliers 
worldwide to meet minimum standards in their environmental, 
social, and governance (“ESG”) performance, including in relation 
to human rights."
"E.ON assesses its suppliers’ ESG performance 
prior to doing business with them and subject suppliers in higher-
risk countries or categories to greater scrutiny."
"In addition, E.ON 
aims to comply with the legal requirements for transparency along 
its supply chain, which in many countries are becoming 
increasingly more demanding, such as the Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act in Germany (“Supply Chain Act”)."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON takes its responsibilities seriously and is therefore committed 
to doing business in a compliant way, respecting human rights, 
protecting the environment, and ensuring proper work conditions."
"E.ON expects that its suppliers are likewise committed to high ESG 
standards and has processes in place to ensure that they do."
"Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders and participating in 
industry initiatives help us to pay particular attention to human 
rights issues."
"For example, E.ON is a member of econsense, a 
network of Germany-based multinational companies dedicated to 
promoting sustainable business development and respect for 
human rights."
"E.ON also participates in a working group at the 
German Compliance Institute DICO focusing on the same 
objectives."
"The aim is to pool expertise 
and resources and to focus on the German energy industry’s 
human rights and environmental risks along its global supply and 
value chains in order to improve the human rights and 
environmental situation."
"E.ON launched a Group-wide human rights due diligence project in 
the summer of 2022 to prepare the Company for the requirements 
of the Supply Chain Act."
"The project identified gaps, developed and 
implemented optimization measures, and designed a Group-wide 
approach to human rights management."
"More information can be found below under “Organization 
and Responsibilities.”  
Guidelines and Policies 
To prevent human rights violations, E.ON aims to always adhere to 
external standards and for this purpose has its own policies and 
guidelines."
"E.ON’s Human Rights Statement, which was signed by all 
Management Board members and the Chief Human Rights Officer, 
is published on the E.ON website."
"It also refers to E.ON’s own guidelines, such 
as the Codes of Conduct for employees and suppliers."
"E.ON’s Code 
of Conduct (more information can be found in the Compliance and 
Anticorruption chapter) obliges all employees to contribute to a 
non-discriminatory and safe work environment and to respect 
human rights."
"In addition, a People Guideline provides guidance to 
employees so that they procure goods and services in line with 
E.ON’s ESG standards."
"The rules and regulations E.ON follows also 
include the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 
and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”)."
E.ON has participated in the UNGC since 2005.
"Other guidelines 
and policies are the responsibility of the individual departments 
and support the implementation of suitable preventive measures 
for areas such as HSE and compliance."
"These are described in the 
chapters entitled Environmental Management, Occupational 
Health and Safety, and Compliance and Anticorruption."
"The Supplier Code of Conduct defines standards for human rights, 
working conditions, environmental protection, and legally 
compliant, honest business practices that E.ON requires its 
suppliers to meet; it was updated on September 1, 2023, and 
applies to all suppliers."
"The current version is supplemented by 
additional requirements from the Supply Chain Act and stipulates 
the standards to be complied with in regard to fair working 
conditions in the supply chain and to climate protection."
"The E.ON Supply Chain Function Policy describes the mandate and 
organizational setup of the Supply Chain function."
"The function 
encompasses the management of procurement processes, 
activities, policies, tools, and supplier relationships for all units to 
which the policy applies."
"In addition, the Function Policy (in 
conjunction with the Supply Chain Handbook) defines Group-wide 
principles, processes, and responsibilities for non-fuel 
procurement by the above-mentioned units."
"Excluded from this 
are the special cases on a specific list (for example energy and fuel 
procurement, financial and real estate transactions, and taxes)."
"Organization and Responsibilities 
The role of Chief Human Rights Officer was previously held by the 
Chairman of the E.ON Management Board, Leonhard Birnbaum, who 
continues to serve as Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairman of 
the Sustainability Council."
"As part of the Group-wide human rights 
due diligence project, the task areas of the future Human Rights 
Officer were expanded in line with the Supply Chain Act, with a 
greater focus on legal aspects."
"In order to meet the associated new 
requirements, in January 2023 E.ON transferred the role to the 
General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer."
"He is the new Chief 
Human Rights Officer and thus responsible for monitoring our 
human rights risk management system and reports on this to the 
Management Board on a regular basis."
"He is also a permanent 
member of the Sustainability Council."
"Staff in the Sustainability 
department and the Legal Affairs, Compliance and Security division 
deal with human rights issues, such as changes in legislation."
"Depending on the issue, the Chief Human Rights Officer can 
involve the Sustainability Council or the E.ON Management Board."
"A new task area, the Human Rights Center of Expertise, was created 
as part of the human rights due diligence project."
"It assumed the 
completed project’s tasks from the summer of 2023 onward."
"The 
center, which is part of the Sustainability & Climate department, 
ensures that legal requirements are fulfilled across all divisions and 
units."
"Furthermore, it implements and maintains our human rights 
risk management system, conducts periodic risk analyses of our 
own business as well as our supply chain, and reports on them."
"It is 
also responsible for Group-wide complaints management and 
exchanges information with external stakeholders on topics 
relevant to human rights."
"In addition, it keeps the Chief Human 
Rights Officer informed about current developments and incidents 
and advises him on upcoming activities and decisions."
"All employees of Group units are responsible for ensuring that 
requirements are met at our own company."
"The Supply Chain 
division, on the other hand, deals with the full range of ESG 
aspects along the supply chain."
"It carries out the related tasks in 
observance of legal requirements as well as company policies, 
including HSE and sustainability standards."
"Risk Management pursuant to the Supply Chain Act  
We conduct periodic and ad hoc risk analyses for our own business 
and for our supply chain in order to identify human rights and 
environmental risks at an early stage."
The analyses have two stages.
"First, we use publicly available indicators and sources to assess the 
human rights and environmental risks defined by the Supply Chain 
Act."
"Examples include the Global Rights Index of the International 
Trade Union Confederation (“ITUC”) and the Human Development 
Report of the United Nations Development Programme (“UNDP”)."
"We adopt a risk-based approach that includes both country and 
industry risks."
"We also consider risks associated with specific 
procurement categories and use a digital solution for ongoing risk 
assessment of our own facilities as well as our suppliers."
"Our own 
facilities will be integrated into this digital solution starting in 
2024."
"In addition, risk analysis incorporates information received 
through our complaints process."
"Then we identify how we can 
reduce the risk potential by means of our existing measures and, 
finally, prioritize the specific risks."
"As part of risk analyses 
conducted on a regular basis, we have prioritized identified risks 
for our own facilities and for our supply chain."
"For our own 
business, we have identified occupational health and safety as a 
risk inherent in our industry and thus as a priority risk for us."
"The 
associated preventive measures are described in the 
Environmental Management and Occupational Health and Safety 
chapters."
"We established a focus 
group for our solar and battery supply chains."
"It consists of experts 
from the Procurement, Sales, and Sustainability departments and 
provides closer support for these supply chains."
"We also address 
the issue in industry initiatives like Solar Power Europe."
"Supply Chain Management 
Our supply chain management for non-fuel suppliers, to which the 
following remarks refer, consists of various preventive measures that 
are interlinked and accompany the supplier in the procurement 
process."
"They are fine-tuned on a regular basis and described below:  
The onboarding process for suppliers is carried out before a 
contract is signed."
"Its steps include self-registration by the 
supplier, a formal pledge to comply with the E.ON Supplier Code of 
Conduct, and a compliance check."
"Every non-fuel supplier whose 
individual transaction volume exceeds €25,000 must complete 
this process."
"Non-fuel suppliers that are not subject to supplier 
onboarding must agree to E.ON’s General Terms and Conditions 
for Purchase Contracts, which are legally binding."
"These oblige 
non-fuel suppliers, among other things, to comply with the 
minimum standards of our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"This approach’s purpose is to minimize potential HSE and CSR 
risks."
"As of year-end 2023, 97.4 percent of non-fuel suppliers had 
completed the onboarding process."
"New suppliers are asked by the 
manager responsible for their product or service category to register 
using the supplier onboarding solution."
"Depending on the transaction 
volume and HSE risk, suppliers must answer one or more 
questionnaires."
"In certain cases, E.ON may take additional steps."
"These include a supplier audit to check whether the supplier complies 
with E.ON’s standards for human rights, working conditions, and 
environmental protection."
"E.ON may also require a supplier to have 
in place an environmental management system certified to ISO 
14001 or Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (“EMAS”) III or a 
health and safety management system certified to ISO 45001."
"Suppliers that participate in tenders as part of a public procurement 
act do not use the above-described process but instead follow the 
qualification procedures required under their country’s laws."
"Building on the assessment procedures introduced in 2018, in the 
year under review E.ON continued to evaluate its suppliers’ 
performance and, based on the findings, make decisions about its 
relationship with them."
"Alongside onboarding, E.ON determines 
annually which of its non-fuel suppliers it deems material; E.ON 
evaluates them on the basis of five KPIs: quality, commercial 
aspects, delivery, innovation, and corporate sustainability, including 
human rights."
"E.ON discusses the results with its suppliers in 
feedback meetings."
"During this meeting, E.ON also decides 
whether it will require a supplier to take specific improvement 
measures if the business relationship is to be maintained."
"The human rights due diligence check introduced in 2021 is based 
on a human rights risk matrix that combines the risks of the different 
categories of goods and services E.ON procures with the risks of 
the countries in which suppliers operate."
"Since being updated in 
2023 the matrix covers all of E.ON’s procurement categories."
"Potentially risky suppliers first had to pass additional checks, such 
as a more detailed questionnaire or audit, and agree to make 
improvements and provide evidence of their implementation."
"In 
2023, more than 3,600 new and existing suppliers answered the 
questionnaire."
"Many high-risk suppliers successfully completed 
the human rights due diligence check."
"Suppliers that have 
difficulty answering the questionnaire or providing evidence of 
their measures are supported and closely monitored."
"In the second quarter of 2022 E.ON began introducing a digital 
solution for ongoing risk assessment of suppliers with medium and 
high human rights risk."
"They are assessed in a variety of 
categories, including sustainability, finance, cybersecurity, supply 
chain disruption, and compliance."
"The digital solution looks at 
several elements called points of interest (“PoIs”): the holding 
company of suppliers, branches, plant locations, and logistics 
routes."
"Since the program’s introduction, over 3,800 PoIs have 
been monitored on an ongoing basis, thereby covering 60 percent 
of E.ON’s annual spend."
"Nevertheless, E.ON is aware that the 
complexity of international supply chains poses a challenge to 
transparency."
"E.ON is therefore also active in industry initiatives to 
develop industry-specific standards for improved transparency in 
supply chains, as described above under “E.ON’s Approach” and in 
the ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement chapter."
"Specific Actions  
Multistage Supplier Analysis  
In 2023 we conducted a multistage analysis of various product 
categories, including transformers, inverters, solar systems, 
batteries, and circuit breakers."
"The analysis was not only of end 
products, but also preliminary stages, including electronic 
components as well as chemicals and raw materials used."
"The findings indicated clear differences between product 
categories and thus provided important insights for future 
measures to improve sustainability at the product and supplier level."
"Overall, the analysis makes an important contribution to enhancing 
E.ON Supply Chain’s environmental and social responsibility."
"Decarbonization  
A first step toward decarbonizing supply chains is to make the 
current CO2 emissions of purchased goods and services more 
transparent."
"In 2022 E.ON therefore conducted a heatmap 
analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chains 
based on third-party emissions factors and cost-based data."
"We 
will repeat the analysis on an annual basis."
"In 2023 the analysis 
included taking a closer look at lower-emissions metals and sulfur 
hexafluoride (“SF6”) gas."
"More information on our reduction efforts 
can be found in the Climate Protection chapter."
"More than 80 percent of employees had completed the 
module by the end of 2023."
"In addition, E.ON trained about 320 Supply Chain employees on 
respect for human rights along the supply chain, new aspects of 
onboarding, and E.ON’s risk matrix for human rights."
"Goals and Performance Review 
E.ON’s objective is to avoid violations of human rights, 
environmental standards, and its corporate principles."
"For this 
purpose, E.ON endeavors to identify the relevant risks along its 
value chain."
"Periodic risk assessments can help E.ON detect actual 
or suspected violations."
"If violations occur, the Supply Chain 
Compliance Officer and the respective Supply Chain Director are 
notified immediately and corrective measures are demanded from 
the supplier."
Implementation is precisely monitored by E.ON.
"If the 
situation does not improve, E.ON terminates its business 
relationship with the supplier."
"No business relationships were 
terminated for this reason in 2023."
"Employees can report possible violations of human rights through 
internal reporting channels and a Group-wide, IT-supported, 
external Whistleblower hotline."
"The hotline service, which is 
published on the Internet, can take calls in the official languages of 
all countries in which E.ON operates."
"Not only E.ON employees, 
but also business partners, their employees, and other third parties 
can contact the hotline, anonymously if they wish."
"The information 
is forwarded to the responsible department at Corporate 
Functions."
"Depending on the type and severity of the potential 
violation, the Compliance department immediately reports it to the 
E.ON Management Board, files criminal charges, initiates its own 
investigation, or takes other measures."
"In 2023 the Whistleblower 
system was used to report four potential human rights violations."
"The investigation found that the allegations were not a violation of 
human rights or E.ON’s Code of Conduct."
"Excursus: Biomass  
E.ON is committed to procuring the fuel for its biomass-fired assets 
responsibly and sustainably."
"Suppliers of solid biomass must, like 
non-fuel suppliers, contractually agree to comply with our Supplier 
Code of Conduct."
"Until March 2023, the E.ON Biomass Purchasing 
Amendment from 2010 defined our policies and procedures, 
which include risk assessments, supplier audits, and provisions for 
joint ventures."
"Effective March 2023, we redefined the terms for 
the purchase of solid biomass for our Energy Infrastructure 
Solutions (“EIS”) business and thus replaced the former Biomass 
Purchasing Amendment."
"The purpose of the new rules is to ensure 
that all relevant units act in accordance with applicable EU 
regulations and meet E.ON’s sustainability standards when 
procuring and using solid biomass for their business activities."
"All 
biomass suppliers must pledge to respect human rights, safeguard 
the general living conditions of persons affected by biomass 
production, and protect biodiversity and the environment."
A large proportion of our biomass capacity is installed in Sweden.
"E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB operates district heating businesses 
in Örebro, Nörrköping, and parts of Stockholm and Malmö."
"Since 
2014, E.ON has assessed the CSR performance of its suppliers 
there using a method developed by E.ON Energiinfrastruktur AB."
"In addition, key requirements for biomass suppliers—such as the 
Supplier Code of Conduct and compliance with the EU Renewable 
Energy Directive II (“RED II”)—have been integral to contracts with 
suppliers since 2021."
"In 2022 E.ON introduced an expanded in-
house assessment of sustainability-related risks and applied it in 
2023 as well."
"Uranium Procurement  
Owing to legislation amended in 2022, E.ON subsidiary 
PreussenElektra continued to operate Isar 2 nuclear power plant 
until April 15, 2023, after which the plant stopped producing 
electricity."
"No additional fuel had to be procured for extended 
operations."
PreussenElektra stopped procuring uranium in 2020.
"Tax    
GRI 3-3 
E.ON considers good corporate governance to consist primarily of 
responsible and value-oriented management."
"This also includes 
having a transparent tax strategy."
"E.ON’s tax strategy and corporate 
strategy are closely aligned."
"The aim is to manage the Company’s 
taxes sustainably in order to help ensure that it continues to invest,
to operate flexibly and efficiently, and to provide attractive dividends 
to shareholders."
"E.ON’s tax strategy is therefore designed to be 
fully compliant with tax law."
"It ensures that management of 
E.ON’s taxation is efficient, responsible, transparent, and accurate, 
both for the Group as a whole and in individual tax jurisdictions."
"E.ON’s Approach 
E.ON is aware of its social responsibility regarding its significance 
as a tax payer."
"It aims for full tax compliance and adheres to all 
national and international tax legislation and standards."
"E.ON also 
has in place policies and procedures to prevent tax evasion."
"Guidelines and Policies 
E.ON’s tax function encompasses Group Tax as well as the units’ 
Tax departments."
"It actively and continually identifies, assesses, 
and monitors tax risks to make sure that the Company’s tax 
practices are in line with its strategic objectives."
"To achieve this 
and to ensure appropriate responses to risks, E.ON has in place a 
governance framework, which includes a Tax Function Policy."
"The
framework and policy were approved by the E.ON Management 
Board and are mandatory for all Group companies."
"The Tax function has also published the 
aforementioned tax strategy."
"E.ON does not make use of jurisdictions publicly identified as non-
cooperative—also know as tax oases—to reduce its effective tax 
burden."
"E.ON does not relocate any business activities in low-tax 
jurisdictions with the primary goal of thereby achieving lower 
taxation."
"E.ON does not use any aggressive tax-reducing 
structures, particularly no structures that lack a business reason or 
motive."
"E.ON’s tax planning always adopts the principle of 
complying with both letter and the spirit of the law."
"E.ON has issued a binding Group-wide Transfer Pricing Policy to 
ensure that intra-Group transactions are conducted in accordance 
with the arm’s-length principle."
"This principle of international tax 
law states that the transfer prices of cross-border transactions 
between Group units, including all ownership interests above 25 
percent, must be set as they would be in a comparable transaction 
between independent third parties in an external market."
"Group 
Tax is responsible for monitoring adherence to the arm’s-length 
principle and is involved in all major intra-Group transactions."
"It 
does this through various means, including regular meetings with 
relevant E.ON business units and functions as well as fixed Group-
wide transfer pricing processes."
"In addition, participants from 
relevant business units and functions (in Germany and elsewhere) 
meet at least once a year to align cross-border intra-Group 
transactions to meet operational as well as tax requirements."
Transfer pricing processes are monitored on an ongoing basis.
"Organization and Responsibilities 
The E.ON Management Board has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s corporate strategy, which includes managing and 
monitoring the tax function."
"It has delegated the responsibility for 
this function to the Senior Vice President (“SVP”) Group Tax, who 
reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer."
"The heads of the Tax 
departments in Germany and other countries report directly to 
Group Tax as well as to their unit’s management board."
"Furthermore, E.ON SE has appointed a Tax Compliance Officer 
(“TCO”), whose role is to ensure that the existing tax compliance 
management system is effective and efficient."
"The TCO reports 
directly to the SVP Group Tax."
"Additionally, local tax compliance 
management systems were put in place at the level of 
independent tax groups in Germany and other countries."
"The SVP Group Tax defines E.ON’s tax principles, and is 
responsible for ensuring that these principles and concomitant 
procedures are in place, maintained, and complied with Group-
wide."
"He reports to the E.ON Supervisory Board’s Audit and Risk 
Committee on tax-related issues and risks."
"In addition, financial tax 
risks are reported to Group Controlling and Risk, which examines 
these risks from a Group perspective and prepares reports for the 
consolidated risk assessment of the E.ON Group."
"The tax function 
disseminates guidelines and policies to ensure tax compliance, 
including related tasks, processes, and responsibilities."
"E.ON has in 
place tax compliance management systems according to IDW 
audit standard PS 980 at its major operations in Germany."
"The 
systems’ purpose is to identify and classify all material tax risks 
and to map the findings in a detailed risk control matrix (“RCM”)."
The RCMs are continually updated and maintained.
"Specific Actions 
E.ON’s tax function takes a variety of steps to stay on top of new 
developments."
"Teams and managers hold meetings at various 
intervals (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to discuss emerging tax 
issues."
"E.ON’s tax experts also meet at slightly longer intervals 
(monthly, quarterly, or annually) to discuss country-specific and 
international tax issues."
"These meetings, which take place both 
physically and virtually, promote continuous collaboration and 
coordination between Group Tax and the units’ Tax departments."
"In addition, Tax teams and managers also receive in-house training."
"E.ON strives to continually improve processes, particularly by 
deploying and using digital solutions that ensure tax compliance 
while enhancing efficiency."
"Our digital solutions include an 
integrated toolset that calculates income tax for quarterly and 
annual financial statements and tax returns."
"Tax tools are updated 
on a regular basis to reflect changes in tax laws."
"This enables us to
ensure that our calculations always comply with the law."
"Where 
reasonable, we implement software interfaces to ensure data 
integrity and to minimize the risk of manual errors."
"E.ON employees participate in a variety of working groups and 
committees of trade associations, such as the Federation of 
German Industries (German abbreviation: “BDI”), the German 
Association of Energy and Water Industries (German abbreviation: 
“BDEW”), and Chambers of Commerce."
"This enables them to 
contribute to the discussion on new tax legislation as well (for 
more information on E.ON’s work in associations, see the ESG 
Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement chapter)."
"Goals and Performance Review 
E.ON and its tax function place great emphasis on maintaining 
transparent and mutual communications with the tax authorities in
the countries where the Company does operates."
"We prepare and 
file all required tax returns and pay the correct amount of tax on 
time and adopt the principle of complying with both letter and the 
spirit of the law."
"We seek advice from independent experts to 
clarify matters of doubt and uncertainties."
"To achieve a higher level of certainty, E.ON regularly discusses 
binding tax rulings or advance pricing agreements (“APA”) with tax 
authorities if this is possible, expedient, and of general or economic 
importance to E.ON."
"Our aim is to prevent subsequent disagreements 
between the tax authorities of different states and our business units."
"E.ON partners with external tax experts that help it supervise 
company audits and prepare tax returns and declarations as well as
tax payments."
"The collaboration with external partners is based on 
open, mutually trustful communications."
"Each partner performs its
own independent quality assurance, which, in the aggregate, leads 
to adequate quality checks."
"E.ON constantly aims for certainty in 
its tax positions and, where appropriate, obtains internal or external 
advice to verify and validate its positions."
"In case our assessment 
does not match that of the tax authorities, we communicate the 
divergent opinion openly in order to prevent misunderstandings."
"Sustainable energy is not essential for propelling 
economic and social development, but a key factor in tackling 
climate change."
"Meeting the global challenges of climate change 
will require that the financial system changes so that it promotes 
sustainable businesses and climate-friendly solutions."
"E.ON’s 
ambitious climate targets set it on an emissions-reduction path 
that is systematically aligned with the new energy world."
"Sustainability is at the core of our corporate strategy and is also 
the guiding principle for our actions."
"Our strategy accords with the 
European Union’s decarbonization agenda and the EU Green Deal."
"Energy networks—one of E.ON’s core businesses—are the platform 
for Europe’s energy transition."
"Our investment program therefore 
aims to be largely aligned with the EU taxonomy."
"More than half of 
our funding needs will be met by the issuance of green bonds."
"Our 
strategy thus also reflects capital markets’ increasing interest in 
sustainable investments."
"The Commission laid the foundation 
for this in Regulation 2020/852, the EU Taxonomy Regulation, 
which describes what is considered an “environmentally 
sustainable activity”, and which criteria are used to classify an 
economic activity as environmentally sustainable."
"The six objectives are: 
1."
"Climate change mitigation
2."
"Climate change adaptation 
3."
"The sustainable use and protection of water and marine 
resources 
4."
"The transition to a circular economy 
5."
"Pollution prevention and control 
6."
"Sets of criteria are available for defining 
the substantial contribution toward achieving the objectives."
"In the 
2022 and 2021 financial years, these sets of criteria were only 
available for the first two environmental objectives."
"Known as technical screening criteria (“TSC”), they specify which 
economic activities are considered taxonomy-aligned."
"Reporting 
on the taxonomy-alignment of economic activities with regard to 
environmental objectives 3 to 6 is only mandatory for the 2024 
financial year onward; reporting on taxonomy-eligibility is required 
for the 2023 financial year."
"Activities are 
taxonomy-eligible if they are described in principle in Annexes I 
and II to the Delegated Act on environmental objectives and can be 
assigned, regardless of whether the corresponding TSC for 
environmentally sustainable activities are met."
"In addition to the information required by law, E.ON voluntarily 
disclosed its taxonomy-aligned investments, revenues, and 
operating expenditures for the 2021 financial year."
"Activities are 
taxonomy-aligned if the corresponding taxonomy-eligible activities 
also meet all the criteria in Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy."
"These 
disclosures have been mandatory since 2022."
"However, the criteria’s provisions, 
formulations, and terms are still subject to uncertainties of 
interpretation."
"The following presents our interpretation of the 
sets of criteria."
"This is intended to 
accelerate the transition toward a carbon-neutral future 
characterized predominantly by renewable energy sources."
"Application of the supplementary act has been mandatory since 
the 2022 financial year."
"Regarding nuclear energy, E.ON has come to the conclusion, based 
on a comprehensive review, that the temporary continued 
operation of Isar 2 nuclear power plant until April 2023, did not fall 
under any of the activities described in the supplementary 
delegated act."
"The sets of criteria for generating electricity, heat, and/or cooling 
from fossil gas are fundamentally relevant for E.ON."
"E.ON installs 
and operates plants that are taxonomy-aligned within the meaning 
of the EU’s new gas economic activities."
"E.ON did not, or did not 
fully, meet the criteria for taxonomy alignment in the 2023 
financial year."
"At the same time, it published 
amendments to the delegated act on the first two environmental 
objectives and the delegated act on disclosure."
"The amendments 
include additional economic activities, adjustments to some DNSH 
criteria, and changes resulting from the publication of the 
delegated act on environmental objectives 3 to 6."
"The economic activities described in the Delegated Act on 
environmental objectives 3 to 6 are, comparatively, not relevant 
for E.ON as an energy company."
"To avoid double counting, we continue to 
assign the economic activities to environmental objective 1, 
“Climate change mitigation.” This confirms the significant 
contribution that E.ON’s business model makes to climate 
protection."
"Of the activities relevant to E.ON as a whole, the following 
activities are of particular importance."
"E.ON is an energy company, 
and thus, its activities in these segments are extensively covered 
by the economic activities listed in the EU taxonomy."
"E.ON’s business activities are continually mapped to 
the relevant taxonomy criteria."
"We consider revenues to be the 
main criterion; that is, E.ON’s activities are allocated to the 
taxonomy’s economic activity with which revenues are or are 
supposed to be generated."
"The check’s findings 
are documented for any taxonomy-relevant economic activities 
identified."
"This documentation is collated in an EU taxonomy 
manual that is binding for all E.ON companies."
"The companies use 
the manual’s specifications to determine the extent to which their 
business activities actually meet the taxonomy’s technical 
screening criteria and create suitable records for this purpose."
"E.ON conducts the analysis of taxonomy-alignment in detail as
follows: 
Assessment of Substantial Contribution 
Compliance with the technical screening criteria is generally 
assessed and documented individually for each economic activity 
and at the companies on a decentralized basis."
"If the criteria 
provide for simplifications that allow compliance with the criteria 
to be assessed at the level of the entire economic activity, an 
operating segment, or for the entire Group, E.ON makes use of 
them."
"Assessment of Doing No Significant Harm (“DNSH”) 
The DNSH criteria mainly refer to compliance with legal 
requirements or, in the case of the “circular economy” objective, to 
fundamental aspects of the economic activity."
"DNSH conformity is 
therefore to be assessed at the level of an economic activity on a 
regular basis."
"DNSH conformity regarding EU environmental 
objective 2, “Climate change adaptation,” is identified and assessed 
in E.ON’s established risk management process."
"For this purpose, 
E.ON makes use of existing systems and processes for financial 
and non-financial risk management, which it has expanded to 
include EU taxonomy matters."
"Details can be found in the Risks 
and Chances Report."
"Assessments of Minimum Safeguards 
E.ON uses established processes and documentation at the Group
level to assess and comply with the minimum safeguards."
"The 
Group ensures that the EU taxonomy’s requirements are fully met 
in this regard by means of appropriate guidelines and related 
training and monitoring measures."
"E.ON companies are required to 
implement such policies and guidelines in a binding manner."
Responsibility for compliance lies with the respective companies.
"Substantial Contribution to Climate Change Mitigation 
By definition, electricity generation from wind and solar as well as 
run-of-river hydropower plants makes a substantial contribution 
to climate change mitigation within the meaning of the taxonomy."
"No other criteria for the assessment of their substantial 
contribution to climate protection need to be assessed."
"The same 
applies to the installation of devices such as solar panels, smart 
energy meters, and electric-vehicle charging stations in buildings."
"E.ON’s activities to establish infrastructure for personal eMobility 
meet the required criteria for creating low-carbon road transport."
"E.ON’s electricity networks make a substantial contribution to 
climate change mitigation within the meaning of the taxonomy, 
since they are downstream distribution networks, and thus part of 
the European interconnected system."
E.ON operates a large number of heating networks.
"This activity is 
in principle taxonomy-eligible."
"Some of these heating networks are 
“efficient” within the meaning of the taxonomy’s criteria."
"This 
means that they transmit at least 50 percent renewable heat, at 
least 50 percent waste heat, at least 75 percent CHP heat, or at 
least 50 percent of a combination of these energy sources."
"Such 
heating networks thus make a substantial contribution to climate 
protection."
"In addition, E.ON operates water supply systems, the majority of 
which make a substantial contribution to climate change 
mitigation because they meet the energy-efficiency criterion (less 
than 0.5 kWh per cubic meter of water) and/or the leakage 
threshold of 1.5."
"For water supply systems that do not meet these 
criteria, investments made in the financial year to improve their 
energy efficiency and/or leakage rate by at least 20 percent are 
classified as taxonomy-aligned investments."
"The significant 
contribution to the sustainable use and protection of marine 
resources is made through the operation of water supply systems 
that provide consumers with high water quality and at the same 
time contribute to the efficiency of water resources."
"These water 
supply systems revenues are classified as taxonomy-aligned if the 
investments enabled them to meet the aforementioned criteria for 
taxonomy-aligned water supply systems."
"In the case of gas networks, in particular investments in existing 
infrastructure that increase the possibility of blending hydrogen 
and other low-carbon gases were classified as taxonomy-aligned."
"Pilot projects to establish dedicated hydrogen infrastructure were 
also assessed to be taxonomy-aligned."
"This also applies to 
investments and operating expenses related to the detection 
and/or prevention of methane leaks."
E.ON operates a large number of CHP and heat generation plants.
"Depending on the energy source used, there are various sets of 
criteria, some of which are met by E.ON plants."
"Plants fueled solely 
by natural gas will be classified as taxonomy-eligible under the 
new sets of criteria but are not classified as taxonomy-aligned at 
present."
"Investments in the development of broadband data infrastructure 
are classified as taxonomy-aligned because the data and analyses 
provided by them lead directly to the reduction of GHG emissions 
at E.ON or its customers."
"Do No Significant Harm 
Protecting assets against the physical impacts of climate change 
(“Climate change adaptation”) is economically relevant for E.ON 
and is therefore factored into investment decisions."
"Climate-
related risks and opportunities are also recorded in E.ON’s risk 
management system."
"The Risks and Chances Report contains 
more information."
"The criteria for the EU’s environmental objective 3, “sustainable 
use and protection of water and marine resources,” mainly refer to 
legal and regulatory requirements in the energy sector."
"Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite for obtaining 
construction and operating permits."
"The same applies in principle 
to the criteria for the EU’s environmental objective 5, “pollution 
prevention and control.” Details can be found in the Environmental 
Management chapter."
"There are general criteria for the environmental objective 4, 
“transition to a circular economy,” such as long durability, easy 
disassembly, or reparability."
"Most components are designed for a 
very long lifespan, are recyclable, and still have economic value at 
the end of their useful life (such as steel, aluminum, and copper)."
"Such components of assets can be recycled within the E.ON Group 
or sold to third parties for further use."
"Furthermore, one of E.ON’s important 
ambitions is to conduct ecological corridor management or to 
convert to this approach."
"Compliance with the Minimum Safeguards 
E.ON is committed to respecting human rights in all business 
processes."
"To prevent human rights violations, E.ON adheres to 
external standards and defines its own principles and policies."
"E.ON’s Human Rights Policy Statement explicitly acknowledges 
the United Nations’ International Bill of Human Rights and the 
International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work and the latter’s fundamental 
conventions."
"The statement also makes reference to E.ON’s own 
policies, such as the Supplier Code of Conduct and the Code of 
Conduct for employees."
"The standards for human rights, work 
conditions, environmental protection, and compliant business 
practices that E.ON requires its suppliers to meet are defined in the 
Supplier Code of Conduct."
"Conducting a periodic risk assessment serves to indicate potential 
threats."
"E.ON promotes compliance with its standards and 
minimize potential threats by means of numerous measures and 
processes."
"The principle focus of these activities at E.ON’s own 
business is on occupational safety and fair work conditions."
"Additional information about the assurance of a responsible supply 
chain, compliance and anti-corruption, and tax is contained in the 
chapters on these topics."
"EU Taxonomy Key Figures 
E.ON’s reporting applies the indicators defined in Article 8 of the 
Taxonomy Regulation: taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned 
investments, revenues, and operating expenses."
"All business 
operations identified at E.ON are assigned to precisely one of the 
EU taxonomy’s economic activities in order to prevent double 
counting."
"E.ON reports the following three indicators for investments, 
revenues, and operating expenses: 
1."
"Taxonomy-eligible activities as a ratio of the total amount 
shown in the E.ON Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements 
prepared according to IFRS 
2."
"Taxonomy-aligned activities as a ratio of the total amount 
shown in the E.ON Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements 
prepared according to IFRS 
3."
"Taxonomy-aligned activities as a ratio of taxonomy-eligible 
activities 
Investments 
Investments were calculated on a gross basis; that is, without 
taking into account revaluations or depreciation and amortization 
or impairment charges."
"They consist of investments in non-current 
tangible and intangible assets (fixed assets), including assets 
acquired in asset deals (recorded directly) and share deals 
(investment amount determined by the purchase-price allocation)."
"The numerator 
is equal to, respectively, taxonomy-eligible, or taxonomy-aligned 
proportion of Group investments."
"Of E.ON’s taxonomy-eligible investments, property, plant, and 
equipment accounted for €5,066 million, intangible assets for 
€325 million, and right-of-use assets for €472 million."
"€4,941  million of property, plant, and equipment, €325 million of 
intangible assets, and €468 million of right-of-use assets are 
taxonomy-aligned."
"In each case the lion’s share went toward our 
electricity networks (economic activity 4.9)."
"In accordance with the taxonomy’s specifications, E.ON also 
includes non-cash-effective investments, but not additions to 
financial assets."
"The taxonomy’s definition of investments differs 
from E.ON’s internal performance indicator for investments, 
namely cash-effective investments."
"E.ON therefore reconciles 
total investments pursuant to the taxonomy to the investments 
disclosed in the “Financial Situation” section of the Business 
Report: 
 
At E.ON, all investments in the 2023 financial year fall under 
category a) of the Annex to the Taxonomy Regulation."
"An 
investment plan according to category b) or investments according 
to category c) do not exist at E.ON."
"Reconciliation to Cash-effective Investments

"Non-cash-effective investments

+ Cash-effective financial investments

./."
"These figures are included in the 
denominator, whereas the corresponding taxonomy-eligible 
and/or -aligned revenues are shown in the numerator."
"Operating Expenses  
The denominator for operating expenses is to be specified in 
accordance with the taxonomy requirements."
"At 
E.ON, this mainly includes expenditures for repair and 
maintenance performed by third parties, which are reported under 
cost of materials and other operating expenses."
"The numerator 
reflects, respectively, the taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned 
proportion of operating expenses."
"Below we report on Group-wide EU taxonomy investments, 
operating expenses, and revenue by segment."
"Details on the EU 
taxonomy key figures by economic activity are presented in detail 
under EU Taxonomy in the Other Information section."
"Investments 
In the 2023 financial year,73 percent of core-business 
investments were within the scope of the EU taxonomy 
(taxonomy-eligible)."
"Taxonomy-aligned activities accounted for 
98 percent of taxonomy-eligible investments."
The Energy Networks segment made a significant contribution.
"About 82 percent of its investments were taxonomy-eligible; 
nearly all of them were taxonomy-aligned."
"At roughly €4.5 billion, 
the largest contribution came from E.ON’s electricity distribution 
networks, which are part of the European interconnected system."
"They continually integrate renewable generating facilities, thereby 
propelling the energy transition in Europe and connecting 
customers to sustainable energy."
"E.ON invested significantly more 
in taxonomy-aligned electricity networks compared with the 
previous year."
"This trend is supported by the digitalization of 
E.ON’s networks through the expansion of fiber-optics and broad-
band technology."
"E.ON invested €289  million in this area in the 
year under review."
"In addition, €382 million of investments in gas networks were 
taxonomy-aligned and thus increased significantly relative to the 
prior year."
"In Germany in particular, these investments serve to 
establish and expand hydrogen infrastructure or enable hydrogen 
to be admixed to E.ON’s existing gas networks."
"€77 million of the 
investments in our water networks were taxonomy-aligned."
"The Customer Solutions segment’s taxonomy-aligned investments 
totaled €0.4 billion."
"Its businesses that install, maintain, and 
devices for measuring, regulating, and controlling buildings’ overall 
energy efficiency represented its main contributor to the EU 
taxonomy."
"The expansion of its assets for district heating 
distribution as well as its energy-infrastructure business, which 
encompasses biofuel-fired electricity and heat cogeneration, as 
well as investments in plants for heat production with combined 
feedstocks are likewise covered by the taxonomy."
"The 
procurement and sale of power and gas are not covered by the 
taxonomy."
"E.ON’s distributed solar generating facilities 
contributed additional amounts."
"We invested in solar projects in 
2023, for example in Germany."
"2Due to the changes in segment reporting, the previous year's figures have been adjusted accordingly."
"Operating Expenses 
In the 2023 financial year, E.ON had around €1.3 billion in 
operating expenses that meet the definitions of the EU taxonomy."
"€393 million of these expenses were not taxonomy-eligible, and 
€855 million were taxonomy-aligned."
"This corresponds to around 
97 percent of taxonomy-eligible expenses."
"As with investments, the majority of aligned expenses resulted, as 
in the prior year, from maintenance activities for E.ON’s electricity 
network (€754  million)."
"Smaller amounts related to gas 
distribution networks, particularly to prevent or reduce methane 
leaks (€28 million)."
"The business with decentralized electricity and/or heat/cooling 
generation plants accounted for more than €20 million."
"€30 million was related to the installation and maintenance of 
renewable technologies at the Customer Solutions segment."
"The proportion of the respective taxonomy-aligned as well as 
taxonomy-eligible operating expenses by economic activity are 
therefore at the prior-year level."
"However, 
revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to end-customers are 
not covered by the EU taxonomy."
"As expected, therefore, only 
19 percent of external sales were taxonomy-eligible."
"Nearly all taxonomy-eligible revenues were also taxonomy-
aligned, of which the vast majority—€16.2 billion—related to 
electricity transmission fees in E.ON’s distribution networks."
"E.ON 
reports €12.6 billion as external taxonomy-aligned revenues in the 
Energy Networks segment and €3.9 billion in the Customer 
Solutions segment from sales revenues for network charges 
insofar as these were attributable to E.ON’s own distribution 
network territory."
"Our energy infrastructure business, which generates decentralized 
electricity and/or heat/cooling from a variety of sources generated 
around €0.1 billion in aligned revenues."
"The proportions of the respective taxonomy-aligned as well as 
taxonomy-eligible revenues by economic activity are therefore at 
the prior-year level."
"Sustainability aspects play an 
increasingly important role in many international investors’ 
decision for or against a particular investment."
"Accordingly, E.ON 
has also systematically considered sustainability in the structuring 
of its financing as well, both in debt and credit markets."
"In 2019 E.ON presented its first Green Bond Framework under 
which it issues green bonds."
"E.ON issued its first green bonds that 
same year."
"In 2021 E.ON then became the first company to fully 
align its revised Green Bond Framework not only with the ICMA 
Green Bond Principles—the current market standard for green 
bonds—but also with the EU Taxonomy."
"The taxonomy defines 
which economic activities are classified as environmentally 
sustainable, thereby setting a Europe-wide standard for 
sustainable investment."
"E.ON had €10.15 billion of green bonds 
outstanding at year-end 2023, making it Germany’s second-
largest issuer of green bonds."
"The green bonds issued in the year 
under review accounted for €2.5 billion of this amount."
"E.ON 
secured over €1.5 billion of green bond financing in January 2024."
"E.ON intends to cover more than 50 percent of its annual financing 
requirements with green bonds."
"E.ON’s Green Bond Framework focuses on sustainable projects in 
the categories Electricity Networks, Renewable Energy, Energy 
Efficiency, and Clean Transportation, both in E.ON’s electricity 
network and customer solutions businesses."
"E.ON’s Green Bond 
Portfolio, a portfolio of qualifying assets in line with the Green 
Bond Framework, consisted of assets worth €24.2 billion at year-
end 2023."
"E.ON’s electricity networks in Germany and Sweden 
account for the largest share."
"Alongside its focus on green bonds, E.ON’s corporate financing 
includes a sustainability-linked €3.5 billion syndicated credit 
facility that was concluded in 2019."
"After two options to extend 
the facility were exercised, its term ends in October 2026."
"The 
facility’s credit margin is linked, among other things, to the 
development of certain ESG ratings."
"This gives us additional 
financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy."
"The 
ESG ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI 
ESG Research, and Sustainalytics."
"The facility serves as a reliable 
and sustainable liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be 
drawn on as needed."
"ESG Ratings of E.ON     
E.ON has been included in numerous ESG ratings for years."
"In 
addition, our regional and national sustainability activities regularly 
receive awards."
"In the new compensation system for Management 
Board members, ESG ratings are a component of the E.ON 
Sustainability Index and represent a performance criterion that is 
taken into account in the Management Board’s long-term variable 
compensation."
"In the ESG ratings that are important to us, E.ON 
has received predominantly good scores for years."
"In 2023 E.ON 
significantly improved its score in two important ESG ratings."
"The 
Sustainability Channel at eon.com presents the most relevant and 
current results."
"The next section takes a closer look at four ratings 
that are relevant for E.ON."
"CDP Climate Change 
In 2023 CDP once again placed E.ON on its A List for 
environmental reporting."
"E.ON’s current rating is in the Leadership 
Level, placing E.ON among the top 346 companies out of nearly 
15,000 assessed to make the A List in 2023."
"ISS ESG 
International Shareholder Services (“ISS”) upgraded E.ON from a 
C+ rating to B-, giving us Prime status."
"This means E.ON meets ISS 
ESG’s high standards for sustainability performance in its industry."
The letter ratings range from D- to A+.
"In addition, E.ON’s decile 
rank is 3."
"The decile rank indicates in which decile of its industry 
(tenth of the total number) a company’s rating falls."
"The ranks go 
from 1 (best: a company’s rating is in the top decile of its industry) 
to 10 (lowest)."
"MSCI ESG Research 
MSCI is one of the world’s best-known index providers."
"MSCI uses 
its own ESG ratings to create its sustainability indices."
"MSCI gave 
E.ON a rating of AA."
Its rating scale extends from CCC to AAA.
"Sustainalytics 
Sustainalytics is a global leader in providing ESG and corporate 
governance research and ratings."
"In 2023 E.ON significantly 
improved its Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating."
"After receiving a 
score of 23.2 points in the medium risk category in the prior year, 
E.ON now has 17.6 points and is assessed to be low risk."
"E.ON is 
therefore ranked fourth out of the 101 companies rated in its 
subindustry."
"ESG Asset Management and Pension Assets     
E.ON links the provision and investment of pension assets to 
sustainable purposes: by financing a company pension plan and by 
considering sustainability criteria when making decisions about 
how the plan’s assets are invested."
"E.ON draws, for example, on 
the Norwegian State Pension Fund’s research and embargo lists in 
order to avoid questionable investments."
"We also select asset 
managers whose investment processes systematically take ESG 
aspects into account."
"In addition, E.ON continually develops its 
own ESG approach to the investment process in order to adapt to 
the latest developments at the Company and in the market."
"High inflation and interest rate 
increases by central banks also had a negative impact on the global 
economy in the year under review."
"This is reflected in forecasts for 
gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth."
"The OECD predicts global 
GDP growth of 2.9 percent in 2023, which is below the 3.3 
percent growth recorded in 2022."
"Economic Developments in the EU 
Economic development in the eurozone could not escape the 
influence of interest rate increases and inflation either, which was 
reflected in GDP."
"The OECD predicts eurozone GDP growth of just 
0.6 percent in 2023."
"The European Central Bank (“ECB”) 
responded to persistently high inflation throughout the eurozone 
in 2022 by reversing its monetary policy in mid-2022 and raising 
its key interest rate—by 0.5 percentage points—for the first time in 
16 years."
"Additional rate increases followed, bringing the key 
interest rate to 2.5 percent at the end of December 2022."
"The ECB 
continued this interest rate policy in 2023 and raised the key 
interest rate in several steps (September 2023) to 4.5 percent."
"The 
ECB’s purpose is to make loans more expensive, dampen demand, 
and counteract high inflation rates in order to bring inflation back 
down to a medium-term target of 2 percent."
"The increase in the 
key interest rate had the desired effect on inflation."
"The inflation 
rate in the eurozone was 5.3 percent in July 2023 but fell to 2.9 
percent in December."
"Economic Developments in Germany 
The OECD’s June 2023 economic forecast for Germany still 
considered stagnation possible for the reporting year, whereas 
Germany’s GDP shrank by 0.2 percent (according to the OECD) or 
by 0.3 percent (according to the German Federal Statistical Office)."
"Interest-rate increases constitute a key reason for this 
development."
"Their intent was to counteract inflation, but they 
also dampened economic activity."
"Inflation, which averaged 6.6 percent in 2023 according to the 
OECD, affected the economy and households throughout the year."
"Development of Energy Prices 
Wholesale energy prices declined significantly over the course of 
2023 compared with the prior year."
"The already-achieved and 
continued expansion of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) import 
capacity diminished the direct impact of the ongoing war in 
Ukraine on Europe’s supply situation."
"At the end of last winter’s 
heating period in March 2023, 48 terminals were already in 
operation in Europe and additional terminals were being planned."
"In addition, generally mild weather conditions last winter made it 
possible to conserve gas reserves in underground storage facilities 
compared with prior years."
"The EU-wide inventory level on April 1, 
2023, was still around 56 percent (prior year: only around 27 
percent)."
"This helped enable facility operators to fill their storage 
facilities by the start of the six-month winter season on October 1, 
2023, because demand and thus pressure on wholesale prices 
were correspondingly lower."
"Gas storage facilities were already 
around 96 percent full at this date and were still around 86 
percent full at year-end."
"At the time of this report’s publication, reliable statements about 
reductions in customers’ consumption for the winter as a whole 
were not yet possible due to weather factors."
"In the winter of 
2022/23, households in Germany, for example, reduced their 
consumption by about 10 percent (which is equal to the estimated 
temperature-independent reduction) and in the United Kingdom 
by around 15 percent."
"On balance, conservation helped lower 
demand on wholesale markets and also had a price-dampening 
effect."
"At the beginning of 2023, the month-ahead contract for one MWh 
of gas at TTF, a virtual trading point in the Netherlands, cost €77."
Prices stabilized at around €35 by year-end.
"The trend for power 
was similar."
"The year-ahead contract for one MWh of baseload 
power cost €214 at the start of the year compared with around 
€100 at year-end."
"This means that the overall price level is 
currently below the level before the start of the war in Ukraine but 
remains almost twice as high as the long-term average before the 
start of the energy crisis."
"The main factors behind the currently still elevated price levels are 
the aforementioned uncertainty regarding weather for the winter 
as a whole, residual geopolitical risks, and competition for LNG on 
the global market."
"By contrast, the anticipated expansion of major 
producers’ gas liquefaction capacity in the years ahead could lead 
to declining LNG prices in the medium term."
"At the UN Climate Change Conference COP28 in Dubai in 
December 2023, heads of state and government from almost 200 
countries agreed on a final document."
"The document contains key 
statements on energy."
"Like the EU and the German delegates at 
COP28, E.ON believes that a clear plan for phasing out fossil fuels 
is lacking at the global level."
"The decarbonization of the energy 
system will thus remain a critical challenge to achieve the 1.5°C 
target."
"Europe 
In view of the energy crisis last year triggered by the war in 
Ukraine and the increasingly tangible consequences of climate 
change, EU institutions initiated or enhanced crisis-management 
measures."
"In March 2022 the European Commission therefore adopted a 
new Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for state aid to 
further support investments in key sectors for the transition to a 
climate-neutral economy and to tackle the energy crisis."
"The 
framework allows member states, for example, to introduce 
additional measures that apply until the end of 2025 and to 
support the deployment of renewable energy, storage facilities, 
and systems to decarbonize industrial processes, including 
hydrogen."
"Under certain conditions, member states can align aid 
granted to beneficiaries in other countries outside the EU."
"In 
addition, the framework allows member states to support 
companies amid the energy crisis through various measures that 
were valid until December 31, 2023."
"In addition, the Commission 
extended until June 2024 some of the measures to grant small 
subsidies and to offset exceptionally high energy prices for 
companies most affected by the crisis."
"The European Commission also proposed to extend two other 
emergency regulations."
"The first concerns Regulation (EU) 
2022/2578 on the market-correction mechanism for gas."
"The 
regulation introduces a sort of pressure relief valve to protect the 
economy from excessively high prices."
"The second concerns the 
emergency regulation on permit-granting procedures (EU) 
2022/2577, which introduces simplified rules for the granting of 
permits in order to accelerate the expansion of renewables and 
associated network infrastructure."
"The measures it contains are 
also contained in the amended Renewable Energy Directive 
(“RED”) and, after the emergency regulation’s expiration, will 
therefore become permanent."
"The European Council approved the 
European Commission’s proposals on extending the emergency 
regulations."
"The European Commission published a proposal on March 16, 
2023, to amend the directive and regulation on the European 
internal power market."
"The 
European Council and the European Parliament adopted their 
respective negotiating positions during the year and reached an 
agreement on December 14."
"The new power market design is 
supposed to take effect and be further implemented in 2024."
"In addition, numerous measures to accelerate renewables 
expansion and the decarbonization of industry in the EU were 
initiated or continued."
"The Net Zero Industry Act (“NZIA”) aims, for example, to support 
the production of technologies that are decisive for the 
achievement of climate neutrality."
"The NZIA is intended to simplify 
the legal framework for the manufacture of these technologies 
and thus to enhance the competitiveness of Europe’s net-zero 
technology industry."
"In addition, the delegated regulations on green hydrogen—(EU) 
2023/1184 and (EU) 2023/1185—were published in the Official 
Journal of the European Union on June 20, 2023."
"The second 
regulation contains a method for calculating RFNBO’s life cycle 
greenhouse gas emissions."
"Directive (EU) 2023/2413 on support for energy from renewable 
sources was published on October 18, 2023."
"It introduces a new 
minimum of 42.5 percent for energy renewables’ share of the EU’s 
gross energy consumption as well as sector targets."
"Furthermore, 
member states must establish requirements for accelerating 
approvals processes for renewables facilities and for network 
expansion."
"In addition, the European Council and the European Parliament 
agreed on a gas package."
"In particular, the new EU gas directive 
updates consumer-protection mechanisms for gas customers and 
adjusts the modalities of network access and network planning to 
reflect the current context, which is characterized by increased use 
of low-carbon gases."
"In the future, a distinction is to be made 
between, and different rules established for, hydrogen distribution 
system operators (“DSOs”) and hydrogen transmission system 
operators (“TSOs”)."
"The (vertical) unbundling rules require 
infrastructure to be separated from competitive activities in a way 
that is similar to existing unbundling rules for gas."
"Consequently, 
less strict rules will apply to DSOs for hydrogen as well."
"In 
addition, only gas and hydrogen TSOs will have to operate as 
legally separate network companies."
"Exceptions are possible at the 
national level, however, for TSOs that submit a cost-benefit 
analysis that is confirmed by their national regulatory agency."
DSOs will be exempted from horizontal unbundling.
"In particular, the regulation introduces new obligations 
for gas infrastructure operators to conduct periodic checks to 
detect and eliminate leaks, to identify the sources of methane 
emissions, and to repair or replace the components in question."
"The Commission must, within 12 months, issue an implementing 
act that specifies minimum detection limits."
"In addition, the new EU Directive 2023/1791 on energy efficiency 
was published on September 13, 2023."
"It contains ambitious 
targets for reducing the EU’s energy consumption by at least 11.7 
percent by 2030 relative to the EU reference scenario."
"Member 
states must stipulate their respective contribution and achieve 
new annual energy savings that gradually increase to 1.9 percent 
by 2030."
"The European Commission published an EU Grid Action Plan on 
November 29, 2023."
"The plan is a non-legislative announcement 
that outlines additional strategic initiatives to foster the 
modernization of power networks and thus to support Europe’s 
climate-protection and renewables targets."
"The initiative’s 
principle aim is to simplify the funding and approval of network 
modernization."
"Germany 
In mid-2022 the Bundestag passed the Easter package to 
accelerate renewables expansion."
"It amended a variety of 
legislation, such as the Renewable Energy Sources Act (German 
abbreviation: EEG), to increase the target for the proportion of 
renewable energy in gross power consumption from 50 percent to 
80 percent by 2030."
The focus is on expanding solar energy.
"Compared with the previous target of 100 GW for 2030, installed 
photovoltaic capacity is to be more than doubled to over 215 GW, 
and onshore wind capacity is to be increased from 71 GW to 115 
GW."
"In 2023 the annual target of 9 GW net additions to 
photovoltaic capacity was already met in September."
"At the end of 
the third quarter of 2023, additions to onshore wind capacity 
amounted to around 50 percent of the annual target of 3.9 GW."
"The number of requests for new network connections for feed-in 
systems has increased considerably in recent years."
"In view of the 
above-described accelerated implementation of climate-protection 
efforts, this figure is likely to continue to rise sharply."
"For example, 
the number of PV requests received by E.ON power distribution 
system operators doubled from around 120,000 in 2021 to about 
240,000 in 2022."
"Requests increased a further 70 percent to 
about 400,000 in 2023."
"Additional measures for standardization, 
digitalization, and automation of network connection processes are 
necessary to enable network connection requests to be processed 
in a timely manner."
"In line with its corporate strategy, E.ON endorses the German 
federal government’s initiatives to accelerate renewables 
expansion."
"We also support accelerated renewables growth by the 
necessary expansion of our smart distribution networks."
"The 
significant increase in momentum and the resulting need for 
additional investments reinforce E.ON’s growth strategy."
"The 
Forecast Report describes our investment plans in particular for 
2024."
"The German federal government took steps to accelerate the 
rollout of smart energy meters by adopting the Metering Point 
Operation Act (German abbreviation: MsbG)."
"The MsbG, which 
was amended by the Act on the Restart of the Digitalization of the 
Energy Transition, establishes a timetable with binding targets 
through 2030."
"Metering point operators are obliged to 
successively equip connected consumption points with smart 
metering systems."
The law took effect in May 2023.
"This mechanism 
does not replace the upgrading of distribution networks, but 
supplements it temporarily."
"In late November 2023 the Federal 
Network Agency (German abbreviation: BNetzA) adopted a 
corresponding regulation."
"In June 2023 the German federal government also initiated the 
amendment of the Climate Protection Act."
"Originally, the Climate 
Protection Act provided for annual emissions reduction targets for 
the energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and waste-
management sectors."
"The current amendment stipulates, among 
other things, that climate targets are to be met on a forward-
looking, multiyear, and cross-sector basis rather than retroactively 
by sector."
"Emissions reduction targets for individual sectors are 
therefore to be eliminated."
"The need to completely convert the power sector to renewables in 
a short space of time and to make this conversion efficient, secure, 
and fast requires the modification of Germany’s power market 
design."
"For this reason, in 2023 the Federal Ministry for Economic 
Affairs and Climate Protection launched the Platform for a 
Climate-Neutral Power System to serve as a discussion forum on 
the future design of the power market."
"Stakeholders from 
parliament, the European Commission, science, business, and civil 
society are involved."
"The Building Energy Act stipulates that, in the 
future, new heating systems may only be installed if at least 65 
percent of the heat they generate comes from renewable sources."
"This applies to new buildings from January 2024 onward, with 
transitional periods through 2028 for existing buildings."
"The 
regulations are accompanied by, among other things, income-
dependent subsidies."
"The Heating Planning Act initially foresees 
that 30 percent of the heat in existing heating networks is to be 
renewable."
"At the same time, the federal states are obliged to 
work toward ensuring that local authorities draw up heating plans 
by 2028 at the latest."
"The plans specify which areas are to be 
supplied with distributed or district heating and how renewable 
energy and waste heat can be used."
"How the methane emissions 
regulation adopted by the EU will affect gas networks cannot yet 
be fully assessed, because the specific requirements for gas 
network operators have not yet been conclusively defined."
"The Energy Industry Act (German abbreviation: EnWG) was 
amended several times in 2023."
"Various topics were addressed, in 
particular the implementation of the ECJ’s ruling on the 
independence of the Federal Network Agency (German 
abbreviation: BNetzA) and the development of a hydrogen core 
grid, including its financing."
"Central to the implementation of the 
ECJ ruling is the formal upgrading of the BNetzA, which is now 
solely responsible for setting the conditions for network access 
and network fees (power, gas, hydrogen)."
"In a motion for a 
resolution passed parallel to the main EnWG amendment, it was 
announced that additional regulations for networks connection are 
anticipated."
"Following the latest cost review, the BNetzA confirmed the cost 
basis of E.ON’s distribution network operating companies for the 
fourth regulatory period for power, although the final 
determinations are still pending and are expected in the first 
quarter of 2024."
"In 2023 the BNetzA also set some of the 
important regulatory parameters for the fourth regulatory period 
(2023 to 2027 for gas, 2024 to 2028 for power)."
"During the year 
the BNetzA, among other things, announced an increase in the 
interest rates for the cost of debt and cost of equity component of 
the capital cost surcharge for new investments in power and gas 
networks from 2024 onward."
"This is intended to take account of 
current interest-rate developments and also to provide incentives 
for new investments in network expansion to propel the energy 
transition."
"However, these determinations only represent 
temporary regulations that are limited to the duration of the fourth 
regulatory period."
"In 
addition, E.ON’s network operators are considering whether to file 
a similar objection to the equity portion."
"However, some important regulatory parameters for the fourth 
regulatory period—for example, the general and individual 
productivity factors for gas and power—have not yet been finalized 
or are still under discussion or consultation with the BNetzA."
"A ruling by the BGH is 
expected some time in 2024."
"As announced, the BNetzA is planning a review of the current 
regulatory framework with regard to the rapidly increasing 
demands placed on network operators by the energy and climate 
transition."
"In early 2024 the BNetzA published a white paper 
containing initial proposals and presented it to energy-industry 
representatives and other stakeholders."
"The white paper focuses 
on refinements to the regulatory framework for the fifth 
regulatory period (for gas from 2028 onward, for power from 
2029 onward) for DSOs and gas TSOs, as well as the need for 
short-term adjustments to gas networks’ useful operating 
lifetimes."
"The BNetzA has planned a discussion process that will 
last until the end of 2025."
"Existing laws will continue to apply until 
further notice."
"Actual changes for network operators will only arise 
when the results are codified into a formally binding legal 
framework."
"With regard to the white paper for the fifth regulatory 
period, this is expected to take place in 2026."
Regulations were established for a core network for hydrogen.
"It is 
to be about 10,000 kilometers long and initially serve for transport 
and supply to large customers."
"The core network was planned 
alongside the legislative process and is expected to be approved by 
the Federal Network Agency in the first quarter of 2024 so that 
pipelines can be built in a timely manner."
"State protection (using 
the amortization approach) is planned for the investments of 
network operators in the core network."
"Considerable efforts in all legal and economic areas remain 
necessary for Germany to achieve its expansion targets for 
photovoltaics."
"Amendments to the Renewable Energy Sources Act 
(German abbreviation: EEG) in particular are intended to pave the 
way for achieving the expansion targets defined in EEG 2023 in a 
way that is compatible with the energy system as a whole."
"It also aims to facilitate plug-in 
solar systems and accelerate grid connection."
"As relief for gas and heat customers, a reduced VAT on gas and 
heat deliveries applied in 2023."
"It expires on March 31, 2024."
"On November 15, 2023, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled 
that the law on the second supplementary budget for 2021 is 
unconstitutional."
"If the ruling’s 
principles are applied to the other special funds, the Economic 
Stabilization Fund (German abbreviation: WSF) is also indirectly 
affected."
"As a result, the German government did not, as planned, 
extend state funding by means of power and gas price caps until 
the end of March 2024; instead, they expired at the end of 2023."
"E.ON has largely implemented the planned 
security measures."
"government provided billions of pounds of financial 
support to help households and businesses cope with the worst 
effects of high wholesale prices in the first quarter of 2023."
"Wholesale energy prices have since fallen from their peak, but bills 
are still almost double what they were before the energy crisis."
"Energy affordability remains a key policy concern, as some 
customers are finding it increasingly difficult to bear the costs."
"In 
response, a winter subsidy was introduced."
"Despite the challenges 
of energy affordability, the U.K."
"government remains committed to 
its net-zero emissions target and increased subsidies in some 
areas, such as heat pumps, by 50 percent to accelerate adoption."
"In other areas, however, the pace of change slowed slightly, as 
evidenced by the recent decision to postpone the ban on the sale 
of new gasoline and diesel cars by five years to 2035, although the 
target that 80 percent of all new cars will be electric by 2030 
remains in place."
"Netherlands 
In 2023 the Dutch government adopted a €11.2 billion support 
package for energy costs."
"Together with energy suppliers, it 
introduced a price cap against rising energy prices."
"The energy 
sector established a €50 million emergency fund for the most 
vulnerable households."
"The aim is to enable 165,000 such 
households to pay their energy bills."
"It was announced that the 
2024 budget foresees no general price increases for 2024."
"After 
the cabinet’s resignation in the summer and the elections held in 
late November 2023, the focus is on forming a new government."
"Italy  
Italy‘s government extended existing support measures for end-
customers through the end of 2023 (a reduction in general 
network charges, social grants for vulnerable customers, and a 
VAT reduction for natural gas only)."
"However, the government 
already expressed its willingness to limit the support measures for 
vulnerable customers in 2024 in order to reduce costs for public 
budgets."
"Alongside these measures, the liberalization process continued in 
order to abolish the protective conditions for Italy’s 9 million 
nonvulnerable customers."
"In the power sector, auctions are being 
held for nonvulnerable household end-customers who are to be 
transferred to the free market."
"In the gas sector, regulated prices 
for nonvulnerable customers were abolished from the start of 
2024."
"The government also presented a first updated version of its 
National Energy and Climate Plan, which is to be based on a 
realistic and technology-neutral approach."
"In addition, additional 
decarbonization measures are being discussed or are in the 
approval phase."
"The aim is to support the development of 
renewable energy facilities and projects and thus to help Italy 
achieve its climate targets for 2030."
"Sweden 
At the beginning of 2023, Sweden‘s government provided 
financial support for households and companies that had been 
most affected by high power prices in the fourth quarter of 2022 
and the first quarter of 2023."
"Prices have since stabilized, and the 
government announced no plans for financial support for the 
winter of 2023/2024."
"While power prices have stabilized, district 
heating prices rose sharply, mainly because of greater demand for 
Nordic biomass due to lower imports from Russia."
"The rise in 
district heating prices attracted a lot of media attention and led to 
a policy debate on stricter price regulation."
"The government 
continued to focus on ensuring a robust electricity system with 
nuclear energy as the basis for the power supply."
"It took numerous 
initiatives during the year to develop nuclear energy with the clear 
aim of building new reactors."
"East-Central Europe 
Although the European Commission recommended that Romania 
abolish the mechanism for capping energy prices by the end of 
2023, current law calls for power and gas prices to remain capped 
for both households and nonhouseholds until the end of March 
2025."
"Consumers are increasingly submitting requests to become 
prosumers, a trend supported by high Romanian government and 
EU funding."
"In addition, new renewables projects are being 
developed."
"In view of these factors, government authorities 
recognize the need to reshape the role of utilities and limit the 
capacity of new renewables projects that will be connected to 
power networks."
"Slovakia adopted a number of measures in 2023 to reduce the 
impact of high energy prices on households and businesses."
"The Czech Republic introduced a package of temporary crisis 
measures in 2023 to shield end-consumers—including households, 
businesses, and large industrial customers—from high energy 
prices."
"In addition, the government is revising social subsidy 
programs in order to combat energy poverty."
"This put significant pressure on 
the availability of network connection capacity."
"At the same time, 
the government continued to revise the market design and define 
measures to support the Czech Republic on its path to carbon 
neutrality."
"The Hungarian government’s energy policy for 2023 focused on 
keeping prices low for households and strengthening power 
networks in order to integrate more renewable energy."
"A Ministry 
of Energy and a Ministry for EU Affairs were also established in

"Special Events in the Reporting Period  
War in Ukraine Continues to Create Significant 
Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Impacts the Energy Sector 
E.ON’s priority since the beginning of the war in Ukraine in early 
2022 has been to secure the energy supply in these anxious times."
"E.ON’s power, gas, and heat networks in various regions of Europe 
are running stably, even in the current situation."
"The war’s repercussions also have implications for E.ON’s 
business."
"Changes in Segment Reporting 
E.ON’s segment reporting was adjusted effective January 1, 2023."

Shareholders 
On April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Západoslovenská energetika 
a.s."
(“ZSE”) and of Východoslovenská energetika Holding a.s.
"(“VSEH“), E.ON SE, and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future 
Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Group."
"The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of 
VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all VSEH 
subsidiaries to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate law 
changes at VSEH."
"The transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE results in ZSE being VSEH’s 
sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of the VSEH 
subsidiaries)."
"The ownership interests in ZSE remains unchanged; 
that is, E.ON has a 49 percent stake in ZSE and the Slovakian state 
a 51 percent stake."
"The new ZSE shareholder agreement 
essentially corresponds to the shareholder agreement that has 
been in force before."
"After closing of the agreement, ZSE continues 
to be accounted for using the equity method in E.ON’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements, while the business activities of 
VSEH, which was previously fully consolidated, are now integrated 
in this joint venture."

"Subsequent Events 
Changes to Business Model 
On September 11, 2023, the Management Board approved a new 
management concept for the E.ON Group."
"Effective from January 
1, 2024, this entails a change in the definition of certain operating 
segments in accordance with IFRS 8 and the reallocation of the 
current goodwill amounts for all operating segments affected by 
the changes and reporting goodwill as of January 1, 2024."
"The 
Management Board's decision was regarded as an opportunity to 
test the goodwill of the existing operating segments for 
impairment."
"The impairment tests carried out as of September 
2023 found no indication of impairment."
"Following the entry into 
force of the new management concept, the goodwill amounts 
reallocated as of January 1, 2024, are subject to the provisions of 
IAS 36 on impairment testing."
"In the new Energy Infrastructure 
Solutions segment, there may be an impairment risk of up to a 
mid-triple-digit million euro amount."
"The Business Model chapter 
contains more information."
"These bond transactions have enabled E.ON to lay the foundation 
for covering its funding requirements for 2024."
"Arbitration Proceedings in Spain 
E.ON SE, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH, and E.ON Iberia Holding 
GmbH are plaintiffs in arbitration proceedings against the 
Kingdom of Spain."
"In the arbitration proceedings, the three 
companies are asserting claims for damages for changes to Span’s 
remuneration scheme for renewable energy."
"The arbitration 
proceedings have been pending at the International Center for 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) since they were 
registered on August 10, 2015."
"On January 18, 2024, an 
arbitration tribunal awarded the companies damages totaling 
approximately €0.3 billion."
"As the legal process has not yet been 
exhausted and there are therefore still uncertainties regarding the 
proceedings’ final outcome, E.ON is not reporting a receivable or 
any associated income in its 2023 financial statements."
"Instead, it 
discloses a contingent receivable."
"Termination of the Operating Concession for a Wastewater 
Treatment Plant in Croatia   
A concession agreement for the operation of a wastewater 
treatment plant exists between Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o, a 
company consolidated in the E.ON Group using the equity method, 
and the City of Zagreb."
"By majority resolution of the city assembly 
on January 25, 2024, the City of Zagreb exercised its contractually 
agreed-on right to unilaterally terminate this concession."
"The manner in which 
the sale will take place had yet to be determined by the City of 
Zagreb at the time of the Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
preparation."
"The transactions’ financial effects cannot yet be 
reliably estimated at the time of preparation either."
"Business Performance 
E.ON’s operating business delivered a positive performance in the 
2023 financial year, and E.ON surpassed its forecast for key 
performance indicators."
"External sales in the 2023 financial year decreased by 19 percent 
to €93.7 billion."
"This performance is mainly attributable to lower 
sales volume due to customers’ energy conservation and portfolio 
streamlining."
"Lower price levels on wholesale markets also had an 
adverse impact on sales."
"The E.ON Group’s adjusted EBITDA of €9.4 billion was €1.3 billion 
above the prior-year figure of €8.1 billion and above the forecast 
range of €8.6 to €8.8 billion, which had been adjusted in August 
2023 (previously: €7.8 to €8 billion)."
"Energy Networks recorded 
adjusted EBITDA of €6.6 billion, which was likewise above the 
adjusted forecast range of €6.3 to €6.5 billion (previously: €6 to 
€6.2 billion)."
"Customer Solutions’ adjusted EBITDA of €2.8 billion 
was also above the adjusted forecast range of €2.3 to €2.5 billion 
(previously: €1.8 to €2 billion)."
"Adjusted EBITDA at Corporate 
Functions/Other of -€0.1 billion was in line with expectations."
"Adjusted net income of €3.1 billion was likewise above the prior-
year figure of €2.7 billion and the forecast range of €2.7 billion to 
€2.9 billion, which had been adjusted in August 2023 (previously: 
€2.3 to €2.5 billion)."
"Earnings per share, which are based on 
adjusted net income, amounted to €1.18 in the year under review 
(prior year: €1.05) and thus surpassed the forecast range of €1.03 
to €1.11 (previously: €0.88 to €0.96)."
"Further growth in the regulated asset base due to additional 
investments was Energy Networks’ main contribution to this 
positive earnings performance."
"In addition, the recovery of the 
energy market environment in 2023 led to significant reductions in 
redispatch expenditures in Germany."
"The calming of the market 
environment and the stabilization of price levels on procurement 
markets in nearly all E.ON regions contributed to a relative 
earnings improvement at Customer Solutions."
"The adjustment of 
energy procurement to current market conditions in the United 
Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands was another positive 
earnings factor."
"Higher risk provisions for bad debt losses was a 
countervailing factor."
"Cash-effective investments of €6.4 billion were significantly above 
the prior-year figure of €4.8 billion and also above the target figure 
of roughly €6.1 billion, which had been adjusted in November 
(previously: roughly €5.9 billion)."
"Energy Networks’ investments of 
€5.2 billion surpassed the forecast figure of €4.6 billion."
"They were 
accelerated in particular in the fourth quarter owing to capacity 
increases and went mainly toward network infrastructure projects."
Customer Solutions’ investments of €1.1 billion were as forecast.
"Corporate Functions/Other’s investments were in line with the 
forecast figure of €0.1 billion."
"The main reason for the declining 
energy wheeling volume was the war in Ukraine and associated 
energy-conservation measures."
"By contrast, fourth-quarter wheeling volume was slightly above 
that of the prior-year quarter."
"This is attributable to lower price 
levels on commodity markets."
"System Length and Network Customers 
E.ON’s power system in Germany was about 694,000 kilometers
long, slightly above the prior-year figure (about 691,000 
kilometers)."
"At year-end it had about 14.9 million network 
customers for power in its service territory (prior year: 14.8 
million)."
"E.ON’s gas system was almost unchanged at about 
99,000 kilometers (prior year: about 98,000 kilometers), as was 
the number of network customers‚ 1.9 million."
"The length of E.ON’s power system in Sweden was 142,000 
kilometers (prior year: about 141,000 kilometers)."
"The number of 
customers in the power distribution system was about 1.1 million, 
unchanged from the prior year."
"E.ON operates electricity networks in East-Central Europe/Turkey 
with a total system length of roughly 274,000 kilometers (prior 
year: about 275,000 kilometers) and supplies, as in the prior year, 
about 8.4 million network customers."
"Gas networks operated by 
E.ON were roughly 50,000 kilometers long (prior year: 49,000 
kilometers)."
"The number of gas network customers is about 2.8
million (prior year: about 2.7 million)."

Power and gas sales to the customer groups decreased.
"The 
primary reasons for the decline in power and gas sales in almost all 
of E.ON’s regional markets were portfolio streamlining in line with 
our B2B strategy, mild weather, as well as crisis-related energy 
conservation and the associated decline in consumption."
"Customer Numbers 
Customer Solutions’ fully consolidated companies had a total of 
about 34.7 million customers at year-end 2023, less than the 
prior-year figure of 35.9 million."
"The number of customers in 
Germany declined slightly to 14.2 million (prior year: 14.4 million) 
because competition became keen again."
"In the United Kingdom 
the number of customers declined slightly to 8.9 million owing to 
our strategic focus on customers that deliver strong sales and 
portfolio streamlining as part of our B2B strategy (prior year: 9.1 
million)."
"At 3.9 million, the number of customers in the 
Netherlands was almost at the prior-year level (4 million)."
"The 
total number of customers in the other regions declined from 8.4 
million to 
7.8 million, in part because of return to more competition in the 
wake of the energy crisis."
"Customer losses relate to both power 
and gas customers."
"For the sake of clarity and in 
order to provide more useful commentary, the Combined Group 
Management Report only discloses external sales and only 
comments on the change in external sales with regard to the 
segments’ performance."
"The E.ON Group’s external sales in 2023 declined by €22 billion to 
€93.7 billion (prior year: €115.7 billion)."
"Energy Networks’ sales of €17.6 billion were €3.6 billion above 
the prior-year figure."
"This development is attributable in particular 
to the significant increase in power price levels in 2022."
"The 
growth in the regulated asset base continued to have a positive 
impact on sales."
"The increase also resulted from higher tariffs 
charged by transmission system operators."
"Customer Solutions’ sales declined by €10.3 billion to €64.6 
billion."
"The decrease is mainly attributable to a decline in sales 
volume in nearly all E.ON regions due to customers’ energy 
conservation as well as portfolio streamlining."
"The successive 
passthrough to end-customers of crisis-driven high procurement 
costs had a countervailing effect."
"It had the largest impact in 
Germany and the Czech Republic."
"The settlement of derivatives 
also adversely affected sales owing to sharply lower commodity 
prices relative to the prior year."
"Sales recorded at Corporate Functions/Other of €11.4 billion were 
about €15 billion under the prior-year figure."
"The decrease is 
mainly attributable to lower price levels compared with the prior 
year on commodity transactions conducted by E.ON Energy 
Markets, our central commodity procurement unit."
"Own work capitalized of €1,334 million was 34 percent above the 
prior-year level (€997 million)."
"It consisted predominantly of 
network investments as well as ongoing and completed IT 
projects."
"Other operating income totaled €38,888 million in 2023 (prior 
year: €73,193 million)."
"Income from derivative financial 
instruments alone declined by €32,961 million year on year to 
€37,273 million, principally because of the development of prices 
on commodity markets during the course of the year."
"Income from 
currency-translation effects (€578 million) was €275 million 
below the prior-year figure (€853 million)."
"Corresponding amounts 
resulting from currency-translation effects and derivative financial 
instruments are recorded under other operating expenses."
"Income 
from the sale of equity interests and securities totaled €151 
million (prior year: €999 million)."
"The prior-year figure mainly 
consists of an €810 million book gain on the partial disposal of 
Westconnect GmbH."
"Costs of materials of €64,228 million were significantly below the 
prior-year level (€108,627 million)."
"The sharp decline mainly 
reflects price developments on commodity markets."
"As part of our 
long-term procurement strategy, the rise in energy prices in the 
first half of the prior year continued, now with a time delay, to lead 
to higher contractually agreed-on procurement costs, whereas 
price levels in 2023 largely moved lower."
"A countervailing effect 
resulted from the fact that forward procurement contacts, which 
under IFRS are accounted for as derivative financial instruments, 
are, at the time of settlement, adjusted to the market price at the 
time of delivery, which has a corresponding impact on costs of 
materials."
"Effects from the marking to market of commodity 
derivatives are recorded under other operating income."
"In addition, 
costs of materials include a change in provisions for pending 
transactions."
"These provisions are mainly recorded for contracted 
sales transactions that are not subject to IFRS 9 (failed own-use) 
transactions that are commercially part of a portfolio that is 
partially offset by procurement transactions that are accounted for 
as derivative financial instruments."
"Personnel costs of €6,010 million were €573 million above the 
prior-year figure (€5,437 million)."
"The change is mainly 
attributable to an increase in the number of employees and to pay 
increases under collective-bargaining agreements."
"This was 
partially offset by lower expenditures for pensions."
"Depreciation charges increased from €3,378 million in the prior 
year to €3,514 million."
"This is principally attributable to higher 
depreciation charges on property, plant, and equipment due to 
additional investments in the network business."
"Countervailing 
effects mainly involved intangible assets due to the absence of 
depreciation charges on residual power output rights."
"In addition, 
there were higher impairment charges on property, plant, and 
equipment and intangible assets."
"Other operating expenses of €59,548 million were €12,188 
million below the prior-year figure (€71,736 million), in particular 
because expenditures relating to derivative financial instruments 
(including currency-translation changes) declined by €13,318 
million to €53,345 million."
"Expenditures relating to currency-
translation effects increased by €194 million to €718 million."
"Income from companies accounted for under the equity method of 
€478 million was significantly above the prior-year level (€279 
million)."
"The increase resulted mainly from higher earnings from 
equity interests in Germany and Slovakia."
"Energy Networks’ adjusted EBITDA increased by €1,181 million to 
€6,640 million (prior year: €5,459 million)."
"In Germany higher 
investments were the driver of this positive performance."
"They led 
to a continued growth in the regulated asset base."
"In addition, the 
recovery of the market environment of the energy-industry 
contributed to a significant reduction in the costs for redispatch."
"These cost reductions are temporary in nature and, because of 
regulatory mechanisms, will be credited to network customers in 
subsequent years."
"Adjusted EBITDA in Sweden and at East-Central 
Europe/Turkey received additional support in all regions except 
Hungary from lower costs for network losses during 2023 as well 
as catch-up effects for only partly covered costs for network 
losses incurred in prior years."
"The weak Swedish krona and Turkish 
lira had an off-setting effect."
"Earnings were also adversely 
impacted by lower wheeling volume resulting from a reduction in 
energy consumption."
"Effects relating to fluctuations in wheeling 
volume are essentially temporary in nature and, in most countries, 
are recovered in subsequent years through regulatory 
mechanisms."
"Adjusted EBITDA at Customer Solutions rose by €1,121 million to 
€2,807 million (prior year: €1,686 million)."
"The increasing 
stabilization of the energy-industry market environment, which 
had been under considerable strain in the prior year, was among 
the contributing factors and had a positive impact on earnings."
"The 
stabilization of price levels on procurement markets contributed to 
an earnings improvement relative to the prior year in nearly all 
E.ON markets."
"In addition, energy procurement in the United 
Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands was adjusted to current 
market conditions, and one-off effects from prior periods had a 
positive impact as well along with non-recurring regulation effects 
in the United Kingdom."
"A decline in sales volume and risk 
provisions for bad debts had a countervailing effect in nearly all  
 
regions."
"In addition, effects from mild weather in the Netherlands 
were less pronounced than in the prior year."
"The in some cases 
tense situation in Romania in 2022 in the Other unit eased as a 
result of improvements in the regulatory scheme."
"In addition, 
wider margins and effects from portfolio management led to 
earnings increases in the Other unit’s other markets."
"Adjusted 
EBITDA at Energy Infrastructure Solutions’ (“EIS”) business of 
providing on-site energy solutions was below the prior year due to 
adverse currency-translation effects and the non-recurrence of 
positive one-off effects."
"Adjusted EBITDA recorded at Corporate Functions/Other declined 
by about €1,000 million to -€79 million (prior year: €918 million), 
mainly because of the absence of earnings streams from 
PreussenElektra, due to the cessation of operations and the 
dismantling of all power stations."
"PreussenElektra’s earnings are 
recorded under non-operating expense/income effective the 
beginning of 2023."
"E.ON generates a large portion of its adjusted EBITDA in very 
stable businesses."
"Regulated, quasi-regulated, and long-term 
contracted businesses accounted for the overwhelming proportion 
of E.ON’s adjusted EBITDA in 2023."
"E.ON’s regulated business consists, among other things, of 
operations in which revenues are largely set by law and based on 
costs."
"The earnings on these revenues are therefore extremely 
stable and predictable."
"E.ON’s quasi-regulated and long-term 
contracted business consists of operations in which earnings have 
a high degree of predictability because key determinants (price 
and/or volume) are largely set for the medium to long term."
"Examples include the operation of industrial customer solutions 
with long-term supply agreements and the operation of heating 
networks."
"Merchant activities are all those that cannot be subsumed under 
either of the other two categories."
"The improvement is attributable to our good operating 
performance in the year under review."
"Based on E.ON stock 
outstanding, adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”) amounted to 
€1.18 (prior year: €1.05)."
"Operating depreciation charges rose relative to the prior year, from 
€2,862 million to €2,983 million."
"This is mainly attributable to an 
increase in depreciation charges on property, plant, and equipment 
resulting from additional investments in the network business."
"Countervailing effects mainly involved intangible assets due to the 
absence of depreciation charges on residual power output rights."
"Economic net interest rose from €890 million to €1,082 million, 
primarily because of the accretion of provisions due to the increase 
in interest-rate levels at the end of 2022."
"In addition, the higher 
interest expense on newly issued bonds due to higher interest 
rates exceeded the positive effects of bond repayments."
"The tax rate on operating earnings of continuing operations was 
25 percent, as in the prior year."
"The tax expense on operating 
earnings rose from €1,062 million to €1,325 million owing to the 
increase in pretax earnings."
"Non-controlling interests’ share of operating earnings rose 
significantly—from €517 million to €912 million—mainly because 
of higher operating earnings at companies at the network business 
in Germany with a significant proportion of non-controlling 
interests."
"This development resulted from a larger regulated asset 
base compared with the prior year and the recording of a price-
driven increase in network fees."
"Adjusted Net Income 
   
 
 
 
4."
"These non-operating items are considered separately in internal 
management control."
"Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income 
reflect the E.ON Group’s long-term profitability and, as metrics for 
internal management control, are adjusted to exclude non-
operating items."
"Net book gains/losses were minor in 2023 and resulted mainly 
from the combination of VSEH and ZSE in Slovakia."
"Book gains in 
the prior year consist in particular of the partial disposal of 
Westconnect."
"Restructuring expenses in the 2023 financial year were below 
those of the prior year and included, as in the prior year, primarily 
expenditures in conjunction with the restructuring of the sales 
business in the United Kingdom."
"Effects in conjunction with derivative financial instruments 
changed by €1,110 million to -€4,233 million."
"The reason was 
that prices on commodity markets decreased almost continually 
during the year, which led to declining fair value measurements on 
forward procurement contracts."
"PreussenElektra’s 
earnings, which are disclosed as non-operating income effective 
2023, had a countervailing effect (€289 million)."
"The decline in non-operating interest expense/income resulted 
from the altered direction of interest-rate movements."
"An increase 
in interest rates in the prior year led to income from accruals on 
non-current provisions for asset-retirement obligations, provisions 
for recultivation and remediation obligations, and other non-
current provisions."
"In the interim interest rates declined relative to 
prior-year balance-sheet date."
"By contrast, E.ON recorded positive 
valuation effect on securities recognized at fair value."
"The positive 
effect of €187 million (prior year: €204 million) from the 
difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective 
interest rate of former innogy bonds adjusted due to the purchase-
price allocation is still recorded under non-operating interest 
expense/income."
"This 
development resulted from a larger regulated asset base 
compared with the prior year and the recording of a price-driven 
increase in network fees."
"Income from discontinued operations resulted from a transaction 
already completed in 2005."
"In accordance with the purchase 
agreement, a one-time purchase-price adjustment was made after 
an audit of the divested company was completed in the first 
quarter of 2023, and the contractual clause now took effect."
"Group net income and corresponding earnings per share amounted 
to €760 million and €0.20, respectively, in the 2023 financial year."
"The decline is mainly attributable to interest-rate developments 
and price developments on commodity markets."
"Prior-year net 
income and earnings per share were €2,242 million and €0.70, 
respectively."
"At the 
forefront of this strategy is ensuring that E.ON always has access 
to capital markets commensurate with its debt level."
"With its target capital structure E.ON aims to sustainably secure a 
strong BBB/Baa rating."
"E.ON manages its capital structure using debt factor, which is 
equal to economic net debt divided by adjusted EBITDA; it is 
therefore a dynamic debt metric."
"Economic net debt includes not 
only financial liabilities but also provisions for pensions and asset-
retirement obligations."
"Economic net debt also includes provisions for asset-retirement 
obligations."
"If the figures for these provisions shown in the balance 
are larger than the respective amount of the obligation (without 
factoring in discounting and cost-escalation effects), the amount 
of the obligation—rather than provision shown in the balance 
sheets—is factored into economic net income."
"This is the case for 
asset-retirement obligations in the nuclear energy unit effective 
December 31, 2023."
"For purposes of management control, the 
amount of the obligations is therefore again used to calculate 
economic net debt."
"Pursuant to IFRS valuation standards, innogy’s financial liabilities 
at the time of initial consolidation were recorded at their fair value."
"This fair value is significantly higher than the original nominal 
value because interest-rate levels have declined since innogy’s 
bonds were issued."
"The purchase-price allocation yielded a 
difference between the nominal value and the fair value, which 
results in additional liabilities of €1.5 billion at year-end 2023."
"This 
amount will be recorded in financial earnings as a reduction in 
expenditures and spread out over the maturity period of the 
respective bonds (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"These balance-sheet and earnings effects do not alter 
the interest and principal payments."
"To manage economic net 
debt, E.ON continues to use the nominal amount of financial 
liabilities, which deviates from the figure shown in its balance 
sheets."
E.ON aims for a debt factor of up to 5.0.
"Debt factor at year-end 
2023 of 4.0 was significantly below the maximum allowable 
figure."
"Economic Net Debt 
Economic net debt increased by €5 billion relative to year-end 
2022 (€32.7 billion) to €37.7 billion."
"Financial liabilities of €33.9 billion reflect E.ON SE’s issuance of 
bonds in the year under review as well as the repayment of five 
bonds (details on the next page)."
"E.ON’s net financial position declined by €3.8 billion compared 
with year-end 2022 to about -€25.3 billion."
"Investment 
expenditures and E.ON SE’s dividend payment exceeded operating 
cash flow and disposals."
"The decrease in actuarial discount rates for pensions, which led to 
an increase in defined benefit obligations, did not offset the 
positive development of plan assets and, on balance, had an 
adverse impact on economic net debt (see Note 25 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements)."
"Because the utilization affects 
operating cash flow, however, the economic net debt was 
negatively affected by the interest-rate effects."
"The figure shown in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets is €1.5 billion higher (year-end 2022: €1.7 billion higher)."
"2The figure for asset-retirement obligations at December 31, 2023, does not fully correspond to 
the figure shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (€7,375 million at  December 31, 2023)."
"This 
is because economic net debt is calculated in part based on the actual amount of E.ON’s 
obligations."
"The figure at December 31, 2022, corresponded to the figure shown in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets (€7,445 million)."
"Funding Policy and Initiatives 
The key objective of E.ON’s funding policy is for the Company to 
have access to a variety of financing sources at all times."
"E.ON 
achieves this objective by using different markets and debt 
instruments to maximize the diversity of its investor base."
"E.ON 
issues bonds with tenors that give its debt portfolio a balanced 
maturity profile."
"Moreover, large-volume euro-denominated 
benchmark issues may in some cases be combined with bonds 
denominated in foreign currencies, smaller euro-denominated 
issues, private placements, and/or promissory notes."
"Furthermore, 
from 2019 onward E.ON has issued green bonds and has since 
established them in its financing mix."
"E.ON continues to intend to 
cover more than 50 percent of its annual long-term financing 
requirements with green bonds (the “E.ON on Capital Markets” 
chapter contains information about the E.ON Green Bond 
Framework)."
"In the past, external 
funding was also carried out by the Company’s Dutch finance 
subsidiary, E.ON International Finance B.V."
"(“EIF“), under 
guarantee of E.ON SE."
"In 2023 E.ON paid back in full maturities of 
€2.6 billion."
"E.ON issued new debt totaling €3.3 billion (see the 
chapter entitled Special Events in the Reporting Period), of which 
€2.5 billion were green bonds."
"With the exception of a U.S.-dollar-denominated bond issued in 
2008, all of E.ON SE and EIF’s currently outstanding bonds were 
issued under a Debt Issuance Program (“DIP“)."
"Similarly, innogy 
and innogy Finance B.V."
"bonds were formerly issued under the 
former innogy Group’s DIP."
"A DIP simplifies a company’s ability to 
issue debt to investors in public and private placements in flexible 
time frames."
"E.ON SE’s DIP was last updated in March 2023 with 
a total volume of €35 billion, of which about €19.7 billion was 
utilized at year-end 2023 E.ON SE intends to renew the DIP in 
2024."
"In addition to its DIP, E.ON has a €10 billion Commercial Paper 
(“CP“) program and a US$10 billion CP program, under which it 
can issue short-term notes."
"After years of inactivity, the U.S."
"dollar 
CP program was utilized again in 2023."
"€0.2 billion of CP was 
outstanding at year-end 2023 (prior year: €0.8 billion)."
"E.ON also has access to €3.5 billion syndicated credit facility, 
which was concluded on October 24, 2019."
"It originally had a five-
year term and includes two options to extend the facility, in each 
case for one year."
"After both options to extend the facility were 
exercised, the term of the credit facility ends on October 24, 2026."
"The credit margin is linked, among other things, to the 
development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON financial 
incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy."
"The ESG 
ratings are set by three renowned agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI ESG 
Research, and Sustainalytics."
"The facility serves as a reliable, 
ongoing general liquidity reserve for the E.ON Group and can be 
drawn on as needed."
"The credit facility is made available by 21 
banks which constitute E.ON’s core group of banks."
"Alongside financial liabilities, E.ON has, in the course of its 
business operations, entered into contingencies and other financial 
obligations."
"These include, in particular, guarantees, obligations 
from legal disputes and damage claims, as well as current and 
non-current contractual, legal, and other obligations."
"Notes 27, 28, 
and 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more 
information about E.ON’s bonds as well as liabilities, 
contingencies, and other commitments."
"E.ON’s creditworthiness has been assessed by Standard & Poor’s 
(“S&P“), Moody’s and Fitch with long-term ratings of BBB, Baa2, 
and BBB+ (A- for bonds), respectively."
"The outlook for all ratings is 
stable."
"The ratings are based on the expectation that, over the near 
to medium term, E.ON will be able to maintain a debt ratio 
commensurate with these ratings."
"The short-term ratings are A-2 
(S&P), P-2 (Moody’s), and F-1 (Fitch)."
"In early 2023 Fitch 
upgraded its short-term rating from F-2 to F-1."
"The short-term 
ratings of S&P and Moody’s remained stable in the year und 
review."
"Alongside the ongoing dialog with 
capital market investors (at road shows, for example) and rating 
analysts, E.ON organizes events that include an annual 
informational meeting for its core group of banks."
"Investments 
The E.ON Group’s cash-effective investments of €6.4 billion in 
2023 were significantly above the prior-year figure of €4.8 billion."
"€6 billion (prior year: €4.6 billion) went toward property, plant, and 
equipment and intangible assets, whereas share investments 
totaled about €411 million (prior year: €177 million)."
The strategic focus of our investment activity is Energy Networks.
"This segment’s investments rose by 34 percent to €5.2 billion 
(prior year: €3.8 billion)."
"The main focus in all regions was on new 
connections and network expansion in conjunction with the energy 
transition."
"Customer Solutions’ investments increased by 35 percent to €1.1 
billion (prior year: €0.8 billion)."
"Fully €0.7 billion (prior year: €0.5 
billion) of total investments went toward Energy Infrastructure 
Solutions (“EIS”) across all regions."
"This increase is attributable in 
particular to higher investments in the smart energy meter 
business in the United Kingdom and the acquisition of Equans 
Energy Solutions (“EES”)."
"EES offers aquifer thermal energy 
storage (“ATES”) in the Netherlands and focuses on low-carbon 
heat and cooling solutions for existing residential and business 
buildings."
"In addition, investments to decarbonize the heat and 
power generation of municipalities and industrial customers in 
Germany were increased."
"Investments at Corporate Functions/Other of €141 million (prior 
year: €76 million) went especially toward intangible assets and 
other shareholdings."
"Cash Flow 
Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 
before interest and taxes of €7.2 billion was €4.3 billion below the 
prior-year figure (€11.5 billion)."
"This resulted in part from a decline 
of €0.9 billion at Energy Networks, which is mainly attributable to 
adverse changes in working capital at the network business in 
Germany."
"In particular, back payments to energy feed-in 
customers who had received insufficient installment payments in 
the previous year had a negative impact on operating cash flow in 
the year under review."
"The remaining decline (a total of -€3.4 
billion) came from Customer Solutions and Corporate 
Functions/Other and was likewise mainly due to negative changes 
in working capital in the 2023 financial year that more than offset 
the increase in cash-effective earnings."
"These negative changes in 
working capital are mainly attributable to the timing difference 
between customer installment payments already received in 2022 
and payments from government support measures and the related 
cash outflows from commodity procurement in the year under 
review."
"In addition, the closure of E.ON’s last nuclear power plant 
in the 2023 financial year led to a further deterioration of cash 
provided by operating activities relative to the prior year."
"Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of     
-€5.6 billion was 2.4 billion below the prior-year figure of -€3.2 
billion."
"This includes cash-effective investments of €6.4 billion 
(prior year: €4.8 billion)."
"The increase is primarily attributable to 
the planned increase in investments in property, plant, and 
equipment and intangible assets, particularly at the network 
business Germany."
"A reduction in cash inflow from disposals also 
affected cash provided by investment activities."
"There was no 
transaction in the 2023 financial year comparable to the sale of 
E.ON’s 50 percent stake in Westconnect in the prior year."
"The net of the issuance and repayment of bonds, 
commercial paper, and bank liabilities led to an improvement in 
cash provided by financing activities."
"A net reduction in adverse 
effects in conjunction with variation margins due to the settlement 
of derivative transactions led to a further improvement in cash 
provided by financing activities."
"Cash-Conversion Rate 
Cash-conversion rate (“CCR“) indicates how much of the E.ON 
Group’s earnings are transformed into cash flow."
"CCR is equal to 
operating cash flow before interest and taxes divided by adjusted 
EBITDA."
"Cash outflows for the decommissioning of nuclear power 
plants were excluded from CCR until 2022."
"Because the earnings 
streams from PreussenElektra’s generation activities are no longer 
included in adjusted EBITDA due to the discontinuation of power 
operations effective December 31, 2022, CCR was adjusted for 
the 2023 financial year."
"Cash flows of €271 million included in 
operating cash flow before interest and taxes in conjunction with 
the decommissioning of nuclear power plants and their temporary 
continued operation from January 1 to April 15, 2023, were not 
factored into the calculation of CCR."
"E.ON’s CCR in 2023 was 80 
percent (prior year: 151 percent)."
"Non-
current assets rose by €1.3 billion to €83 billion."
"This is mainly 
attributable to an increase in investments in property, plant, and 
equipment as well as a rise in the book value of companies valued 
using the equity method."
"This was mainly due to the addition of 
VSEH at Západoslovenská energetika a.s."
"(“ZSE”) and the 
application of IAS 29 in Turkey."
"By contrast, receivables from 
derivative financial instruments declined."
"This relates in particular 
to the development of commodity derivatives."
"In addition, deferred 
tax assets increased owing to the development of derivatives and 
the reversal of deferred tax assets in the E.ON SE’s tax group."
"Current assets decreased by 41.7 percent, from €52.2 billion to 
€30.5 billion."
"This likewise resulted mainly from the decline in 
receivables on derivative financial instruments due to 
developments on commodity markets and from a reduction in 
liquid funds caused by higher investments and dividend payments."
"Equity attributable to E.ON SE shareholders was about €14.1 
billion at year-end 2023 (prior year: about €15.9 billion), whereas 
equity attributable to non-controlling interests was roughly €5.9 
billion (prior year: about €5.9 billion)."
"The equity ratio (including 
non-controlling interests) at year-end 2023 was about 18 percent, 
which is 2 percentage points higher than at year-end 2022."
"The 
primary reason for the decline in equity was the reduction in net 
income, the dividend payment along with the remeasurement of 
pension obligations."
"In addition, other income and expenses 
decreased because of the recycling of the cash flow hedge 
relationships for commodity derivatives that were unwound in the 
prior year."
"An increase in provisions for pensions due to lower interest rates 
and an increase in financial liabilities had a countervailing effect."
"Current debt of €37.6 billion was 30.6 percent below the figure at 
year-end 2022, due principally to a decrease in liabilities relating to 
derivative financial instruments, which is likewise due to 
developments on commodity markets, and a decrease in liabilities 
from trade accounts payable."
"The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contain more 
commentary on E.ON’s asset situation."
"Consolidated Assets, Liabilities, and Equity 
 
 
€ in millions 
 Dec."
"KG (“MEON”) into E.ON SE, the acquiring 
entity, on August 28, 2023, resulted in MEON’s business assets 
accruing to E.ON as part of the universal succession."
"The accrual 
limits individual line items’ comparability with the prior year."
"The increase in financial assets consists mainly of an increase in 
loans to affiliated companies (€1,451 million) and an increase in 
securities held as fixed assets due to the MEON accrual (€985 
million)."
"A decline in stakes in affiliated companies due to the 
MEON accrual (-€1,371 million) was a countervailing factor."
"The increase in receivables from affiliated companies is mainly 
attributable to higher receivables from profit-pooling agreements 
with subsidiaries (€842 million)."
"The decline in other liabilities 
results mainly from a reduction in the amount in money market 
funds (-€1,279 million)."
"The change in equity reflects a €650 million increase in retained 
earnings resulting from changes in treasury shares under the 
employee stock-purchase program conducted in 2023 (€15 
million) along with a €28 million decrease in net income available 
for distribution."
"The increase in provisions results mainly from the provisions for 
pensions added from MEON at the date of the accrual (€2,722 
million)."
"E.ON SE issued new bonds and commercial paper in the amount of 
€3,300 million in the 2023 financial year and repaid bonds in the 
amount of €1,750 million."
"In addition, liabilities from commercial 
paper declined by €559 million."
"The decrease in liabilities to 
affiliated companies of €3,484 million reflects a decline in intra-
Group financing."
"Information on treasury shares can be found in Note 11 to the 
Financial Statements of E.ON SE and Note 20 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"As such, its 
earnings situation is affected by income from equity interests."
"The 
main contributors to positive income from equity interests were 
income from the transfer of profits from E.ON Beteiligungen 
GmbH in the amount of €2,174 million, E.ON Finanzanlagen 
GmbH in the amount of €1,030 million, and E.ON Energie AG in 
the amount of €764 million."
"The financial result for 2023 includes a deterioration in net interest 
expense of €516 million, mainly due to the increase in interest 
rates."
"By contrast, the prior-year financial result was adversely 
affected by expenses from impairment charges on equity interests 
in affiliated companies (€649 million)."
"The negative balance of other income and expenses in 2023 
resulted primarily from €489 million in losses due to the transfer 
of MEON Pensions GmbH & Co."
"KG to E.ON SE, €265 million in 
personnel-related expenses, €225 million in expenses for 
purchased third-party services, €64 million in auditing and 
consulting services, and €174 million in net expenses from 
currency effects."
"The increase in the provision for recultivation and 
remediation obligations in 2023 reflected expenditures of €16 
million (prior year: €109 million)."
"In addition, E.ON 
SE provides a relatively limited degree of energy-specific services 
to affiliated network operators for network operations relating to 
electricity distribution and/or gas distribution and prepares activity 
statements for these services."
"The resulting earnings, individually 
and in total, are minimal (about -€0.2 million)."
"In the year under review, total tax expenses amounted to €160 
million relating to taxes for the current financial year as well as 
taxes for prior years."
"This consists of income tax expense of €160 
million and an expense from other taxes of €0.2 million."
"At the Annual Shareholders Meeting in 2024, the Management 
Board will propose that net income available for distribution be 
used to pay a dividend of €0.53 per ordinary share and the 
remaining amount of €1,412 million to be carried forward to the 
next financial year."
"Management’s proposal for the use of net 
income available for distribution is based on the number of 
ordinary shares on March 4, 2024, the date the Financial 
Statements of E.ON SE were prepared."
"The complete Financial Statements of E.ON SE, with an 
unqualified opinion issued by the auditor, KPMG AG, Düsseldorf, 
will be announced in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger)."
"Outlook 
The E.ON SE Management Board has decided on a dividend policy 
that foresees annual growth in the dividend per share of up to 5 
percent through the dividend for the 2028 financial year."
"This also 
applies to dividend growth of up to 5 percent for the 2024 
financial year."
"E.ON will aim for an annual increase in dividend per 
share after 2028 as well."
"In E.ON’s strategy, sustainability with an 
emphasis on climate-neutral economic activities is a key growth 
factor that will enable E.ON to meet its dividend targets."
"However, the current situation gives forecasts a 
high degree of uncertainty."
"The forecast for global economic growth in 2024 takes into 
account stricter financing conditions, weak trade growth amid 
geopolitical tensions, and the effects of tighter monetary policy."
"Assuming that inflation continues to fall and real incomes rise, the 
OECD expects the global economy to grow by 3 percent in 2025."
"Global goods trade and industrial production are expected to 
regain momentum owing to the considerable drawdown of 
companies’ inventories, while China’s weak economic 
development will have a dampening effect."
"The European Commission’s experts predict that the EU’s GDP will 
grow by 1.3 percent in 2024 and 1.7 percent in 2025."
"Economic institutes anticipate that Germany’s economy will begin 
to recover and grow by 0.9 percent in 2024 and to normalize 
further in 2025 with GDP growth of 1.3 percent."
"Declining 
inflation at the end of 2023, rising incomes, and the high 
employment rate indicate an increase in purchasing power and 
overall economic demand, which support these estimates and 
forecasts."
"General Statement on E.ON’s Anticipated 
Development 
The growth strategy adopted in 2021 as a continuation of the 
Group’s far-reaching transformation in the preceding years proved 
to be correct and resilient in 2023 as well."
"In our view, the 
strategic elements of sustainability and digitalization, which 
remain valid and underscore E.ON’s growth ambitions, are 
precisely the success factors that will accelerate the 
transformation of the energy system."
"We anticipate that in 2024 
our operating business will continue to be shaped by a higher level 
of commodity prices and of inflation and interest rates than before 
the start of the crisis."
"Anticipated Earnings and Financial Situation 
Forecast Earnings Performance 
The most important key performance indicators for managing the 
E.ON Group are adjusted EBITDA, investments, and earnings per 
share from adjusted net income (“EPS”)."
"E.ON expects adjusted 
Group EBITDA of €8.8 to €9.0 billion in the 2024 financial year."
"It 
anticipates adjusted net income of €2.8 to €3.0 billion, or €1.07 to 
€1.15 per share in 2024 (based on around 2,612 million shares 
outstanding)."
"We report on the E.ON Group’s dividend policy and 
planned annual dividend growth in the E.ON on Capital Markets 
chapter."
"There are changes to the E.ON Group’s segment reporting 
effective January 1, 2024."
"The Energy Infrastructure Solutions 
(“EIS”) business, which was previously included in the Customer 
Solutions segment, has been carved out and will be reported as a 
separate segment."
"From 2024 onward, Customer Solutions also 
includes the activities of E.ON Energy Markets GmbH, our central 
commodity procurement unit (previously included in Corporate 
Functions/Other), and, due to its business activities’ new profile, 
has been renamed Energy Retail."
"E.ON expects Energy Networks to record an earnings increase in 
2024 compared with the past financial year."
"This performance will 
result from further growth in the regulated asset base due to 
additional investments along with positive regulatory changes, 
particularly in Sweden."
"In addition, brought forward catch-up 
effects for costs incurred in prior years for network losses that 
were not fully covered are expected in Hungary."
"Earnings at Energy Retail (formerly Customer Solutions), without 
the Energy Infrastructure Solutions business, are expected to be 
significantly below the prior-year level, which will not be 
significantly altered by the initial inclusion of E.ON Energy Markets 
GmbH."
"The non-recurrence of positive one-off effects and the 
anticipated stabilization of the market environment will have an 
adverse impact on earnings."
"This is 
mainly attributable to the higher investment activity of recent 
years and the related commissioning of new customer projects."
"Earnings at Corporate Functions/Other are expected to be below 
the prior-year level."
"Lower earnings from generation activities in 
Turkey and the fact that E.ON Energy Markets GmbH’s earnings 
are now reported at Energy Retail will have an adverse impact."
"Adjusted net income and earnings per share from adjusted net 
income (“EPS”) are expected to be below the prior-year level."
"In 
addition to the above-described developments in adjusted EBITDA, 
higher depreciation charges due to increased investments in the 
energy transition will have a negative impact."
"This will be partially 
offset by lower non-controlling interests resulting from a decline in 
operating earnings from companies with a significant share of 
minority interests."
"Planned Investments 
Investments in the sustainable expansion and digital 
transformation of energy networks and customer solutions 
operations form the basis for the value-driven growth E.ON aims 
to achieve."
"Investments of around €7.2 billion are therefore 
planned for the 2024 financial year."
"E.ON will make most of these investments in its Energy Networks 
segment, the backbone of a successful energy transition."
"Investments will go toward expanding, enhancing, and 
modernizing networks, switching equipment, and metering and 
control technology in order to ensure the reliable, uninterrupted, 
and sustainable distribution of electricity and to meet rising energy 
demand."
"In addition, E.ON will invest in the digitalization of 
network planning, monitoring, and control."
"Investments at Energy Infrastructure Solutions will mainly go 
toward business expansion in our markets in Sweden, Germany, 
and the United Kingdom."
"At Energy Retail, E.ON will invest in advanced IT platforms, smart 
charging solutions for eMobility, and integrated energy solutions."
"Corporate Functions/Other’s investments will go mainly toward 
Group-wide IT infrastructure and digital platforms for the 
networks and customer solutions business."
"The ERM is based on a centralized governance approach that 
defines standardized processes and tools covering the 
identification, evaluation, countermeasures as well as the 
monitoring and reporting of risks and chances."
"Overall governance 
is provided by the Group Controlling & Risk division’s Group Risk & 
Special Projects department on behalf of the E.ON SE Risk 
Committee."
"All risks and chances have an accountable member of the 
Management Board, have a designated risk owner who remains 
operationally responsible for managing that risk/chance, and are 
identified in a dedicated bottom-up process."
"Scope 
E.ON’s risk management system in the broader sense has a total of 
four components: 
• an internal monitoring system 
• a management information system 
• preventive measures 
• the ERM, which is a risk management system in the narrow 
sense."
"The purpose of the internal monitoring system is to ensure the 
proper functioning of business processes."
"This consists of 
preventive organizational measures (such as policies and work 
instructions) and internal controls and audits (particularly by 
Internal Audit)."
"The E.ON internal management information system identifies risks 
early so that steps can be taken to actively address them."
"General Measures to Limit Risks 
E.ON takes the following general preventive measures to limit
risks."
"Managing Legal and Regulatory Risks 
E.ON engages in extensive and constructive dialog with 
government agencies and policymakers in order to manage the 
risks resulting from the E.ON Group’s policy, legal, and regulatory 
environment."
"Furthermore, the Company strives to conduct proper 
project management so as to identify early and minimize the risks 
attending major investments."
"E.ON attempts to minimize the operational risks of legal 
proceedings and ongoing planning processes by managing them 
appropriately and by designing appropriate contracts beforehand."
"Managing Operational and IT Risks 
To limit operational and IT risks, E.ON continually improves its 
network management and the optimal deployment of its assets."
"At 
the same time, E.ON implements operational and infrastructure 
improvements that will enhance the reliability of its generation 
assets and distribution networks, even under extraordinarily 
adverse conditions."
"In addition, E.ON has factored the operational 
and financial effects of environmental risks into its emergency 
plan."
"They are part of a catalog of crisis and system-failure 
scenarios prepared for the Group by the Incident and Crisis 
Management team."
"E.ON IT systems are maintained and optimized by qualified E.ON 
Group experts and outside experts, and by a wide range of 
technological security measures."
"In addition, the E.ON Group has 
in place a range of technological and organizational measures to 
counter the risk of unauthorized access to data, the misuse of data, 
and data loss."
"Should an accident occur despite the measures taken, E.ON has a 
reasonable level of insurance coverage."
"Detailed information can 
be found in various chapters of the Combined Group Management 
Report."
"Managing Market Risks 
E.ON uses a comprehensive sales-management system and 
extensive customer management to manage margin risks caused 
by market prices."
"E.ON conducts systematic risk management to 
limit exposure to risks of price changes."
"Its key elements are, in 
addition to binding Group-wide policies and a Group-wide 
reporting system, the use of quantitative key figures, the 
limitation, pricing, and optimization of risks, and the strict 
separation of functions between departments."
"Furthermore, E.ON 
utilizes derivative financial instruments that are commonly used in 
the marketplace."
"These instruments are transacted with financial 
institutions, brokers, power exchanges, and third parties whose 
creditworthiness is monitored on an ongoing basis."
"E.ON’s local 
sales units and the remaining generation operations conduct local 
risk management under central governance standards to monitor 
these underlying commodity risks and to minimize them through 
hedging."
"Managing Strategic Risks 
E.ON has comprehensive preventive measures in place to manage
potential risks relating to acquisitions and investments."
"These 
measures include, in addition to the relevant company guidelines 
and manuals, comprehensive due diligence, legally binding 
contracts, a multistage approvals process, and shareholding and 
project controlling."
"Comprehensive post-acquisition projects also 
contribute to successful integration."
"Managing Finance and Treasury Risks 
This category encompasses credit, interest-rate, currency, tax, and 
asset-management risks and chances."
"E.ON uses systematic risk 
management to monitor and control its interest-rate and currency 
risks and manage these risks using derivative and non-derivative 
financial instruments."
"Here, E.ON SE plays a central role by 
aggregating risk positions through intragroup transactions and 
hedging these risks in the market."
"Due to E.ON SE’s intermediary 
role, its risk position is largely closed."
"E.ON manages credit risk by taking appropriate measures, which 
include obtaining collateral and setting limits."
"The E.ON Group’s 
Risk Committee is regularly informed about credit risks."
"A further 
component of E.ON’s risk management is a conservative 
investment strategy for financial funds and a broadly diversified 
portfolio."
"Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contains 
detailed information about the use of derivative financial 
instruments and hedging transactions."
"Note 32 describes the 
general principles of E.ON’s risk management and applicable risk 
metrics for quantifying risks relating to commodities, credit, 
liquidity, interest rates, and currency translation."
"As required by law, E.ON’s ERM’s effectiveness is reviewed 
regularly by Internal Audit."
"In compliance with the provisions of 
Section 91, Paragraph 2, of the German Stock Corporation Act 
relating to the establishment of a risk-monitoring and early 
warning system, E.ON has a Risk Committee for the E.ON Group 
and for each of its business units."
"The Risk Committee’s mission is 
to achieve a comprehensive overview of E.ON’s risk exposure at 
the Group and unit level and to actively manage risk exposure in 
line with E.ON’s risk strategy."
"The ERM applies to all fully consolidated E.ON Group companies 
and all companies valued at equity whose gross book value in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements is greater than €50 million."
"E.ON takes an inventory of its risks and chances at each quarterly
balance-sheet date."
"To promote uniform financial reporting Group-wide, E.ON has in 
place a central, standardized system that enables effective and 
automated risk reporting."
"Company data are systematically 
collected, transparently processed, and made available for analysis 
both centrally and decentrally at the units."
"Risks and chances are generally 
reported on the basis of objective evaluations."
"If this is not 
possible, estimates by in-house experts are used."
"The evaluation 
measures a risk’s/chance’s financial impact on the current earnings 
plan while factoring in risk-reducing countermeasures."
"The 
evaluation therefore reflects the net risk."
"For quantifiable risks and chances, E.ON then evaluates the 
likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss or damage."
"In the 
commodity business, for example, commodity prices can rise or 
fall."
This type of risk is modeled with a normal distribution.
Modeling is supported by a Group-wide IT-based system.
"Extremely unlikely events—those whose likelihood of occurrence is 
5 percent or less—are classified as tail events."
"Tail events are not 
included in the simulation described below."
"This statistical distribution makes it possible for E.ON’s internal 
risk management system to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of 
these risks."
"This yields an aggregated risk distribution that is 
quantified as the deviation from the Company’s current earnings 
plan for adjusted EBITDA."
"E.ON uses the 5th and 95th percentiles of this aggregated risk 
distribution as the worst case and best case, respectively."
"Statistically, this means that with this risk distribution there is a 90 
percent likelihood that the deviation from the Company’s current 
earnings plan for adjusted EBITDA will remain within these 
extremes."
"The impact 
classes are shown in the table above."
"The following description of risks by category alludes to the 
aforementioned impact classes."
"It also addresses major/high tail 
events and major/high qualitative risks."
"In the case of qualitative 
risks (which by definition are more difficult to assess both in terms 
of their loss amount and their probability), a further distinction is 
made between risks with a low probability (6 percent < x ≤ 25 
percent) and a medium probability (26 percent < x ≤ 50 percent)."
"Example: in category x, there is a risk y (medium, high) and a risk z 
(low, major)."
"In the case of tail events and qualitative risks, the focus is not only 
on E.ON’s key performance indicator, adjusted EBITDA, but also on 
other indicators relating to its asset and financial position."
"The E.ON Group has major risk positions in the following category: 
market risks."
"As a result, the aggregate risk position of E.ON SE as 
a Group is major."
"In other words, the E.ON Group’s maximum 
annual adjusted EBITDA risk ought not to exceed -€500 million to 
-€2 billion in 95 percent of all cases."
"Commodity prices, which rose sharply in 2022 in conjunction with 
the war in Ukraine, declined significantly in 2023."
"This has 
significant positive implications for the assessment of individual 
risks as well as, on the negative side, individual chances relative to 
the prior year."
"On the one hand, commodity prices can affect 
wheeling volume and prices in the sales business; on the other, it is 
a material risk factor for possible bad debts in the sales business."
"Persistently high commodity prices also lead to material 
counterparty risks; however, our major suppliers’ good credit 
ratings and system relevance continue to render the likelihood of 
occurrence very low (tail/high)."
"The energy network business could likewise experience a decline 
in wheeling volume, credit losses, price increases for network 
losses, and redispatch expenditures that lead to lower earnings."
"Risks and Chances by Category 
E.ON’s major risks and chances by risk category are described 
below."
"Also described are major risks and chances stemming from 
tail events as well as qualitative risks that would impact adjusted 
EBITDA by more than €500 million."
"Also included are risks and 
chances that would affect planned net income and/or cash flow."
"Legal and Regulatory Risks 
The political, legal, and regulatory environment in which the E.ON 
Group does business is a source of risks."
"This could confront E.ON 
with direct and indirect consequences that could lead to possible 
financial disadvantages."
"New risks—but also opportunities—arise 
from energy-policy decisions at the European and national level."
"The Energy Policy and Regulatory Environment chapter contains 
detailed information about the energy policy environment."
"In the wake of the economic and financial crisis in many EU 
member states, interventionist policies and regulations have been 
adopted in recent years, such as additional taxes and additional 
reporting requirements (for example, EMIR, MAR, REMIT, MiFID2)."
"The relevant agencies monitor compliance with these regulations 
closely."
This leads to attendant risks for E.ON’s operations.
"The 
same applies to price moratoriums, regulated price reductions, 
statutory price adjustment requirements, and changes to support 
schemes for renewables, which could pose risks to, as well as 
create chances for, E.ON’s operations in the respective countries."
"The operation of energy networks is subject to a large degree of 
government regulation."
"New laws and regulatory periods cause 
uncertainty for this business."
"In addition, matters related to 
Germany’s Renewable Energy Sources Act, such as issues 
regarding solar energy, can cause temporary fluctuations in cash 
flow and adjusted EBITDA."
"The rapid growth of renewables is also 
creating new risks for the network business."
"For example, 
insolvencies among renewables operators or feed-in tariffs unduly 
paid by grid operators lead to court or regulatory proceedings."
"This risk category also includes major risks arising from possible 
litigation, fines, and claims; governance and compliance issues; as 
well as risks and chances related to contracts and permits."
"This results in a 
medium risk and a medium chance position."
"In addition, the decommissioning of gas networks and attendant 
possible asset-retirement obligations could pose significant risks 
for the Energy Networks segment (tail, high)."
"The operations of the E.ON Group’s Customer Solutions segment 
subject it to certain risks relating to legal proceedings, ongoing 
planning processes, and regulatory changes."
"This poses a major risk 
(tail/high)."
"A significant change will result from Germany’s implementation of 
the European Court of Justice’s ruling requiring it to form a largely 
independent national regulatory agency, which could have an 
impact on E.ON’s regulated business activities in Sweden 
(low/major)."
"PreussenElektra’s business is substantially influenced by 
regulation as well."
"This could pose risks for its remaining business 
and the dismantling of decommissioned nuclear power plants."
"Operational and IT Risks 
The operational and strategic management of the E.ON Group 
relies heavily on complex information technology (“IT”) and 
complex operational technology (“OT”)."
"Consequently, there are 
risks and chances in conjunction with information security and the 
security of operating processes in E.ON’s business segments."
"Cybersecurity and the continuous protection of IT and OT systems 
against cyberattacks constitute a focus area of E.ON’s risk 
management."
"It is important that the operating units and the 
Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk Management divisions jointly 
and proactively evaluate and manage risks for E.ON."
"Technologically complex production facilities are used in the 
distribution of energy, resulting in major risks from procurement 
and logistics, construction, the operation and maintenance of 
assets, as well as general project risks."
"The risks at 
PreussenElektra encompass dismantling activities as well."
"E.ON’s 
operations in and outside Germany face major risks of a power 
failure as well as higher costs and additional investments resulting 
from unanticipated operational disruptions or other problems."
"Operational failures or extended production stoppages of facilities 
or components of facilities as well as environmental damage could 
negatively impact earnings, affect the cost situation, and/or result 
in the imposition of fines."
"In unlikely cases, this could lead to a high 
risk."
"Overall, it results in a moderate risk position and a low chance 
position in this category."
"General project risks can include delays 
and increased capital requirements."
"Extraordinary environmental events could also affect the operation 
of energy networks or equipment and equipment components."
This could pose a liquidity risk for E.ON (tail/major).
"E.ON could also be subject to environmental liabilities that could 
have a significant adverse impact on its business."
"In addition, new 
or amended environmental laws and regulations may result in cost
increases for E.ON."
"HSE, HR, and Other Risks 
Health and occupational safety are important aspects of E.ON’s 
day-to-day business."
"The Company’s operating activities can 
therefore pose risks in these areas and create social and 
environmental risks and chances."
"In addition, E.ON’s operating 
business potentially faces risks resulting from human error and 
employee turnover."
"It is important that E.ON acts responsibly 
along its entire value chain and that it communicates consistently, 
enhances the dialog, and maintains good relationships with key 
stakeholders."
"E.ON actively considers environmental, social, and 
corporate governance issues."
"These efforts support the Company’s 
business decisions and public relations."
"E.ON’s objective is to 
minimize reputational risks and retain public acceptance so that 
the Company can continue to operate its business successfully."
These matters result in a low risk and chance position.
"In the past, predecessor entities of E.ON SE conducted mining 
operations, resulting in obligations in North Rhine-Westphalia and 
Bavaria (low/major)."
E.ON SE can be held responsible for damage.
"This could lead to major individual risks that E.ON currently only 
evaluates qualitatively."
"Market Risks 
E.ON’s units operate in an international market environment that is
characterized by general risks relating to the business cycle."
"In 
addition, the entry of new suppliers into the marketplace along 
with more aggressive tactics by existing market participants and 
reputational risks have created a keener competitive environment 
for the Company’s sales business in and outside Germany, which 
could reduce margins."
"However, market developments could also 
have a positive impact on E.ON’s business."
"Such factors include 
wholesale and retail price developments, customer churn rates, 
and temporary volume effects in the network business."
"This 
results in a major risk and a medium chance position in this 
category."
"The demand for electric power and natural gas is seasonal, with 
E.ON’s operations generally experiencing higher demand during 
the cold-weather months of October through March and lower 
demand during the warm-weather months of April through 
September."
"As a result of these seasonal patterns, E.ON’s sales 
and results of operations are higher in the first and fourth quarters
and lower in the second and third quarters."
"Nevertheless, actual 
customer demand may deviate from the forecast owing to various 
factors (such as the weather and the economy)."
"Such deviations 
could have a positive or negative business impact, particularly in 
an environment of highly volatile prices."
"E.ON aims to reduce these 
impacts by, for example, pursuing a prudent hedging strategy in 
conjunction with a proactive approach to reforecasting or by 
pricing its risks vis-à-vis customers."
"Alongside E.ON’s own procurement organization for its sales 
business, the E.ON Energy Markets GmbH (“EEM”) subsidiary 
functions as a central interface to wholesale markets."
"EEM’s main 
purpose is to consolidate E.ON’s commodity positions in order to 
manage market price risks and to diversify and mitigate credit and 
margin (cash flow) risks."
"Strategic Risks 
E.ON’s business strategy involves acquisitions and investments in 
its core business as well as disposals."
"This strategy depends in part
on the ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate such 
companies that enhance, on acceptable terms, the Company’s 
energy business."
"In order to obtain the necessary approvals for 
acquisitions, E.ON may be required to divest other parts of its 
business or to make concessions or undertakings that affect its 
business."
"In addition, there can be no assurance that E.ON will be 
able to achieve the returns expected from any acquisition or 
investment."
"It is also possible that E.ON will not be able to realize 
its strategic ambition of enlarging its investment pipeline and that 
significant amounts of capital could be used for other 
opportunities."
"The overall risk position in this category was 
moderate at the balance-sheet date; the chance position was low."
"Furthermore, acquisitions and investments in new geographic 
areas or lines of business require E.ON to become familiar with 
new sales markets and competitors and to address the attending 
business risks."
"In the case of planned disposals, E.ON faces the risk of disposals 
not taking place or being delayed and the risk that E.ON receives 
lower-than-anticipated disposal proceeds."
"In addition, after 
transactions close E.ON could face major liability risks resulting 
from contractual obligations (tail/major)."
"Finance and Treasury Risks 
E.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through
the use of financial instruments."
"Credit risk results from non-
delivery or partial delivery by a counterparty or customer of the 
agreed consideration for services rendered, from total or partial 
failure to make payments owed on existing accounts receivable, 
and from replacement risks in open transactions."
"E.ON‘s international business operations are exposed to risks from 
currency fluctuation."
"One form of this risk is transaction risk, 
which arises when payments are made in a currency other than 
E.ON’s functional currency."
"Another form of risk is translation risk, 
which arises when currency fluctuations lead to accounting effects
when assets/liabilities and income/expenses of E.ON companies 
outside the eurozone are translated into euros and entered into 
E.ON’s Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Positive developments
in foreign-currency rates can also create chances for E.ON’s 
operating business."
"E.ON faces earnings risks relating to net income from financial 
liabilities, planned funding, and interest-rate derivatives that are
based on variable interest rates and from non-current asset-
retirement obligations."
"Derivative transactions may result in short-term cash inflows or 
outflows."
"This relates in particular to margin payments for 
electricity and gas procurement transactions on energy exchanges."
"The additional liquidity requirements potentially resulting from this 
are factored into E.ON’s financing strategy."
"In addition, the price changes and other uncertainty relating to the 
current and non-current investments E.ON makes to cover its non-
current obligations (particularly pension and asset-retirement 
obligations) could, in individual cases, be major."
"In principle, E.ON could also encounter tax risks and chances."
This category has a medium risk and a medium chance position.
"Furthermore, declining or rising discount rates could lead to 
increased or reduced provisions for pensions and asset-retirement 
obligations, including non-current liabilities (tail, major)."
"This can 
create a high balance-sheet risk for E.ON."
"Refinancing terms on debt capital markets depend in part on rating 
agencies’ credit ratings."
"Rating agencies Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch 
have given E.ON a strong investment-grade rating."
"E.ON has 
contracts that would trigger additional collateral requirements if 
certain rating levels were not met."
"Consequently, significant rating 
downgrades could lead to additional liquidity requirements 
(tail/high)."
"On the other hand, positive business performance or 
further debt reduction could have a positive impact on E.ON’s 
rating."
"ESG Risks and Chances   
► E.ON strives to operate responsibly at all times and therefore 
monitors all the material impacts of its business activities."
"Alongside financial aspects, E.ON also considers environmental, 
social, and governance (“ESG”) aspects along its value chain."
"This 
encompasses monitoring and assessing ESG risks and chances as 
well as their possible impact on the E.ON Group, but also the 
impact of E.ON’s business activities on the climate, the 
environment, employees, suppliers, and customers."
"The 
systematic consideration of non-financial issues enables the 
Company to identify opportunities and risks for business 
development at an early stage."
"E.ON has integrated the reporting of non-financial risks related to
ESG and their impact on the Group into the ERM."
"All risks and 
chances related to ESG are made identifiable in the ERM system."
"Sustainability risks can have a considerable impact on all of 
these known risk categories and can be a factor in contributing to 
their materiality."
"In addition, E.ON analyzes potential reportable risks within the 
meaning of Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Sentence 1, Items 3 and 4 
of the German Commercial Code (German abbreviation: “HGB“), 
while taking into account its ESG materiality analysis, 
management approaches, and the ERM’s findings."
"This involves 
considering risks relating to environmental, employee, and social 
matters as well as human rights, anticorruption, and antibribery."
"E.ON places an emphasis on analyzing its climate risks, in part 
because of E.ON’s support of the recommendations of the Task 
Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD“)."
"Safeguarding its assets against climate-change impacts and the 
climate resilience of its business model are economically relevant 
to E.ON."
"Physical climate risks are also the focus of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation’s do-no-significant-harm (“DNSH“) provisions (see the 
“EU Taxonomy” chapter)."
"They are assigned to the EU 
environmental objective 2 “climate change adaptation.“ E.ON 
assesses DNSH compliance with climate change adaptation at the 
Group level."
"Each E.ON Group business unit is required to 
comprehensively assess and record climate risks as part of its risk 
reporting."
"Any risks that significantly jeopardize climate change 
adaptation are identified in the risk management process."
"This 
basic approach to identifying any potential harm to climate change 
adaptation is verified in consultation with relevant specialist 
departments."
"In addition, in 2021 E.ON for the first time developed a qualitative 
scenario analysis describing the impact of three different climate 
scenarios on E.ON and on individual E.ON business units through 
2050."
"This involved defining three reference scenarios 
(conservative, ambitious, and fully committed) and assessing and 
identifying the relevant business units on the basis of key value 
drivers and related key performance indicators (“KPIs”)."
"The next 
step was to develop a qualitative scenario impact analysis by 
analyzing the key value drivers identified by the business units and 
by performing a risk assessment as well as by evaluating the 
business impacts."
"The last step was to develop strategic 
recommendations."
"This scenario analysis was enlarged in 2022 and applied to the 
climate risks defined in the EU taxonomy."
"First, E.ON’s main EU 
taxonomy-aligned economic activities and its companies making 
the main contribution to the corresponding investments were 
identified centrally."
"Next, these companies used a bottom-up 
process to determine the climate risks for the relevant economic 
activities or investments in accordance with the EU taxonomy 
catalog."
These risks were then subjected to a scenario analysis.
"A 
qualitative risk assessment was performed for each identified 
climate risk and economic activity in line with the IPCC scenarios 
SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 for the reference period 2041 to 2060."
"We conducted an update of the scenario analysis for the 2023 
financial year."
"The findings of this risk assessment do not differ in 
nature from the risks already reported and managed in the ERM."
"As for the amount of damage estimated in the scenario analysis, in 
2023 there were again no significant deviations from the century 
events for weather or climate risks already reported in the ERM."
"◄ 
Management Board’s Evaluation of the Risk and 
Chances Situation 
The E.ON Group’s overall risk and chances situation at year-end 
2023 changed significantly relative to year-end 2022, in particular 
because of lower commodity prices."
"Energy Networks (Germany, 
Sweden, and East-Central Europe/Turkey), Customer Solutions 
(Germany, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Other), and 
Corporate Functions/Other are the Company’s IFRS reportable 
segments."
"E.ON SE prepares its Financial Statements in accordance with the 
German Commercial Code, the SE Ordinance (in conjunction with 
the German Stock Corporation Act), and the German Energy Act."
"E.ON prepares a Combined Group Management Report which 
applies to both the E.ON Group and E.ON SE."
"Accounting Process 
All companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
must comply with E.ON’s uniform Accounting and Reporting 
Guidelines for the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements and 
the Interim Consolidated Financial Statements."
"These guidelines 
describe applicable IFRS accounting and valuation principles."
"They 
also explain accounting principles typical in the E.ON Group, such 
as those for provisions for nuclear-waste management, the 
treatment of financial instruments, and the treatment of 
regulatory obligations."
"E.ON regularly analyzes amendments to 
laws, new or amended accounting standards, and other important 
pronouncements for their relevance to, and consequences for, the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and, if necessary, update its 
guidelines and systems accordingly."
"Corporate Functions defines and oversees the roles and 
responsibilities of various Group entities in the preparation of E.ON 
SE’s Financial Statements and the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"These roles and responsibilities are described in a 
Group Policy document."
"E.ON Group companies are responsible for preparing their financial 
statements in a proper and timely manner."
"They receive 
substantial support from Business Service Centers in Regensburg, 
Germany; Cluj, Romania; and Kraków, Poland."
"E.ON SE combines 
the financial statements of subsidiaries belonging to its scope of 
consolidation into its Consolidated Financial Statements using 
standard consolidation software."
"Group Accounting is responsible 
for conducting the consolidation and for monitoring adherence to 
the guidelines for scheduling, processes, and contents."
"Monitoring 
by means of system-based automated controls is supplemented 
by manual checks."
"In conjunction with the year-end closing process, additional 
qualitative and quantitative information relevant for accounting is 
compiled."
"Furthermore, dedicated quality-control processes are in 
place for all relevant departments to discuss and ensure the 
completeness of important information on a regular basis."
E.ON SE’s Financial Statements are prepared with SAP software.
"The accounting and preparation processes are divided into discrete 
functional steps."
"Bookkeeping processes have largely been 
outsourced to E.ON’s Business Service Centers."
"Cluj has the 
primary responsibility for processes relating to subsidiary ledgers 
and several bank activities."
"Regensburg has the principal 
responsibility for processes relating to the general ledgers."
Automated or manual controls are integrated into each step.
"Defined procedures ensure that all transactions and the 
preparation of E.ON SE’s Financial Statements are recorded, 
processed, assigned on an accrual basis, and documented in a 
complete, timely, and accurate manner."
"Relevant data from E.ON 
SE’s Financial Statements are, if necessary, adjusted to conform 
with IFRS and then transferred to the consolidation software 
system using SAP-supported transfer technology."
"The following explanations about E.ON’s internal control system 
(“ICS”) and its general IT controls apply equally to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and to E.ON SE’s Financial Statements."
"Furthermore, it serves to assure compliance to 
significant internal and external regulations and to assure 
effectiveness and efficiency of business activities."
"The 
management of each unit in the E.ON Group is legally responsible 
for establishing and maintaining an adequate and effective internal 
control system (“ICS”)."
"The Compliance function is responsible for 
the implementation of the compliance management system 
(“CMS”) which is described in the Corporate Governance 
Declaration."
"The ICS 
department at Corporate Audit is responsible for the oversight and 
coordination of the overall ICS process in order to ensure an 
effective ICS in the E.ON Group."
"For this purpose, the ICS 
department at Corporate Audit provides the ICS framework and 
the necessary tools."
"An ICS Business Partner (“ICS BP”) is assigned 
to each unit that is of importance to the E.ON Group and therefore 
in the ICS documentation scope."
"The unit’s management remains responsible for 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of the implemented ICS."
"The ICS BP system ensures a uniform approach as well as 
consistent and efficient collaboration and fosters continuous 
improvement by means of extensive information-sharing among 
Group companies."
"E.ON’s ICS Framework 
E.ON’s ICS is based on the globally recognized COSO framework 
from May 2013 (COSO: The Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission)."
"The catalog of ICS Principles, which defines the minimum 
requirements for an effective internal control system, is a key 
component of E.ON’s ICS."
"All fully consolidated companies and majority-
owned units are subject to the ICS Principles."
"In addition to the ICS Principles, certain units of special importance 
to the E.ON Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements must fulfill 
several additional ICS requirements for selected processes."
"These 
requirements relate to the documentation and assessment of the 
relevant processes and controls—the ICS model—as well as 
reporting to Corporate Audit."
"A functionally managed digital organization and third-party service 
providers provide IT and digital services for the E.ON Group."
"The documentation of the IT general controls 
is stored in E.ON’s documentation system."
"Each year, qualitative criteria and quantitative materiality aspects 
are used to determine which processes and controls must be 
documented and assessed by which E.ON units."
"E.ON units in the ICS documentation scope use a central 
documentation system (SAP-GRC) for this purpose."
"The system 
contains the scope, detailed documentation requirements, the 
assessment requirements for process owners, and the final Sign-
Off process."
"Management Self-Assessment and Control Tests 
After E.ON units have documented their processes and controls, 
the individual process owners conduct an annual assessment of 
the design and the operational effectiveness of the controls 
embedded in these processes and the ICS principles."
"This is known 
as a management self-assessment."
"The assessment is supported 
by tests of control effectiveness for selective risk areas."
"Corporate 
Audit’s ICS department defines the methodology for these tests, 
which are conducted by the process owners or employees 
assigned by them."
"In addition, the effectiveness of the internal controls is audited by 
Internal Audit."
"These audits are conducted based on a risk-oriented 
audit plan."
"Any identified deficiencies are reported to the relevant 
companies."
"The findings of the management self-assessments and the audits 
are included in the integrated annual report on the effectiveness of 
the entire E.ON Group’s ICS and are reported to the E.ON SE 
Management Board."
"Sign-Off Process 
Based on the self-assessment result and internal and external 
audit findings, the respective management of the unit conducts 
the final Sign-Off."
"The final step of the internal evaluation process 
is the submission of a formal written declaration confirming the 
ICS’s effectiveness (“Sign-Off”)."
"The Sign-Off process is conducted 
at all levels of the Group companies before E.ON SE, as the final 
step, conducts it for the Group as a whole."
"The Chairman of the 
E.ON SE Management Board and the Chief Financial Officer 
perform the final Sign-Off for the E.ON Group."
"Corporate Audit regularly informs the E.ON SE Supervisory 
Board’s Audit & Risk Committee about the ICS for financial 
reporting and about any significant deficiencies identified in the 
E.ON Group’s various processes."
"The entire Management Board is not 
aware of any circumstances arising from its examination of the ICS 
and ERM system and the reporting of the Corporate Audit and 
Group Risk functions that speak against the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of these systems in all material respects."
"Each 
share of stock grants the same rights and one vote at a 
Shareholders Meeting."
"Restrictions on Voting Rights or the Transfer of 
Shares 
An employee stock-purchase program was offered in 2021 and 
2022."
"Shares acquired by employees under the employee stock-
purchase program are subject to a blackout period that begins the 
day ownership of such shares is transferred to the employee and 
that ends on December 31 of the next calendar year plus one."
"As a 
rule, an employee may not sell such shares until the blackout 
period has expired."
"Pursuant to Section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(German abbreviation: “AktG”), the Company’s treasury shares 
give it no rights, including no voting rights."
"Legal Provisions and Rules of the Company’s Articles 
of Association Regarding the Appointment and 
Dismissal of Management Board Members and 
Amendments to the Articles of Association 
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Management Board consists of at least two members."
"The 
Supervisory Board decides on the number of members as well as 
on their appointment and dismissal."
"The Supervisory Board appoints members to the Management 
Board for a term not exceeding five years; reappointment is 
permissible."
"If several persons are appointed as members of the 
Management Board, the Supervisory Board may appoint one of the 
members as Chairperson of the Management Board."
"If there is a 
vacancy on the Management Board for a required member, the 
court makes the necessary appointment upon petition by a 
concerned party in the event of an urgent matter."
"The Supervisory 
Board may revoke the appointment of a member of the 
Management Board and of the Chairperson of the Management 
Board for serious cause (for further details, see Sections 84 and 85 
of the AktG)."
"Resolutions of the Shareholders Meeting require a majority of the 
valid votes cast unless mandatory law or the Articles of 
Association explicitly prescribe otherwise."
"An amendment to the 
Articles of Association requires a two-thirds majority of the votes 
cast or, in cases where at least half of the share capital is 
represented, a simple majority of the votes cast unless mandatory 
law explicitly prescribes another type of majority."
"The Supervisory Board is authorized to decide by resolution on 
amendments to the Articles of Association that affect only their 
wording (Section 10, Paragraph 7, of the Articles of Association)."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the 
wording of Section 3 of the Articles of Association upon utilization 
of authorized or conditional capital."
"Management Board’s Power to Issue or Buy Back 
Shares 
Pursuant to a resolution of the Shareholders Meeting of May 28, 
2020, the Management Board is authorized, until May 27, 2025, 
to have the Company acquire treasury shares."
"The shares acquired 
and other treasury shares that are in possession of or to be 
attributed to the Company pursuant to Sections 71a et seq."
"of the 
AktG must altogether at no point account for more than 10 
percent of the Company’s share capital."
"These authorizations may be utilized on one or several occasions, 
in whole or in partial amounts, in pursuit of one or more objectives 
by the Company and also by its affiliated companies or by third 
parties for the Company’s account or one of its affiliates’ account."
"In addition, the Management Board is authorized to cancel 
treasury shares, without such cancellation or its implementation 
requiring an additional resolution by the Shareholders Meeting."
"of the AktG; 
“Authorized Capital 2020”)."
"Subject to the Supervisory Board’s 
approval, the Management Board is authorized to exclude 
shareholders’ subscription rights."
"At the Annual Shareholders Meeting of May 28, 2020, 
shareholders approved a conditional increase of the Company’s 
share capital (with the option to exclude shareholders’ subscription 
rights) up to the amount of €264 million (“Conditional Capital 
2020”)."
"Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
contains more information about Conditional Capital 2020."
"Significant Agreements to Which the Company Is a 
Party That Take Effect on a Change of Control of the 
Company Following a Takeover Bid 
The underlying contracts of debt issued since 2007 contain 
change-of-control clauses that give the creditor the right of 
cancellation."
"This applies, inter alia, to bonds issued by E.ON SE 
and E.ON International Finance B.V."
"and guaranteed by E.ON SE 
and other instruments such as credit contracts."
"Granting change-
of-control rights to creditors is considered good corporate 
governance and has become standard market practice."
"More 
information about financial liabilities is contained in the section of 
the Combined Group Management Report entitled Financial 
Situation and in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Management Board 
members’ severance payment consists of their base salary and 
target bonus plus fringe benefits for two years after termination of 
their service agreement."
"In accordance with the DCGK, these 
severance payments are limited to the amount of the annual 
compensation for the remaining term of the service agreement."
"Total compensation for the past financial year and the expected 
total compensation for the current financial year in which the 
service agreement ends prematurely are used to calculate the 
severance payment cap."
"The purpose of these contractual agreements is to preserve the 
independence of Management Board members."
"A change-of-control event would also result in the early payout of 
virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan."
"Other Disclosures Regarding Takeovers 
The Company has been notified about the following direct or

voting rights: 
• notification on December 10, 2020, by RWE Aktiengesellschaft 
for 15 percent of the voting rights."
"Stock with special rights granting power of control has not been 
issued."
"In the case of stock given by the Company to employees,

This relates to energy procurement and sales contracts that are not classified as own-use contracts under IFRS 9 and are accounted for as commodity derivatives.
2Cash and cash equivalents of continuing operations at the end of the period of the previous year also include €12 million attributable to VSEH Group that was deconsolidated in the fourth quarter of 2023.
"On 
March 4, 2024, the Board of Management of E.ON SE approved 
the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2023, 
for publication."
The Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared in euros.
"Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are shown in millions of 
euros (€ million)."
"For accounting reasons, rounding differences 
may occur."
"These financial statements relate to the financial year 
from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with IAS 1, 
“Presentation of Financial Statements” (“IAS 1”), the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets have been prepared using a classified balance 
sheet structure."
"Assets that will be realized within 12 months of 
the reporting date, as well as liabilities that are due to be settled 
within one year of the reporting date are generally classified as 
current."
"The Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using 
the nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal 
purposes."
"Scope of Consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the financial 
statements of E.ON SE and entities controlled by E.ON 
(“subsidiaries”)."
"Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee 
and has the ability to use its power over the investee to influence 
those returns."
"Control is generally deemed established when a 
majority of the voting rights is held."
"An entity is a structured entity 
if control is based on contractual arrangements or other legal 
relationships and is not reflected in a majority of voting rights."
"The results of the subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the 
year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income from 
the date of acquisition or until the date of their disposal, 
respectively."
"Where necessary, adjustments are made to the subsidiaries’ 
financial statements to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those of the Group."
"Intercompany receivables, liabilities and 
results are eliminated in the consolidation process."
"Associated Companies 
An associate is an investee over whose financial and operating 
policy decisions E.ON has significant influence and that is not 
controlled by E.ON or jointly controlled with E.ON."
"Significant 
influence is presumed if E.ON directly or indirectly holds at least 
20 percent, but not more than 50 percent, of an entity’s voting 
rights."
"Interests in associated companies are accounted for using 
the equity method."
"Interests in associated companies accounted for using the equity 
method are reported on the balance sheet at cost, adjusted for 
changes in the Group’s share of the net assets after the date of 
acquisition and for any impairment charges."
"Losses that might 
potentially exceed the Group’s interest in an associated company 
when attributable long-term loans are taken into consideration are 
generally not recognized."
"Any difference between the cost of the 
investment and the pro rata remeasured value of its net assets is 
recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements as part of the 
carrying amount."
"Companies accounted for using the equity method are tested for 
impairment by comparing the carrying amount with its recoverable 
amount."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, 
the carrying amount is adjusted for this difference."
"If the reasons 
for previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist, such 
impairment losses are reversed accordingly."
"Joint Ventures 
Joint ventures are also accounted for using the equity method."
"Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with joint-
venture companies are eliminated within the consolidation process 
on a pro rata basis if they are material."
"Joint Operations 
A joint operation exists when E.ON and other investors directly 
control an operation, but unlike a joint venture, they do not have a 
claim to the changes in net assets from the operation."
"Instead, 
they have direct rights to individual assets or direct obligations 
with respect to individual liabilities in connection with the 
operation."
"E.ON recognizes assets and liabilities as well as 
revenues and expenses in a joint operation pro rata according to 
the rights and obligations attributable to E.ON."
"If exchange or market prices are unavailable for 
consideration, fair values are derived from market prices for 
comparable assets or comparable transactions."
"If these values are 
not directly observable, fair value is determined using appropriate 
valuation methods."
"In such cases, E.ON determines fair value using 
the discounted cash flow method by discounting estimated future 
cash flows by a weighted-average cost of capital."
"Non-controlling interests can be measured either at cost (partial 
goodwill method) or at fair value (full goodwill method)."
"The choice 
of method can be made on a case-by-case basis."
"The partial 
goodwill method is generally used within the E.ON Group."
"Intangible assets must be recognized separately if they are clearly 
separable or if their recognition arises from a contractual or other 
legal right."
"Provisions for restructuring measures may not be 
recorded in a purchase price allocation."
"If the purchase price paid 
exceeds the proportional share in the revalued net assets at the 
time of acquisition, the positive difference is recognized as 
goodwill."
"No goodwill is recognized for positive differences 
attributable to non-controlling interests."
"A negative difference is 
recognized in net income."
"Foreign Currency Translation 
The Company’s transactions denominated in foreign currency are 
translated at the current exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction."
"Gains and losses from the translation of non-derivative financial 
instruments used in hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are recognized in equity as a component of other 
comprehensive income."
"The ineffective portion of the hedging 
instrument is immediately recognized in net income."
"The functional currency as well as the reporting currency of E.ON 
SE is the euro."
"The assets and liabilities of Group companies with a 
functional currency other than the euro are translated using the 
mid-market exchange rates applicable on the balance sheet date."
"The income statements of foreign Group companies with a 
functional currency other than the euro are translated using annual 
average exchange rates."
"Differences arising from the application of 
both rates are recognized directly in equity."
"As a 
result, among other things, non-monetary assets and liabilities are 
generally adjusted using a general price index and a gain or loss on 
the net monetary position is recognized."
"For additional information 
on the application of IAS 29 in fiscal year 2023, please refer to 
Note 16."
"Recognition of Income 
a) Revenues 
Revenues in the “Customer Solutions” segment are generated 
primarily from the sale of electricity and gas to retail customers, 
industrial and commercial customers and wholesale markets as 
well as from district heating and cooling."
"For contracts that do not 
provide for defined purchase quantities, the performance 
obligation consists in particular in the provision and availability of 
energy on demand at any time (standing ready obligation)."
"The 
distribution of products and services used to increase energy 
efficiency and energy autonomy are also part of the “Customer 
Solutions” business."
"In the Energy Networks business, mainly earnings from the 
distribution of electricity and gas are included in revenues."
"E.ON 
makes the electricity and gas distribution network available to its 
customers."
"Significant parts of the fees generated from this 
distribution are regulated and are therefore subject to efficiency-
based upper limits on revenue."
"Revenues are generally recognized when E.ON fulfills its 
performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service 
to a customer."
"An asset is deemed to be transferred when the 
customer obtains control of the asset."
"The majority of the E.ON 
Group’s revenues are recognized over time because customers use 
these services when they are provided."
"For all such revenues, 
progress is measured using output-based methods, e.g., through 
the measurement of services that have already been provided or 
units that have been produced or delivered."
"For construction 
contracts, the stage of completion for overtime revenue 
recognition can be determined using input-based methods, such as 
the cost-to-cost method."
"The methods used appropriately reflect 
the pattern of transfer of goods to customers or provision of 
services for customers."
"The relatively subordinate point-in-time 
revenue recognition occurs primarily in the “Build & Sell” area on 
the installation of solar panels or charging stations and for so-
called linear products, where a fixed amount of energy is provided 
to commercial customers at a specific point in time."
"Revenue is 
recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which 
means that no significant discretionary decisions are required."
"Revenues from the sale of goods and services are measured using 
the transaction prices allocated to these goods and services."
"They 
reflect the value of the volume supplied, including an estimated 
value of the volume supplied to customers between the date of the 
last invoice and the end of the period."
"Monthly advance payments 
for B2C customers are generally determined on the basis of 
historical consumption data, taking into account current 
temperature effects."
"Peak payments are settled at the end of the 
settlement period."
"In B2B, a bottom-up approach is used to 
calculate individual rates."
"E.ON’s sales 
transactions generally are not based on any material finance 
components."
"The average target payment period is generally 
between 10 and 30 days, in exceptional cases longer."
"Refunds to 
customers are an exception and are granted if the customer is 
disconnected from the power supply for an extended period of 
time."
"Cash bonuses or bonus payments to customers are 
recognized as refund liabilities and presented as a decrease in 
revenues uniformly over the term of the contract."
"As a rule, no 
warranties are granted in the Core Business."
"Warranties are only 
granted in the “Build & Sell” activities."
"b) Interest Income 
Interest income is recognized pro rata using the effective interest
method."
"c) Dividend Income 
Dividend income is recognized when the right to receive the 
distribution payment arises."
"Electricity and Energy Taxes 
Electricity and energy taxes are levied on electricity and natural 
gas delivered to retail customers and are calculated on the basis of 
a fixed tax rate per kilowatt-hour (“kWh”)."
"This rate varies between 
different classes of customers."
"Electricity and energy taxes 
payable are deducted from sales revenues on the face of the 
income statement if those taxes are levied upon delivery of energy 
to the retail customer."
"Earnings per Share 
Basic (undiluted) earnings per share is computed by dividing the 
consolidated net income attributable to the shareholders of the 
parent company by the weighted-average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the relevant period."
"At E.ON, the 
computation of diluted earnings per share is identical to that of 
basic earnings per share because E.ON SE has issued no potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares."
"The increase in the weighted-average 
number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the issue of 
treasury shares in E.ON SE under the voluntary employee stock 
purchase program."
"Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at the 
cash-generating unit level on at least an annual basis."
"The term 
cash-generating unit also always includes groups of cash-
generating units and is referred to in simplified form as a cash-
generating unit."
"Goodwill must also be tested for impairment, 
during the year, at the level of individual cash-generating units if 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable 
amount of a particular cash-generating unit might be impaired, 
resulting in a shortfall in the carrying amount."
"Newly created goodwill is allocated to those cash-generating units 
expected to benefit from the respective business combination."
"The 
cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are generally 
equivalent to the operating segments, since goodwill is reported, 
and considered in performance metrics for controlling, only at that 
level."
"Goodwill 
impairment testing is performed in euros, while the underlying 
goodwill is always carried in the functional currency."
"In a first step, E.ON determines the recoverable amount of a cash-
generating unit on the basis of the fair value (less costs to sell) 
using generally accepted valuation procedures."
"This is based on 
the medium-term planning data of the respective cash-generating 
unit."
"If needed, a 
calculation of value in use is also performed."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the 
goodwill allocated to that cash-generating unit is adjusted in the 
amount of this difference."
"E.ON performs the annual testing of goodwill for impairment at 
the cash-generating unit level in the fourth quarter on October 1 of 
each fiscal year."
"Impairment charges on the goodwill of a cash-generating unit and 
reported in the income statement under “Depreciation, 
amortization and impairment charges” may not be reversed in 
subsequent reporting periods."
"Intangible Assets 
IAS 38, “Intangible Assets” (“IAS 38”), requires that intangible 
assets be amortized over their expected useful lives unless their 
lives are considered to be indefinite."
"Factors such as typical 
product life cycles and legal or similar limits on use are taken into 
account in the classification."
"Internally generated intangible assets subject to amortization are 
related to software and are recognized as development costs."
"Intangible assets subject to amortization are generally amortized 
using the straight-line method over their expected useful lives."
"The 
useful lives of customer relationships and similar assets range 
between 2 and 50 years, and between 3 and 50 years for 
concessions, industrial property rights, licenses and similar rights, 
unless depreciation based on consumption reflects an appropriate 
level of depletion."
"This latter category includes software in 
particular."
"Useful lives and amortization methods are subject to 
regular verification."
"Intangible assets subject to amortization are 
tested for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired."
Intangible assets whose use has not yet started are not amortized.
"An impairment test is carried out at least once a year as well as 
whenever there are indications of impairment, either for the 
individual asset or at the level of the cash-generating unit."
"The 
useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite life is tested 
annually to determine whether the indefinite life assumption 
continues to be justified."
"Both assets with definite and indefinite useful lives are impaired if 
the recoverable amount—the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use—is lower than the carrying amount."
"See Note 15 for additional information about goodwill and 
intangible assets."
"Research and Development Costs 
Under IFRS, expenditure on research is expensed as incurred, while 
costs incurred during the development phase of new products, 
services and technologies are to be recognized as assets when the 
specific criteria for recognition specified in IAS 38 are present."
"In 
the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, E.ON capitalized costs for 
internally generated software and other technologies in this 
context."
"Useful lives are regularly 
tested for appropriateness and the underlying assumptions and 
estimates are updated, for example, in view of technical, economic 
or legal circumstances."
"The useful lives of the most significant asset classes of material 
property, plant and equipment are presented below: 
    
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an 
asset may be impaired."
"In such a case, property, plant and 
equipment are tested for impairment according to the principles 
prescribed for intangible assets in IAS 36."
"If the reasons for the 
impairment losses previously recognized under depreciation, 
amortization and impairment charges no longer exist, such 
impairment losses are reversed and recognized in income."
"Such 
reversal shall not cause the carrying amount to exceed the amount 
that would have resulted had no impairment taken place during 
the preceding periods."
"Repair and maintenance costs that do not constitute significant 
replacement capital expenditure are expensed as incurred."
"In the case of 
a specific financing arrangement, the respective borrowing costs 
incurred for that particular arrangement during the period are 
used."
"For non-specific financing arrangements, a financing rate 
uniform within the Group of 2.66 percent was applied for 2023 
(2022: 2.59 percent)."
Other borrowing costs are expensed.
"Government Grants 
The Group receives grants for assets and grants related to income."
"Government investment subsidies do not reduce the acquisition 
and production costs of the respective assets; they are instead 
reported on the balance sheet as deferred income."
"They are 
recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the associated 
asset’s expected useful life."
"Grants related to income are also generally recognized as deferred 
income on the balance sheet."
"The liability item is reversed over the 
period necessary to match the corresponding income effects that 
are intended to compensate for the government grants."
"Grants are 
recognized in the same way as subsidized items."
"Government grants are recognized at fair value if the Group 
satisfies the necessary conditions for receipt of the grant and if it is 
highly probable that the grant will be issued."
"Leasing 
Lease agreements are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 16, 
“Leases” (“IFRS 16”)."
"A lease is an agreement that conveys the 
right to use an identified asset for a specified period in exchange 
for consideration."
"In certain cases, agreements that are not 
concluded in the form of a rental or lease agreement (e.g., physical 
power purchase agreements) are also reviewed to determine 
whether they contain a lease in accordance with IFRS 16."
"E.ON is 
party to some agreements in which it is the lessor and to others in 
which it is the lessee."
"E.ON as Lessee 
Transactions in which E.ON acts as a lessee are accounted for on 
the basis of the right-of-use model."
"The recognition exemption of 
IFRS 16.5 is used for low-value leases and for agreements with a 
lease term of less than 12 months (short-term leases)."
"Accordingly, there is no recognition of the right-of-use asset and 
the lease liability."
"Instead, the payments are recognized on a 
straight-line basis as an expense."
"In line with internal management 
practice, intragroup leases are recognized as current expenses in 
the segment reporting."
"A lease liability is recognized in the amount of the present value of 
the existing payment obligation."
"Present value is determined by discounting with an 
incremental borrowing rate that is equivalent in terms of risk and 
term if the implicit interest rate cannot be determined."
"The liability 
is subsequently measured using the effective interest method."
"A 
right-of-use asset corresponding with the lease liability is 
recognized in the amount of the present value of the lease 
payments."
"The initial recognition amount of the right-of-use asset 
is increased by the amount of the initial direct costs, as well as 
expected costs for asset retirement obligations; prepayments 
made are included and lease incentives received are deducted from 
the initial recognition amount."
"A right-of-use asset is subsequently 
measured at amortized cost."
"Depreciation is carried out on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful 
life of the identified asset."
"An impairment test is carried out in 
accordance with IAS 36 if events or changed circumstances 
indicate an impairment."
"E.ON ensures its operational flexibility when concluding leasing 
agreements through the use of extension and termination options."
"In determining the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and 
circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise 
existing options."
"The lease term therefore also includes periods 
covered by extension options if it is assumed with reasonable 
certainty that they will be exercised."
"E.ON as Lessor 
Lease transactions in which E.ON acts as lessor are classified as 
operating or finance leases depending on the distribution of risks 
and rewards."
"If a lease is classified as an operating lease, E.ON 
recognizes the identified asset and recognizes the lease payments 
as other operating income on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term."
"For finance leases, the identified asset is derecognized and a 
receivable is recognized in the amount of the net investment value."
"Payments made by the lessee are treated as a reduction of the 
lease receivable or interest income."
"The income from such 
arrangements is recognized over the term of the lease using the 
effective interest method."
"Subleases are classified based on the 
right-of-use asset under the head lease."
"Financial Instruments 
Non-Derivative Financial Instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments are measured in accordance 
with IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” (“IFRS 9”)."
"They are 
recognized at fair value, including transaction costs, on the 
settlement date when acquired, provided they are not recognized 
at fair value through profit and loss."
"If a financial asset is held for the purpose of collecting contractual 
cash flows and the cash flows of the financial asset represent 
exclusively interest and principal payments, then the financial 
asset is measured at amortized cost (AmC)."
"Unrealized gains and losses from financial assets measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), net of related 
deferred taxes, are reported as a component of equity (other 
comprehensive income) until realized."
"Realized gains and losses 
are determined by analyzing each transaction individually."
"Debt instruments that do not exclusively serve to collect 
contractual cash flows or to both generate contractual cash flows 
and sales revenue, or whose cash flows do not exclusively consist 
of interest and principal payments are measured at fair value 
through profit and loss (FVPL)."
"For equity instruments that are not 
held for trading purposes, E.ON does not exercise the FVOCI 
option."
"Impairments of financial assets are both recognized for losses 
already incurred and for expected future credit defaults."
"The 
amount of the impairment loss calculated in the determination of 
expected credit losses is recognized on the income statement."
"The expected future credit loss is calculated by multiplying the 
probability of default by the carrying amount of the financial asset 
(exposure at default) and the expected loss ratio (loss given 
default)."
"For information on the treatment of impairments under 
IFRS 9, please see Note 32."
"Non-derivative financial liabilities (including trade payables) within 
the scope of IFRS 9 are measured at amortized cost, using the 
effective interest method."
"Initial measurement takes place at fair 
value, with transaction costs included in the measurement."
"In the 
subsequent measurement, the residual carrying amount is 
adjusted by the amortization and accretion of any premium or 
discount remaining until maturity."
"The premium or discount is 
recognized in financial results over its term."
"Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging 
Derivative financial instruments and separated embedded 
derivatives are measured at fair value as of the trading date at 
initial recognition."
"Under IFRS 9, they are classified as at fair value 
through profit and loss (FVPL) as long as they are not a component 
of a hedge accounting relationship."
"Gains and losses from changes 
in fair value are immediately recognized in net income."
"The instruments primarily used are foreign currency forwards and 
cross-currency interest rate swaps, as well as interest rate swaps."
"In commodities, the instruments used primarily include physically 
and financially settled forwards and options related to electricity 
and gas."
"As part of fair value measurement in accordance with IFRS 13, the 
counterparty risk is also taken into account for derivative financial 
instruments."
"E.ON determines this risk based on a portfolio 
valuation in a bilateral approach for both own credit risk (debt 
value adjustment) and the credit risk of the corresponding 
counterparty (credit value adjustment)."
"The counterparty risks 
thus determined are allocated to the individual financial 
instruments by applying the relative fair value method on a net 
basis."
"E.ON has designated some of these derivatives as part of a 
hedging relationship."
"IFRS 9 sets requirements for the 
admissibility of hedging instruments and the underlyings, the 
formal designation and documentation of hedging relationships, 
the hedging strategy, as well as fulfilling requirements of 
effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting."
"The 
designated hedged items and hedging instruments are subject to 
the same risk."
"This economic relationship ensures that the 
amounts of the hedged items and hedging instruments are offset 
against each other and that the hedging relationships are therefore 
effective."
The hedge ratio of the hedges is 1:1.
"Ineffectiveness 
arises only if the measurement parameters of the hedged item and 
the hedging instrument differ from one another or in the case of 
subsequent designation of the hedging instrument."
"All 
components of derivative gains and losses from the measurement 
of hedge ineffectiveness are taken into consideration during 
recognition."
"For qualifying fair value hedges, the change in the fair value of the 
derivative and the change in the fair value of the hedged item that 
is due to the hedged risk(s) are recognized in income."
"In accordance with IFRS 9, the currency 
basis spread (hedging costs) will be separated from the hedging 
instrument and reported separately as an excluded component in 
accumulated other comprehensive income in the reserve for 
hedging costs as a component of equity."
"The hedging result is reclassified into income during the period in 
which the cash flows of the hedged asset are recognized in 
income."
"The result is recognized immediately in income if it 
becomes probable that the hedged underlying transaction will no 
longer occur."
"For hedging instruments used to establish cash flow 
hedges, the change in fair value of the ineffective portion is 
recognized immediately in the income statement to the extent 
required."
"To hedge the foreign currency risk arising from the Company’s net 
investment in foreign operations, derivative as well as non-
derivative financial instruments are used."
"Gains or losses due to 
changes in fair value and from foreign currency translation are 
recognized within equity, as a component of other comprehensive 
income, under currency translation adjustments."
"Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are recognized 
in income are presented as other operating income or expenses."
"Gains and losses from interest-rate derivatives are included in 
interest income."
"Unrealized gains and losses resulting from the initial measurement 
of derivative financial instruments at the inception of the contract 
are not recognized in income."
"They are instead deferred and 
recognized in income systematically over the term of the 
derivative."
"An exception to the accrual principle applies if 
unrealized gains and losses from the initial measurement are 
verified by quoted market prices, observable prices of other 
current market transactions or other observable data supporting 
the valuation technique."
"In this case the gains and losses are 
recognized in income."
"E.ON holds portfolios of sales and procurement contracts for 
electricity and gas supplies with various customer and supplier 
groups (commodity futures)."
"They are not accounted for as derivative financial instruments at 
fair value through profit and loss (FVPL) in accordance with IFRS 9, 
but as pending transactions subject to the rules of IAS 37."
"Contracts that provide for net settlement and resales of the 
quantities to be delivered at a future date generally cannot, as a 
rule, be classified as own-use contracts."
"Based on forward-looking 
forecasts of delivery quantities specified by customer structure 
and portfolio management, contracts with physical settlement 
upon conclusion are recognized as derivatives for which 
settlement cannot be ensured within the scope of ordinary 
delivery."
"This “safety buffer” is reviewed on a regular basis and 
adjusted if necessary."
"Embedded derivatives in own-use contracts must be separated 
from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives in 
accordance with IFRS 9 if the economic characteristics and risks of 
these derivatives are not closely related to those of the host 
contract."
"The contract is assessed upon conclusion to determine 
whether a derivative is required to be separated."
"A reassessment 
must be carried out if there is a significant change in the terms of 
the contract or in the context of business combinations."
"Agreements to buy or sell non-financial items that are not 
classified as own-use contracts under IFRS 9 and that are required 
to be accounted for as derivatives must be recognized in the 
balance sheet at their fair value until they are realized."
"In addition, any income from 
commodity derivatives arising from the difference between the 
contract price and the market price is recognized in other operating 
income."
"In exceptional cases, commodity derivatives are 
designated as hedging instruments of a cash flow hedge in 
accordance with IFRS 9, and the effective part of the value change 
is recognized in equity as a component of other comprehensive 
income."
"IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” (“IFRS 7”), and IFRS 
13 both require comprehensive quantitative and qualitative 
disclosures about the extent of risks arising from financial 
instruments."
"Additional information on financial instruments is 
provided in Notes 31 and 32."
"Non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are netted on 
the balance sheet if under IAS 32 E.ON has both an unconditional 
right—even in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency—and the 
intention to settle offsetting positions simultaneously and/or on a 
net basis."
"Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or production 
cost and net realizable value."
"The cost of raw materials, finished 
products and goods purchased for resale is determined based on 
the average cost method."
"In addition to production materials and 
wages, production costs include material and production 
overheads based on normal capacity."
"The costs of general 
administration are not capitalized."
"Inventory risks resulting from 
excess and obsolescence are provided for using appropriate 
valuation allowances, whereby inventories are written down to net 
realizable value."
"Emission Rights and Similar Certificates 
Emission rights and similar certificates held under national and 
international emissions trading systems for the settlement of 
obligations are capitalized at cost at the date of acquisition and 
reported under current assets."
"Subsequent measurement is at 
amortized cost under IAS 38."
"The obligation to submit emission rights and similar certificates to 
the relevant authorities is recognized as a liability as of the balance 
sheet date."
"Measurement is based on the best estimate of the 
future settlement amount."
"Receivables, Contract Assets or Liabilities and Other Assets 
A receivable is recognized under IFRS 15 when the goods or 
services are delivered, provided that the right to consideration is 
unconditional, i.e., is only related to the passage of time."
"However, 
if the right to receive the consideration is contingent upon 
conditions other than the passage of time, a contract asset is 
recognized."
"A contract liability under IFRS 15 is recognized when 
consideration has been received for an existing IFRS 15 contract 
and the right to receive the goods or services still exists in full or in 
part."
"The contractual liability is only reversed with an effect on 
revenue when E.ON has performed the corresponding service."
"Other assets are 
amortized over the estimated term of the contract depending on 
how the goods or services to which the costs relate are transferred 
to the customer."
"If the estimated term of the contract is less than 
one year, the costs are immediately recognized as an expense on 
the income statement."
"Trade receivables without a significant 
financial component are measured upon initial recognition at their 
transaction price."
"Valuation allowances, included in the reported 
net carrying amount, are provided for identifiable individual risks."
"If 
the loss of a certain part of the receivables is probable, valuation 
allowances are provided to cover the expected loss."
"Impairments 
are also recognized for expected future credit losses."
"Liquid Funds 
Liquid funds include checks, cash on hand, bank balances and 
current securities."
"Liquid funds with an original maturity of more than three months 
are recognized under securities and fixed-term deposits provided 
that their maturities are not more than 12 months and therefore 
are recognized under non-current financial receivables and other 
financial assets."
"Liquid funds with an original maturity of less than three months 
are considered to be cash and cash equivalents in accordance with 
IAS 7."
"This also applies if they are merely contractually restricted, 
in which case the funds can technically be disposed of at any time 
at E.ON’s discretion."
"However, if, as a result of a restriction, liquid 
funds cannot technically be disposed of at any time at E.ON’s 
discretion, they are reported separately as restricted liquid funds."
"The reclassification to the separate balance sheet items is 
shown in the fixed asset movement schedule under Changes in 
scope of consolidation."
"Discontinued operations are components of an entity that are 
either held for sale or have already been sold and can be clearly 
distinguished from other corporate operations, both operationally 
and for financial reporting purposes."
"Additionally, the component 
of the entity classified as a discontinued operation must represent 
a major business line or a specific material geographic business 
segment of the Group or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for 
resale."
"Non-current assets that are held for sale either individually or 
collectively as part of a disposal group, or that belong to a 
discontinued operation, are no longer depreciated."
"They are 
instead accounted for at the lower of the carrying amount and the 
fair value less any remaining costs to sell."
"If this value is less than 
the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in other 
operating expenses."
"Prior-year income 
statement figures are adjusted accordingly."
"The relevant assets 
and liabilities are reported in a separate line on the balance sheet."
"The cash flows of discontinued operations are reported separately 
in the cash flow statement, with prior-year figures adjusted 
accordingly."
"However, there is no reclassification of prior-year 
balance sheet line items attributable to discontinued operations."
"Equity Instruments 
E.ON has entered into purchase commitments to holders of non-
controlling interests in subsidiaries."
"By means of these 
agreements, the non-controlling shareholders have the right to 
require E.ON to purchase their shares on specified conditions."
"None of the contractual obligations has led to the transfer of 
substantially all of the risk and rewards to E.ON at the time of 
entering into the contract."
"Under the anticipated acquisition 
method, however, the right of tender is accounted for as if it had 
already been exercised."
"The difference between this measurement and the 
carrying amount of the minority shareholders’ equity to be 
derecognized is recognized in equity of E.ON SE shareholders."
"The 
accretion of the liability is recognized as interest expense."
"If a 
purchase commitment expires unexercised, the liability reverts to 
non-controlling interests."
"Any remaining difference is then 
recognized directly in equity in retained earnings."
"Where shareholders of entities own statutory, non-excludable 
rights of termination (as in the case of German partnerships, for 
example), such termination rights require the reclassification of 
non-controlling interests from equity into liabilities under IAS 32."
"The liability is recognized at the present value of the expected 
settlement amount irrespective of the probability of termination."
"Changes in the value of the liability are reported within other 
operating income."
"Accretion of the share of the results of the non-
controlling shareholders’ share in net income is recognized in Net 
interest income/expense."
"In the event that non-controlling 
shareholders are entitled to a guaranteed dividend, this 
entitlement is recognized as a liability through reclassification from 
non-controlling interests in equity."
"If such 
treasury shares are subsequently distributed or sold, the 
consideration received, net of acquisition costs, any directly 
attributable additional transaction costs and associated income 
taxes, is recognized in additional paid-in capital."
"Share-Based Payment 
Share-based payment plans issued in the E.ON Group are 
accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-Based Payment” 
(“IFRS 2”)."
"In fiscal years 2017 to 2023, virtual shares were granted to 
members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain E.ON 
Group executives under the new E.ON Performance Plan."
"See the 
Compensation Report for more details on the structure of the plan."
"The E.ON Performance Plan represents commitments of the 
Company which provide for cash compensation based on the share 
price performance at the end of the term."
"The compensation 
expense is measured taking into account the fair value of the 
virtual shares granted and recognized in personnel expense pro 
rata over the vesting period."
"In 2023, as in 2022, employees of E.ON SE and participating 
subsidiaries once again had the opportunity to purchase E.ON 
shares at favorable conditions under the employee stock purchase 
program."
"The program includes a share-based payment settled in 
equity instruments (shares of E.ON SE) as consideration for 
services rendered or work performed."
"The corresponding 
compensation under IFRS 2 was recognized in personnel expense 
and the offsetting entry was made in equity."
"Provisions for Pensions and Similar Obligations 
Measurement of defined benefit obligations in accordance with 
IAS 19, “Employee Benefits,” is based on actuarial computations 
using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations 
performed at year-end."
"Included in gains and losses from the remeasurements of the net 
defined benefit liability or asset are actuarial gains and losses that 
may arise especially from differences between estimated and 
actual variations in underlying assumptions about demographic 
and financial variables."
"Additionally included is the difference 
between the actual return on plan assets and the expected interest 
income on plan assets included in the net interest result."
"Remeasurement effects are recognized in full in the period in 
which they occur and are not reported within the Consolidated 
Statements of Income, but are instead recognized within the 
Statements of Recognized Income and Expenses as part of equity."
"Past service cost, as well as gains and losses from settlements, are 
fully recognized in the income statement in the period in which the 
underlying plan amendment, curtailment or settlement takes 
place."
They are reported under personnel costs.
"The amount reported on the balance sheet represents the present 
value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of 
plan assets."
"If a net asset position arises from this calculation, the 
amount is limited to the present value of available refunds and the 
reduction in future contributions and to the benefit from 
prepayments of minimum funding requirements."
"Such an asset 
position is recognized as an operating receivable."
"Payments for defined contribution pension plans are expensed as 
incurred and reported under personnel costs."
"Contributions to 
state pension plans are treated like payments for defined 
contribution pension plans to the extent that the obligations under 
these pension plans generally correspond to those under defined 
contribution pension plans."
"The provision is recognized 
at the expected settlement amount."
"Long-term obligations are 
generally discounted at the market interest rate applicable as of 
the respective balance sheet date, provided that it is not negative."
"The accretion amounts and the effects of changes in interest rates 
are generally presented as part of financial results."
"A 
reimbursement related to the provision that is virtually certain to 
be collected is capitalized as a separate asset."
"No offsetting within 
provisions is permitted."
"Advance payments remitted are deducted 
from the provisions."
"Obligations arising from the decommissioning or dismantling of 
property, plant and equipment are recognized during the period of 
their occurrence at their discounted settlement amounts, provided 
that the obligation can be reliably estimated, whereby no negative 
discount rates are applied."
"The carrying amounts of the respective 
property, plant and equipment are increased by the same amounts."
"Advance payments remitted are deducted from the 
provisions."
"Changes in estimates arise in particular from deviations from 
original cost estimates, from changes to the maturity or the scope 
of the relevant obligation, and also as a result of the regular 
adjustment of the discount rate to current market interest rates."
"The adjustment of provisions for the decommissioning and 
restoration of property, plant and equipment for changes to 
estimates is generally recognized by way of a corresponding 
adjustment to these assets, with no effect on income."
"As the 
property, plant and equipment concerned have, however, 
frequently already been fully depreciated, changes to estimates 
are primarily recognized within the income statement."
"The estimates for nuclear decommissioning provisions are derived 
from studies, cost estimates, legally binding civil agreements and 
legal information."
"A material element in the estimates are the real 
interest rates applied (the applied discount rate, less the cost 
increase rate)."
"If onerous contracts exist in which the unavoidable costs of 
meeting a contractual obligation exceed the economic benefits 
expected to be received under the contract, provisions are 
established for losses from pending transactions."
"Such provisions 
are recognized at the lower of the excess obligation upon 
performance under the contract and any potential penalties or 
compensation arising in the event of non-performance."
"Obligations 
under an open contractual relationship are determined from a 
sales market perspective, in part on the basis of contract 
portfolios."
"Provisions for pending sales transactions must also be recognized 
if these transactions are subject to the own-use exemption under 
IFRS 9 and if they are partially offset by transactions that are 
accounted for as derivative financial instruments measured at 
current market prices."
"The book structure adopted under 
IFRS 9 therefore affects the accounting treatment of the 
corresponding provisions."
Contingent liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet.
"A full disclosure of information is not provided for certain 
contingent liabilities, contingent receivables and provisions in 
connection with pending litigation if such disclosure could have a 
significant influence on further proceedings."
"Provisions for restructuring costs are recognized at the present 
value of the future outflows of resources."
"Provisions are 
recognized once a detailed restructuring plan has been decided on 
by management and whose implementation has either already 
begun or which have been publicly announced or communicated to 
the employees or their representatives."
"Only those expenses that 
are directly attributable to the restructuring measures are used in 
measuring the amount of the provision."
"Expenses associated with 
the future operation are not taken into consideration."
"Income Taxes 
Under IAS 12, “Income Taxes” (“IAS 12”), deferred taxes are 
recognized on temporary differences arising between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and their tax 
bases (balance sheet liability method)."
"Uncertain tax positions are 
recognized at their most likely value or the expected value."
"IAS 12 
further requires that deferred tax assets be recognized for unused 
tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits."
"Deferred tax assets 
are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit 
will be available against which the deductible temporary 
differences and unused tax losses can be utilized."
"Each of the 
corporate entities is assessed individually with regard to the 
probability of a positive tax result in future years."
"The planning 
horizon is basically three to five years in this context."
"Any existing 
history of losses is incorporated in this assessment."
"For those tax 
assets to which these assumptions do not apply, the value of the 
deferred tax assets is reduced."
"Deferred taxes in connection with 
the global minimum tax (“Pillar II”) are not recognized."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted 
or substantively enacted tax rates expected to be applicable for 
taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are 
expected to be recovered or settled."
"The effect on deferred tax 
assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates and tax law is 
recognized in net income unless the change affects deferred taxes 
that had previously been recognized directly in equity."
"The change 
is generally recognized in the period in which the material 
legislative process is completed."
"Income taxes for transaction 
costs of an equity transaction are recognized directly in equity."
"E.ON is responding to this 
circumstance, in particular through the application of IFRIC 23, by 
continuously identifying and assessing the tax environment and 
the resulting effects."
"The most current information is then 
incorporated into the estimate parameters necessary for 
measuring the tax provisions."
"Accordingly, related potential 
interest rate effects are also assessed, measured and reported 
separately."
"Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 
In accordance with IAS 7, “Statement of Cash Flows,” the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are classified in cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities."
"Segment Information 
In accordance with the so-called management approach required 
by IFRS 8, “Operating Segments,” the internal reporting 
organization used by management for making decisions on 
operating matters is used to identify the Company’s reportable 
segments."
"The internal performance measure used as the segment 
result is EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain non-operating effects 
(see Note 35)."
"Transactions between the reportable segments are 
recorded at arm’s length transfer prices."
"Structure of the Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
Statement of Income 
In accordance with IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements,” 
the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been prepared using a 
classified balance sheet structure."
"Assets that will be realized 
within 12 months of the reporting date, as well as liabilities that 
are due to be settled within one year of the reporting date are 
generally classified as current."
"The Consolidated Statement of Income is classified using the 
nature of expense method, which is also applied for internal 
purposes."
"Estimates are based on past experience and on current knowledge 
obtained on the transactions to be reported."
"Actual amounts may 
differ from these estimates."
"The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis and are adjusted as necessary in the periods in 
which they were recognized."
"Estimates 
are also factored in when applying IFRS 16, namely in connection 
with the determination of lease terms and the calculation of the 
discount rate, and in part when applying IFRS 9 in connection with 
the determination of expected future credit losses."
"The application of accounting policies requires judgments to be 
made that may affect the amounts recognized in the financial 
statements."
"Judgments are relevant, for example, when assessing 
whether an item is to be classified in accordance with IFRS 5."
"Here, 
management assesses whether a disposal is considered highly 
probable."
"Further judgments may be necessary in assessing 
whether E.ON controls, jointly controls with other investors, or can 
significantly influence an entity."
"Specifically, management assesses here what the significant 
activities of the Company are, i.e., which activities have a material 
impact on the returns of the investee."
"The list of shareholdings 
(see Note 38) provides information on the form of inclusion in the 
consolidated financial statements of certain investees whose share 
of voting rights indicates a different form of inclusion."
"The underlying principles used for estimates and judgments in the 
named topics and in additional relevant topics are outlined in the 
respective sections."
"Critical judgment is required in the recognition of risks arising from 
claims asserted by customers for the restitution of amounts 
collected through price adjustment measures (provisions in 
connection with price adjustments)."
"Judgment is also required 
when assessing the potential recognition of assets or liabilities and 
their classification as contingent assets or liabilities (see Note 29)."
"In addition, estimates and judgments continue to be subject to 
increased uncertainty, in particular due to the significant volume 
and price volatilities on the energy markets and due to the war in 
Ukraine."
"The actual amounts may differ from the estimates and 
judgments made; changes may have a material impact on E.ON’s 
net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"When the 
estimates and judgments were updated, all available information 
on expected economic developments and country-specific 
government measures was taken into account on the reporting 
date."
"It is difficult to predict the duration and the extent of the 
impact on assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows of the war in 
Ukraine."
"More information on the impact of the war in Ukraine on 
the E.ON Group is presented in Note 3."
"The 
amendments will be applied for fiscal years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2023."
"The amendments have no material impact on 
E.ON’s Consolidated Financial Statements."

"This invasion is having far-reaching economic 
consequences, and direct impacts—particularly in the energy 
sector—are being experienced, which are also explained further in 
the “Macroeconomic and Industry Environment” section of the 
Management Report."
"The consequences of the war in Ukraine continue to have an 
impact on E.ON’s business, primarily due to volatile commodity 
prices."
"Following the sharp rise in commodity prices seen in the 
previous year, they fell over the course of the reporting year but 
remained at a significantly higher level."
"This resulted in a declining 
market valuation of sales and procurement transactions 
recognized as derivatives in the balance sheet, as well as declines 
in these partially offsetting provisions for onerous contracts."
"The 
impacts are explained in more detail in the sections “Earnings 
Situation,” “Financial Situation” and “Asset Situation” of the 
Management Report."
"The situation assessable at the balance-sheet date with regard to 
the war in Ukraine indicated no triggering events that would 
necessitate impairment charges on non-current assets under IAS 
36, in particular goodwill, other intangible assets, and property, 
plant and equipment."
"In fiscal year 2023, high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine 
affected the ability of customers to pay significantly increased 
energy bills and led to additional impairment losses on trade 
receivables (see also the comments in Note 18)."
"Potential balance sheet effects of the future development of the 
war in Ukraine are being analyzed on an ongoing basis."
"The Europe-wide energy crisis has prompted the governments of 
some countries in which E.ON operates to adopt various measures 
to soften the impact on the end consumer."
"Some of these 
measures may directly impact E.ON, such as the introduction of 
price caps or the elimination of excess earnings."
"In particular, the 
price caps could have a direct impact on E.ON’s revenues under 
IFRS 15."
"However, these charges did not have a material effect on 
E.ON’s earnings in the 2023 financial year."
"For example, negative 
effects from price caps were primarily offset by government 
grants, which were in part recognized as grants related to income
in accordance with IAS 20 (see the comments in Notes 6 and 9)."
"There are also government measures that do not directly affect 
E.ON, such as the temporary assumption of energy costs for the
end consumer."
"One domestic 
company reported as joint operations was presented pro rata on 
the Consolidated Financial Statements (2022: one domestic 
company)."
"(5) Material Acquisitions, Disposals and Disposal 
Groups in 2023
Consortium Agreement with RheinEnergie 
On June 29, 2021, Westenergie AG, a fully consolidated 
subsidiary of the E.ON Group, entered into a consortium 
agreement with RheinEnergie AG."
"The agreement was finalized 
effective March 31, 2023, after the conditions imposed by the 
Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Cartel Office) were met."
"With 
the closing of the transaction, Westenergie and RheinEnergie 
merged shareholdings in individual municipal utilities into rhenag 
Rheinische Energie Aktiengesellschaft (“rhenag”)."
"It also resulted in 
the initial consolidation of AggerEnergie GmbH within the E.ON 
Group."
"Westenergie also transferred 20 percent of the shares of 
Stadtwerke Duisburg, which, pursuant to IFRS 5, was previously 
included in E.ON’s Consolidated Financial Statements as an 
associated company, to RheinEnergie, which increased its share in 
RheinEnergie from 20 to 24.2 percent."
"The acquisition cost of a business combination is generally 
determined based on the fair values of the assets transferred as 
consideration, the liabilities assumed and the equity interests 
issued by the acquirer at the acquisition date."
"Because the shares 
in AggerEnergie were acquired in the course of a complex swap 
transaction, in accordance with IFRS 3.33, no determination was 
carried out at the acquisition date of the rhenag shares transferred 
in the framework of the overall swap transaction."
"Instead, the 
shares in AggerEnergie acquired were measured as of the 
acquisition date of March 31, 2023."
"The acquisition cost of the 
62.7 percent shareholding determined on this basis amounts to 
€137 million."
"Accordingly, there is no need to allocate the 
consideration to major classes of consideration in accordance with 
IFRS 3.B64(f)."
"The non-cash swap and the different value 
transfers to rhenag reduce the shareholding in rhenag from 66.67 
percent to 45.56 percent."
"Contingent consideration and 
compensatory assets were not included in the agreement."
"The fair value of the receivables and other assets acquired is 
€67 million and corresponds primarily to the gross amounts."
"These 
mainly consist of trade receivables (€58 million)."
"The 37.3 percent non-controlling interest is measured using the 
partial goodwill method for identified pro rata net assets."
"Goodwill 
mainly reflects the value of assets that may not be recognized 
separately, such as the workforce and expected synergies."
"No significant transaction costs were incurred for the acquisition 
of control over AggerEnergie GmbH."
"The acquisition contributed €0.2 billion to revenue and €15 million 
to consolidated net income from April 1, 2023, to December 31, 
2023."
"If the acquisition had been completed by January 1, 2023, 
the revenue contribution of AggerEnergie GmbH would have been 
around €0.1 billion and the contribution to consolidated net 
income would have been in the low single-digit million euro range."
"The purchase price allocation to the identified assets and liabilities 
was made on a provisional basis due to the ongoing process of 
preparing and reviewing the underlying financial information."
"Consequently, changes to the allocation of the purchase price to 
the individual assets and liabilities may still be made within the 
agreed adjustment period of up to 12 months."
"Closing of the Future Consolidation Agreement by ZSE 
shareholders  
On April 8, 2022, the shareholders of Západoslovenská energetika 
a.s."
(“ZSE”) and Východoslovenská energetika Holding a.s.
"(“VSEH”), E.ON SE and the Slovak Republic, concluded a Future 
Consolidation Agreement to combine ZSE and the VSEH Group."
"The agreement provides, among other things, for 100 percent of 
the VSEH shares to be transferred to ZSE, the sale of all 
subsidiaries of VSEH to ZSE, and the implementation of corporate 
law changes at VSEH."
"The transfer of VSEH shares to ZSE results in ZSE being VSEH’s 
sole shareholder (and thus also shareholder of the VSEH 
subsidiaries)."
"The ownership interests in ZSE remains unchanged; 
that is, E.ON has a 49 percent stake in ZSE and the Slovakian state 
a 51 percent stake."
"The new ZSE shareholder agreement 
essentially corresponds to the shareholder agreement that has 
been in force before."
"After closing of the agreement, ZSE continues 
to be accounted for using the equity method in E.ON’s 
Consolidated Financial Statements, while the business activities of 
VSEH, which was previously fully consolidated, are now integrated 
in this joint venture."
"The transaction was originally expected to be closed by the end of 
2022."
"Accordingly, the VSEH Group has been presented as a 
disposal group in accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 
2021."
"The last condition precedent was fulfilled on June 12, 2023."
"As of this 
date, the VSEH Group was deconsolidated and the value of the 
investment in ZSE was increased accordingly by the fair value of 
these VSEH shares."
The deconsolidation of VSEH resulted in a gain of €15 million.
"As 
the shares of VSEH were transferred to the ZSE, there was no 
gain/loss on the revaluation of a remaining stake in VSEH."
"The 
divested assets (before deduction of minority interests) consisted 
of €1,001 million in non-current assets and €415 million in current 
assets."
"In addition, goodwill of €104 million was allocated."
"Outgoing liabilities (before deduction of minority interests) 
consisted of €738 million in liabilities, €15 million in provisions and 
€127 million in deferred tax liabilities."
"Deconsolidation results are generally allocated to other operating 
income."
"Discontinued Operations 
Income from discontinued operations in the amount of €61 million 
resulted from a transaction already completed in 2005."
"In 
accordance with the purchase agreement, a one-time purchase-
price adjustment was made after an audit of the divested company 
was completed in the first quarter of 2023, and the contractual 
clause now took effect."
"The growing regulatory asset base in the network area and the 
price increases passed on to customers led to an increase in 
revenues."
"In contrast, and more than offsetting this development, 
there was a significant reduction due to price developments on the 
commodity markets."
"This was due to forward contracted sales 
volumes, which are accounted for as a derivative in accordance 
with IFRS 9."
"The resulting sales must be reported at market prices 
at the time of physical delivery."
"The decreased revenues are mainly 
related to income as well as expenses from derivative financial 
instruments, which are reported under other operating income."
"Revenue realized in the current reporting period and resulting from 
performance obligations that had already been fulfilled in whole or 
in part in previous reporting periods amounted to €0.8 billion 
(2022: €0.7 billion)."
"As of December 31, 2023, the total amount of 
performance obligations already contracted but still outstanding 
(excluding expected contract extensions and expected new 
contracts) amounted to €30.8 billion (December 31, 2022: 
€43.6 billion)."
"The greater part of these performance obligations is 
expected to be fulfilled within the next three years."
"In the E.ON 
Group, revenues are mainly realized over time."
"Revenues that were 
not recognized under IFRS 15 but under other accounting 
standards totaled €5.4 billion in fiscal 2023 (2022: €5.1 billion)."
"Of 
this, €5.2 billion was attributable to income-related government 
grants from the public sector (2022: €1.6 billion)."
"Revenues are broken down in detail into intragroup and external 
revenues in the segment information (Note 35)."
"They are also 
broken down into key regions and technologies."
"The overview also 
shows the effect of revenues on operating cash flow before 
interest and taxes."
"(7) Own Work Capitalized
Own work capitalized amounted to €1,334 million in 2023 (2022: 
€997 million) and resulted primarily from capitalized work 
performed in connection with ongoing and completed IT projects 
and network assets."
"Income and expenses from derivative financial instruments 
(including currency derivatives) relate to fair value measurement 
under IFRS 9."
"Income from derivative financial instruments decreased year-on-
year by €32,961 million to €37,273 million (2022: 
€70,234 million), mainly due to price developments on the 
commodity markets."
"Commodity derivatives generated income in 
the amount of €35,931 million (2022: €68,302 million)."
"In 
addition, income from derivative financial instruments (including 
currency derivatives) includes realized income from currency 
derivatives of €1,174 million (2022: €1,632 million)."
"Conversely, income from currency translation effects decreased by 
€275 million to €578 million."
"Corresponding items from derivative 
financial instruments (including currency derivatives) are included 
in other operating expenses."
"The effects of foreign currency 
translation within other operating income amounted to 
€611 million (2022: €2,143 million)."
"The gain on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and 
securities were €848 million below prior year."
"In 2022 there were 
gains on the disposal of Westconnect GmbH in the amount of 
€810 million."
"Gains were realized on the sale of securities in the 
amount of €51 million (2022: €26 million)."
"Miscellaneous other operating income decreased by €234 million 
compared with the prior year."
"The decrease is due to the €13,318 million decline in 
expenses from derivative financial instruments (including currency 
derivatives) to €53,345 million (2022: €66,663 million)."
"Similar to 
the development in income from derivative financial instruments, 
this was mainly due to price developments on the commodity 
markets over the course of the year."
"Expenses from commodity derivatives amounted to €52,026 
million in 2023 (2022: €64,615 million)."
"In addition, expenses 
from derivative financial instruments (including currency 
derivatives) includes realized expenses from currency derivatives 
of €1,312 million (2022: €1,473 million)."
"Expenses from exchange rate differences in the amount of 
€718 million increased by €194 million compared with the 
previous year (€524 million)."
"Foreign currency translation effects within other operating 
expenses amounted to €707 million (2022: €1,880 million)."
"Miscellaneous other operating expenses includes third-party 
services and passthrough charges in the amount of €1,204 million 
(2022: €981 million)."
"Also included are IT expenses in the amount 
of €654 million (2022: €480 million), advertising and marketing 
expenses in the amount of €279 million (2022: €177 million, as 
well as consulting and audit fees in the amount of €217 million 
(2022: €155 million)."
"(9) Cost of Materials 
The principal components of expenses for raw materials and 
supplies and for purchased goods are the purchase of gas and 
electricity."
"Fuel supply is also included in this line item in the 
previous year."
"Expenses for purchased services consist primarily of 
network usage charges and maintenance costs."
"This sharp decrease was 
mainly due to energy price developments on the commodity 
markets."
"Under the long-term procurement strategy, higher 
energy prices in the first half of last year exerted persistent 
upward pressure on procurement costs even into the second half 
of the year, in spite of the fact that the overall price trend in 2023 
was downward."
"This was partially offset by the fact that forward 
procurement contracts are recognized as derivative financial 
instruments in accordance with IFRS, and on recognition this 
requires adjustment to the market price at the time of delivery."
"Accordingly, income from the market valuation of commodity 
derivatives is recognized in other operating income."
"In addition, the change in provisions for contracted sales 
transactions reported that are not subject to IFRS 9 (so-called 
own-use contracts), which are economically part of a portfolio that 
is partly offset by procurement transactions to be accounted for as 
derivative financial instruments."
"Provisions were significantly 
reduced in the current reporting period."
"Government subsidies received reduced the cost of materials by 
€453 million (2022: €774 million)."
"The decline in 
net interest income is mainly due to the fact that interest rates fell 
moderately compared to the previous year."
"This eliminated the 
very positive effect of the previous year, when a significant rise in 
interest rates had resulted in high income from the discounting of 
provisions."
"The amortized cost reported in interest and similar income 
includes positive effects from cash investments in the amount of 
€150 million (2022: €32 million)."
"This item was also negatively 
impacted by the increased interest expense from the newly issued 
bonds, which was higher than the decreased interest expense from 
the matured bonds."
"Capitalized interest 
on debt (€8 million; 2022: €8 million) remained unchanged in 
interest expenses."
"The valuation effects of securities recognized at fair value through 
P&L are included in both income (€86 million; 2022: €35 million) 
and expenses (-€35 million; 2022: -€236 million) from fair value 
through P&L."
"The 
income tax rate of 31 percent corresponds to the tax rate 
applicable to E.ON SE for 2023."
"The differences from the effective 
tax rate are reconciled as follows: 
Continuing operations generated tax income of €598 million in the 
reporting year (2022: tax income of €245 million)."
"This 
corresponds to a theoretical tax rate of -592 percent."
"This was 
primarily due to market valuations of commodity derivatives in 
various countries with different tax rates, which resulted in a 
higher tax rate."
"In addition, the tax rate was influenced by changes 
in the value of deferred tax assets as well as taxes for previous 
years."
"These 
items can be found in the balance sheet."
"As of December 31, 2023, €16 million (2022: €16 million) in 
deferred tax liabilities were recognized for the differences between 
net assets and the tax bases of subsidiaries and associated 
companies (outside basis differences)."
"Accordingly, deferred tax 
liabilities were not recognized for temporary differences of €2,062 
million (2022: €3,067 million) at subsidiaries and associated 
companies, as E.ON is able to control the timing of their reversal 
and the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future."
"Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities 
Dec."
"Deferred tax assets were not recognized, or are no longer 
recognized, in the amount of €776 million (2022: €2,918 million) 
for temporary differences which are recognized in income and 
equity."
"Current tax expense was reduced by €26 million (2022: €4 million) 
due to the use of previously unrecognized tax losses."
"The change in 
previously unrecognized tax losses and temporary differences 
reduced deferred tax expense by €77 million (2022: €71 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023, E.ON reported deferred tax assets for 
companies that incurred losses in the current or the prior-year 
period that exceed the deferred tax liabilities by €2,028 million 
(2022: €478 million)."
"Of this amount, €1,672 million is 
attributable to companies in Germany and €339 million to 
companies in the UK."
"These amounts mainly include deductible 
temporary differences."
"Recognition in the UK is due to the fact 
that expenses for the integration of new business activities and 
processes that led to tax losses in the past are non-recurring."
"In 
Germany, recognition is based, among other factors, on taxable 
profits realized in the current financial year and on sufficient 
taxable profits in subsequent financial years."
"These factors are 
based on scenario analyses as well as stable earnings contributions 
from the regulated area."
"E.ON also expects derivative financial 
instruments recognized at negative fair value to have a positive 
effect on non-operating earnings through a reversal during the 
planning period."
"When considered in the aggregate, the 
management has concluded that each company will generate 
sufficient taxable income against which the previously unused tax 
losses and deductible temporary differences can be offset."
"Changes in deferred tax assets in the current year, with net 
addition of €38 million, relate mainly to liabilities (+€26 million), 
property, plant and equipment (+€11 million) and loss 
carryforwards (+€7 million)."
"Changes in deferred tax liabilities, 
with net additions of €65 million, relate primarily to property, plant 
and equipment (+€39 million), receivables (+€34 million) and 
liabilities (-€16 million)."
"Changes in deferred tax assets in the prior year, with net disposals 
of €1 million, relate mainly to intangible assets (+€12 million), 
property, plant and equipment (+€11 million) and liabilities (-€18 
million)."
"Changes in deferred tax liabilities, with net disposals of -
€20 million, relate primarily to intangible assets (+€15 million), 
property, plant and equipment (-€48 million) and receivables (-€11 
million) as well as liabilities (+€25 million)."
"The VSEH Group has been presented as a disposal group in 
accordance with IFRS 5 since December 31, 2021."
"The transaction 
was then concluded on November 23, 2023 (see Note 5)."
"The 
VSEH Group was deconsolidated on this date and the value of the 
investment in ZSE was increased accordingly by the fair value of 
these VSEH shares."
"The deconsolidation of VSEH resulted in the 
derecognition of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €127 
million."
"Global Minimum Tax 
The E.ON Group is included in the scope of application of the OECD 
Model Rules of Pillar 2 for the national implementation of the 
global minimum tax."
"The Model Rules were transposed into 
German law through the introduction of a minimum tax law in 
December 2023, which applies to all fiscal years beginning after 
December 31, 2023."
"Because the legislation had not entered into 
force as at the reporting date in any country in which the E.ON 
Group has business units as defined by the legislation, there was 
no current tax exposure associated with it for the 2023 fiscal year."
"The E.ON Group applies the exemption in IAS 12 for the 
recognition and disclosure of information on deferred tax assets 
and liabilities in connection with income taxes from global 
minimum taxation."
"An initial indicative analysis was carried out as of the reporting 
date to determine the fundamental impact and the jurisdictions in 
which E.ON could be exposed to potential effects in connection 
with a supplementary tax."
"The first step was to determine whether the safe harbor 
regulations were applicable."
"The effective tax rate was calculated 
on a simplified basis for countries that were not exempt from the 
Pillar 2 calculation after a review of the safe harbor rules."
"This initial indicative analysis did not identify any countries in 
which the E.ON Group operates that could result in a material  
impact in the form of a supplementary tax."
"Consequently, E.ON is 
currently not expected to be materially affected by a 
supplementary tax."
"Accordingly, the average effective Group tax 
rate would have remained unchanged if the minimum tax 
legislation had already been in force on the balance sheet date."
"The change is primarily 
attributable to the higher headcount and tariff increases."
"This is 
counteracted by lower expenses for pensions."
"Share-Based Payment 
The expenses for share-based payment in 2023 (the E.ON 
Performance Plan) amounted to €93.3 million (2022: 
€24.6 million)."
"Employee Stock Purchase Program 
The voluntary employee stock purchase program took place again 
in 2023, giving employees in the German Group companies the 
opportunity once again to purchase E.ON shares at favorable 
conditions."
"The favorable pricing conditions granted within the 
framework of the employee stock purchase program (IFRS 2, 
“Share-based Payment”) resulted in personnel expense of 
€6.7 million; the offsetting entry was made in equity."
"Long-term Variable Compensation 
Members of the Management Board of E.ON SE and certain 
executives of the E.ON Group receive share-based payment as part 
of their voluntary long-term variable compensation."
"The purpose 
of such compensation is to reward their contribution to E.ON’s 
growth and to further the long-term success of the Company."
"This 
variable compensation component, comprising a long-term 
incentive effect along with a certain element of risk, provides for a 
logical linking of the interests of shareholders and management."
"The following discussion includes reports on the E.ON 
Performance Plan introduced in 2017."
"E.ON Performance Plan (EPP)
In the years 2017 to 2023, E.ON granted the members of the 
Management Board of E.ON SE and certain executives of the E.ON 
Group virtual shares under the E.ON Performance Plan."
"The 
vesting period of each tranche is four years."
"Vesting periods start 
on January 1 of each year."
"The beneficiary will receive virtual shares in the amount of the 
agreed target."
"The conversion into virtual shares will be based on 
the fair market value on the date when the shares are granted."
"The 
number of virtual shares allocated may change during the four-
year vesting period."
"For tranches granted through 2021, the only 
relevant criterion was the total shareholder return (“TSR”) of E.ON 
stock compared with the TSR of the companies in a peer group 
(“relative TSR”)."
"The final number of virtual shares allocated in the 
2022 tranche depends on three performance criteria, namely, 
relative TSR, ROCE, and the E.ON Sustainability Index."
"The TSR is the return on E.ON stock, which takes into account the 
stock price plus the assumption of reinvested dividends, adjusted 
for changes in capital."
"The peer group used for relative TSR will be 
the other companies in E.ON’s peer index, the STOXX® Europe 600 
Utilities."
"During a tranche’s vesting period, E.ON’s TSR 
performance is measured once a year in comparison with the 
companies in the peer group and set for that year."
"The E.ON Sustainability Index reflects the four most relevant ESG 
aspects (ESG = Environment, Social, Governance) at E.ON."
"In 2023 
these aspects were: climate action, diversity, health and safety, 
and ESG ratings."
"For the tranches granted up to and including 2021, the final 
number of virtual shares is determined as follows: E.ON’s TSR 
performance in a given year determines the final number of one-
fourth of the virtual shares granted at the beginning of the vesting 
period."
"If target attainment in a year is below the threshold defined 
by the Supervisory Board upon allocation, the number of virtual 
shares is reduced by one-fourth."
"If E.ON’s performance is at the 
upper cap or above, the fourth of the virtual shares allocated for 
the year in question will increase, but to a maximum of 150 
percent."
"For the tranche granted beginning in 2022, in addition to TSR (50 
percent weighting), ROCE (25 percent weighting) and the E.ON 
Sustainability Index (25 percent weighting) are also taken into 
account as performance criteria."
"The resulting number of virtual shares at the end of the vesting 
period is multiplied by the average price of E.ON stock in the final 
60 days of the vesting period."
"This amount is increased by the 
dividends distributed on E.ON stock during the vesting period and 
then paid out."
"The sum of the payouts is capped at 200 percent of 
the agreed target."
"The virtual shares are canceled if the employment relationship of 
the beneficiary ends before the end of the term for reasons within 
the control of the beneficiary."
"If the employment relationship of 
the beneficiary is terminated before retirement, through the end of 
a limited term or for operational reasons before the end of the 
term, the virtual shares do not expire but are settled at maturity."
"The same shall apply in the case of a change in control 
related to E.ON SE and also if the allocating company leaves the 
E.ON Group before maturity."
"The following are the base parameters of the tranches of the E.ON 
Performance Plan active in 2023: 
The provision for the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh tranches of 
the E.ON Performance Plan as of the balance sheet date is €165.0 
million (2022: €92.9 million)."
"The expense for the fourth, fifth,  
sixth and seventh tranches amounted to €93.3 million in the 2023 
fiscal year (2022: €24.6 million)."
"Employees 
In 2023, E.ON employed an average personnel of 71,629 (2022: 
68,888)."
"Part-time employees were taken into account on a pro 
rata basis when this figure was calculated."
"In addition, an average 
of 2,064 apprentices were employed in the reporting year in 
Germany (2022: 2,033)."
"The breakdown by segment is shown in the following table:

"The declaration has been made permanently and publicly 
accessible to stockholders on the Company’s website 
(www.eon.com)."
"They also include 
the fees for auditing reviews of the IFRS interim financial 
statements and other audit services directly required by the audit 
of the Financial Statements."
"The fees for other attestation services include all attestation 
services that are not auditing services and are not used in 
connection with the audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"List of Shareholdings 
The list of shareholdings pursuant to Section 313 (2) HGB is an 
integral part of these Notes to the Financial Statements and is 
presented in Note 38."
"The increase in the weighted-
average number of shares outstanding resulted primarily from the 
issue of treasury shares in E.ON SE under the voluntary employee 
stock purchase program."

"Impairments 
To perform the impairment tests, E.ON first determines the fair 
values less costs of disposal of its cash-generating units."
"Because 
there were no binding sales transactions or market prices for the 
respective cash-generating units in 2023, fair values were 
calculated based on discounted cash flow methods."
"Valuations are based on the medium-term corporate planning 
authorized by the Management Board."
"The calculations for 
impairment-testing purposes are generally based on the three 
planning years of the medium-term plan plus two additional 
detailed planning years."
"Deviations from this are made in certain 
justified exceptional cases."
"The cash flow assumptions extending 
beyond the detailed planning period are determined using 
sustainable, business and currency-specific growth rates based on 
the analysis of past years and predictions for the future."
"In 2023, 
the sustainable, currency-specific inflation rate used for the euro 
area was 1.25 percent (2022: 1.25 percent)."
"The discount rates 
after taxes used for discounting cash flows in the annual 
impairment test are calculated using market data for each cash-
generating unit, and as of the valuation date, ranged between 4.3 
and 12.6 percent after taxes (2022: between 3.9 and 13.0 
percent)."
"For 
example, impacts of climate targets on CO2 prices and changing 
weather conditions (temperature, wind, etc.) are included."
"The 
assumed development of all of the key influencing factors 
mentioned corresponds to the expectations set out in the forecast 
report."
2Presented here are the growth rates and cost of capital for selected cash-generating units whose respective goodwill is material when compared with the carrying amount of all goodwill.
3Energy Networks Germany was valued with a detailed planning period of 3 years and on the basis of the regulatory asset base.
"4Other non-current assets consist of intangible assets, right-of-use assets and of property, plant and equipment."
"Against the backdrop of the expansion of the network, which is 
key to achieving climate protection targets, the detailed planning 
period provides for a significant increase in investments in the 
Energy Networks Germany segment, with a corresponding 
increase in the regulated asset base."
"We expect regulatory returns 
to remain stable."
"In the Customer Solutions Germany and UK segments, we 
anticipate a significant increase in investments and a significant 
decline in sales revenue during our detailed planning period 
compared to the 2023 financial year."
"The decline in revenues in 
spite of a comparable number of customers is due to the 
assumption that prices on the commodity markets will normalize."
"We expect a moderate increase in estimated EBITDA margins in 
the detailed planning period in the Customer Solutions UK and 
Germany segments due to the planned portfolio optimization and 
the expansion of our growth business areas."
"The above discussion applies accordingly to the testing for 
impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and 
equipment and investments subject to the application of the equity 
method (IAS 28), and of groups of these assets."
"If the goodwill of a 
cash-generating unit is combined with assets or groups of assets 
for impairment testing, the assets must be tested first."
"Goodwill 
On September 11, 2023, the Board of Management of E.ON SE 
adopted a new management concept for the Group."
"This will take 
effect from 1 January, 2024, and, due to the concept in IFRS 8, 
will require a change in the definition of the operating segments 
and thus also a reallocation of the existing goodwill of all segments 
affected by the changes as of 1 January, 2024."
"The decision of the 
Board of Management was seen as a triggering event to review the 
recoverability of these goodwill amounts."
"As of September 2023, 
no impairment losses were identified."
"The performance of the annual goodwill impairment tests in the 
2023 financial year did not result in any impairments under IAS 
36."
"The determination of a value in use was not necessary for any 
cash generating unit."
"In 2023, impairments were recognized on the goodwill of the 
Slovakian operations after they were classified as held for sale 
under IFRS 5 since the fourth quarter of 2021 (see Note 5 for 
more information)."
"These required impairments amounted to 
approximately €44 million and are attributable to the fact that the 
fair value less costs of disposal was below the carrying amount of 
the disposal group."
"An impairment loss in such a case will always 
be allocated first to the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the disposal group."
"In November 2023, following the closing of 
the Future Consolidation Agreements the VSEH has been 
deconsolidated (see also Note 5)."
"Intangible Assets 
In 2023, approximately €63 million of impairments were 
recognized on intangible assets."
"In terms of amount, the largest 
impairment loss occurred in the Customer Solutions Germany 
segment."
"The German Sales Technology Platform, a platform for 
technological solutions in German sales, was written down by €44 
million on an unscheduled basis."
"The migration of certain 
customers planned for calendar year 2023 has been postponed 
indefinitely."
"In addition, the current medium-term planning no 
longer includes costs for multi-client capability, but costs for the 
continuation of the previous billing systems."
"As of December 31, 
2023, the new carrying amount of the sales platform, which 
consists of several assets and sub-assets, amounts to €84 million."
"Reversals of impairments on intangible assets amounted to around 
€30 million in the current year."
"A write-up of €30 million was 
recognized on the Delgaz power grid in the cash generating unit 
Energy Networks Romania, bringing the new carrying amount to 
€521 million."
"In 2023, the Company recorded an amortization expense on 
intangible assets of €606 million (2022: €714 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023, the closing balance of intangible assets 
with an indefinite useful life amounted to €82 million (2022: €308 
million)."
"These assets are mainly attributable to concession rights 
from the Swedish energy grid with a value of €37 million."
"In 2023, 
easements/rights of way from the Energy Network Germany 
segment in the amount of €237 million were reclassified from an 
indefinite useful life to a limited useful life."
"Implementation has 
been done prospectively in accordance with IAS 8.36."
"In the year under review, €104 million (2022: €68 million) of 
research and development costs within the meaning of IAS 38

million in 2023."
"Two geothermal plants in Kirchwaidach (by €25 
million) and Heidelberg (by €12 million) were impaired to their new 
carrying amounts of €15 million and €47 million, respectively."
"The 
main reasons for the impairments were the expected sustained 
decline in earnings as well as disagreements with the customer of 
one plant regarding further investment requirements."
"In addition, 
in the past, construction work on one of the large biomass power 
plant projects (Green Steam Hürth) had been significantly delayed 
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, rising procurement costs and 
financial challenges on the part of our technical suppliers."
"Although these problems have been solved in the meantime, based 
on the latest assessments of the business case, there was an 
impairment loss of €28 million (new carrying amount €142 
million)."
"Reversals of impairments on property, plant and equipment 
amounted to around €3 million in the current year (2022: €17 
million)."

subject to restrictions on disposal."
"Borrowing costs in the amount of €8 million were capitalized in 
2023 (2022: €8 million) as part of the historical cost of property, 
plant and equipment."
"The €1,120 million increase in the carrying amounts of companies 
measured at equity compared with December 31, 2022, was 
mainly due to the increase in the carrying amount of the 
investment in Západoslovenská energetika a.s."
"(ZSE) in Slovakia 
and the application of IAS 29 in Turkey."
"The net income from companies measured at equity of €478 
million includes impairments of €237 (2022: €878 million) and 
reversals of impairment losses of €7 million (2022: €311 million)."
"These impairments and reversals primarily relate to the application 
of IAS 29 in Turkey."
"Consequently, since the second quarter of 2022, the 
financial statements prepared on the basis of historical cost have 
been adjusted in accordance with IAS 29 for the first time for two 
Turkish investees included in the Group using the equity method 
(joint ventures)."
"Under IAS 29, financial statements in the 
functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy must be 
expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance 
sheet date."
"As a result, among other things, non-monetary assets 
and liabilities are generally adjusted using a general price index and 
a gain or loss on the net monetary position is recognized."
"The 
adjustment under IAS 29 is made on the basis of the consumer 
price index as of December 31, 2023, published by the Turkish 
Statistical Institute, which amounted to 1,859.38 index points 
(December 31, 2022: 1,128.45)."

"Reversals of write-downs amounted to €16 million in 2023 (2022: 
€13 million)."
"The change in inventories compared to December 31, 2022, is 
mainly attributable to the significant decrease in stored gas

No inventories have been pledged as collateral.
"(18) Receivables and Other Assets
The following table lists receivables and other assets by remaining 
time to maturity as of the dates indicated: 
As of the reporting date, other financial assets include receivables

"Receivables from derivative financial instruments amounted to 
€7,985 million at the balance sheet date (2022: €30,746 million)."
"Of this amount, €6,709 million (2022: €29,230 million) is 
attributable to forward commodity contracts."
"The decrease is 
primarily due to price developments on the commodity markets 
during the course of the year."
"Receivables within the scope of IFRS 15 mainly comprise trade 
receivables."
"Value adjustments recognized in profit or loss on 
receivables within the scope of IFRS 15 totaled -€1.0 billion in 
2023 (2022: -€0.7 billion)."
The Federal Constitutional Court declared in Case No.
"2 BvL 29/14 
that section 36(6a) of the Corporate Tax Act (Körperschaft-
steuergesetz – KStG) as amended by the Tax Act 2010 
(Jahressteuergesetz 2010) is incompatible with the Basic Law."
"Based on this court order, the provision may result in an unjustified 
loss of potential to reduce a company’s corporate tax that could 
have been realized at the time of the transition from the 
“imputation system” (Anrechnungsverfahren) to the “half-income 
system” (Halbeinkünfteverfahren)."
"In accordance with the decision 
of the Federal Constitutional Court, the legislator was required to 
remedy the violation of constitutional law by December 31, 2023, 
with retroactive effect."
"However, the legislator has not yet taken 
any action in this respect."
"Therefore, it is not currently clear how 
the legislator will structure the new regulation."
"Depending on how 
the new legislation is enacted, this could potentially result in a tax 
refund for E.ON SE in the future of up to a low, three-digit million 
euro amount in the context of ongoing appeal proceedings."
"Due to 
the tight budgetary situation, however, it cannot be ruled out that 
the legislator will use its discretionary powers in a pro-fiscal 
manner."
"Cash and cash equivalents also include, in particular, money 
market funds in the amount of €358 million (2022: €1,200 
million) which meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents."

€351 million) which are subject to an only contractual restriction 
comprise mainly advance payments in connection with 
government intervention measures."

"The reduction in 
additional paid-in capital is attributable to the issue of employee 
shares to eligible employees of the E.ON Group."
"The total change of               
-€1,726 million is primarily due to E.ON SE’s distribution to 
shareholders."
"In addition, actuarial losses from pensions led to a  
change in retained earnings."
"This was partially offset by the 
positive consolidated net income."
"Under German securities law, E.ON SE shareholders may receive 
distributions from E.ON SE’s income available for distribution in 
accordance with the German Commercial Code (German GAAP)."
"As of December 31, 2023, these German-GAAP retained earnings 
totaled €3,294 million (2022: €2,630 million)."
"Of this amount, 
legal reserves of €45 million (2022: €45 million) are restricted 
pursuant to Section 150 (3) and (4) AktG."
"The increase in retained 
earnings is due to the transfer of €650 million to the revenue 
reserve from the current result, as well as the sale of treasury 
shares under the employee stock purchase program in 2023."
"The dividend-restricted amounts are fully 
covered by a sufficient amount of available reserves."
"The amount of retained earnings available for distribution is 
€3,146 million (2022: €2,467 million)."
"A proposal to distribute a cash dividend for 2023 of €0.53 per 
share will be submitted to the Annual Shareholders Meeting."
"For 
2022, shareholders at the May 17, 2023, the Annual Shareholders 
Meeting voted to distribute a dividend of €0.51 for each dividend-
paying ordinary share."
"Based on a €0.53 dividend, the total profit 
distribution is €1,384 million (2022: €1,331 million)."
"The table below illustrates the share of OCI attributable to 
companies accounted for under the equity method."
"The list of shareholdings pursuant to Section 313 (2) 
HGB (see Note 38) contains information on the registered office of 
the company and disclosures on equity interests."
"There are no major restrictions beyond those under customary 
corporate or contractual provisions."
"The amount of €80 million 
(2022: €301 million) was reclassified from non-controlling 
interests to liabilities in connection with guaranteed dividends."
"This corresponds to a funded status of 80 
percent."
"Both defined benefit plans and defined 
contribution plans are in place at E.ON."
"Benefits under defined 
benefit plans are generally paid upon reaching retirement age, or in 
the event of disability or death."
"E.ON regularly reviews the pension plans in place within the Group 
for financial risks."
"Typical risk factors for defined benefit plans are 
longevity and changes in nominal interest rates, as well as inflation 
developments and rising wages and salaries."
"The features and risks of defined benefit plans are shaped by the 
general legal, tax and regulatory conditions prevailing in the 
respective country."
"The configurations of the major defined benefit 
and defined contribution plans within the E.ON Group are 
described in the following discussion."
"Germany 
Active employees at the German Group companies are covered by 
both cash balance plans and pension plans based on final salary."
Pension plans based on final salary are closed to new hires.
"All new 
hires will receive cash balance plans in accordance with a capital or 
pension module system, which, depending on the pension plan, 
can provide for alternative payout options of a prorated single 
payment and payments of installments in addition to the payment 
of a regular pension."
"The cash balance plans used different interest 
rules until December 31, 2021."
"Depending on the underlying 
pension plan, either interest rates adjusted to market 
developments with a fixed lower limit or guaranteed interest rates 
were used to determine the capital or pension modules."
"The 
majority of pension commitments still with a fixed guaranteed 
interest rate were modified as of January 1, 2022, in that the 
pension modules acquired from January 1, 2022, onwards now 
also bear interest at a rate adjusted to market developments and 
protected by a fixed lower limit."
"The benefit expense for the cash 
balance plans is determined at different percentage rates based on 
the ratio between compensation and the contribution limit in the 
statutory retirement pension system in Germany."
"Employees can 
additionally choose to defer compensation."
"Future pension adjustments are either guaranteed at 1 percent per 
annum or largely track the development of the inflation rate, 
usually in a three-year cycle."
"To fund the pension plans for the German Group companies, plan 
assets were established."
"The major part of these plan assets is 
administered in the form of Contractual Trust Arrangements 
(“CTAs”) in accordance with specified investment principles."
"There 
are additional plan assets available through the implementation 
channels of the pension fund (“Pensionsfonds”) and smaller 
German pension vehicles (“Pensions- und Unterstützungskassen”)."
"Only the pension fund and the “Pensionskassen” vehicles are 
subject to regulatory provisions in relation to the investment of 
capital and funding requirements."
"United Kingdom 
In the United Kingdom, there are various pension plans."
"In the past, 
employees were covered by defined benefit plans, which for the 
most part were final-pay plans and make up the majority of the 
pension obligations currently reported for the United Kingdom."
"Benefit payments to the beneficiaries are adjusted for inflation on 
a limited basis."
These pension plans were closed to new hires.
"Since then, new hires are offered a defined contribution plan."
"Aside 
from the payment of contributions, this plan entails no additional 
risks for the employer."
"Plan assets in the United Kingdom are administered by trustees in 
independent special-purpose vehicles, most of which are separate 
sections of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS)."
"The 
trustees are selected by the members of the plan or appointed by 
the entity."
"In that capacity, the trustees are particularly responsible 
for the investment of the plan assets."
"The actuarial assumptions 
underlying the valuation are agreed upon by the trustees and E.ON 
UK plc."
"They include presumed life expectancy, wage and salary 
growth rates, investment returns, inflationary assumptions and 
interest rate levels."
"The last technical valuation for the E.ON UK Section took place on 
the reporting date of March 31, 2021, and no technical funding 
deficit was identified."
"The most recent completed technical 
valuation carried out for the Npower section was completed as of 
March 31, 2022, and there was also no technical financing deficit 
identified."
"Other Countries 
The remaining pension obligations are divided between the 
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Romania, the 
Czech Republic and the USA."
"The defined benefit plan in the Netherlands consists of 
commitments made by various employers within the framework of 
a sector-specific fund and does not permit a pro rata allocation of 
the obligations, plan assets and service cost."
"The E.ON Group 
accordingly accounts for this obligation as a defined contribution 
plan."
There are no minimum funding requirements in this respect.
"Benefits may be reduced or contributions increased if there is 
insufficient funding."
"From the perspective of the Group, however, the benefit plans are 
relatively insignificant in the above-mentioned countries."
"The present value is attributable to retirees and their beneficiaries 
in the amount of €13.5 billion (2022: €12.7 billion), to former 
employees with vested entitlements in the amount of €2.8 billion 
(2022: €2.4 billion) and to active employees in the amount of €5.4 
billion (2022: €4.8 billion)."
"2Different salary growth rates due to different benefit plans (E.ON: 2.10 percent (2022: 2.20 
percent); Npower: 2.50 percent (2022: 2.70 percent))."
"3The pension increase rate for Germany applies to eligible individuals not subject to an agreed 
guarantee adjustment."
"The IAS 19 discount rates for the EUR and GBP currency areas are 
determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rate 
method."
"The full yield curve is used to determine the present value 
of the defined benefit obligations, and the IAS 19 discount rate 
disclosed is determined retrospectively as the discount rate that 
leads to the identical present value of the defined benefit 
obligations when applied uniformly."
"The yield curve “RATE:Link” 
from provider WTW is used to determine the present value."
"If one of the actuarial assumptions 
is changed for the purpose of computing the sensitivity of results 
to changes in that assumption, all other actuarial assumptions are 
included in the computation unchanged."
"When considering sensitivities, it must be noted that the change in 
the present value of the defined benefit obligations resulting from 
changing multiple actuarial assumptions simultaneously is not 
necessarily equivalent to the cumulative effect of the individual 
sensitivities."
"The fair value of these plan assets changed as follows: 
The plan assets include virtually no owner-occupied real estate or 
equity and debt instruments issued by E.ON Group companies."
"Each of the individual plan asset components has been allocated to 
an asset class based on its substance."
"This 
investment policy stems from the corresponding governance 
guidelines of the Group."
"An increase in the net defined benefit 
liability or a deterioration in the funded status following an 
unfavorable development in plan assets or in the present value of 
the defined benefit obligations is identified in these guidelines as a 
risk."
"E.ON therefore regularly reviews the development of the 
funded status in order to monitor this risk."
"To implement the investment objective, the E.ON Group primarily 
pursues an investment approach that takes into account the 
structure of the benefit obligations."
"The investment strategy may also involve the 
use of derivatives (for example, interest rate swaps and inflation 
swaps, as well as currency hedging instruments) to facilitate the 
control of specific risk factors of pension liabilities."
"In the table 
above, derivatives have been allocated, based on their substance, 
to the respective asset classes."
"In order to improve the funded 
status of the E.ON Group as a whole, a portion of the plan assets 
will also be invested in a diversified portfolio of asset classes that 
are expected to provide for long-term returns in excess of those of 
fixed-income investments and the discount rate."
"The determination of the target portfolio structure for the 
individual plan assets is based on regular asset-liability studies."
"In 
these studies, the target portfolio structure is reviewed in a 
comprehensive approach against the backdrop of existing 
investment principles, the current funded status, the condition of 
the capital markets and the structure of the benefit obligations, 
and is adjusted as necessary."
"The parameters used in the studies 
are additionally reviewed regularly, at least once each year."
"Asset 
managers are tasked with implementing the target portfolio 
structure."
"They are monitored for target achievement on a regular 
basis."
"Contributions to state plans totaled €0.4 billion (2022: €0.4 
billion)."
"The weighted-average duration of the defined benefit obligations 
measured within the E.ON Group was 13.5 years as of December 
31, 2023 (2022: 13.2 years)."
"The provision items 
are discounted in accordance with the maturities with interest 
rates of between 1.8 and 7.3 percent."
"Provisions for Nuclear-Waste Management 
Obligations 
The provisions for nuclear-waste management obligations as of 
December 31, 2023, in the amount of €6.6 billion exclusively 
relate to nuclear power activities in Germany."
"The asset retirement obligations recognized include the anticipated 
costs of post- and residual operation of the facility, dismantling 
costs, and the cost of removal and disposal of the nuclear 
components of the nuclear power plant."
"The cost estimates used to determine the provision amounts are 
based on studies and analyses performed by external specialists 
and are updated annually, provided that the cost estimates are not 
based on contractual agreements."
"A risk-free discount rate of an average of about 2.0 percent is used 
for the measurement of E.ON’s disposal obligations (previous year: 
(2.5 percent)."
"As in the prior year, E.ON assumes a 2 percent 
increase in costs when estimating annual payments."
"A change in 
the discount rate or in the cost increase rate of 0.1 percentage 
points would change the amount of the provision recognized on 
the balance sheet by approximately €40 million."
"Excluding the effects of discounting and cost increases, the 
amounts for disposal obligations would be €6,540 million with 
average credit terms of approximately six years."
"There were changes in estimates for the nuclear power business in 
2023 in the amount of €266 million (2022: -€965 million)."
"This 
mainly includes the discounting effect in the amount of about 
€200 million resulting from the decrease in interest rates, effects 
from cost adjustments in the amount of €230 million and off-
setting effects from the optimization of decommissioning and 
disposal services."
"€686 million (2022: €624 million) of this was 
used, of which €592 million (2022: €562 million) related to 
decommissioning nuclear power plants based on circumstances 
for which decommissioning and dismantling costs were 
capitalized."
"Personnel Obligations 
Provisions for personnel costs primarily cover provisions for early 
retirement benefits, performance-based compensation 
components, restructuring and other deferred personnel costs."
"Restructuring provisions, which totaled €641 million at December 
31, 2023 (2022: €766 million), were made especially in Germany 
for various restructuring projects."
"Obligations from Green Certificates 
Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs or Green Certificates) 
are an important mechanism for promoting renewable energies, 
especially in the UK."
"The ROCs represent a fixed share of 
Renewables in power sales and can be acquired either from 
renewable sources or on the market."
"During a 12-month ROC 
period, the obligations recognized as a provision for this purpose 
are offset against the acquired certificates and used."
"In addition, the provisions for dismantling conventional plant 
components in the nuclear power segment, which are based on 
legally binding civil agreements and public provisions, in the 
amount of €375 million (2022: €300 million) are taken into 
account here."
"The change in this item is in addition to inflation-
related adjustments also due to the decrease in interest rates."
"Excluding discounting and cost-increase effects, the amounts for 
these disposal obligations with an average payment term of about 
14 years would be €380 million."
"The other asset retirement obligations disclosed under economic 
net debt, not including the provisions for dismantling conventional 
plant components in the nuclear power segment, amount to 
€447 million."
"Sales and Supplier-Related Obligations 
Provisions for supplier-related obligations consist of provisions for 
potential losses on open purchase contracts."
"The main changes in the area of sales-related obligations result 
from impending losses from pending sales contracts."
"There was a 
reversal in the amount of €1.9 billion in connection with the lower 
energy prices on the commodity markets."
"In addition €1.4 billion 
was utilized."
"Provisions for sales market-oriented obligations 
include provisions for risks of loss from pending sales agreements 
in the amount of €0.1 billion (2022: €3.2 billion)."
"Environmental Remediation and Similar Obligations 
Provisions for environmental remediation refer primarily to 
redevelopment protection measures and the rehabilitation of 
contaminated sites."
This relates to energy procurement and sales contracts that are not classified as own-use contracts under IFRS 9 and are accounted for as commodity derivatives.
"This collateral relates to amounts pledged by banks 
to limit the utilization of credit lines in connection with the fair 
value measurement of derivative transactions."
"The other financial 
liabilities include, inter alia, financial guarantees totaling €8 million 
(2022: €8 million)."
"Also included is collateral received in 
connection with goods and services in the amount of €17 million 
(2022: €24 million)."
"E.ON can use this collateral without 
restriction."
"The financial liabilities of innogy recognized at the date of initial 
consolidation were marked to market under IFRS."
"This market 
value was considerably higher than the nominal value because 
market interest rates had fallen since the bonds were issued."
This difference is not taken into account in the economic net debt.

"As of December 31, 2023, there were  
bilateral credit facilities in the amount of about €2.3 billion (2022:

"These 
facilities were agreed with a share of E.ON’s core banking group 
and were not drawn on during the reporting year."
"€3.5 Billion Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility 
Effective October 24, 2019, E.ON arranged a syndicated revolving 
credit facility in the amount of €3.5 billion over an original term of 
five years, with two extension options for one year each."
"After  
both options are exercised, the term of the credit line will end on 
October 24, 2026."
"The credit margin is linked, among other things, 
to the development of certain ESG ratings, which gives E.ON 
financial incentives to pursue a sustainable corporate strategy."
"The 
ESG ratings are set by three prominent agencies: ISS ESG, MSCI 
ESG Research, and Sustainalytics."
"The facility serves as the 
Group’s reliable, long-term liquidity reserve, one purpose of which 
is to function as a backup facility for the commercial paper

"(guaranteed by E.ON SE) have the maturities presented in the table 
below."
"Capital expenditure grants of €752 million (2022: €445 million) 
have not yet been recognized as revenue."
"As in the prior year, the 
majority of these were government grants, in particular for the 
network business."
"The E.ON Group retains ownership of the 
assets."
"The grants are non-refundable and are recognized in other 
operating income over the period of the depreciable lives of the 
related assets."
"Derivative liabilities totaled €12,440 million as of December 31, 
2023 (2022: €28,009 million)."
"Of this amount, €10,832 million 
(2022: €26,316 million) is attributable to forward commodity 
contracts."
"The change compared with the previous year is mainly 
due to the market valuation of commodity derivatives."
"Contract liabilities under IFRS 15 in the amount of €4,392 million 
(2022: €4,098 million) consist primarily of construction grants 
that were paid by customers for the cost of new gas and electricity 
connections in accordance with the generally binding terms 
governing such new connections."
"These grants are customary in 
the industry, generally non-refundable and recognized as revenue 
in the amount of €314 million according to the useful lives of the 
related assets (2022: €372 million)."
"Other operating liabilities consist primarily of other tax liabilities in 
the amount of €950 million (2022: €1,019 million) and interest 
payable in the amount of €441 million (2022: €369 million)."
"This 
item also includes other liabilities to our customers from 
overpayments and refund claims of €1,765 million (2022: €902 
million) and current personnel liabilities of €503 million (2022: 
€458 million)."
"(28) Contingent Liabilities and Other Financial 
Obligations
As part of its business activities, E.ON is subject to contingent 
liabilities and other financial obligations involving a variety of 
underlying matters."
"These primarily include guarantees, 
obligations from litigation and claims (as discussed in more detail 
in Note 29), short- and long-term contractual, legal and other 
obligations and commitments."
"Contingent Liabilities 
The contingent liabilities of the E.ON Group amounted to €0.3 
billion as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: €0.3 billion) 
and primarily include contingent liabilities in connection with 
potential long-term environmental remediation measures and legal 
disputes."
"This value represents the best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the present obligation as of the 
reporting date."
"E.ON has also issued direct and indirect guarantees and surety 
bonds to third parties in connection with its own operations or the
operations of affiliated companies, which may trigger payment 
obligations based on the occurrence of certain events."
"These 
instruments include both financial guarantees as well as 
operational guarantees, which primarily secure contractual 
obligations as well as benefit obligations for active and former 
employees."
"In some cases, 
obligations are covered in the first instance by provisions of the 
disposed companies before E.ON itself is required to make any 
payments."
"Guarantees issued by companies that were later sold by 
E.ON SE or its legal predecessors are usually included in the 
respective final sales contracts in the form of indemnities."
"Moreover, E.ON has commitments under which it assumes joint 
and several liability arising from its interests in civil-law companies 
(“GbR”), non-corporate commercial partnerships and consortia in 
which it participates."
"The guarantees of E.ON also include items related to the operation 
of nuclear power plants."
"The coverage requirement is satisfied in part by a standardized 
insurance facility in the amount of €255.6 million."
"The institution 
Nuklear Haftpflicht Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts (“Nuklear 
Haftpflicht GbR”) now only covers costs between €0.5 million and 
€15 million for claims related to officially ordered evacuation 
measures."
"If an accident occurs, the Solidarity Agreement calls for the nuclear 
power plant operator liable for the damages to receive—after the 
operator’s own resources and those of its parent companies are 
exhausted—financing sufficient for the operator to meet its 
financial obligations."
"Under the Solidarity Agreement, E.ON 
Energie’s share of the liability coverage on December 31, 2023, 
was 43.3 percent (prior year: 43.3 percent), plus an additional 5.0 
percent charge for the administrative costs of processing damage 
claims."
"The contract does not provide for a change in share for the 
2023 calendar year."
"Sufficient liquidity has been provided for and 
is included within the liquidity plan."
"Furthermore, as of December 31, 2023, E.ON is continuing to 
provide collateral in the amount of €454.2 million (2022: €700.8 
million) for the former Group companies transferred to RWE which 
are to be repaid or assumed by RWE Group companies."
"In the 
course of the fiscal year 2023, €246.6 million of guarantees were 
redeemed as part of the exchange process with RWE."
"Other Financial Obligations 
In addition to provisions and liabilities carried on the balance sheet 
and to reported contingent liabilities, there also are other financial 
obligations arising mainly from contracts entered into with third 
parties, or on the basis of legal requirements."
"As of December 31, 2023, purchase commitments for 
investments in property, plant and equipment amounted to €2.9 
billion (2022: €2.3 billion)."
"Of these commitments, €2.4 billion are 
due within one year (2022: €1.7 billion)."
"€2.3 billion of the 
purchase commitment at December 31, 2023 (2022: €2.0 billion) 
relates to the segments Energy Networks Germany and Sweden."
"Additional contractual obligations in place at the E.ON Group as of 
December 31, 2023, relate primarily to the purchase of electricity 
and natural gas."
"Fixed financial obligations under electricity 
purchase contracts amount to €6.7 billion on December 31, 2023 
(2022: €11.3 billion), of which €5.0 billion (2022: €8.6 billion) is 
due within one year."
"Financial obligations under fixed gas purchase 
contracts amount to approximately €3.9 billion on December 31, 
2023 (2022: €5.4 billion)."
"Of this amount, €2.8 billion (2022: €4.5 
billion) is due within one year."
"Additional fixed purchase 
commitments as of December 31, 2023, amount to €0.8 billion 
(2022: €0.7 billion)."
"They essentially include long-term contractual 
commitments to purchase heat and alternative fuels."
"Of these 
commitments, €0.2 billion (2022: €0.2 billion) are due within one 
year."
"There are also additional purchase commitments whose 
amount is not fixed yet."
Other financial obligations exist only to an insignificant extent.
"These include capital commitments in connection with joint 
ventures, obligations concerning the acquisition of financial assets, 
and obligations arising from capital measures."
"(29) Litigation and Claims
A number of different court actions, governmental investigations 
and proceedings, and other claims are currently pending or may be 
instituted or asserted in the future against companies of the E.ON 
Group."
"The courts and authorities are also 
subjecting competitive practices to stricter reviews."
"Where 
appropriate, Group companies have recognized corresponding 
contingent assets (see Note 18), provisions (see Note 26) or 
contingent liabilities (see Note 28)."
"In the Energy Networks segment, Group companies are involved in 
proceedings for the award of concessions and in connection with 
grid connections and the calculation of the grid fee."
"Official 
regulations, approvals and changes in regulatory practice have 
given rise to legal disputes."
"Of particular note here are effects in 
connection with the regulatory treatment of capital costs, return 
on equity and other key regulatory parameters."
"The national legal 
framework conditions within Europe are subject to changes, some 
of which have a significant impact on network operations."
"Owing 
to a number of factors, including regulatory and legal decisions, 
the regulatory framework has increased here."
"However, these 
regulatory interventions are not restricted to the network area; 
distribution activities in the customer solutions area have also 
been affected by regulatory measures."
"The changes to the legal and regulatory framework can in some 
cases also significantly impact subsidies and remuneration 
practices in the area of Renewables, which in turn are the object of 
regulatory or court proceedings."
"There are also legal disputes in connection with completed M&A 
activities, in particular as a result of the acquisition of innogy SE."
"With regard to the latter, all legal actions brought against the 
European Commission’s merger control approval decision were 
dismissed by the Court of First Instance of the European Union; 
E.ON SE intervened on the side of the European Commission in 
these proceedings."
"(30) Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosures
Please refer to the detailed presentation in Note 5 for information 
on the shares in AggerEnergie GmbH and other shares in 
Západoslovenská energetika a.s."
"(“ZSE”) acquired in the framework 
of swap transactions."
"In the current fiscal year, E.ON made external payments for 
additions to consolidated shareholdings and activities in the 
amount of €14 million (2022: €0 million)."
"Cash and cash 
equivalents in the amount of €2 million were also acquired."
"The total consideration received by E.ON in 2023 on the disposal 
of consolidated equity interests and activities generated cash 
inflows of €1 million (2022: €634 million)."
"Cash and cash 
equivalents disposed of amounted to €0 million (2022: €3 million)."
"The sale of the consolidated activities led to reductions of 
€1 million (2022: €855 million) in assets and €1 million (2022: 
€55 million) in provisions and liabilities."
"Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations 
before interest and taxes of €7.2 billion was €4.3 billion below the 
prior-year figure (€11.5 billion)."
"This resulted in part from a decline 
of €0.9 billion at Energy Networks, which is mainly attributable to 
adverse changes in working capital at the network business in 
Germany."
"In particular, back payments to energy feed-in 
customers who had received insufficient instalment payments in 
the previous year had a negative impact on operating cash flow in 
the year under review."
"The remaining decline (a total of
-€3.4 billion) came from Customer Solutions and Corporate 
Functions/Other and was likewise mainly due to negative changes 
in working capital in the 2023 financial year that more than offset 
the increase in cash-effective earnings."
"These negative changes in 
working capital are mainly attributable to the timing difference 
between customer instalment payments already received in 2022 
and payments from government support measures and the related 
cash outflows from commodity procurement in the year under 
review."
"In addition, the closure of E.ON’s last nuclear power plant 
in the 2023 financial year led to a further deterioration of cash 
provided by operating activities relative to the prior year."
"Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations of     
-€5.6 billion was 2.4 billion below the prior-year figure of         
-€3.2 billion."
"This includes cash-effective investments of 
€6.4 billion (prior year: €4.8 billion)."
"The increase is primarily 
attributable to the planned increase in investments in property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets, particularly at the 
network business Germany."
"A reduction in cash inflow from 
disposals also affected cash provided by investment activities."
"There was no transaction in the 2023 financial year comparable to 
the sale of E.ON’s 50-percent stake in Westconnect in the prior 
year."
"Cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations of    
-€1.8 billion was €1.3 billion above the prior-year figure of        
-€3.1 billion."
"The net of the issuance and repayment of bonds, 
commercial paper, and bank liabilities led to an improvement in 
cash provided by financing activities."
"A net reduction in adverse 
effects in conjunction with variation margins due to the settlement 
of derivative transactions led to a further improvement in cash 
provided by financing activities."
"At the E.ON Group, hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 is 
employed primarily in connection with hedging long-term liabilities 
and future financing via interest-rate derivatives and for hedging 
long-term foreign currency receivables and payables via currency 
derivatives."
"E.ON also hedges net investments in foreign 
operations."
"In the commodity sector, fluctuations in future cash flows from 
procurement and sales transactions are economically hedged by 
offsetting transactions."
"Hedge accounting was applied in individual 
cases with regard to hedging electricity and gas price change risks."
"To hedge currency risk, E.ON entered into hedging transactions in 
the reporting year in pounds sterling at an average hedging rate of 
£0.90/€ (2022: £0."
"91/€) and in US dollars at an average hedging 
rate of US$1.36/€ (2022: US$1.36/€)."
"Hedging transactions were 
concluded at an average interest rate of 2.80 percent (2022:    
2.67 percent) to hedge the interest rate risk in the eurozone."
"To 
hedge commodity price risk, E.ON entered into hedging 
transactions with an average hedged price of €30/MWh for gas 
and an average hedged price of €115/MWh for electricity."
"Fair Value Hedges 
Fair value hedges are used to protect against the risk from changes 
in market values."
"Gains and losses on these hedges are generally 
reported in that line item of the income statement which also 
includes the respective hedged items."
"Cash Flow Hedges 
Cash flow hedges are used to protect against the risk arising from 
variable cash flows."
"Interest rate swaps and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps are the principal instruments used to limit 
interest rate and currency risks."
"The purpose of these swaps is to  
maintain the level of payments arising from long-term interest-
bearing receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency 
and euros by using cash flow hedge accounting in the functional 
currency of the respective E.ON company."
"Futures contracts are 
concluded to reduce future cash flow fluctuations arising from 
commodity transactions effected at variable spot prices."
"Cash flow 
hedge accounting to hedge the risk of changes in commodity 
prices (electricity and gas) was applied in individual cases in the 
2023 fiscal year."
"Gains and losses from the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges 
are classified as other operating income or other operating 
expenses."
"Reclassifications recognized in income are generally reported in 
that line item of the income statement which also includes the 
respective hedged transaction."
"2Of this amount, -€116 million (previous year -€23 million) relates to hedged cash flows that are no longer expected to occur."
"The carrying amount of the assets used as hedging instruments as 
of December 31, 2023, was €2 million (2022: €104 million) and 
the carrying amount of the liabilities used as hedging instruments 
was €1,241 million (2022: €1,117 million)."
"The fair values of the 
designated portion of the hedging instruments changed by -€110 
million in the reporting period (2022: +€304 million)."
"As in 2022, no ineffectiveness resulted from net investment 
hedges in 2023."
"As a rule, reclassification adjustments recognized in income are 
reported under other operating income and expenses."
"The nominal 
volume of hedging instruments in net investment hedges 
amounted to €4,613 million as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 
€4,759 million)."
"Since the currency risk of net investment hedges 
is hedged through the ongoing rollover of the hedging instruments, 
the majority are concluded with a remaining term of less than one 
year."
"Valuation of Derivative Instruments 
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is sensitive to 
movements in underlying market rates and other relevant 
variables."
"The Company assesses and monitors the fair value of 
derivative instruments on a periodic basis."
"The fair value to be 
determined for each derivative instrument is the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants on the 
measurement date (exit price)."
"E.ON also takes into account the 
counterparty credit risk for both own credit risk (debt value 
adjustment) and the risk of the corresponding counterparty (credit 
value adjustment) when determining fair value."
"The fair values of 
derivative instruments are calculated using common market 
valuation methods with reference to available market data on the 
measurement date."
"The following is a summary of the methods and assumptions for 
the valuation of utilized derivative financial instruments in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"• Currency, electricity and gas forward contracts, swaps, and 
emissions-related derivatives are valued separately at their 
forward rates and prices as of the balance sheet date."
"Whenever
possible, forward rates and prices are based on market 
quotations, with any applicable forward premiums and 
discounts taken into consideration."
"• The fair values of existing instruments to hedge interest risk are
determined by discounting future cash flows using market 
interest rates over the remaining term of the instrument."
"Discounted cash values are determined for interest rate, 
currency and cross-currency interest rate swaps for each 
individual transaction as of the balance sheet date."
"Interest 
income and expenses are recognized in income at the date of 
payment or accrual."
"• Equity forwards are valued on the basis of the stock prices of the
underlying equities, taking into consideration any timing 
components."
"• Exchange-traded futures and option contracts are valued 
individually at daily settlement prices determined on the futures
markets that are published by their respective clearing houses."
Paid initial margins are disclosed under other assets.
"Variation
margins received or paid during the term of such contracts are 
stated under other liabilities or other assets, respectively, unless
they are offset against the recognized market values of the 
commodity derivatives, as the offsetting criteria of IAS 32.42 
are met."
"• Certain long-term energy contracts are valued with the aid of 
valuation models that use internal data if market prices are not 
available."
"A hypothetical 10 percent increase or decrease in 
these internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet date 
would lead to a theoretical change in market values of 
±€5 million."
The measurement categories are described in detail in Note 1.
"The amounts determined using valuation techniques with unobservable inputs (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) correspond to the difference between the total fair 
values of the two hierarchy levels listed."
2The liabilities from put options include counterparty obligations and non-controlling interests in fully consolidated partnerships (see Note 27).
"Where the fair value of a financial instrument can be derived from 
an active market without the need for an adjustment, that value is 
used as the fair value."
"This applies in particular to equities held and 
to bonds held and issued."
The measurement categories are described in detail in Note 1.
"The amounts determined using valuation techniques with unobservable 
inputs (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) correspond to the difference between the total fair values of the two hierarchy levels listed."
2The liabilities from put options include counterparty obligations and non-controlling interests in fully consolidated partnerships (see Note 27).
"Any necessary discounting takes place using 
current market interest rates over the remaining terms of the 
financial instruments."
"The determination of the fair value of 
derivative financial instruments is discussed in Note 31."
"At the end of each reporting period, E.ON assesses whether there 
might be grounds for reclassification between hierarchy levels."
"In 
2023, due to adjusted price quotes, securities with a fair value of 
€169 million were reclassified from hierarchy level 1 to hierarchy 
level 2 and securities with a fair value of €283 million were 
reclassified from hierarchy level 2 to hierarchy level 1."
"The input parameters of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for 
equity investments are specified taking into account economic 
developments and available industry and corporate data (see also 
Note 1)."
"A hypothetical change of +10 percent or -10 percent in 
these key internal valuation parameters as of the balance sheet 
date would lead to a theoretical change in market values of     
+€77 million or -€3 million, respectively."
"Certain long-term energy 
contracts are measured using valuation models based on internal 
fundamental data if market prices are not available."
"A hypothetical change of ±10 percent in the internal valuation 
parameters as of the balance sheet date would result in a 
theoretical increase or decrease in fair values of ±€5 million."
"A 
change of +10 percent or -10 percent in the key internal 
measurement parameters of other financial receivables and other 
financial assets as of the balance sheet date would result in a 
theoretical increase or decrease in fair values of ±€2 million."

"Compulsory netting is carried out if the netting criteria pursuant to 
IAS 32.42 are met cumulatively."
"Transactions and business relationships resulting in the financial 
assets and liabilities presented are regularly concluded on the basis 
of standard contracts that permit the conditional netting of open 
transactions in the event that a counterparty becomes insolvent."
"If 
there is also currently a legal right to set off and the intention is to 
settle on a net basis, offsetting is mandatory in accordance with 
IAS 32."
"Collateral pledged to and received from financial institutions in 
relation to these liabilities and assets limits the utilization of credit 
lines in the fair value measurement of interest rate and currency 
derivatives, and is shown in the table."
"This amount is the maximum amount that E.ON would have to pay 
in the event of claims on the guarantees."
"E.ON has recognized a 
liability for this in the amount of €8 million (2022: €8 million)."
"For financial liabilities that bear floating interest rates, the rates 
that were fixed on the balance sheet date are used to calculate 
future interest payments for subsequent periods as well."
"Financial 
liabilities that can be terminated at any time are assigned to the 
earliest maturity band in the same way as put options that are 
exercisable at any time."
"In gross-settled derivatives (usually currency derivatives and 
commodity derivatives), outflows are accompanied by related 
inflows of funds or commodities."
"In addition to impairments of financial assets, net gains and losses 
in the amortized cost category are due primarily to interest income 
from financial assets and liabilities and effects from the currency 
translation of financial liabilities."
"The net gains and losses in the fair value through profit or loss 
measurement category encompass both the changes in fair value 
from derivative financial instruments and from equity instruments, 
and gains and losses on realization."
"The decrease in net results was 
due in particular to reduced income from the valuation and 
realization of commodity derivatives."
"Impairments of Financial Assets 
Impairment losses on financial assets must be recognized not only 
for losses already incurred but also for expected future credit 
losses."
"E.ON takes into account expected future credit losses of 
financial assets carried at amortized cost, financial assets 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and 
receivables from finance leases."
"For trade receivables, expected credit losses are recognized over 
their entire residual term using the simplified method (lifetime 
expected credit loss (ECL) trade receivables)."
"For other financial 
assets, E.ON first determines the credit loss expected within the 
first 12 months (stage 1—12 month ECL)."
"In derogation of this, in 
the event of a significant increase in the default risk, the expected 
credit loss over the entire residual term of the respective 
instrument is recognized (stage 2—lifetime ECL)."
"Whether the 
default risk has increased significantly depends largely on the 
counterparty risk as calculated internally on initial recognition."
"E.ON uses an 18-point internal rating scale to monitor 
counterparty risk."
"A significant increase in the default risk is 
assumed at the earliest after a three-level decline in the rating 
(since initial recognition)."
"If there are objective indications of an 
actual default, an individual impairment loss must be recognized 
on the income statement (stage 3—losses already incurred)."
"E.ON distinguishes between two approaches when calculating 
expected future credit losses."
"If external or internal rating 
information is available, the expected credit loss for trade 
receivables and other financial assets is determined on the basis of 
this data."
"If no rating information is available, E.ON determines 
default ratios for trade receivables on the basis of historical default 
rates, taking into account forward-looking information on 
economic developments."
"In the E.ON Group, a default or the 
classification of a receivable as uncollectable is assumed after 180, 
270 or 360 days, depending on the region."
"There were no significant changes in valuation allowances in 2023 
for other financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair 
value through other comprehensive income, or for receivables 
from finance leases."
"The 
units have developed additional guidelines of their own within the 
confines of the Group’s overall guidelines."
"To ensure efficient risk 
management at the E.ON Group, the Trading (Front Office), 
Finance Controlling (Middle Office) and Financial Settlement (Back 
Office) departments are organized as strictly separate units."
"E.ON uses a Group-wide treasury, risk management and reporting 
system."
"This system is a standard information technology solution
that is fully integrated and is continuously updated."
"The system is
designed to provide for the analysis and monitoring of the E.ON 
Group’s exposure to liquidity, foreign exchange and interest risks."
"On a Group-wide basis, Finance Controlling/Counterparty Risk 
Management monitors and steers credit risks for banks, and 
Counterparty Risk Management monitors and steers corporates of 
a certain materiality."
"These activities are carried out each using a 
standard software package."
"Separate Risk Committees/Steering Groups are responsible for the 
maintenance and further development of the strategy set by the 
Management Board of E.ON SE with regard to commodity, 
treasury and credit risk management policies."

"Cash pooling and external financing are largely centralized at E.ON 
SE and certain financing companies."
"Funds are provided to the 
other Group companies as needed on the basis of an “in-house 
banking” solution."
"E.ON SE determines the Group’s financing requirements on the 
basis of short- and medium-term liquidity planning."
"The financing 
of the Group is controlled and implemented on a forward-looking 
basis in accordance with the planned liquidity requirement or 
surplus."
"Relevant planning factors taken into consideration include 
operating cash flow, capital expenditures, divestments, margin 
payments and the maturity of bonds and commercial paper."
"Price Risks 
In the normal course of business, the E.ON Group is exposed to 
risks arising from price changes in foreign exchange, interest rates,
commodities and asset management."
"These risks create volatility 
in earnings, equity, debt and cash flows from period to period."
"E.ON has developed a variety of strategies to limit or eliminate 
these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, 
among others."
"Credit Risks 
E.ON is exposed to credit risk in its operating activities and through
the use of financial instruments."
"Uniform credit risk management 
procedures are in place throughout the Group to identify, measure 
and steer credit risks."
"The following discussion of E.ON’s risk management activities and 
the estimated amounts generated from value-at-risk (“VaR”) and 
sensitivity analyses are “forward-looking statements” that involve 
risks and uncertainties."
"Actual results could differ materially from 
those projected due to actual, unforeseeable developments in the 
global financial markets."
"The methods used by the Company to 
analyze risks should not be considered forecasts of future events 
or losses."
"For example, E.ON faces certain risks that are either non-
financial or non-quantifiable."
"Such risks principally include country 
risk, operational risk, regulatory risk and legal risk, which are not 
represented in the following analyses."
"Foreign Exchange Risk Management 
E.ON SE is responsible for steering the currency risks to which the
E.ON Group is exposed."
"Because it holds interests in businesses outside of the eurozone, 
currency translation risks arise within the E.ON Group."
"Fluctuations in exchange rates produce accounting effects 
attributable to the translation of the balance sheet and income 
statement items of the foreign consolidated Group companies 
included in the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Translation 
risks are hedged through borrowing in the corresponding local 
currency, which may also include shareholder loans in foreign 
currency."
"In addition, derivative and non-derivative financial 
instruments are employed as needed."
"The hedges qualify for hedge 
accounting under IFRS as hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations."
"The Group’s translation risks are reviewed at regular 
intervals and the level of hedging is adjusted whenever necessary."
"The respective debt factor, net assets and the enterprise value 
denominated in the foreign currency are the principal criteria 
governing the level of hedging."
"The E.ON Group is also exposed to operating and financial 
transaction risks attributable to foreign currency transactions."
"The 
subsidiaries are responsible for managing their operating currency 
risks and are generally required to hedge their currency risks 
through E.ON SE."
"E.ON SE coordinates hedging throughout the 
Group companies and makes use of external derivatives as needed."
"It may either directly close out foreign currency positions that have 
been tendered, in whole or in part, through external transactions, 
or keep the position open within approved limits."
"The one-day 
value-at-risk (95 percent confidence) for transactional foreign 
currency positions totaled €0.2 million as of December 31, 2023 
(2022: €0.7 million) and is mainly determined by the currencies 
Czech koruna, Hungarian forint and Swedish krona."
"Financial transaction risks result from payments originating from 
financial receivables and payables."
"They are generated both by 
external financing in a variety of foreign currencies, and by 
shareholder loans from within the Group denominated in foreign 
currency."
Financial transaction risks are generally hedged.
"Interest Rate Risk Management 
E.ON is exposed to profit risks arising from floating-rate financial 
liabilities and future (re)financing needs."
"Positions based on fixed 
interest rates, on the other hand, are subject to changes in fair 
value resulting from the volatility of market interest rates."
"E.ON 
seeks a balanced maturity profile."
"This is influenced, among other 
factors, by the type of business model, existing liabilities as well as 
the regulatory framework in which E.ON operates."
"Interest rate 
derivatives are also used to manage interest rate risk."
"With interest rate derivatives and cash on hand included, the share 
of financial liabilities with floating interest rates or with maturities 
of less than 12 months was 0 percent as of December 31, 2023 
(2022: 0 percent)."
"The volume-weighted average interest rate of 
the financial liabilities, including interest rate derivatives, was 2.8 
percent as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 2.7 percent)."
"As of December 31, 2023, the E.ON Group held interest rate 
derivatives with a nominal value of €5,512 million (2022: €6,263 
million)."
"A sensitivity analysis was performed on the Group’s floating-rate 
borrowings and planned financing, including interest risk hedges."
"This measure is used for internal risk controlling and reflects the 
economic position of the E.ON Group."
"A one-percentage-point 
upward or downward change in interest rates (across all 
currencies) would raise or lower interest charges by ±€15 million 
(2022: ±€8.0 million) in the subsequent fiscal year."
"The principal commodity prices 
to which E.ON is exposed relate, in particular, to electricity, gas, 
green and emissions certificates."
"The objective of commodity risk management is to transact 
through physical and financial contracts to optimize the value of 
the portfolio while reducing the potential negative deviation from 
target EBITDA and OCF."
"In the normal course of business of the underlying energy 
production and retail sales activities, E.ON’s individual 
management units are exposed to uncertain commodity market 
prices, which impacts operating results."
"All external trading on 
commodity markets contributes to reducing open commodity 
positions driven by sales and is undertaken in strict accordance 
with approved commodity hedging strategies."
"A very small number of proprietary trading transactions are 
entered into in separate trading books, which are subject to strict 
monitoring and limits based on risk metrics and governance."
"The 
processes and operational management models within the trading 
system are monitored by the local market risk teams and centrally 
managed by the Risk Management department."
"The subsidiary, E.ON Energy Markets GmbH (EEM), acts as a 
central interface to the wholesale markets."
"The main function of 
EEM is to consolidate E.ON’s commodity positions, to reduce price 
risks from the distribution business and to diversify and reduce 
credit and margin risks."
"As of December 31, 2023, the E.ON Group primarily held 
electricity and gas derivatives with a nominal value of €125,767 
million (2022: €136,765 million)."
"Electricity derivatives account 
for €45,418 million (2022: €66,648 million) of this amount and 
gas derivatives for €80,268 million (2022: €70,055 million)."
"A key foundation of the commodity risk management system is 
the Group-wide Commodity Risk Policy and the corresponding 
internal policies of the units."
"These specify the control principles 
for commodity risk management, minimum required standards 
and clear management and operational responsibilities."
"Commodity exposures and risks are reported across the Group on 
a monthly basis to the members of the Risk Committee."
"A report 
on complex weather risks is prepared once each quarter."
"A corresponding hypothetical change would 
result in a theoretical increase in fair value and recognition in 
income in the amount of €279 million or a decrease in fair value 
and recognition in expense in the amount of €279 million for gas 
derivatives (2022: ±€810 million)."
"Because commodity hedge 
accounting is only applied in individual cases, hypothetical changes 
in market prices result in only immaterial effects recognized in 
other comprehensive income."
"Credit Risk Management 
In order to minimize credit risk arising from operating activities and 
from the use of financial instruments, the Company enters into 
transactions only with counterparties that satisfy the Company’s 
internally established minimum requirements."
"Maximum credit 
risk is confined by credit limits based on internal and (where 
available) external credit ratings."
"The setting and monitoring of 
credit limits is subject to certain minimum requirements, which are 
based on Group-wide credit risk management guidelines."
"Long-
term operating contracts and asset management transactions are 
not comprehensively included in this process."
"They are monitored 
separately at the level of the responsible units."
"In principle, each Group company is responsible for managing 
credit risk in its operating activities."
"Depending on the nature of 
the operating activities and the credit risk, additional credit risk 
monitoring and controls are performed both by the units and by 
Corporate Headquarters."
"Regular reports on credit limits, including 
their utilization, are submitted to the Risk Committee."
"Intensive, 
standardized monitoring of quantitative and qualitative early-
warning indicators, as well as close monitoring of the credit quality 
of counterparties, enable E.ON to act early in order to minimize 
risk."
"To the extent possible, collateral is negotiated with counterparties 
for the purpose of reducing credit risk."
"Accepted as collateral are 
primarily guarantees issued by the respective parent companies, 
letters of comfort or evidence of profit and loss transfer 
agreements in combination with letters of awareness."
"To a lesser 
extent, the Company also requires bank guarantees and deposits 
of cash and securities as collateral to reduce credit risk."
"Risk 
management collateral in the forms mentioned above totaling 
€10.3 billion (2022: €61.0 billion) was used for setting limits."
"The 
lower wholesale market price level over the course of 2023 means 
that the collateral attributable to individual parent companies of 
our counterparties is lower and must be taken into account 
accordingly."
"Derivative transactions are generally executed on the basis of 
standard agreements that allow for the netting of all open 
transactions with individual counterparties."
"To further reduce 
credit risk, bilateral margining agreements are entered into with 
selected banks."
"Limits, which are regularly monitored, are imposed 
on the credit and liquidity risk resulting from bilateral margining 
agreements and exchange clearing."
"The systematic management 
of liquidity risk remains an important component of risk 
management at E.ON, particularly against the backdrop of the 
continued possibility of energy price volatility."
"For the 
remaining financial instruments, the maximum risk of default is 
equal to their nominal amounts."
"At E.ON, liquid funds are normally invested at banks with good 
credit ratings, in money market funds with first-class ratings or in 
short-term securities (for example, commercial paper) of issuers 
with strong credit ratings."
"Bonds of public and private issuers are 
also selected for investment."
"Group companies that for legal 
reasons are not included in the cash pool invest money at leading 
local banks."
"Standardized credit assessment and limit-setting is 
complemented by daily monitoring of CDS levels at the banks and 
at other significant counterparties."
"These financial assets are invested on the basis of an accumulation 
strategy (total-return approach), with investments broadly 
diversified across the various asset classes, for example the money 
market, bond and equity asset classes, as well as alternative asset 
classes like real estate."
"The majority of the assets are held in 
investment funds managed by external fund managers."
"Corporate 
Asset Management at E.ON SE, which is part of the Company’s 
Finance Department, is responsible for continuous monitoring of 
overall risks and those concerning individual fund managers."
"The 
three-month VaR with a 98 percent confidence interval for these 
financial assets was €78 million (2022: €166 million)."
The liquidation of Versorgungskasse Energie VVaG (VKE i.
"L.) was 
almost complete as of December 31, 2023."
"Financial investments 
under management amounted to €46.0 million as of December 31, 
2023 (2022: €51.9 million)."
"The company was deconsolidated on 
June 30, 2019."
"Leases are recognized in 
accordance with the right-of-use model as set out in IFRS 16."
"The 
tables in Note 15 present the development of the right-of-use 
assets by asset class."
"The net carrying amount of the rights of use 
at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023, in the amount of 
€2,710 million (2022: €2,377 million) increased year-on-year by 
€333 million (2022: €47 million)."
"In addition to the network 
business, the increase is primarily attributable to the areas of fiber 
optics, real estate and battery storage systems."
"Depreciation of 
right-of-use assets in the amount of €417 million (2022: €390 
million) showed a slight increase compared with the prior year."
"To ensure operative flexibility, in particular for real estate leases as 
well as in the area of wastewater disposal, extension and 
termination options are included in the agreements."
"In determining 
the lease term, E.ON considers all facts and circumstances that 
have an impact on the exercise of an extension option or the non-
exercise of a termination option."
"In the determination of the lease 
liability, and correspondingly of the right-of-use assets, all 
reasonably certain cash outflows are taken into consideration."
"As 
of December 31, 2023, potential future cash outflows in the 
amount of €304 million (2022: €235 million) were not included in 
the lease liability as it is not reasonably certain that the leases will 
be renewed or not terminated."
"Possible future cash outflows for 
lease agreements that can be terminated without penalty by either 
party, subject to certain deadlines, are not included in this amount 
due to higher levels of uncertainty."
"Variable lease payments occur 
in only immaterial amounts and E.ON generally does not issue 
residual value guarantees."
"Leases not yet commenced to which 
E.ON as a lessee is committed result in potential future cash 
outflows over the expected lease terms of €26 million (2022: 
€110 million)."
"The majority of the figure reported in 2022 related 
to future rental payments for the new office building of E.ON 
Sverige AB in Malmö, which was occupied in 2023 and is now 
included in the rights of use."
"The existing lease liabilities do not 
contain any covenant clauses that are linked to financial ratios."
"The maturity structure of the 
future payment obligations from leases is presented in Note 32."
"Due to the practical expedients used, the recognition of a right-of-
use asset is not necessary for low-value leases and leases with a 
lease term of less than 12 months."
"Instead, a lease expense is 
recognized in these cases."
"Cash outflows from lease agreements totaled €634 million (2022: 
€580 million) in the fiscal year and are allocated to operating cash 
flow in the amount of €251 million (2022: €223 million)."
"This 
includes the lease expense for short-term and low-value leases as 
well as the expense from variable lease payments and interest 
expense for the period."
"Payments allocated to the amortization of 
the lease liability are recognized in cash flows from financing 
activities in the amount of €383 million (2022: €357 million)."
"E.ON as Lessor
E.ON enters into lease agreements as a lessor to a limited extent."
"Finance leases include technical equipment and machinery, in 
particular generation plants, that have been transferred to 
customers for use."
"Operating leases include assets that have been 
transferred for use, in particular real estate, heat and electricity 
generation plants and lines."
"There are no material risks in 
connection with rights retained to the assets temporarily 
transferred for use, with the result that risk management 
strategies, in particular, are not necessary."
"Residual-value 
guarantees are only entered into on an individual basis for 
purposes of additional hedging."
"The present value of minimum lease payments is recognized under 
receivables from finance leases (see Note 18)."
"The short-term 
portion totals €29 million (2022: €33 million)."
"There were no 
material changes to net investments in the period under review."
"This also applies to cash inflows 
from finance leases with variable lease payments."
"Payments 
recognized as financing income from net investments increase the 
operating cash flow."
"Some of these 
companies are related parties, including associated companies 
accounted for under the equity method and their subsidiaries."
"Receivables and payables consist primarily of lease obligations 
from leaseback models and trade receivables."
"Joint ventures and 
subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated continue to be 
accounted for as associated companies."
"The relationships with these entities do not generally differ from 
those that exist with municipal entities in which E.ON does not 
have an interest."
"Expenses from transactions with related 
companies are generated mainly through electricity and gas 
deliveries as well as through management fees, IT services and 
third-party services."
"Liabilities of E.ON payable to related companies as of December 
31, 2023, include €60 million (2022: €55 million) in trade 
payables and shareholder loans to operators of jointly owned 
nuclear power plants."
"These shareholder loans bear interest at 1.0 
percent (2022: 1.0 percent) and have no fixed maturity."
"E.ON 
continues to have in place with these power plants a cost-transfer 
agreement and a cost-plus-fee agreement for the procurement of 
electricity."
"The settlement of such liabilities occurs mainly through 
clearing accounts."
"Under IAS 24, compensation paid to key management personnel 
(members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board 
of E.ON SE) must be disclosed."
"The total expense for 2023 for members of the Management 
Board amounted to €12.5 million (2022: €11.8 million) in short-
term benefits and €0.2 million (2022: €0.3 million) in post-
employment benefits."
"The cost of post-employment benefits is 
equal to the service cost of the provisions for pensions."
"The expense determined in accordance with IFRS 2 for existing 
commitments arising from share-based payment in 2023 was 
€11.0 million (2022: €2.7 million)."
"Provisions for these commitments amounted to €18.0 million as of 
December 31, 2023 (2022: €10.1 million)."
"The members of the Supervisory Board received a total of €4.6 
million for their activity in 2023 (2022: €5.0 million)."
"Employee representatives on the Supervisory Board were paid 
compensation under the existing employment contracts with 
subsidiaries totaling €0.9 million (2022: €1.0 million)."

sustainable earnings power of the E.ON Group’s business, 
unadjusted EBITDA is adjusted for certain non-operating effects."
"Operating earnings also include income from investment subsidies 
for which liabilities are recognized."
"IAS 
29 was applied for the first time in 2022 because of the 
hyperinflation in Turkey and the effects recognized in income are 
also presented in other non-operating earnings."
"In addition, effects from the valuation of certain provisions on the 
balance sheet date are disclosed in non-operating earnings."
"In 
addition, effects that are to be initially recognized from the 
subsequent measurement of hidden reserves and charges in 
connection with the innogy purchase price allocation are included."
"Net book gains/losses were minor in 2023 and resulted mainly 
from the combination of VSEH and ZSE in Slovakia."
"Book gains in 
the prior year consist in particular of the partial disposal of 
Westconnect."
"Restructuring expenses in the 2023 financial year were below 
those of the prior year and included, as in the prior year, primarily 
expenditures in conjunction with the restructuring of the sales 
business in the United Kingdom."
"Effects in connection with derivative financial instruments 
changed by €1,110 million to -€4,233 million."
"The reason was 
that prices on commodity markets decreased almost continually 
during the year, which led to declining fair value measurements on 
forward sales and procurement contracts."
"PreussenElektra’s 
earnings, which are disclosed as non-operating income effective 
2023, had a countervailing effect (€289 million)."
"Along with the depreciation charges in connection with the innogy 
purchase-price allocation, which are disclosed separately, E.ON 
recorded impairment charges mainly on specific assets at 
Customer Solutions and on the IFRS book value of VSEH in 
Slovakia at Energy Networks."
"The decline in non-operating interest expense/income resulted 
from the altered direction of interest-rate movements."
"An increase 
in interest rates in the prior year led to income from accruals on 
non-current provisions for asset-retirement obligations, provisions 
for recultivation and remediation obligations, and other non-
current provisions."
"In the interim interest rates declined relative to 
prior-year balance-sheet date."
"By contrast, E.ON recorded positive 
valuation effect on securities recognized at fair value."
"The positive 
effect of €187 million (prior year: €204 million) from the 
difference between the nominal interest rate and the effective 
interest rate of former innogy bonds adjusted due to the purchase-
price allocation is still recorded under non-operating interest 
expense/income."
"Non-controlling interests’ share of operating earnings rose from 
€517 million to €912 million mainly because of higher operating 
earnings at companies at the network business in Germany with a 
significant proportion of non-controlling interests."
"This 
development resulted from a larger regulated asset base 
compared with the prior year and the recording of a price-driven 
increase in network fees."
"In accordance with the purchase 
agreement, a one-time purchase-price adjustment was made after 
an audit of the divested company was completed in the first 
quarter of 2023, and the contractual clause now took effect."
"Aside from that, there was no major concentration in any 
given geographical region or business area."
"Due to the large 
number of customers the Company serves and the variety of its
business activities, there are no individual customers whose 
business volume is material compared with the Company’s total 
business volume."
"There were no loans to members of the Supervisory Board in 
2023."
"Management Board 
Total compensation of the Management Board in 2023 amounted 
to €20.2 million (2022: €19.5 million)."
"This consists of non-
performance-based compensation (base salary, fringe benefits) 
and performance-based compensation (bonus, long-term variable 
compensation)."
"Total payments to former members of the Management Board and 
their beneficiaries amounted to €16.3 million (2022: €14.0 
million)."
"Provisions of €170.6 million (2022: €184.5 million) have 
been established for the pension obligations to former members of 
the Management Board and their beneficiaries."
"There were no loans to members of the Management Board in 
2023."
"(37) Subsequent Events
Changes to the Business Model 
On September 11, 2023, the Management Board approved a new 
management concept for the E.ON Group."
"Effective from January 
1, 2024, this entails a change in the definition of certain operating 
segments in accordance with IFRS 8 and the reallocation of the 
current goodwill amounts for all operating segments affected by 
the changes and reporting goodwill as of January 1, 2024."
"The 
Management Board's decision was regarded as an opportunity to 
test the goodwill of the existing operating segments for 
impairment."
"The impairment tests carried out as of September 
2023 found no indication of impairment."
"Following the entry into 
force of the new management concept, the goodwill amounts 
reallocated as of January 1, 2024, are subject to the provisions of 
IAS 36 on impairment testing."
"In the new Energy Infrastructure 
Solutions segment, there may be an impairment risk of up to a 
mid-triple-digit million euro amount."
"Corporate Bonds Issued 
E.ON issued two green corporate bonds at the beginning of 
January 2024."
"One bond has a volume of €750 million due in 
January 2031 with a 3.375 percent coupon; the other bond has a 
volume of €750 million due in January 2036 with a 3.75 percent 
coupon."
"Arbitration Proceeding in Spain 
E.ON SE, E.ON Finanzanlagen GmbH and E.ON Iberia Holding 
GmbH are plaintiffs in arbitration proceedings against the 
Kingdom of Spain."
"In the arbitration proceedings, the three 
companies are asserting claims for damages for changes to the 
Spanish renewable energies subsidies regime."
"The arbitration 
proceedings have been pending at the International Centre for 
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) their registration on 
August 10, 2015."
"On January 18, 2024, an arbitration court 
awarded the companies damages totaling approximately €0.3 
billion."
"Termination of Operating Concession Wastewater 
Treatment Plant in Croatia 
A concession agreement for the operation of a wastewater 
treatment plant exists between Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o., a 
company consolidated at equity in the E.ON Group, and the City of 
Zagreb."
"By majority resolution of the City Assembly on January 25, 
2024, the City of Zagreb exercised its contractually agreed right to 
unilaterally terminate this concession."
"This results in a six-month 
period from the receipt of the termination letter of February 2, 
2024, during which the city will either acquire the individual assets 
of Zagrebacke otpadne vode d.o.o."
"or the shares held by E.ON in 
this company."
"The City of Zagreb has yet to determine how the 
sale will take place at the time of preparation of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"The financial impact of the transactions 
cannot yet be reliably estimated at the time of preparation."
"Under 
the terms of the concession agreement, the disposal value will 
initially be determined by a consultant to be appointed jointly."
"The 
associate is allocated to the Energy Networks ECE/Turkey 
segment."

"In addition, we have audited the management report of 
the Company and the Group (hereinafter referred to as “combined 
group management report”) of E.ON SE for the financial year from 
1 January to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not 
audited the content of those components of the combined 
management report specified in the ""Other Information"" section of 
our auditor's report."
"In all 
material respects, this combined group management report is 
consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies 
with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our opinion on 
the combined group management report does not cover the 
content of those components of the combined group 
management report specified in the ""Other Information"" section 
of the auditor's report."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our 
audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
combined group management report.."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are 
further described in the ""Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined group 
management report"" section of our auditor's report."
"We are 
independent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial and 
professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these 
requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) (f) of 
the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided 
non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit 
Regulation."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the combined group 
management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated  
Financial Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the 
consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 
January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as 
a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters."
"Provisions for onerous contracts were reported in the 
amount of EUR 0.1 billion."
"The 
contracts in these portfolios are predominantly entered and 
processed by way of mass processes."
"Discretion is required when determining whether a commodity 
forward transaction was concluded to satisfy own requirements 
and is being held for this purpose and therefore fulfils the own-use 
criteria on initial and subsequent recognition."
"In compliance with 
the requirements of IFRS 9, the underlying contracts are to be 
classified as ""own use"" contracts or as derivative financial 
instruments and monitored on an ongoing basis."
"With regard to 
the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk that these 
may be incompletely or incorrectly recognised and/or incorrectly 
classified."
"There is also the risk that a change in purpose at a later 
date will not be recognised and the contracts will not be properly 
accounted for."
"Fair values are to be determined for the commodity forward 
transactions classified as derivative financial instruments."
"Provided that no market prices are observable, the fair values are 
to be determined on the basis of recognised valuation methods."
"The methods, assumptions and data used for this purpose require 
judgement."
"There is a risk for the financial statements that the 
other operating assets, the (other) operating liabilities and the 
other operating income will not be measured or determined in line 
with the accounting requirements."
"In the context of its business activities, E.ON fulfils its sales 
obligations towards customers through commodity forward 
transactions."
"If there is a risk of losses from sales obligations, 
provisions for onerous contracts must be recognised."
"The amount 
of the provisions is determined based on the best possible 
estimate of the amount by which the unavoidable costs of fulfilling 
the contract will exceed the expected economic benefit of the 
contract, i.e."
generally the agreed sales price for sales transactions.
"A direct allocation of procurement transactions to individual sales 
obligations is generally not possible for electricity and gas supply 
companies and thus also not possible within the E.ON Group."
"There is the 
risk for the consolidated financial statements that provisions are 
not recognised or not in the amount required."
"For the IT and individual data processing systems deployed, with 
the involvement of our IT specialists we evaluated the 
effectiveness of the rules and procedures relating to a large 
number of IT applications and which support the effectiveness of 
the application controls."
"We used analyses to satisfy ourselves that the commodity forward 
transactions were properly recognised and classified."
"In the case of 
sales, we assessed whether there was a change in purpose and 
whether it was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 
appropriately."
"To assess the methodically and 
mathematically correct implementation of the valuation method, 
our valuation experts verified E.ON's valuation using their own 
calculations and analysed deviations for a risk-based selection."
"Price and market information observable in the market were used 
where possible."
"In addition, we assessed the appropriateness of the key data and 
assumptions as well as the method used by E.ON in relation to the 
recognition of provisions for onerous contracts for sales portfolios."
"To this end, we verified the allocations of the procurement 
transactions to the sales portfolios and also discussed the 
expected future contribution margins in the various sales 
portfolios of the E.ON Group with those responsible for planning."
"To ensure the computational accuracy of the method used, we 
verified the Company's calculations on the basis of selected risk-
based elements."
"OUR OBSERVATIONS 
The recognition, classification and ongoing monitoring of 
commodity forward transactions has been carried out 
appropriately."
"The methods, assumptions and data used to 
measure commodity forward transactions and provisions for 
onerous contracts are appropriate."
"Recoverability of goodwill 
Please refer to Note [1] to the consolidated financial statements 
for information on the accounting policies applied."
"THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK 
Goodwill amounts to EUR 17.1 billion as at 31 December 2023 
and, at 86% of consolidated equity, constitutes a significant 
proportion of the assets."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, irrespective of any 
indication of impairment, as at 1 October."
"If impairment triggers 
arise during the financial year, an event-driven goodwill 
impairment test is also carried out during the year."
"The goodwill is 
allocated to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-
generating units, which essentially correspond to the operating 
segments at the E.ON Group."
"For the goodwill impairment test, the 
carrying amount is compared with the recoverable amount of the 
relevant cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an 
impairment loss is recognised."
"At E.ON, the recoverable amount is 
initially calculated as the fair value less costs to sell."
"The goodwill impairment test is complex and based on a number of 
assumptions requiring judgement."
"These include the estimate of 
the expected business and earnings performance of the operating 
segments, the assumed long-term growth rates and the discount 
rate used."
"On 11 September 2023, the Board of Management of E.ON 
passed a resolution on a new management concept for the E.ON 
Group."
"The concept is effective from 1 January 2024 and requires 
a change in the definition of some segments according to IFRS 8 
and, in this context, a reallocation of the current goodwill for all 
segments affected by the changes and carrying goodwill as at 1 
January 2024."
"The Board of Management's decision was seen as 
an event triggering testing of the recoverability of goodwill for the 
segments affected by the changes and carrying goodwill."
"As a result of the impairment tests conducted, the Company did 
not identify any need for impairment."
"Furthermore, no 
requirement to recognise an impairment loss was identified in the 
course of the annual impairment testing."
"There is the risk for the consolidated financial statements that 
impairment existing as at the reporting date was not identified."
"There is also the risk that the related disclosures in the notes are 
not appropriate)."
"OUR AUDIT APPROACH 
First, we obtained an understanding of the process for impairment 
testing of goodwill through explanations provided by staff of the 
finance organisation and by evaluating the Company’s 
documentation."
"With the involvement of our valuation experts, we 
assessed (among other things) the appropriateness of the 
significant assumptions and the Company's calculation method for 
both annual as well as indicator-based (ad hoc) impairment 
testing."
"To this end, we discussed and validated the expected cash 
flows and the assumed long-term growth rates with those 
responsible for planning."
"We also carried out reconciliations with 
the budget drawn up by management and approved by the 
Supervisory Board for the following year and the medium-term 
planning, including the projected development for the next three to 
five years, that has been acknowledged by the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, we assessed the consistency of the assumptions with 
external market forecasts."
"We also confirmed the accuracy of the Company's previous 
forecasts by comparing the budgets of previous financial years 
with actual results and by analysing deviations."
"We compared the 
assumptions and data underlying the weighted average cost of 
capital, especially the risk-free interest rate, the market risk 
premium and the beta factor, with our own assumptions and 
publicly available data."
"To assess the methodically and mathematically correct 
implementation of the valuation method, we verified the valuation 
performed by the Company using our own calculations and 
analysed deviations."
"Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes 
regarding impairment of goodwill are appropriate."
"OUR OBSERVATIONS 
The calculation method used for impairment testing of goodwill is 
appropriate and in line with the accounting policies to be applied."
"The Company's assumptions and data underlying the 
measurement are appropriate."
The related disclosures in the notes are appropriate.
"Other Information 
The The Board of Management and/or the Supervisory Board are 
responsible for the other information."
"The other information also includes the remaining parts of the 
annual report."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report do not cover the other information, 
and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form 
of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in this 
regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of 
Management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to 
continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In 
addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the 
going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to 
liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic 
alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statements and of the combined group management 
report."
"Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and this combined management 
report."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud 
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the 
Board of Management and the reasonableness of estimates 
made by the Board of Management and related disclosures."
"If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined 
group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on 
the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's 
report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined group management report."
"We 
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of 
the group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"• Evaluate the consistency of the combined group management 
report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity 
with [German] law, and the view of the Group's position it 
provides."
"• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the Board of Management in the combined 
groupmanagement report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant 
assumptions used by the Board of Management as a basis for 
the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation 
of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do 
not express a separate opinion on the prospective information 
and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial 
unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, 
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit 
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies 
in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We 
describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in 
accordance therewith is further described below."
"Our audit firm 
applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management 1: 
Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QMS 
1 (09.2022))."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of 
preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting 
process."
"Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
ESEF documents are free from material intentional or 
unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 
328 (1) HGB."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the assurance work."
"• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the 
assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the 
effectiveness of these controls."
"• Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file made available containing the ESEF documents 
meets the requirements of the Commission Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, 
on the technical specification for this electronic file."
"• Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML 
rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated 
financial statements and the audited combined group 
management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit 
Regulation 
We were elected as group auditor at the Annual General Meeting 
on 17 May 2023."
"We were engaged by the Audit and Risk 
Committee of the Supervisory Board on 6 December 2023."
"We 
have been the group auditor of E.ON SE without interruption since 
financial year 2021."
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor's report are 
consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee 
pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit 
report)."
"Other Matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report 
Our auditor's report must always be read together with the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the audited 
combined group management report as well as the examined ESEF 
documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance 
opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the 
examined ESEF documents provided in electronic form."

This figure reports full-time equivalents (“FTE”).
"This includes making steady progress toward our 
climate targets, effectively managing climate-related risks, seizing 
climate-related opportunities that fit with our corporate strategy, 
and reporting transparently on all these matters."
"To ensure that 
we do so, we have put in place a highly effective governance 
structure."
"The TCFD’s recommendations provide important guidance for 
reporting."
"Established in 2015, the TCFD aims to develop 
consistent, comparable, and accurate climate-related financial risk 
disclosures that companies can use to provide information to 
investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders."
"E.ON became 
an official TCFD supporter in 2019, which marks the start of our 
TCFD reporting below."
"Going forward, we will continue to expand 
our TCFD reporting."
"One consequence of TCFD reporting is that 
we have developed a qualitative scenario analysis to assess how 
our businesses might be affected under different climate 
scenarios."
"› In addition, the TCFD reporting is supported by additional 
information in the publication “On course for net zero—Supporting 
paper for E.ON’s decarbonization strategy and climate-related 
disclosures.” ‹ 
Governance 
The importance of climate change for E.ON is reflected in our 
governance."
"The Management Board has overall responsibility for 
the sustainability strategy, including the climate targets."
"It is 
informed on a quarterly basis by the Chief Sustainability Officer 
(“CSO”) about important initiatives and developments as well as 
KPIs."
"The CSO manages and monitors all of the Company’s 
sustainability activities and chairs the Sustainability Council."
"The 
council is E.ON’s most important forum for discussing 
sustainability issues, establishing a sustainable mindset, and 
embedding it in business processes."
"The Supervisory Board is 
regularly informed about material sustainability topics by its Audit 
and Risk Committee, by its Innovation and Sustainability 
Committee, and by the Management Board."
"As part of the carbon 
management plan introduced in 2022, emission reduction paths 
were defined for the business units to implement the Group's 
climate targets at the local level."
"Our units conduct annual controls 
to ensure that we are on track to meet our targets."
"Strategy 
E.ON’s business operations cause carbon emissions."
"Yet our two 
core businesses—Energy Networks and Customer Solutions—also 
help millions of customers avoid emissions."
"They make the energy 
system more efficient and increase the proportion of renewables in 
the energy mix."
"E.ON’s current climate strategy includes emission-reduction 
targets for 2030, 2040 and 2050."
"In 2020 E.ON set new climate 
targets and intends to be climate-neutral by 2040 (Scope 1 and 2)."
"Both climate change and the energy transition aimed at slowing it 
could create risks as well as opportunities for E.ON’s business."
"A 
scenario analysis models how the key value drivers of E.ON and 
five of our business units might be affected under different 
scenarios through 2050."
"The analysis consisted of three different 
climate scenarios: a conservative, ambitious, and fully committed 
climate policy."
"Subject experts analyzed the implications, which 
were used to conduct a risk-and-opportunity assessment."
"It shows 
that we have a robust business model and great opportunities for 
decarbonization for every scenario."
"E.ON’s high proportion of 
regulated business makes it robust, while massive electrification 
and decarbonization offer major opportunities for the Company’s 
business model."
"In view of these important findings, we intend to 
review of the scenario analysis on an annual basis."
"We again began 
a qualitative scenario analysis at the end of 2023."
"Risk Management 
E.ON regularly monitors and assesses its non-financial, climate, 
and other sustainability risks and opportunities and their potential 
impact in the short, medium, and long term."
"In 2020 we integrated 
climate related risks into our Enterprise Risk Management system."
"In 2021 human rights risks in the supply chain, employee matters, 
social matters, and anti-corruption were integrated as well."
"Risk 
and sustainability managers at the units were actively involved in 
this process."
"The status of this process is presented to the E.ON 
Group Risk Committee on a regular basis."
"Our analyses of climate 
risks encompass physical risks (such as extreme weather and 
rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes 
in consumer preferences, the regulatory environment, and carbon 
pricing)."
"The Risks and Chances Report contains additional 
information."
"Metrics and Targets 
E.ON’s current climate metrics consist mainly of the emission 
figures for its carbon footprint categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3) and 
the measurement of progress toward its climate targets (see 
above)."
"The climate targets defined in 2020 remain valid (see 
Climate Protection chapter)."
"We monitor progress toward these 
targets on an annual basis for all relevant GHG categories."
"The 
aforementioned carbon management plan apportions our 
emission-reduction targets to the business units, while giving 
them the operational decision-making authority on how to achieve 
them."
"In addition, E.ON discloses avoided emissions."
"This applies to the 
annual reporting for its green bonds, which includes disclosures on 
the metric tons of CO2e avoided by the projects funded."
"A green 
bond is a fixed-interest security whose issuance proceeds are used 
to fund infrastructure and energy-efficiency projects that yield 
measurable carbon savings."
"In 2023 E.ON issued three green 
bonds totaling €2.5 billion."
Capital markets in particular want standardized ESG KPIs.
"Consequently, this report discloses KPIs on our ESG performance over three years."
"In addition, since 2010 we have reported our KPIs in accordance with standards of the German 
Association for Financial Analysis and Asset Management (German abbreviation: “DVFA”) and the 
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies (“EFFAS”)."
"KPIs that reflect these standards are 
indicated by the DVFA/EFFAS ID."
KPIs that are particularly important to us are highlighted.
"The audit levels of the KPIs that were part of the independent Sustainability Assurance or the audit of 
the consolidated financial statements can be found in the Combined Group Management Report as 
well as the Annexes to the Combined Group Management Report."
"The About This Report chapter 
explains how the respective KPIs are marked and with which audit level they were audited."
"Companies with fewer than ten employees do not have to be included if their activities have no material impact on the various 
Scope 1 to Scope 3 categories."
"2The external global warming potential (""GWP"") sources used are the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (""BEIS"", 
formerly DEFRA), the Naturvårdsverkets, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the Överenskommelse Värmemarknadskommittén 2021, and the 
IPCC AR5 report."
"3Emissions from power and heat generation are divided into emissions from plants owned and operated by E.ON (Scope 1) and emissions 
from plants leased to, and operated by, customers (Scope 3)."
"This improves E.ON’s ability to manage its emissions and makes progress 
toward its targets more transparent."
"4The external global warming potential (""GWP"") sources used is the International Energy Agency (""IEA"")."
"5The external global warming potential (""GWP"") sources used are the International Energy Agency (""IEA"") and the Association of Issuing
