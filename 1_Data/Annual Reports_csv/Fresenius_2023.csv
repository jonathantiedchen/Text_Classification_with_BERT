Fresenius  |  Annual Report 2023
Table of contents
The healthcare industry offers tremendous opportunities."
"It is growing structurally, yet at the same time facing the 
challenge of having to use resources more efficiently."
"A demographic shift is taking place: in many regions 
of the world, the population is aging and the number of 
people with chronic diseases is increasing."
"The importance 
of health equity – that is to say, fair, affordable, and high- 
quality healthcare for all people – is rightly growing."
"Health 
awareness has improved among many people, too."
"At the same time, great progress has been made in rec-
ognizing, treating, and curing diseases that were until 
recently considered incurable."
"This is thanks to disruptive 
changes such as cell and gene research in biology, techno-
logical advances in AI and robotics, and ever greater quan-
tities of usable data."
"We have realigned our company to the #FutureFresenius 
strategy and are now focusing on simplifying the structure, 
sharpening our focus, and enhancing performance."
Fresenius previously had a complex corporate structure.
"In today’s fast-paced world, we must be faster and more 
focused."
"Only by improving Fresenius can we fulfil our mis-
sion and thus improve people’s health."
"Simplified structure
We have reduced complexity and created transparency 
and flexibility."
"Fresenius completed the deconsolidation of 
Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) at the end of November 
2023."
"This historic step offers both companies tremendous 
advantages: decisions are now made faster and more effi-
ciently."
"The management teams can concentrate on their 
respective core business."
Capital allocation has improved.
"FMC is no longer part of the fully consolidated subsidiaries 
of Fresenius."
"The latter continues to hold a 32 percent 
stake in of FMC’s share capital however and therefore has 
a vested interest in its value-preserving development."
"Sharper focus
We are now concentrating on our operating companies 
Fresenius Helios and Fresenius Kabi."
"Both businesses 
afford attractive market positions and good growth oppor-
tunities."
"We manage FMC and the hospital and healthcare 
provider Fresenius Vamed as investment companies."
"At the 
same time, we are divesting ourselves of businesses for 
which we are no longer the “best owner.” We have sold our 
hospital business in Peru and the Eugin chain of fertility 
clinics, for example."
"With Fresenius Helios in Germany and Quirónsalud in 
Spain, Fresenius is Europe’s leading private hospital opera-
tor and treats around 26 million patients every year."
"Two 
things that makes us proud: in 2023, Newsweek magazine 
voted five Quirónsalud clinics among the world’s best 
­
specialized hospitals."
"And Wirtschaftswoche business mag-
azine named Fresenius Helios the top healthcare provider in 
Germany in the “Regional clinic/hospital groups” category."
"Humans and machines for optimal therapy: robot-assisted surgery  
enables greater precision and therefore a faster recovery."
"»	 
Great progress has been made in 
recognizing, treating, and curing 
diseases that were until recently 
considered incurable."
"The Casiopea platform 
developed in-house is used to assign patients to the 
right location and to initiate the correct course of treat-
ment before a patient has even visited the doctor or 
clinic."
"Overall, the outcome is better coordinated pro-
cesses, more pleasant treatment paths, and more suc-
cessful therapies."
"▶	 
AI applications and digital solutions are also increasingly 
being integrated into everyday clinical practice at our 
Fresenius Helios facilities in Germany."
"Thanks to AI, for 
example in the analysis of radiological images or use of 
robots during minimally invasive procedures, diagnoses 
and medical interventions are becoming more precise 
and efficient."
"This is good for both the medical quality 
and the company’s economic success."
"Fresenius Kabi is successfully implementing the Vision 2026 
strategy."
"The generics we produce save healthcare sys-
tems around the world substantial sums of money and make 
high-quality medicines available to a growing number of 
people."
"Seventy percent of the intravenous drugs we deliver 
to the USA are on the list of essential medicines of the 
U.S."
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
"With our portfo-
lio and pipeline of biosimilars, new treatment options with 
affordable medicines and medical products are constantly 
becoming available – in 40 countries worldwide already."
"Biosimilars are follow-on versions of biopharmaceuticals, 
that is to say, biotechnological drugs that are authorized 
after the patent period of the original active ingredient has 
expired."
"They are used to treat autoimmune diseases 
or cancer."
"And in the USA, 
we significantly expanded the treatment options for 
patients with autoimmune diseases and cancer through 
the market launches of the two biosimilars Idacio® and 
Stimufend®."
"▶	 
In terms of medical technology, we offer state-of-the-art 
infusion pump technology with the Ivenix® infusion sys-
tem."
"In the USA, we have signed a multi-year agreement 
with the renowned U.S."
"hospital group, the Mayo Clinic, 
for the supply and service of 10,000 Ivenix® large-volume 
infusion pumps for its hospitals and clinics."
"▶	 
Fresubin® PLANT-BASED Drink, a vegan alternative, 
complements our extensive range of clinical nutrition and 
meets the growing demand for plant-based alternatives."
"Enhanced performance
With the implementation of our strategy at the start of the 
year, we also established our Fresenius Financial Frame-
work."
"The main new feature is a focus on returns through 
clearly defined EBIT margin bands for the business seg-
ments and capital returns at Group level."
"Biosimilars from Fresenius Kabi allow more people access to state-of- 
the-art therapies."
"»	 
Fresenius is at the heart of health-
care and will continue to draw on 
these developments in the future  
to further strengthen its position  
as a leading therapy-focused  
company."
"▶	 
We met our earnings outlook, which we raised over the 
course of the year: Looking at full fiscal year 2023, 
group revenue increased to around EUR 22.3 billion, 
with a strong organic revenue growth of 6 percent."
"Operating earnings (EBIT) increased by 2 percent in 
constant currency to around EUR 2.3 billion."
"In terms 
of the EBIT and revenue, the businesses were within 
the defined bands."
"▶	 
We significantly exceeded our savings target in 2023 
and are now aiming to reduce costs by €400 million by 
2025."
"The target for 2025 was previously around €350 
million."
"▶	 
The cost reductions, divestments, and higher earning 
power are helping to reduce the debt ratio."
"The German federal government’s Energy Relief Package 
(“Entlastungspaket Energiehilfen”) also contributes to 
this."
"It involves compensation and reimbursement payments 
of around €300 million to cover the higher energy costs 
in our hospitals in Germany."
"However, the legislator has 
imposed the restriction on use of these relief payments 
provided for in the German Hospital Financing Act that no 
dividends or management bonuses may be distributed in 
2023."
"Despite this, we decided to make use of this govern-
ment relief in order to further reduce the company debt 
and net interest and enhance the company value."
"Never-
theless, Fresenius is of the opinion that the linking of hospi-
tal financing to a ban on dividends and bonuses is unconsti-
tutional, however, we are not yet finally committed to taking 
legal action."
"In principle, we will continue to pursue our progressive div-
idend policy."
"This means that we aim to increase the divi-
dend in line with the currency-adjusted growth in earnings 
per share before special items or to at least maintain the 
previous year’s level."
"We initiated #FutureFresenius with the aim of reposition-
ing Fresenius and making it fit for the future."
"Hence we 
pressed the Reset button in 2023 with the launch of 
#FutureFresenius, transformed Fresenius, and immediately 
initiated the second phase, Revitalize."
"We also strengthened 
our team: Pierluigi Antonelli, Michael Moser, and Robert 
Möller were appointed to the Management Board in 2023."
"We have a committed management team that is now driv-
ing the necessary changes."
"In 2024, we shall continue to focus on efficient, cross-­
segment collaboration, improved profitability, and higher 
productivity; debt reduction will also remain important."
"This will be followed by the Rejuvenate phase: we wish to 
continue to grow organically and to expand into attractive 
business areas that are close to our core competences."
"We have named the phase thereafter, during which we 
wish to develop first-class therapies and leading healthcare 
technologies, Reimagine."
Platform-driven growth will form the basis for this.
"Fresenius 
Kabi and Fresenius Helios are working on three platforms 
for the therapies of the future: (Bio)Pharma, MedTech, and 
More than one million infusion pumps from Fresenius Kabi are in use 
worldwide and help to optimize patient care."
"»	 
The words trust and responsi­
bility 
are at the core of everything we do."
"What makes Fresenius unique is the combination of medical 
expertise and clinical practice with industrial production 
and technological know-how."
"Unlike our competitors from 
the pharmaceutical and medical technology sectors, we 
have direct contact with patients through our clinics."
"We 
are able to gather experience that is beneficial to patient 
well-being via this human-to-human interface."
We need the best for this.
"Fresenius is a top address for tal-
ented experts from all over the world – as countless awards 
prove."
"Fresenius offers more than 40 apprenticeships and 
over 30 dual study programs, for example in our newly 
­
created dual study programs Sustainable Science & Tech­
nology and Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, within 
which we explore the topics of the future."
"Finding new 
ways to attract and retain nursing staff is equally important."
"Whether through targeted recruitment and the subsequent 
integration of skilled workers from abroad."
"Or through inno-
vative marketing campaigns on social media."
"The words trust and responsibility are at the core of every-
thing we do."
"We contribute decisively to health equity, 
which is one of our environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) goals."
Another is the reduction of our CO2 emissions.
"We are making progress here as planned: in 2023, we 
already reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
Fresenius supports life from a very early stage: a caesarian section at a 
Fresenius Helios hospital in Germany."
"»	 
Every year, Fresenius touches the 
lives of almost 450 million ­
people 
with its products and services."
"­
People entrust us with their most 
valuable asset: their health."
We bear responsibility for this.
"«
(direct and indirect emissions from purchased energy) by 
22 percent from the 2020 level."
"We are gradually approach-
ing the targets of halving CO2 emissions by 2030 and achiev-
ing climate ­
neutrality by 2040."
"Else Kröner’s motto of “If not us, then who?” has helped to 
transform Fresenius into a global company."
"Every year, 
Fresenius touches the lives of almost 450 million people with 
its products and services."
"People entrust us with their most 
valuable asset: their health."
We bear responsibility for this.
"On behalf of the Management Board, I would like to thank 
our 190,000 colleagues for their outstanding work and com-
mitment."
"My heartfelt thanks also to the Supervisory Board 
and the Else Kröner-Fresenius Foundation for their unwav-
ering support."
"Finally, I would like to thank you, dear 
shareholders, for the trust you place in us."
"I look forward 
to exchanging with you at our Annual General Meeting in 
Frankfurt am Main on May 17."
"The 
wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to cause 
immense suffering."
"These conflicts also have consequences 
for the global economy and geopolitical stability, for exam-
ple with regard to supply chains, the availability of essential 
medicines, energy prices, and inflation."
"Despite these diffi-
cult conditions, Fresenius has performed well compared to 
the competition as a leading healthcare company and is 
resolutely pursuing its own transformation."
"Important milestones in the #FutureFresenius strategy 
program were achieved as planned in the past fiscal year."
"In addition to a simplified structure, focus on Fresenius Kabi 
and Fresenius Helios, and enhanced performance, this also 
includes the use of cutting-edge technology."
"Artificial intel-
ligence, digitalization, robotics, and breakthroughs in cell 
and gene therapy will shape the future of healthcare and help 
to improve people’s health."
"The deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care is a his-
toric step."
"Both companies are now independent and can 
make decisions faster and concentrate on their core business."
"Fresenius has set itself the goal of achieving profitable growth 
in 2024."
"Around 400 million people use Fresenius services 
and products every year, whether be this at Helios and 
Quirónsalud clinics or Fresenius Kabi products."
"Fresenius 
strives to improve people’s health and at the same time 
increase the cost effectiveness and efficiency of the health-
care system."
"This will in turn enable the company to 
­
generate lasting value for all stakeholders."
"The Supervisory 
Board supports the strategy of the Management Board."

cantly."
"As a result, the social and healthcare systems of 
many countries are coming under increasing pressure."
"As 
the average age of the population increases, so does the 
number of critically and chronically ill patients.¹ Health is 
thus a critically important factor for the benefit of individu-
als and societies as a whole."
"The extent to which these 
opportunities can be leveraged depends heavily on one fac-
tor: health."
"At Fresenius, we are at the heart of healthcare."
"We offer 
healthcare products and services for critically and chroni-
cally ill individuals, in line with the megatrends of health 
and demographics."
"We improve people’s lives by providing 
high-quality and affordable healthcare."
"In doing so, we con-
sider significant paradigm shifts in the healthcare environ-
ment with regards to biologic products and therapies, tech-
nological change, and new forms of data generation, pro-
cessing, and usage."
"Advancing patient care is always the focus of our activi-
ties."
"Our goal is to expand Fresenius’ position as a leading 
global provider of products, services, and therapies for crit-
ically and chronically ill people."
"At the same time, we want 
to grow profitably and use our capital efficiently, in order to 
create value for our stakeholders and enable us to continue 
investing in better medicine."
"In the fiscal year, we deconsolidated the Fresenius 
Medical Care business segment by changing the legal form 
of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA into a stock cor-
poration."
"Further information can be found in the ""Decon-
solidation of Fresenius Medical Care"" section."
"Fresenius operates in key healthcare areas indispensa-
ble for critically and chronically ill patients."
"We continu-
ously develop our business segments and strive to assume 
leading positions in system-critical healthcare markets and 
segments."
"We orient our portfolio towards healthy, profita-
ble growth, a strong focus on margins and capital returns, 
and the highest ambitions for operational excellence and 
competitiveness."
"At Fresenius, we hold ourselves accountable to the 
highest standards of quality and integrity."
"All of our busi-
ness segments make an overall contribution to increasing 
the quality, affordability, and efficiency of healthcare as 
well as patient satisfaction."
"At the same time, we care for 
our environment by protecting nature and using its re-
sources carefully."
"Fresenius Kabi’s commitment is to improving the qual-
ity of life of its patients."
"The quality and safety of its prod-
ucts and services is thus of paramount importance to 
Fresenius Kabi."
"Fresenius Helios hospitals are characterized by high 
standards of treatment quality, hygiene, patient safety, and 
quality of care."
"Fresenius Vamed bases its quality processes on clearly 
defined and generally established standards."
"At Fresenius, we combine our medical expertise with 
extensive production capacities, and clinical practice with 
technology know-how to continuously improve therapies 
for our patients."
"We will continue building on our strength 
in technology, our competence and quality in patient care, 
and our ability to manufacture cost-effectively."
"Developing 
products and systems that provide a high level of safety 
and user-friendliness and enable tailoring to individual pa-
tient needs is an inherent part of our strategy of sustainable 
and profitable growth."
"Digitalization is play-
ing an increasingly important role -- whether it is in 
healthcare facilities or in production."
"It drives innovative 
technologies and treatment concepts and can contribute to 
solving numerous challenges in the healthcare system (see 
separate Group Non-financial Report p."
"The commitment of our more than 190,000 employees 
worldwide is key for the success and sustained growth of 
Fresenius."
"We firmly believe in a culture of diversity, as we 
are convinced that different perspectives, opinions, experi-
ences, and values enable Fresenius to continue successfully 
growing as a global healthcare company."
"To tackle the upcoming challenges and be able to con-
tinue to grow as a company, attracting new employees is 
key."
"Not only do we try to attract new talent, but also do 
everything we can to retain and develop our employees 
over the long term."
"We offer a variety of flexible working-
time models and incentive programs to ensure that our 
long-term needs for highly qualified employees are met."
"Furthermore, we offer our employees attractive opportuni-
ties to develop their careers in an international and dy-
namic environment."
"EXECUTING SEGMENT STRATEGIES 
The Fresenius Group offers a broad spectrum of system-
critical products and services for the health and quality of 
life of our patients."
"Our business segments hold leading 
positions in key areas of healthcare, and all of them are 
continuing to execute their respective strategic priorities to 
sustain leadership and contribute significantly to the 
benefit of healthcare systems."
"At the level of the Fresenius 
Group, we manage the strategic direction of the Group, and 
orient our portfolio towards value-maximizing business 
areas and maximum patient impact."
"With its Vision 2026, Fresenius Kabi has developed a 
strategic plan to transform the company for the next dec-
ade and to better capture new growth opportunities."
"Fresenius Kabi will continue to focus on high-quality prod-
ucts for critically and chronically ill patients."
"Within this 
clear direction, Fresenius Kabi has defined three growth 
vectors, alongside the strengthening of the resilience of our 
volume businesses (3+1 strategy)."
"The growth vectors are:  
 
► 
the broadening of our biopharmaceutical offering, 
► 
further rollout of clinical nutrition, 
► 
expansion in the MedTech area."
"Fresenius Kabi’s growth strategy was transparently pre-
sented at a Capital Markets Day in May 2023."
"Successful market launches have made Fresenius Kabi the 
leading provider of intravenous lipid nutrition in North 
America."
"This strengthens the global clinical nutrition busi-
ness beyond its solid base in Europe, Latin America, and 
Asia-Pacific."
"Our newly bundled MedTech business has been further 
strengthened by the acquisition of Ivenix."
"With the award-
winning Ivenix infusion system, we are entering the infu-
sion therapy market in the United States."
"The design of the 
Ivenix infusion system is easier to use than conventional 
systems and increases the safety of infusions."
"The pump 
also works seamlessly with other systems."
"In parallel, Fresenius Kabi has continued to build resili-
ence in its volume-driven IV business and is extending the 
portfolio with continued launches in all regions."
"Fresenius Helios wants to further strengthen its posi-
tion as the leading private healthcare service provider in 
Europe."
"Helios Germany will continue to focus its offerings on 
cross-sector healthcare, further specialize hospitals, and co-
ordinate their respective medical service portfolios within 
regional structures."
"In regional competence centers, we are 
already pooling expertise in various specialist areas in order 
to achieve the best treatment results for our patients."
"We intend 
to exploit the growth potential in the outpatient sector by 
linking our medical care centers (MVZs) even more closely 
with hospitals."
"In addition, we will seize the newly created 
regulatory opportunity of daytime inpatient treatment as a 
further form of care."
"We also aim to increase the efficiency 
of our energy consumption in the interests of sustainability 
and climate protection."
"In Spain, we expect demand for hospital and other 
healthcare services to continue to rise."
"We want to continue 
to exploit this potential by building new clinics and expand-
ing existing hospital sites."
"We aim to integrate our diverse 
range of inpatient and outpatient services even better and 
further expand them across the entire network of sites."
"We 
consistently focus on the strategic factors of medical excel-
lence, innovation, and service quality in order to attract pa-
tients."
"Our focus here is on optimal treatment quality as 
well as patient satisfaction."
"In addition, we expect growth 
opportunities from consolidations in the fragmented private 
hospital market."
"Fresenius Helios is constantly advancing its digitaliza-
tion agenda in order to further improve patient care and 
service."
"In addition to the digitalization of our documents 
and internal processes, we will focus even more strongly on 
the digitalization of direct clinical processes and clinical de-
cision support in the future."
"In doing so, we also want to 
make responsible use of the opportunities offered by artifi-
cial intelligence."
"Fresenius Vamed manages projects in the area of inte-
grated healthcare services to support healthcare systems 
more efficiently."
"Fresenius Vamed uses state-of-the-art 
standards such as building information modeling (BIM) in 
the construction of healthcare facilities."
"In operational man-
agement, Fresenius Vamed relies on new concepts, the use 
of innovative technologies, and digitalization measures."
"All 
of this serves to improve medical care and reduce the 
workload of medical staff."
"#FUTUREFRESENIUS 
In the 2023 fiscal year, we advanced our #FutureFresenius 
program in order to transform our Group and position it for 
the coming decades."
"We made great progress in the 2023 
financial year, particularly in the structural progression of 
the Group."
"The healthcare industry has a long runway for growth, 
which will be accelerated by quickly evolving technologies, 
new therapies such as biopharmaceuticals, more and more 
professional steering of patient journeys, and a true digital 
revolution."
"We want Fresenius to be at the forefront of 
these trends and have thus charted our course to continued 
system relevance in our businesses."
"The first step of this journey was a Reset: strengthening 
our return focus, driving structural productivity, and creat-
ing change momentum across the organization."
"With the 
closure of the Reset phase, we are now in the Revitalize 
phase, gearing up for continuous portfolio optimization and 
the pursuit of growth verticals."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the deconsolidation of Fresenius 
Medical Care and targeted divestments sharpened the fo-
cus of the portfolio and achieved structural simplification."
"Clear structures and responsibilities were also defined with 
the initiation of a new operating model."
"This framework 
will enable us to steer and improve performance in a more 
targeted manner in future based on the Fresenius Financial 
Framework."
"Going forward, we want to increasingly orient our port-
folio to three platforms: (Bio)Pharma --
- including clinical 
nutrition, MedTech, and Care Provision."
"With these plat-
forms, we cater to major trends in healthcare and become a 
more therapy-focused company."
"The health and quality of 
life of our patients who we serve with high-quality, afforda-
ble products and services is at the core."
"At the same time, 
our platforms address attractive value pools in healthcare, 
which will provide opportunities for future profitable 
growth."
"We will prioritize growth investments for the healthcare 
products and services of tomorrow in our Operating Com-
panies Fresenius Kabi and Fresenius Helios."
"Within the Fresenius 
Group, we will -- under the operating model initiated in 
2023 -- provide strategic direction, effective governance and 
risk management and provide targeted  services to the ben-
efit of our segments and the overall capital efficiency of the 
Group."
"As announced, Fresenius continued to focus on and pri-
oritize its core business areas in the 2023 fiscal year as part 
of its active portfolio management."
"The resulting significant reduction in the complex-
ity of the corporate structure creates the conditions for 
greater flexibility and more efficient, faster decision-making."
"In February 2023, it was announced that Fresenius in-
tends to deconsolidate Fresenius Medical Care via a change 
of legal form of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA into 
a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft, AG)."
"At the Ex-
traordinary General Meeting of Fresenius Medical Care in 
July 2023, this legal form change was approved by 99% of 
the shareholders."
"At its constituent meeting following the 
Annual General Meeting, the new Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius Medical Care AG elected Michael Sen as its Chair 
and Fresenius CFO Sara Hennicken as Deputy Chair."
"This 
underscores Fresenius’ close ties with Fresenius Medical 
Care and its ongoing commitment to the company."
"Follow-
ing the entry of the conversion in the commercial register 
on November 30, 2023, the change of legal form and the 
associated deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care be-
came effective."
"Following the entry of Fresenius Medical Care’s change of 
legal form in the commercial register on November 30, 2023, 
the investment in Fresenius Medical Care was deconsoli-
dated and subsequently accounted for using the equity 
method in accordance with IAS 28."
"Further information on 
the financial effects of the deconsolidation of Fresenius 
Medical Care can be found in the Results of Operations, Fi-
nancial Position, Assets and Liabilities section (pages 59)."
"STRUCTURAL PRODUCTIVITY 
While fundamentally healthy and geared toward long-term 
growth, our market environment is also characterized by 
strong current macro headwinds that challenge our opera-
tions and increase our cost base."
"With that in mind, we 
have reinvigorated our focus on structural productivity and 
are running corresponding programs in all our business 
segments and at the corporate center."
"Structural productivity improvements are expected to 
offset market headwinds and to create financial flexibility 
for future growth investments in the coming years."
"We have increased the original target of saving around 
€350 million (excluding Fresenius Medical Care) annually 
in sustainable costs at EBIT level from 2025."
"We now plan 
to save around €400 million (excluding Fresenius Medical 
Care) in structural costs at EBIT level from 2025."
"The most 
important elements are process optimization, the reduction 
of sales, administration and procurement costs as well as 
digitalization measures."
"The Group-wide cost and efficiency program is making 
excellent progress."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we increased 
the annual savings achieved since the start of the program 
to around €280 million (excluding Fresenius Medical Care)."
"This significantly exceeded the original target of €200 mil-
lion for 2023."
"One-time costs incurred as part of the pro-
gram amounted to around €221 million (excluding 
Fresenius Medical Care) in the 2023 fiscal year."
"For 2024, Fresenius expects to increase the annual cost 
savings under the cost and efficiency program to €330 to 
350 million 
To achieve the targeted cost savings, additional one-
time costs of around €80 to 100 million are expected at 
EBIT level for the period 2024 to 2025."
"The one-off costs 
will continue to be classified as special items in line with 
previous practice."
"At the same time, a 
far-reaching restructuring program was initiated with the 
clear objective of increasing the company’s profitability."
"The reorganization of the management of Fresenius Vamed 
was announced at the end of June 2023."
"Dr. Michael Moser, 
member of the Fresenius Management Board, is now re-
sponsible for Fresenius Vamed."
"In addition, the control 
function of the Vamed Supervisory Board was strengthened 
by new appointments and the establishment of an Audit 
Committee, consisting of Sara Hennicken as Chair and 
Dr. Michael Moser as Deputy Chair, among others."
"As part of the transformation, Fresenius Vamed has rea-
ligned its project business, particularly in Germany."
"Moreo-
ver, Fresenius Vamed has initiated the withdrawal from 
non-core activities in main non-European markets in the 
service business."
"This will lead to a redimensioning of ac-
tivities and thus to a significantly lower risk profile."
"As a result of this transformation, Fresenius Vamed re-
measured the affected business activities in the 2023 fiscal 
year and recognized special items of €554 million."
"These are attributable in particular to impairments of loans, 
investments, receivables, inventories and orders, restruc-
turing expenses, and the recognition of corresponding pro-
visions."
These special items are largely non-cash items.
"From the 2025 fiscal year, Fresenius Vamed is expected 
to achieve the structural EBIT margin range of 4% to 6% 
specified in the Fresenius Financial Framework."
"CHANGE MOMENTUM 
At Fresenius, our collective actions have always been driven 
by our enormous passion and the strongest possible com-
mitment to patients."
"On our pathway to #FutureFresenius, 
we want to nurture this passion, and combine it with a 
strong appetite for change, preparing us for the dynamic 
shifts in the healthcare industry for the best of our patients."
"As part of #FutureFresenius, we aim to embrace new ways 
of working and establish a culture of excellence, where we 
measure ourselves against the best and maintain trusting di-
alog that welcomes diverse perspectives."
"Throughout our 
company, we engage in such trusting dialog with our em-
ployees, stakeholders, and external partners, and our global 
top leaders are agreed about the need for change."
"We aim 
to continuously pick up the pace of change and improve-
ment and use this momentum to create #FutureFresenius."
"SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM 
For Fresenius, sustainability is an integral part of its busi-
ness model."
"The company is working to establish global 
sustainability standards and continuously improve its own 
sustainability performance."
"To this end, Fresenius contin-
ued to drive forward its ESG (Environment, Social, Govern-
ance) initiatives in fiscal year 2023."
"The company aims to be climate-neutral by 2040 and to re-
duce 50% of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 
2030 compared to 2020 levels."
"Fresenius will continuously 
assess Scope 3 emission impacts for inclusion in our tar-
gets."
"Further information on our sustainability organization 
and the measures taken in the 2023 fiscal year can be 
found in the Non-financial Group Report starting on 
page 107 of this Annual Report."
"CORPORATE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
The Management Board makes strategic and operational 
management decisions based on our Group-wide perfor-
mance indicators for growth, profitability, liquidity, capital 
efficiency, and capital management."
"The most important fi-
nancial performance indicators for us are explained below 
and a definition is provided in the glossary of financial 
terms on pages 376 to 378."
"As part of the Fresenius Financial Framework, we have 
defined ambition levels (growth bands, among others EBIT 
margin) for the business segments."
"These serve as an am-
bition level for the internal management of our business 
sectors and are benchmarked against leading competitors."
"The key figures for the financial performance indicators 
for 2024 of the Group and the business segments can be 
found in the Outlook section on pages 84 f."
"GROWTH 
For Fresenius, currency-adjusted revenue growth, in partic-
ular organic revenue growth in the Group and in the busi-
ness segments, is of central importance for managing reve-
nue growth."
"It shows the growth of our business that 
comes from our own resources and not from acquisitions, 
divestitures, or currency translation and hyperinflation ef-
fects."
"Currency translation effects are the difference be-
tween revenue in the reporting period at the exchange 
rates of the reporting period, less revenues in the reporting 
period at the exchange rates of the comparative period."
"A 
portfolio effect takes place in the case of an acquisition or 
divestment."
"Any portfolio effect is excluded for 12 months 
after the end of the relevant transaction in the reporting or 
comparative period, after which both current and prior pe-
riods fully reflect the portfolio change."
"In the Fresenius Financial Framework, organic revenue 
growth represents the key performance indicator for the 
Group’s growth and that of the business segments."
"With 
the Fresenius Financial Framework, we have defined an-
nual organic revenue growth ranges (ambition levels) for 
the Operating Companies."
"AMBITION LEVEL OF ANNUAL ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH 
OPERATING COMPANIES 
  
Organic

"Fresenius Kabi 
  
4--7% 
Fresenius Helios 
  
3--5% 
 
PROFITABILITY 
At Group level, we primarily use earnings before interest 
and taxes (EBIT) and EBIT growth in constant currency."
"As part of the new Fresenius Financial Framework, we 
have defined annual margin bands (ambition levels) for the 
business segments."
"These serve as an ambition level for the 
internal management of our business sectors and are 
benchmarked against leading competitors."
"The annual 
EBIT margin is defined as earnings before interest and 
taxes divided by revenue."
"To improve comparability of operating performance 
over several periods, the earnings figure is adjusted for 
special items where necessary."
"AMBITION LEVEL OF ANNUAL EBIT MARGIN BANDS 
 
  
EBIT 
margin 
bands p.a."
"CCR is 
defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow (cash flow 
before acquisitions and dividends; before interest, tax, 
and special items) to operating income (EBIT) before 
special items."
"This allows us to assess our ability to gen-
erate cash and pay dividends, among other things."
"The 
ambition level for the CCR is around 1.0, considering the 
growth profile of the respective year."
"With the Fresenius Financial Framework, Fresenius 
aims to generate attractive and predictable dividend 
yields."
"In line with its progressive dividend policy, the 
Company aims to increase the dividend in line with earn-
ings per share growth (before special items, in constant 
currency), but at least maintain the dividend at the prior-
year’s level."
"Notwithstanding the legally required suspension of divi-
dend payments for fiscal year 2023, Fresenius maintains its 
dividend policy for the future."
"CAPITAL EFFICIENCY 
We work as profitably and efficiently as possible with the 
capital provided to us by shareholders and lenders."
"Under the Fresenius Financial Framework, the Group’s 
capital efficiency is managed on the basis of return on in-
vested capital (ROIC)."
"This serves as an ambition level for 
the internal management of our Group."
"We aim to achieve 
a ROIC of between 6% and 8%."
"An overview of the return 
on invested capital by business area can be found in the 
Group Management Report on page 78."
"CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
We use the ratio of net debt and EBITDA as the key param-
eter for managing the capital structure."
"This measure indi-
cates the degree to which a company is able to meet its 
payment obligations."
"Our business segments usually hold 
leading positions in growing and mostly non-cyclical mar-
kets."
"Since the majority of our customers are of high credit 
quality, they generate mainly stable, predictable cash flows."
"According to the management assessment, the Group is 
therefore able to use debt to finance its growth to a greater 
extent than companies in other industries."
"The self-imposed target corridor for the leverage ratio 
remains unchanged at 3.0× to 3.5×."
"The KPIs 
cover the key sustainability topics of medical quality / pa-
tient satisfaction and employees."
"An additional ESG compo-
nent is included in the long-term remuneration of the Man-
agement Board, as explained in the Remuneration Report 
on page 234."
"The topic of employees is measured with the key figure 
of the Employee Engagement Index (EEI) for the 
Fresenius Group."
"The indicator measures how positively 
employees identify with their employer, how committed 
they feel, and how engaged they are at work."
"The index is 
the weighted average of engagement scores derived from a 
business segment’s entities included in the survey."
"The EEI 
is measured within the range of 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 
(strongly agree."
"For the 2024 fiscal year, Fresenius is targeting an EEI of 
4.33 (corresponds to 100% target achievement)."
"The Medical Quality / Patient Satisfaction topic is 
made up of equally weighted key performance indicators 
defined at business segment level."
"The three key figures 
are based on their respective materiality for the business 
model."
"The 
score shows how many deviations were identified on 
average during the inspections and audits considered 
(scale >0)."
"For the 2024 fiscal year, Fresenius Kabi is targeting an 
Audit & Inspection Score of no more than 2.3 (100% target 
achievement)."
"The Inpatient Quality Indicator at Fresenius Helios 
comprises the measurement of a set of standardized inpa-
tient quality indicators (G-IQI/E-IQI)."
"These are based on 
routinely collected hospital billing data from hospital infor-
mation systems."
"The number of indicators achieved com-
pared to the total number of indicators is calculated to 
measure the overall success rate."
"There is individual target setting and measurement of 
target achievement in the two Helios segments Helios Ger-
many and Helios Spain."
"Subsequently, target achievement 
is consolidated at Helios company level with equal 
weighting (50% each) for Executive Board compensation."
"The Inpatient Quality Indicator is measured on a scale of 
0% to 100%."
"For the 2024 fiscal year, Helios Germany is targeting an 
Inpatient Quality Indicator (G-IQI) score of at least 88% 
(100% target achievement); an Inpatient Quality Indicator 
(E-IQI) score of at least 55% (100% target achievement) is 
targeted for Helios Spain."
"The differences in the values be-
tween the two countries are a result of the adaptation of 
quality measurement to the German standard in Spain, 
which was then gradually rolled out in the clinics."
"Fresenius Vamed measures the level of patient satisfaction 
in its healthcare facilities in a continuous and structured 
process."
"At or immediately after the point of discharge, 
each patient receives a questionnaire, which contains at 
least 16 standardized questions that are evaluated for the 
patient satisfaction target."
"Patient satisfaction is measured 
on a scale from 1 (very satisfied) to 5 (not satisfied)."
"Fresenius Vamed aims to achieve a patient satisfaction 
rating of at least 1.57 in the 2024 fiscal year (100% target 
achievement)."
"Further information on our sustainability program can be 
found in the separate Group Non-financial Report starting 
on page 107 and in the Compensation Report starting on 
page 233."
"Our invest-
ments and acquisitions are carried out based on a detailed 
coordination and evaluation process."
"As a first step, the 
Management Board sets the Group’s investment targets 
and the budget based on investment proposals."
"In the next 
step, the respective business segments and the internal Ac-
quisition & Investment Council (AIC) determine the pro-
posed projects and measures, taking into account the over-
all strategy, the total investment budget, and the required 
and potential return on investment."
"We evaluate investment 
projects based on commonly used methods, such as inter-
nal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV)."
"Within 
the framework of the due diligence process, opportunities 
and risks associated with the potential acquisition target 
are analyzed and assessed."
"To this end, we review the busi-
ness model, the key financial figures and tax issues, and 
the resulting company valuation."
"In addition, we compre-
hensively analyze the market and competitive environment, 
the regulatory framework, and the legal aspects."
"The audit 
also covers various issues relating to compliance, produc-
tion, research and development, quality, information tech-
nology, human resources, and the environment."
"Based on 
investment volume, a project is submitted for approval to 
the executive committees or respective managements of 
the business segments, to the Group Management Board of 
Fresenius Management SE, and / or, if applicable, also addi-
tionally for the consent of its Supervisory Board."
"You can find more details on our key performance indica-
tors in our interactive tool on our website at  
www.fresenius.com/interactive-tool."
"Growth rates are based on the assumptions of the respective 
annual forecasts and are adjusted for special items and, if applicable, other effects affecting the underlying growth (adjustments to new accounting standards, acquisitions / divestments,  
acquisition costs, or cost-saving programs)."

"Our products are used where 
the patient is most at risk: in emergency medicine, inten-
sive care, special care, and for those who need to be 
treated in hospital or as an outpatient for a longer period of 
time."
"In these patient groups, every single step is essential 
for the success of the therapy."
"Products of Fresenius Kabi 
make a crucial contribution to the success of the treatment 
and the interaction between medicine and technology is 
highly important."
"We consider it our task to develop products that help to

ture development work will be geared toward this."
"Our development expertise includes all related compo-
nents, such as the drug-active pharmaceutical ingredients 
and raw materials, the pharmaceutical formulation, the pri-
mary packaging, the medical device needed for application 
of drugs and infusions, and the production technology."
"In the biopharmaceutical area, our currently expanding 
and highly attractive product pipeline of biosimilars in-
cludes a range of commercialized medicines and molecules 
in various development stages."
"Predominantly targeting ar-
eas of immunology and oncology, we are committed to 
providing access to biologics for more patients and 
healthcare providers around the world."
"Our high-quality, 
effective, and safe therapies offer solutions for patients and 
healthcare professionals and contribute significantly to the 
care and quality of life of patients."
"With the 55% majority stake acquisition in mAbxience 
in 2022, we diversified our biosimilars pipeline, vertically 
expanded our research & development and manufacturing

opment center for biosimilars in Eysins, Switzerland, where 
new biosimilars for the treatment of autoimmune and onco-
logical diseases are developed in state-of-the-art develop-
ment and research laboratories."
"The state-of-the art mAbx-
ience GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) research & de-
velopment laboratories are based in Europe (Léon, Spain) 
and South America (Garín and Munro, Argentina)."
"Our 
R & D centers with cutting-edge technology include small-
scale facilities and pilot plants focused on process optimi-
zation, clinical batches and new technologies."
"A biosimilar is a biological product that is similar to an-
other approved biological product called the reference 
product."
"The biosimilar product demonstrates a similar an-
alytical profile, similar pharmacokinetic and comparable ef-
ficacy, safety, and immunogenicity to the reference prod-
uct."
"We apply the same high-quality standards to our bio-
similar products throughout the entire value chain, from re-
search, development, and manufacturing to commercializa-
tion, as are required for the reference product."
"The adop-
tion and uptake of biosimilars has been growing considera-
bly worldwide and more and more patients are being 
treated with high-quality biologic drugs."
"In July of the re-
porting year, IDACIO® was launched in the United States, 
as well as in Paraguay and Latvia."
"We will continue to work 
toward providing access to more patients in additional mar-
kets globally."
"Our second biosimilar, Stimufend®2, a pegfilgrastim bi-
osimilar used to treat patients who experience neutropenia 
following chemotherapy, was launched in the United States 
in February 2023 following approval from the U.S."
"Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2022."
"Stimufend® was already launched in France in the last 
quarter of 2022."
"Our third biosimilar, Tyenne®3, was launched in the Eu-
ropean Union (EU) in November 2023 and is the first tocili-
zumab biosimilar to receive approval and be made available 
in the EU."
"Commercial activities for Tyenne® have been on-
going in six European countries since November 2023."

"This collaboration marks a 
historic milestone in the production of biopharmaceuticals 
in Türkiye, specifically focusing on a crucial cancer drug."
"Fresenius Kabi is a leading provider of clinical nutrition 
products as well as related medical-technical products and 
disposables for administering these products."
"Clinical nutri-
tion provides care for patients who cannot nourish them-
selves normally or sufficiently."
"This includes, for example, 
patients in intensive care and those who are seriously or 
chronically ill."
"There are two types of clinical nutrition therapy: paren-
teral nutrition and enteral nutrition."
"Parenteral nutrition is 
administered intravenously when the intestinal function is 
impaired."
"This is necessary if the condition of a patient 
does not allow them to absorb and metabolize essential nu-
trients orally or as sip and tube feed in a sufficient quantity."
"Enteral nutrition is administered in the form of a sip or tube 
feed using the gastrointestinal tract."
"Fresenius Kabi is one 
of the few companies worldwide to offer both forms of clin-
ical nutrition."
"Clinical nutrition provides care for patients who cannot 
nourish themselves normally or sufficiently."
"This includes, 
for example, patients in intensive care units (ICU) and 
those who are critically or chronically ill."
"Early and ade-
quate intervention can help prevent malnutrition and its 
consequences."
"Malnutrition is a common problem in hospitalized pa-
tients: studies carried out in Europe show that one in four 
patients in the hospital suffers from malnutrition or is at 
risk of malnutrition."
"The clinical significance of malnutri-
tion results from a less favorable prognosis in terms of mor-
bidity and mortality."
"Further consequences can be a longer 
stay in the hospital and higher associated treatment costs."
"In 2023, we continued our development work on paren-
teral nutrition products."
"We are concentrating on formula-
tions that are tailored to the needs of individual patient 
groups."
"In addition to our global development projects, we 
work on parenteral nutrition products for specific markets 
and regions such as the United States, China, and Europe."
"The use of fish oil in parenteral nutrition continues to 
be a focus area."
"Parenteral nutrition containing fish oil has 
numerous beneficial effects on important biological func-
tions, including the modulation of the immune and inflam-
matory response."
"The use of fish oil in parenteral nutrition 
products may help to improve clinical outcomes and 
shorten ICU and hospital length of stay."
"In the area of enteral nutrition, we are focusing our re-
search and development activities on product concepts that 
support therapeutic compliance and thus the success of 
therapy."
"In particular, the flavor of enteral products is 
known to be a critical parameter in ensuring the ac-
ceptance of the products and compliance with the nutri-
tional therapy."
"With 
the launch of the Fresubin plant-based drink, we have ex-
panded our range of plant-based products as a response to 
customers’ demands and preference."
"Another focus of our 
work is on the development of products with an increased 
calorie and protein concentration."
"This way, we make it 
easier for the user to take in the necessary amount of nutri-
ents in small volumes."
"In addition to global product devel-
opments, we are continuing to work on product develop-
ments for specific market requirements."
"Medical devices are used for the administration of 
pharmaceuticals and include infusion and nutrition pumps, 
infusion management systems, anesthesia monitoring, as 
well as disposables, including infusion sets, extension lines, 
enteral nutrition tubes, and monitoring electrodes."
"A spe-
cific range of these products is designed for pediatric use."
"In the area of medical devices, we focus on developing 
new products as well as on further developing our existing 
portfolio."
"This industry in particular is characterized by 
technological innovations."
"Digitalization is a more crucial 
factor here than in any of our other product segments."
"De-
vices not only have to be continuously developed in terms 
of their application, but they also have to increasingly be 
embedded in the IT system landscape of hospitals, blood 
donation centers, and plasma centers."
"In the future, we 
want to benefit from this trend and are already focusing on 
the continuous development of our software solutions to in-
crease efficiency and benefit for our customers."
"We also continued the development work on our new 
infusion management system Exelia in the reporting year."
"This system features a modern operating system and will 
enable new therapy and treatment procedures in the inten-
sive care unit and operating room."
"Fresenius Kabi will con-
tinue to develop the Exelia system further to continuously 
meet the advancing demands in the area of application."
"In the reporting year, we continued to develop the Vigi-
lant Software Suite, a software solution for our Agilia family 
of infusion pumps in hospitals."
"In research and development in the area of transfusion 
technology, we are working intensively on products for use 
in cell therapy."
"Our focus is on product developments for 
the automated washing and concentration of cell concen-
trates."
"These products are used in CAR T-cell¹ and similar 
cell therapies."
"In 2023, we worked on software enhance-
ments for our cell therapy products LOVO¹ and CUE¹."
"In 
the area of our plasma donation product Aurora Xi, we are 
working on a software solution and the associated clinical 
study to further increase the plasma yield and efficiency 
per donor."
"In the area of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), we 
continue to focus on the introduction of the Amicus Blue 
system and the associated Phelix light box in Europe, as 
well as on the further development of an ECP application 
method, which only requires one vascular access."
"In this 
therapy method, certain blood cells outside the body are 
treated with ultraviolet light (phototherapy)."
"This method is 
used to treat various immunological diseases, including to 
kill malignant immune cells (lymphocytes) outside the 
body."
"Fresenius Kabi offers a broad range of intravenously 
administered generic drugs across a wide array of thera-
peutic categories: oncology drugs, anesthetics & analgesics, 
anti-infectives, and critical-care drugs."
"Fresenius Kabi pro-
vides the related devices for the administration of these 
products."
"The portfolio is geared towards the treatment of 
and care for chronically and critically ill patients."
"Fresenius 
Kabi has a global network of production centers."
"Fresenius 
Kabi manufactures finished medicines in its own plants 
and, at some sites, also produces active pharmaceutical in-
gredients (API)."
"Fresenius Kabi’s investments aim, among 
other things, to continuously modernize and automate the 
production processes at its plants."
"In the area of generic IV drugs, we are continuously 
working on the extension of our product portfolio."
"For ex-
ample, in the reporting year, we launched the drug Zinc 
Sulfate for which one of the stock-keeping units was 
granted CGT (Competitive Generic Therapy) designation."
"Furthermore, we launched the cardiovascular drug Vaso-
pressin in single dose vials."
"In Europe, we brought Sugam-
madex (reversal agent for neuromuscular block) onto the 
market on day one after patent expiry."
"1 For more information, see the glossary on page 374."
"For example, we 
are developing IV drugs with new formulations and dosage 
forms, as well as improved primary packaging."
"In 2023, we 
had more than 100 active generic drug projects."
"In addition, we are constantly working 
on product improvements that bring additional benefits to 
both medical personnel and patients."
"For example, we de-
velop ready-to-use products that are especially convenient 
and safe and help to prevent application errors in day-to-
day medical care."
"These include ready-to-use solutions in 
our freeflex infusion bags, the cost-effective KabiPac infu-
sion bottle, and pre-filled syringes."
"Drugs in pre-filled sy-
ringes are easier and safer to use than traditional applica-
tions."
"In the reporting year, we launched Diazepam and 
Fentanyl in pre-filled syringes in the United States."
"In Eu-
rope, we launched, among others, Ondansetron, an antie-
menic drug, as a ready-to-use solution in KabiPac."
"To improve drug safety, Fresenius Kabi is implementing a 
global program to introduce data matrix barcodes on our 
generic drugs."
"This initiative is intended to prevent errors 
in the manual entry of drug information in data manage-
ment systems, e.g., of hospitals."
"Within infusion solutions, Fresenius Kabi offers prod-
ucts for fluid and blood volume replacement."
"Moreover, 
Fresenius Kabi’s product portfolio includes a broad range 
of infusion technologies as well as disposables for the deliv-
ery of medication for all pharmaceuticals administered via 
the vein."
"Fresenius Kabi provides a wide range of infusion ther-
apy products, including the following: basic infusion solu-
tions, which consist primarily of salts (electrolytes), carbo-
hydrates, and water."
"They are infused when the body water 
content or electrolyte balance is impaired, as well as in 
acute need of energy supply and a lack of salt or specific 
minerals."
"They also serve as carrier solutions for intrave-
nously administered drugs."
"In addition, Fresenius Kabi of-
fers a comprehensive range of products in infusion bags 
and bottles, such as freeflex PVC-free infusion bags and 
KabiPac plastic bottles."
"Furthermore, Fresenius Kabi manufactures blood vol-
ume substitution solutions that include hydroxyethyl starch 
derived from waxy maize."
"Artificial blood volume replace-
ment products (colloids) are often used to treat patients 
suffering from hemodynamic instability due to acute blood 
losses, e.g., resulting from an accident or during surgery."
"Fresenius Kabi also provides medical-technical equip-
ment and disposables, such as cannulas, tubes, and pumps 
for administering infusion solutions."
"In the area of infusion solutions, as in past years, we have 
focused our development activities on improving and devel-
oping new container technologies to improve the daily 
work routine and safety of healthcare professionals."
"Our 
portfolio extension to the U.S."
"market is advancing, as we 
are in the last stages of preparing the introduction of our 
product offering for infusion solutions, which was specifi-
cally designed for this key market."
"For this reason, 
Fresenius values a culture of diversity."
"The interplay of a 
wide range of views, opinions, cultural backgrounds, expe-
riences, and values enables us to successfully exploit our 
potential as a global company."
"The number of employees increased slightly and 
amounted to 193,865 at the end of 2023."
"Personnel ex-
penses for the Fresenius Group were €9,930 million in 
2023 (2022: €9,439 million), equivalent to 45% of revenue 
(2022: 44%)."
"Personnel expenses per employee, based on 
the average number of employees, were €52 thousand 
(2022: €50 thousand) and €53 thousand in constant cur-
rency."
"In Germany, Fresenius companies have signed tariff 
agreements with IG BCE, Marburger Bund, and ver.di (la-
bor union for services)."

"EMPLOYEE RECRUITMENT AND PERSONNEL 
DEVELOPMENT 
In order to meet our need for highly qualified employees in 
the long term and attract new employees, we rely on tar-
geted HR marketing activities."
"For example, we cooperate 
with universities for a variety of formats, have our own HR 
channels on the most important social media platforms for 
our target groups, and have launched an ambassador pro-
gram for all Fresenius employees (Fresenius Ambassadors)."
"In addition, we try to retain our employees in the long 
term by offering attractive development opportunities and 
making internal development opportunities transparently 
available to all employees through an attractive, cross-divi-
sional internal job exchange (stayFresenius)."
"The development and implementation of concepts and 
measures for recruiting and promoting staff will be aligned 
with the market requirements of the respective segments 
and will be more standardized in the future."
"A cross-divi-
sional approach is being pursued in order to ensure a more 
coherent and effective strategy."
"We select applicants solely 
on the basis of their qualifications and experience."
"We aim 
to ensure that all people with comparable aptitude have the 
same career opportunities at Fresenius, regardless of gen-
der, age, origin, nationality, religion, disability, sexual iden-
tity and orientation, or other characteristics."
"The proportion of female employees in the Fresenius Group 
was 68% as of December 31, 2023 (Dec."
"The proportion of females in services or care is traditionally 
higher than in the area of production."
"This is reflected in 
the proportion of female employees in our business seg-
ments: our business segment Fresenius Helios has, with 
75%, the highest proportion of female employees within 
the Group."
"The number of female participants in the Group-
wide Long Term Incentive Plan (Long-Term Incentive Plan 
2023 -- LTIP) is a good indication of the share of women in 
management positions."
"According to this, the ratio of 
women among these 501 top executives was 27% as at De-
cember 31, 2023 (Dec."
"31, 2022: 28% of 522 top execu-
tives)."

"CHANGES TO THE SUPERVISORY BOARD 
With the registration of the legal form change of Fresenius 
Medical Care AG, Stefanie Balling left the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA as of November 30, 
2023."
"She was succeeded by Holger Michel, who had al-
ready been appointed at the constituent meeting of the Eu-
ropean Works Council of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA on April 
29, 2021, as a personal substitute member for Ms."
"Balling, 
and thus succeeded her without election."
"CHANGES TO THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
Dr. Michael Moser has been a member of the Fresenius 
Management Board since July 1, 2023, responsible for Le-
gal, Compliance, Risk Management, ESG, and for the 
Fresenius Vamed business segment."
"Since December 1, 
2023, he has also been responsible for Human Resources, 
which he took over from Dr. Sebastian Biedenkopf."
"Dr. Sebastian Biedenkopf stepped down from the 
Fresenius Management Board upon expiry of his Manage-
ment Board appointment on November 30, 2023."
"Dr. Ernst 
Wastler, previously responsible for Fresenius Vamed, 
stepped down as Chairman of the VAMED Management 
Board and thus also from the Fresenius Management Board 
upon reaching retirement age on July 18, 2023."
"On September 8, 2023, Fresenius announced that the 
Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE had ap-
pointed Robert Möller as a member of the Management 
Board with immediate effect."
"At the same time, Robert Möl-
ler took over as Chairman of the Management Board of  
Helios Health GmbH."
"He succeeded Dr. Francesco De Meo, 
who has left the company."
"Following the successful deconsolidation of Fresenius 
Medical Care, Helen Giza left the Management Board on 
November 30, 2023."
"The #FutureFresenius strategy, with its realignment of 
the business segments into Operating and Investment Com-
panies, is thus also reflected in the composition of the 
Fresenius Management Board."
"Therefore, the investment 
companies are no longer represented by a separate mem-
ber of the Management Board."
"The CVs of the members of the Supervisory Board and 
the Management Board can be found on our website at 
https://www.fresenius.com/Corporate-Management."
"An efficient value chain is important for 
our profitability."
"In an environment characterized by ongo-
ing cost-containment pressure from health insurers, as well 
as price pressure, security and quality of supply play an im-
portant role."
"Within each business segment of the 
Fresenius Group, procurement processes are coordinated 
centrally, enabling us to bundle similar requirements, ne-
gotiate global framework agreements, constantly monitor 
market and price trends, and ensure the safety and quality 
of materials."
"Further information on supply chain at Fresenius can be 
found in our Opportunities and Risk Report on page 96."
"and in our separate Group Non-financial Report on 
pages 183."
"All processes are subject to the highest quality and 
safety standards, for the benefit of the patients and to pro-
tect our employees."
"RESPONSIBILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL 
MANAGEMENT, SUSTAINABILITY 
We orient our activities within the Fresenius Group to long-
term goals, and thus ensure that our work is aligned to the 
needs of patients and employees, as well as shareholders 
and business partners, in a sustainable manner."
"Our re-
sponsibility as a healthcare Group goes beyond our busi-
ness operations."
"It is our mission to constantly improve our 
performance in the areas of environmental protection, oc-
cupational health and technical safety, and product respon-
sibility and logistics, and to comply with legal require-
ments."
"Further information on our sustainability management 
can be found in our separate Group Non-financial Report 
on pages 103 of our Annual Report."
"Thanks to 
strong private consumption and resilient labor markets, it 
reached 3.3% according to current estimates."
"Global eco-
nomic activity was supported by emerging markets, includ-
ing China, and, among the industrialized countries, by the 
United States in particular."
"The latest data provides mixed 
signals for the major economies."
"While real GDP growth in 
the third quarter of 2023 increased in both China and the 
United States, it remained unchanged in other industrial-
ized countries due to continued high inflation and its im-
pact on economic activity and consumption."
"While consumer behavior continued to normalize after 
the pandemic, global trade growth in 2023 remained com-
paratively weak at 1.1% according to current estimates, 
but already showed signs of improvement in the latter part 
of the year."
"The overall weak trade was due to less trade-
friendly growth in the global economy, with consumption 
accounting for a larger share of domestic demand and 
emerging markets making a greater contribution."
"In addi-
tion, trade growth in the reporting year was also slowed by 
the recovery in the consumption of services as a result of 
the complete lifting of COVID-19 restrictions."
"Global inflation, measured on the basis of the global con-
sumer price index (CPI), continued to fall over the course of 
the year."
"This development was supported by lower energy 
and food prices -- while core inflation remained high."
"In the 
member states of the Organization for Economic Co-opera-
tion and Development (OECD), CPI inflation fell to 5.6% in 
October 2023."
"Global financing conditions initially fluctuated in 2023, 
but ultimately showed a slight improvement in the industri-
alized countries after inflation remained slightly below ex-
pectations in several economies."
"In addition, some central 
banks had recently become more cautious with regard to 
the question of whether further interest rate hikes were 
necessary."
"HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY 
The healthcare sector is one of the world’s largest indus-
tries and we are convinced that it demonstrates excellent 
growth opportunities."
"In the emerging countries, additional drivers are: 
 
► 
expanding availability and correspondingly greater de-
mand for basic healthcare, and  
► 
increasing national incomes and hence higher spend-
ing on healthcare."
"The de-
cline in the share compared to 2021 reflects lower spend-
ing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic on the one hand 
and the impact of rising inflation on the other, which re-
duces the value of healthcare spending."
"Despite these fac-
tors, the average share of healthcare expenditure in na-
tional income in OECD countries was still significantly 
higher in 2022 than before the pandemic (2019: 8.8%)."
"The United States recorded the highest expenditure per 
capita with an estimated US$12,555 in 2022 (2021: 
US$12,197)."
"Based on current estimates, Germany ranks 
third in the OECD country comparison with US$8,011 in 
2022 (2021: US$7,518)."
"On average, the OECD countries fi-
nanced 76% of their healthcare expenditure from public 
funds in 2022."
"In Germany, this share was 87% in 2022 ac-
cording to current OECD estimates (2021: 86%)."
"Average life expectancy has risen in most OECD coun-
tries in recent decades."
"In 2021, it averaged 80.3 years 
(2020: 80.6 years)."
"The reasons for this are better living 
conditions, more intensive healthcare, and advances in 
medical care."
"In order to limit the constantly rising expenditure in 
the healthcare system, cost bearers are increasingly re-
viewing care structures to identify potential savings."
"How-
ever, rationalization alone cannot compensate for the rise 
in costs."
"For this reason, market-based incentives for cost- 
and quality-conscious action in the healthcare sector 
should also be created."
"In this way, treatment costs can be 
reduced by improving the overall quality of care."
"As a result, prevention programs are becoming just as im-
portant as innovative remuneration models that are linked 
to the quality of treatment."
"The digitalization of the 
healthcare system in particular can also contribute to im-
proved patient care and greater cost efficiency."
"HEALTHCARE SPENDING AS % OF GDP

"The acquisition of a majority stake in mAbxience sig-
nificantly strengthens Fresenius Kabi in this growth mar-
ket, in which the company participates through biosimilars 
and contract development and manufacturing of biophar-
maceuticals."
"The market for biopharmaceuticals is a fast-
growing and innovative segment, which will gain even 
more relevance for the care of patients going forward."
"Competitors in the biosimilars market for biopharmaceuti-
cals include Sandoz, Biocon, Coherus, Alvotech, and Teva."
"In 2023, the global clinical nutrition market reached a 
size of approximately €11 billion."
"Within Europe, the mar-
ket experienced growth of around 4%, while emerging 
market regions exhibited even higher growth rates."
"Latin 
America2 saw a 14% increase in the clinical nutrition mar-
ket, and Southeast Asia similarly demonstrated robust 
growth at approximately 10%."
"Despite these positive 
trends, there remains substantial additional global growth 
potential, as nutrition therapies are underutilized in patient 
care, despite established medical and economic benefits 
proven by studies."
"Clinical nutrition administration, particu-
larly in cases of health- or age-related nutritional deficien-
cies, has the potential to reduce hospital costs through 
shorter stays."
"Fresenius Kabi, as a prominent player in en-
teral nutrition and the leading provider of parenteral nutri-
tion, aims to capitalize on this growth potential."
"The com-
pany plans to introduce its clinical nutrition offerings in 
countries where it currently lacks a comprehensive range."
"By expanding its product portfolio and leveraging new dis-
tribution channels, Fresenius Kabi is poised to enhance its 
global presence."
"Competitors in the global parenteral nutrition market 
include Baxter and B."
"In the enteral nutrition mar-
ket, Fresenius Kabi competes with Abbott, Nestlé, and Da-
none, among others."
"The market for de-
vices and related dedicated disposables is estimated to be 
around €5 billion with a growth rate of 4%."
"There is a sig-
nificant further market for non-dedicated disposables."
"The 
MedTech INS product range will be developed regionally 
and thus be available in more countries, particularly in the 
United States with the acquisition of Ivenix."
"In the 
MedTech INS segment, Fresenius Kabi ranks among the 
leading suppliers worldwide."
"Competitors in the market for 
medical technology products include Baxter, B."
"Braun, 
Becton Dickinson, and ICU Medical."
"The market for MedTech Transfusion Medicine and Cell 
Therapies (TCT) grew by around 4% to about €4 billion."
"Fresenius Kabi is the leading company in the market for 
blood collections, which has recovered slightly compared 
to the previous year."
"Increased demand for plasma-derived 
therapies and autotransfusion treatments has resulted in at-
tractive market growth; Fresenius Kabi holds top-three po-
sitions in both markets."
"Due to newly approved treatments, 
the cell and gene therapies segment is the fastest-growing 
market within TCT."
"With the continued success of Lovo, 
now used in two of the six FDA-approved CAR-T therapies 
and in one of all the remaining approved cell therapies (not 
specific to CAR-T) in the United States, our cell therapies 
business grew compared to the previous year."
"Competitors 
in the transfusion technology market include Terumo, Hae-
monetics, and Macopharma."
"In 2023, the global market for generic IV drugs and IV 
fluids was around €50 billion3."
"With significant regional 
differences, the market generated low- to mid-single digit 
growth."
"Fresenius Kabi was able to enter additional seg-
ments of the global addressable market due to the expan-
sion of our product portfolio in the areas of complex formu-
lations, differentiated generics, and prefilled syringes, 
among others."
"Fresenius Kabi’s competitors in the market 
for generic IV drugs include Pfizer, Sanofi, Sandoz, Viatris, 
and Hikma."
"Competitors in the market for infusion thera-
pies include B."
1 Market data is based on company research and refers to the markets relevant for Fresenius Kabi.
"This is subject to annual volatility due to currency fluctuations and  
patent expiries of original drugs in the IV drug market, among other things."
"2 Due to hyperinflation in Argentina, market growth is presented excluding Argentina."
"3 As in the previous year, the market definition also includes revenue of off-patent products."
"Of this, around 61% was attributable 
to personnel costs and 38% to material costs, which in-
creased by around 6% and 4% respectively."
"Based on the number of admissions, Helios Germany is 
the leading company in the German market for acute hospi-
tals with a market share of around 6%3."
"The Helios clinics 
mainly compete with individual hospitals or local and re-
gional clinic associations."
"Private competitors include As-
klepios Kliniken, Sana Kliniken, and Rhön-Klinikum."
"The number of inpatient treatment cases in German 
hospitals rose again in 2022 for the first time since the start 
of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"In total, 16.8 million cases 
were treated."
"Nevertheless, the figure was around 13% be-
low the pre-pandemic year 2019."
"The increase in the remuneration of hospital services 
in the German flat rate per case billing system (DRG sys-
tem) is based on what is known as the change value 
(‘‘Veränderungswert’’)."
It is calculated on an annual basis.
"For 2023, the change value was 4.32% (2022: 2.32%)."
"The flat rates per case are used to determine the reim-
bursement of inpatients."
"The related nursing staff costs per 
case at the bedside have been carved out from the flat rates 
since 2020."
"The nursing staff costs are reimbursed in full 
based on the actual costs incurred by the care budget 
which is individually negotiated separately by the contrac-
tual partners as part of the overall budget negotiations."
"Compared to the previous year, the economic situation of 
German hospitals has deteriorated."
"54% of German hospi-
tals posted losses in 2022 (2021: 43%)."
"The proportion of 
hospitals with an annual surplus was only 35% (2021: 
44%)."
"The main reason for the deteriorating economic sit-
uation is the inflation-related general cost increases."
"To provide financial support, hospitals in Germany 
were supplied with compensation and reimbursement 
amounts from the liquidity reserve of the healthcare fund 
for inflation-related additional costs in 2023."
"To determine 
the amount of the reimbursement, hospitals report the di-
rect costs for the purchase of natural gas and electricity to 
the hospital planning authorities."
"For comparison, the en-
ergy discounts for the month of March 2022 are used."
"The 
financial support, which also extends to 2024, amounts to a 
total of €1.5 billion in hospital-specific reimbursement 
amounts and €4.5 billion in flat-rate compensation pay-
ments based on the number of beds (indirect costs)."
"The 
German Hospital Institute (DKI) estimates that the annual 
investment requirements of German hospitals amount to 
about €7 billion."
"The central topic in the German hospital sector in 2023 
was the planned hospital structure reform."
"The aim of the 
reform is to fundamentally reshape the hospital landscape 
in Germany."
"The current system of purely volume-based re-
muneration via flat rates per case is to be changed."
"The 
plan is to limit remuneration based on flat rates per case to 
40%."
"In future, an average of 60% of the remuneration is 
to be distributed independently of performance via what 
are known as maintenance flat rates (including the care 
budget)."
"The maintenance funding is to be linked to performance 
groups that are allocated to the individual hospitals by the 
federal states and which require compliance with defined 
criteria."
"Among other things, this is intended to ensure that 
complex treatments may only be carried out in hospitals 
that have the appropriate personnel and technical equip-
ment."
"Depending on the performance group and with that, 
its relevance, hospitals will receive financial resources."
"The 
criteria for allocation have not yet been determined."
"The changeover to the maintenance flat rates of 60% 
on average is expected to take place gradually over several 
years."
"The hospitals argue that the concept in its current 
form still only deals with operating costs, but not with the 
adequate financing of investment costs."
"In July 2023, the federal and state governments agreed on 
a key points paper for the hospital reform."
"At the end of 
2023, the Federal Ministry of Health presented a working 
draft for a law."
"The working draft is currently being exam-
ined by the participating federal states."
"The planned law is 
expected to come into force in the first quarter of 2024 at 
the earliest."
"Further information on the hospital structure 
reform can be found in the Outlook section on page 82."
"In 
2023, the shortage of specialist staff and problems filling 
vacancies in the nursing care sector continued to pose a 
challenge for inpatient hospital care in Germany."
"In 2023, the nursing staff minimum levels for nursing-
sensitive wards were extended to include the areas of ear, 
nose, and throat medicine, urology, as well as rheumatology."
"For the first time in 2023, day treatments without 
overnight stays in the hospital could be billed using flat 
rates per case."
"This is intended to reduce night shifts, par-
ticularly in nursing, in order to create additional capacity 
for nursing staff on the day shift."
"In Spain, the private hospital market had a volume of 
around €20 billion in 20221."
"With a sales share of around 12%, Helios Spain is the 
leading company in the private hospital market."
"Its compet-
itors are a large number of privately run individual hospi-
tals or smaller chains, including HM Hospitales, Hospiten, 
Vithas, Ribera Salud, Hospitales Sanitas, and HLA."
"Of the approximately 800 hospitals in Spain, around 
two thirds of hospital beds are in public hospitals2."
"In an 
OECD comparison, Spain has around 3.0 beds per 1,000 in-
habitants, which is well below the OECD average of 5.0 
beds per 1,000 inhabitants."
"Public healthcare facilities in Spain are largely tax-financed 
and are generally open to the population without further 
charges or co-payment obligations."
"In addition, the Spanish 
government promotes the private healthcare sector through 
tax reliefs for private health insurance purchased by em-
ployers, among other things."
"After peaking in 2022, inflation in Spain decreased 
again in 2023."
"In particular, energy prices, which are also 
relevant for the hospital sector, stabilized at a significantly 
lower level in 2023."
"A challenge in some regions of the country continued to 
be the shortage of skilled workers, particularly in the care 
sector, although the situation has improved significantly 
compared to during the waves of COVID-19."
"In addition, a 
certain shortage of doctors is emerging in some specialist 
areas due to the steadily increasing demand for healthcare 
services."
"In addition to inflation-related cost increases, the short-
age of specialists and changes in the regulatory environ-
ment, digitalization is another challenge for the hospital 
sector in Germany and Spain."
"At the same time, it offers 
enormous opportunities, for example by standardizing and 
automating processes to a greater extent."
"New technolo-
gies offer the possibility of tapping into efficiency potential 
while maintaining at least the same, and often even higher, 
quality and reducing costs."
"It is estimated that in Germany 
alone, around 12%3 of total expenditure on healthcare and 
patient care can be saved through digitalization."

market for reproductive medicine is highly fragmented."
"Fresenius Vamed meets these challenges through long-
standing project partnerships, as well as its high level of 
expertise and experience in the fields of medical technol-
ogy and operational and organizational planning."
"The ser-
vice business also faced challenges in 2023 in terms of in-
flation-related cost increases and higher energy costs."
"Ca-
pacity restrictions, infection-related absences, and lower 
demand for rehabilitation services due to postponed elec-
tive surgeries played a slightly smaller role in 2023 than in 
the year before."
"Demand for reliable management of medi-
cal technology and high-end healthcare services remains 
robust."
"The market for projects and services for hospitals and 
other healthcare facilities is very fragmented."
"Therefore, an 
overall market size cannot be determined."
"The markets are 
country-specific and depending, to a large extent, on fac-
tors such as public healthcare policies, government regula-
tion, and levels of privatization, as well as demographics 
and economic and political conditions."
"In markets with es-
tablished healthcare systems and mounting cost pressure, 
the challenge for healthcare facilities is to increase their 
efficiency."
"Here, demand is especially high for sustainable 
planning and energy-efficient construction, optimized hos-
pital processes, and the outsourcing of medical-technical 
support services to external specialists."
"This enables hospi-
tals to concentrate on their core competency − treating pa-
tients."
"In addition to offering services for healthcare facilities 
worldwide, Fresenius Vamed itself is active as a leading 
post-acute care provider in Central Europe, especially in 
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic."
"In 
emerging markets, the focus is on building and developing 
healthcare infrastructure and improving the level of 
healthcare."
"Fresenius Vamed is a global company with no direct

lio of projects, services, and total operational management 
over the entire life cycle of healthcare facilities."
"As a result, 
Fresenius Vamed has a unique selling proposition of its 
own."
"Depending on the business segment, the company 
competes with international companies and consortia, as 
well as with local providers."
"This included 
increased uncertainties, inflation-related cost increases, 
staff shortages, and increased energy costs."
"In this difficult 
macroeconomic environment, the Fresenius Group was 
able to increase its revenue and earnings guidance over the 
course of the year."

"COMPARISON OF THE ACTUAL BUSINESS RESULTS 
WITH THE FORECASTS 
The overall macroeconomic environment in 2023 was char-
acterized by increased uncertainties, inflation-related cost 
increases, staff shortages, and higher energy costs."
"Despite 
this difficult macroeconomic environment, the Fresenius 
Group was able to increase its Group revenue and earn-
ings1 guidance over the course of the year."
"The overview on page 58 shows how the outlook for the 
Group and the business segments developed in 2023."
"Due to the deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care 
AG (FMC) in the course of the fiscal year, the comparison is 
made with the forecast for the Group excluding FMC."
"Revenue increased organically by 6% in fiscal year 
2023 and was thus at the upper end of the guidance ad-
justed in August 2023 (guidance for 2023: mid-single-digit 
percentage growth)."
"The increase is driven by an ongoing 
strong performance of our Operating Companies."
"EBIT1increased by 2% in constant currency and was 
therefore at the upper end of the guidance adjusted in Oc-
tober 2023 (guidance for 2023: broadly flat)."
"The increase 
was driven by a strong performance at Fresenius Kabi and 
Fresenius Helios."
"We invested €1,136 million in property, plant and 
equipment (2022: €1,182 million)."
"At 5.1% of Group reve-

below the prior-year level of 5.5%, but in line with the ex-
pectation (expectation for 2023: around 5%)."
"The cash conversion rate (CCR) was 1.0 and is therefore 
in line with expectations (expectation for 2023: below 1)."
"The net financial debt / EBITDA ratio was 3.76×2 (De-
cember 31, 2022: 3.80×2) and thus in line with expecta-
tions."
"We had projected that the leverage ratio would be 
below 4.0×2 by the end of 2023."
"This is still above our self-
imposed target corridor of 3.0× to 3.5×."
"Group ROIC was 5.2%1 (2022: 5.6%1) and thus in line 
with expectations."
"We had projected a figure of around 5% 
for fiscal year 2023."
"The decrease in ROIC was mainly due 
to a higher tax rate."
"The non-financial performance targets of the Fresenius

diversification, funding flexibility, cost of capital, and the ex-
isting maturity profile."

rencies in which our returns and cash flows are generated."

RATING OF FRESENIUS SE & CO.
"Liquidity analysis 
The main sources of liquidity are cash provided by operat-
ing activities and cash used in financing activities, i.e."

erating activities are influenced by the profitability of 
Fresenius’ business and by working capital, in particular

erated through the use of various short-term financing in-
struments."
"To this end, we issue commercial paper and 
draw on bilateral bank credit lines."

quirements can also be covered by accounts receivable 
programs."

ing sources will be sufficient to cover the Group’s foreseea-
ble liquidity needs."

"Irrespective of this, the Management Board considers 
the business outlook for the Group to be positive and ex-
pects a successful fiscal year 2024."
"OUTLOOK 
This Group Management Report contains forward-looking 
statements, including statements on future revenue, ex-
penses, and investments, as well as potential changes in 
the healthcare sector, our competitive environment, and 
our financial situation."
"These statements were made on the 
basis of the expectations and assessments of the Manage-
ment Board regarding events that could affect the Company 
in the future, and on the basis of our mid-term planning."
"For further in-
formation, please see our Opportunities and Risk Report on 
pages 87 ff."
"GENERAL AND MID-TERM OUTLOOK 
Despite the challenges posed by the macroeconomic envi-
ronment, the Management Board continues to assess the 
business outlook of the Fresenius Group as positive at the 
time of preparing the Group Management Report."
"We con-
tinue to see steadily growing demand for our products, ser-
vices, and therapies worldwide."
"We are continuously striving to optimize our costs, ad-
just our capacities, and improve our product mix, as well as 
to expand our products and services business."
"This in-
cludes plans for cost-efficient production and a further-op-
timized procurement process."
"In addition, we can use digi-
tal technologies to accelerate central administrative pro-
cesses and make them more efficient."
"For more infor-
mation, see Cost efficiency program section on page 85."
"Fresenius recognizes very good opportunities to meet 
the growing demand for healthcare resulting from the ag-
ing population with its increasing need for comprehensive 
care and from technological progress worldwide."
"Fresenius 
expects that access to healthcare in developing and emerg-
ing countries will continue to improve and that efficient 
healthcare systems with appropriate reimbursement struc-
tures will develop over time."
"We will continuously review 
and optimize our activities and growth options in the global 
regions and look for opportunities to introduce further 
products from our portfolio in attractive markets that ena-
ble profitable growth."
"The mid-term business outlook for Fresenius’ Operating 
Companies is determined by the following factors:  
 
► 
Fresenius Kabi is focusing on three growth areas: 
broadening the biopharmaceuticals business, expand-
ing the clinical nutrition business, and expanding the 
MedTech business."
"In the field of biopharmaceuticals, 
Fresenius Kabi specializes in the development of prod-
ucts for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and for 
use in oncology, and has a pipeline of molecules in 
various stages of development."
"The acquisition of a 
majority stake in mAbxience in 2022, which will enable 
a fully integrated vertical biopharma business, 
strengthens Fresenius Kabi’s presence in the high-
growth biopharmaceuticals market."
"We expect these 
measures to boost the company’s earnings in the com-
ing years."
"The clinical nutrition portfolio has grown 
successfully in recent years and will be further ex-
panded, making the product offering more accessible 
from a geographical perspective."
"The MedTech portfo-
lio was strengthened by the acquisition of Ivenix and 
its advanced infusion system."
"Fresenius Kabi continues 
to expand its MedTech product offering to keep pace 
with modern software and connectivity requirements."
"To strengthen the resilience of its high-volume IV drug 
business, Fresenius Kabi is developing generic drug 
formulations that are available at the time of market 
launch, i.e."
"immediately after the patents of the origi-
nator drugs expire."
"Fresenius Kabi aims 
to further expand its product portfolio in selected 
countries where the company does not yet have a com-
prehensive offering, depending on the respective local 
market conditions."
"► 
Fresenius Helios operates almost-nationwide hospital 
networks in Germany and Spain and provides outpa-
tient care at various facilities."
"Patient care is to be fur-
ther improved through the exchange of knowledge and 
experience (best practice) between Helios Germany 
and Helios Spain."
"The increasing number of privately 
insured patients opens up growth opportunities for He-
lios Spain, with a very deliberate and targeted alloca-
tion of capital for future expansion and hospital con-
struction."
"Furthermore, the close integration of Helios 
Spain’s corporate health management facilities with its 
own hospitals offers additional growth opportunities."
"In addition to innovative therapies, digitalization cre-
ates potential to further expand our market position."
"Helios Germany and Helios Spain are developing inno-
vative business areas such as digital offerings."
"► 
Fresenius Vamed is advancing its restructuring pro-
gram."
"In addition, the expansion of high-quality ser-
vices such as the management of medical-technical 
products, sterile supply, operational technology, and IT 
development is driven forward."
"Fresenius Vamed ex-
pects both its project and services business to grow 
again, respectively: further, due to the need for life-cy-
cle and PPP projects (public-private partnership)."
"Fur-
thermore, Fresenius Vamed plans to further strengthen 
its leading position as a post-acute care provider in 
Central Europe."
"HEALTHCARE SECTOR AND MARKETS 
The healthcare sector is considered to be widely independ-
ent of economic cycles."
"The demand, especially for lifesav-
ing and life-sustaining products and services, is expected 
to increase regardless of the macroeconomic challenges, 
given that they are medically needed and the population is 
aging."
"Moreover, medical advances and the large number 
of diseases that are still difficult to cure -- or are incurable -- 
are expected to remain growth drivers."
"In the emerging countries, the availability of basic 
healthcare and the demand for high-quality medical treat-
ment are increasing."
"As per-capita income increases, indi-
viduals increasingly have to cope with the illnesses associ-
ated with lifestyle diseases."
"On the other hand, experts estimate that further ﬁnan-
cial constraints in the public sector could result in more 
pricing pressure and a slowdown in revenue for companies 
in the healthcare industry."
"Some countries are experienc-
ing signiﬁcant ﬁnancing problems in the healthcare sector 
due to the strained public finance situation."
"Especially in 
the industrialized countries, increased pressure to encour-
age saving can be expected as healthcare costs constitute a 
large portion of the budget."
"It will be increasingly important for companies in the 
healthcare sector to increase patient benefit, to improve 
treatment quality, and to offer preventive therapies."
"In ad-
dition, especially those products and therapies that are not 
only medically but also economically advantageous will be 
of increasing importance."
"Today, more 
than one in three new drug approvals is a biopharmaceuti-
cal and significant growth of this global market, especially 
biosimilars, is expected in the next few years and decades."
"Going forward, we anticipate mid-single-digit growth in 
the clinical nutrition market."
"This outlook is underpinned 
by the growing awareness of the importance of early clini-
cal nutrition, as emphasized in the latest guidelines."
"More-
over, the increasing adaption of mandatory screening for 
malnutrition2 is contributing to the positive growth pro-
spects."
"We see further potential in addressing the substan-
tial number of malnourished individuals who still lack ac-
cess to nutrition therapies."
"Notably, emerging regions such 
as Latin America and Africa are expected to play a signifi-
cant role in this growth story, with projections indicating 
mid- to high-single-digit growth rates in these areas."
"The MedTech Infusion and Nutrition System (INS) market 
should experience growth in the mid-single-digit range go-
ing forward, mainly driven by infusion management sys-
tems."
"In many countries, we continue to see strong demand 
in the infusion technology segment, with more nationally 
resilient positions after COVID-19."
"In addition, the infusion 
pumps already placed in recent years will increase the de-
mand for dedicated infusion sets."
"In the MedTech Transfusion Medicine and Cell Thera-
pies (TCT) market, we expect to see mid-single-digit 
growth in the near future."
"This growth will be driven pri-
marily by the worldwide demand for plasma-derived intra-
venously administered products."
"In cell and gene therapy, 
we expect extraordinary growth as these therapies are ap-
proved for first- and second-line treatments."
"In the blood 
center business, we expect continued slight market growth, 
driven by increased platelet apheresis use in developing 
markets."
"Going forward, the markets for generic IV drugs and 
IV fluids are expected to grow in the low-to-mid-single-
digit range, with significant regional differences."
"The de-
mand for generic IV drugs is likely to grow because of their 
significantly lower price in comparison to the price of origi-
nator drugs."
"The growth dynamic will continue to be driven 
by improvement in healthcare infrastructure and access to 
care in the emerging markets, originator drugs going off-
patent, and by volume increase in original off-patent prod-
ucts that are offered at steady prices due to a unique selling 
proposition."
"A factor working in the opposite direction is 
the price pressure on off-patent brands and generic drugs 
as regulators seek to keep healthcare budgets under con-
trol, and it is expected that the competitive pressure in the 
market will further increase."
1 Market data refers to Fresenius Kabi’s addressable markets.
"Those are subject to annual volatility due to currency fluctuations and patent expiries of original drugs in the IV drug market, 
  among other things."
Percentage increase based on market value (price × volume).

"According to calculations, the potential for outpatient 
treatment in German hospitals is around 20% of inpatient 
cases (excluding births)2."
"Increasing outpatient treatment is 
desirable, not least for reasons of the shortage of specialist 
staff."
"This requires, in particular, the creation of financial in-
centives that contribute to a shift of cases to the outpatient 
sector."
"The first steps have been taken with the hybrid 
DRGs, which were introduced on January 1, 2024."
"In future, 
hybrid DRGs are to be extended to other service areas."
"In addition, a stronger cross-sectoral integration of in-
patient and outpatient medicine should ensure high-quality 
hospital care close to home, which goes hand in hand with 
the reduction of duplicate structures and specialization."
"He-
lios is well positioned in terms of cross-sector medicine in 
Germany with its broad range of inpatient and outpatient 
services."
"The increase in the remuneration of hospital services 
in Germany is determined, among other things, by what is 
known as the change value."
It amounts to 5.13% for 2024.
"The hospital financing system also provides for various sur-
charges and discounts for acute hospitals."
"Due to the overall delay in negotiations on the budgets 
(including the nursing care budgets) of hospitals in Ger-
many, the federal government has introduced legislative in-
itiatives to improve the liquidity of hospitals."
"Among other 
things, liquidity compensations outstanding related to the 
nursing care budgets up to and including 2024 can also be 
agreed as part of current agreement."
"The aim is to 
accelerate payment and thus improve the liquidity situation 
of hospitals, which is continues to be challenging for many 
hospitals in Germany due to the COVID-related decline in 
case numbers and thus lower proceeds."
"Future expectations for the year 2024 are negative for 
German hospitals: according to the Hospital Barometer 
2023 of the German Hospital Institute (DKI), 71% of hospi-
tals expect their economic situation to deteriorate."
"Only 
4% of hospitals still expect an improvement."
"Helios ex-
pects to continue to grow profitably in Germany in 2024."
"Since its founding, the company has focused on good or-
ganization, cost efficiency, and measurable, high medical 
quality as well as transparency of medical results."
"To provide financial support for inflation-related addi-
tional costs and increased energy costs, hospitals in Ger-
many will be supplied with compensation and reimburse-
ment amounts from the liquidity reserve of the healthcare 
fund for the last time by the end of April 2024."
"For 2024, the obligatory minimum nursing staff levels 
have been extended to include the specialist department of 
neurosurgery."
"Obligatory minimum nursing staff levels will 
be introduced for other hospital departments in the future."
"Starting in 2025, a new instrument for measuring nurs-
ing staff, referred to as the nursing staff model PPR 2.0, is 
to be gradually introduced."
"For this purpose, all hospitals 
will have to classify each patient daily into a nursing classi-
fication starting in 2024."
"The nursing classification then re-
sults in a calculated requirement for nursing staff for each 
clinic."
"From 2025, the Federal Ministry of Health (BMG) 
will be able to specify the percentage of this requirement 
that must be implemented in practice."
"If this normative re-
quirement is not met in practice, financial sanctions may be 
imposed."
"Digitalization in hospitals in Germany is to be driven for-
ward by the Hospital Futures Act."
"For example, nationwide 
standards will be introduced to enable greater networking 
in the healthcare sector and further improve patient care."
"From January 1, 2025, a deduction of up to 2% of the bill 
for each full and partial inpatient case is to be deducted if a 
hospital does not provide all the digital services listed in 
the Hospital Structure Fund Ordinance."
"In January 2023, the health ministers of the German 
states discussed a concept for comprehensive hospital 
structure reform."
"In July 2023, the federal and state gov-
ernments agreed on a key points paper for hospital reform."
"At the end of 2023, the Federal Ministry of Health pre-
sented a working draft for a law."
"The proposed draft is cur-
rently being reviewed by the states involved."
"The planned 
law is expected to come into force in the first quarter of 
2024 at the earliest."
"The aim is to fundamentally restruc-
ture the hospital landscape in Germany."
"The current system 
of purely volume-based remuneration via flat rates per case 
is to be changed."
"In future, 60% of the remuneration is to 
be distributed independently of performance via what is 
known as maintenance flat rates and linked to specific per-
formance groups."
"The changeover to maintenance flat rates 
is to take place gradually over several years."
"The financial impact of the reform on the Helios clinics 
cannot be estimated at present, as significant details are 
not known, particularly regarding the planned allocation of 
performance groups and the criteria of the maintenance fi-
nancing."
"In principle, however, Helios Germany considers itself to 
be well positioned for the upcoming reform as it has been 
strategically focusing on structural changes, new forms of 
care, and regional healthcare networks (clusters) for many 
years."
"Helios expects the hospital structure reform to be ra-
ther beneficial than detrimental to the company."
"The government is currently planning to revise the reg-
ulations on emergency care."
"However, there is currently no 
concrete legislative procedure."
"According to our expectations, we anticipate that the 
private hospital market in Spain in 2024 will continue to 
grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range in terms of 
revenue."
"The continuing increase in the number of pri-
vately insured patients should also open up opportunities 
for private operators in the future."
"Relevant indicators, for example nationwide healthcare 
spending and bed density, indicate the further market de-
velopment potential in the Spanish healthcare system com-
pared with other EU countries."
"This also provides opportu-
nities for the establishment of new hospitals."
"Investments 
are being made both by the public sector and by private 
hospital operators.1  
In addition, the highly fragmented Spanish private hos-
pital market offers further consolidation potential."
"We expect the trend towards digitalization in the 
healthcare sector to become even more important."
"Increas-
ingly, the degree of digitalization will be central to the fu-
ture viability of a hospital."
"Networks and the use of digital 
solutions are opening up new opportunities to make pro-
cesses more efficient and safer and thus to break new 
ground in patient care."
"Digitalization will be a core element 
in maintaining competitiveness and being able to react to 
upcoming changes in an agile way."
"THE MARKET FOR PROJECTS AND SERVICES FOR 
HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES 
For fiscal year 2024, depending on geopolitical develop-
ments, Fresenius Vamed expects growing demand world-
wide for projects and services for hospitals and other 
healthcare facilities."
"In the Central European markets with established 
healthcare systems, we expect solid growth and a contin-
ued rise in demand."
"This is due to demographic develop-
ments and an increasing need for investment and moderni-
zation in public healthcare facilities that has in part become 
apparent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Addi-
tional growth opportunities arise from the fact that public 
institutions are increasingly outsourcing non-medical ser-
vices to private service providers due to increasing effi-
ciency pressure."
"In addition, a sustainable expansion of the 
range of post-acute services in Europe is expected."
"In the emerging markets, we anticipate an overall dy-
namic demand development."
"Growth in markets such as Af-
rica, Latin America, and southeast Asia will initially be 
driven by the demand for efﬁcient, needs-oriented medical 
care."
"In China and the Middle East, growth will be driven 
by the development of infrastructure and the creation of 
new care services, as well as research and training facili-
ties."
"Further opportunities arise from the progress of digital-
ization."
"It is important to systematically exploit the oppor-
tunities it offers, for example in the establishment and op-
eration of what are known as virtual hospitals and the con-
sistent further development of telemedical treatment proce-
dures."
"These can make a decisive contribution to making 
state-of-the-art technology and medical expertise available 
at adequate cost."
"This goes hand in hand with networking 
between healthcare systems at different levels of develop-
ment in order to facilitate access to high-quality healthcare 
services for broad sections of the population."
"Fresenius also expects in-
terest rates to remain at a similar level to 2023."
"Irrespective of this, the Management Board considers 
the business outlook for the Group to be positive and ex-
pects a successful fiscal year 2024."
"Fresenius will continue to closely monitor the potential 
impact of increased volatility and reduced visibility on its 
business and balance sheet."
"All of these assumptions are subject to considerable uncer-
tainty."
"TAX RATE 
For fiscal year 2024, we expect a tax rate between 25% 
and 26% (2023: 28.3%)."
"COST AND EFFICIENCY PROGRAM 
Structural productivity improvements are expected to offset 
market headwinds and to create financial flexibility for fu-
ture growth investments in the coming years."
"We have increased the original target of saving around 
€350 million (excluding Fresenius Medical Care) annually 
in structural costs at EBIT level from 2025."
"We now plan to 
save around €400 million (excluding Fresenius Medical 
Care) in sustainable costs at EBIT level from 2025."
"The cost savings program includes programs in all busi-
ness segments and in the Corporate Center, which are 
managed and controlled centrally by the Group."
"The most 
important elements are process optimization, the reduction 
of sales, administration and procurement costs as well as 
digitalization measures."
"The Group-wide cost and efficiency program is making 
excellent progress."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we increased 
the annual savings achieved since the start of the program 
to around €280 million (excluding Fresenius Medical Care)."
"This significantly exceeded the original target of €200 mil-
lion for 2023."
"One-time costs incurred as part of the pro-
gram amounted to around €221 million (excluding 
Fresenius Medical Care) in the 2023 fiscal year."
"For 2024, Fresenius expects to increase the annual cost 
savings under the cost and efficiency program to €330 to 
350 million."
"To achieve the targeted cost savings, additional one-
time costs of around €80 to 100 million are expected at 
EBIT level for the period 2024 to 2025."
"The one-off costs 
will continue to be classified as special items in line with 
previous practice."
"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
For fiscal year 2024, we expect a cash conversion rate of 
around 1.0."
"In addition, undrawn credit lines under syndicated or 
bilateral credit facilities from banks provide us with suffi-
cient financial headroom."
"Financing activities in 2024 are largely geared to refi-
nancing existing financial liabilities maturing in 2024 and 
2025."
"Without further acquisitions and divestments, Fresenius 
expects the net debt / EBITDA1 ratio at the end of 2024 to 
be within the self-imposed target corridor of 3.0× to 3.5× 
(December 31, 2023: 3.76×)."
"There are no significant changes in the financing strat-
egy planned for 2024."
"INVESTMENTS 
In 2024, we expect to invest about 5% of revenue in prop-
erty, plant and equipment."
"About 54% of the capital ex-
penditure planned will be invested at Fresenius Helios and 
about 39% at Fresenius Kabi."
"Fresenius Helios will primarily invest in measures at the 
individual hospital locations in Germany and in new hospi-
tal buildings and expansions in Spain."
"Fresenius Kabi will mainly invest in expansion and 
maintenance in 2024."
"This includes, in particular, the ex-
pansion of production facilities and in-licensing projects for 
biosimilar molecules."
"Fresenius Vamed will mainly invest in its post-acute fa-
cilities."
"With a share of around 80%, Europe is the regional 
focus of investment in the planning period."
"Around 12% of 
the investments are planned for North America and around 
8% for Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa."
"About 33% 
of total funds will be invested in Germany."
"For 2024, we expect return on invested capital to im-
prove and to be within a range of 5.4 to 6.0% (2023: 
5.2%)."
"CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
For fiscal year 2024, we expect the equity ratio to increase 
about 5 percentage points compared to fiscal year 2023 
(2023: 43%)."
"Furthermore, we expect that financial liabili-
ties in relation to total assets will slightly decrease in fiscal 
year 2023 (2023: 35%)."
"DIVIDEND 
With the Fresenius Financial Framework, Fresenius aims to 
generate attractive and predictable dividend yields."
"In line 
with its progressive dividend policy, the Company aims to 
increase the dividend in line with earnings per share 
growth (before special items, in constant currency), but at 
least maintain the dividend at the prior-year’s level."
"Irrespective of the legally required suspension of divi-
dend payments for the 2023 fiscal year, Fresenius will 
maintain its dividend policy in the future."
"NON-FINANCIAL TARGETS 
As of fiscal year 2023, the qualitative measurement of fiscal 
years 2021 and 2022 will be replaced by quantitative ESG 
KPIs in the short-term variable Management Board remu-
neration (Short-term Incentive -- STI)."
"The KPIs cover the 
key sustainability topics of medical quality / patient satisfac-
tion and employees."
"The topic of employees is measured with the key figure 
of the Employee Engagement Index (EEI) for the Fresenius 
Group."
"Fresenius is aiming for an EEI of 4.33 (achieved 
2023: 4.13 ex FMC; 4.24 incl."
"FMC) for fiscal year 2024 
(corresponds to 100% target achievement)."
"The Medical Quality / Patient Satisfaction topic is com-
posed of equally weighted key figures that are defined at 
the business segment level."
"The indicators are based on the 
respective relevance for the business model."
"Fresenius Kabi aims for an Audit & Inspection Score of 
at most 2.3 (achieved 2023: 1.9; 100% target achieve-
ment)."
"Helios Germany aims to achieve an Inpatient Quality In-
dicator (G-IQI) score of at least 88% (achieved 2023: 
88.7%; 100% target achievement), and Helios Spain aims 
to achieve a score of at least 55% (achieved 2023: 76.7%; 
100% target achievement)."
"Fresenius Vamed aims to achieve a patient satisfaction 
score of at least 1.57 (achieved 2023: 1.56; 100% target 
achievement) in fiscal year 2024."
"At the same time, the Fresenius Group is exposed to a 
number of risks when undertaking these activities due to 
the complexity and the dynamics of its business."
"These 
risks are inevitable consequences of entrepreneurial activ-
ity, because opportunities can only be exploited when there 
is a willingness to take risks."
"As a provider of products and services for the, to a large 
extent, severely and chronically ill, we are relatively inde-
pendent of economic cycles."
"The diversification into three 
business segments, which operate in different segments of 
the health care market, and the global footprint further 
minimize the Group’s risk profile."
"Our many years of expe-
rience, as well as our regularly leading market position, 
serve as a solid basis for achieving a realistic assessment of 
opportunities and risks."
"OPPORTUNITIES MANAGEMENT 
Managing opportunities is an ongoing, integral part of cor-
porate activity."
"To be successful over the long term, we 
consolidate and improve on what we have already achieved 
and create new opportunities."
"The Fresenius Group and its 
business segments are organized and managed in a way 
that enables us to identify and analyze trends, require-
ments, and opportunities in our often fragmented markets, 
and to focus our actions accordingly."
"We maintain regular 
contact and dialog with research groups and scientific insti-
tutions to explore new prospects, and keep a close watch 
on markets and competitors in order to identify opportuni-
ties."
"Within the Group, opportunities and synergies can be 
exploited through continuous communication involving the 
exchange of information and know-how between the 
business segments."
"As part of our strategic and operational 
budgeting process, we identify and analyze short-, me-
dium-, and long-term opportunities and risks."
"Opportuni-
ties can also be assessed systematically in our risk manage-
ment process."
"We discuss opportunities in the Outlook sec-
tion starting on page 79 ff."
"KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FRESENIUS 
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ENTIRE 
INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 
Risk management is a continuous process."
"The aim of risk 
management is to identify potential risks as early as possi-
ble in order to assess their impact on business and, if nec-
essary, to take appropriate mitigating measures."
"The ability 
to identify, assess, and manage risks that put the achieve-
ment of our business goals at risk is an important element 
of solid corporate governance."
"The Fresenius risk manage-
ment- (RMS) and internal control system (ICS) is therefore 
closely linked to its corporate strategy."
"It explicitly takes 
into account all types of risk, including non-financial risks 
associated with our business activities or our business rela-
tionships, products, and services."
"In this context, sustaina-
bility-related risks are also taken into account in accord-
ance with the GCGC."
"We consider short-, medium-, and long-term risks."
"For 
example, we consider a period of 10 years and beyond 
when analyzing product development, investment and ac-
quisition decisions."
"Due to the constantly changing external and internal re-
quirements and environment, our risk management and in-
ternal control system is being continuously developed."
"In 
the past fiscal year, for example, the risk management and 
internal control systems were linked even more closely."
"The completeness and validity of the risk information 
within our risk management approach was also 
strengthened by analyzing our risk-bearing capacity and 
our aggregated risk position."
"The adequacy and effectiveness of our risk management 
and internal control system is audited by Internal Audit."
"The findings from these audits are used to continuously ad-
vance our risk management and internal control system."
"The ‘‘Second 
Line of Defense’’ also sets guidelines and minimum re-
quirements for the Group."
"On the basis of these guidelines, 
Group-wide standards are established and documented for 
the risk management and internal control system."
"In addition, the core principles of the risk culture and of 
the risk strategy are defined and integrated into the busi-
ness processes."
"► 
The managers of each organizational unit are required 
to report any relevant changes in the risk profile to the 
Management Board without delay."
"► 
A dedicated Risk Management and ICS function at 
Group level defines standards valid for the entire 
Group and supports and monitors risk management 
and internal control system structures and processes."
"Specialized sub-departments have been set up within 
this Group function."
"► 
The Group function is supplemented by risk manage-
ment functions at segment or entity level."
"The tasks 
and responsibilities between the different organiza-
tional levels are clearly defined and documented."
"► 
A Risk Steering Committee chaired by the Member of 
the Management Board for Risk Management is an ad-
visory body that discusses internal and external devel-
opments regarding the risk management and internal 
control system."
"In addition, the Risk Steering Commit-
tee advises on significant risks and prepares decision 
proposals for the Fresenius Management Board."
"The 
Management Board of the Fresenius Group has the 
overall responsibility for effective risk management 
and regularly discusses the current risk situation."
"Within the Fresenius Group Management Board, the 
Member of the Management Board for Risk Manage-
ment is responsible for the risk management and inter-
nal control system, as well as their organization."
"► 
The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee monitors 
the effectiveness of the risk management and internal 
control system."
"The risk situation is evaluated regularly and compared with 
specified requirements using standardized processes."
"If rel-
evant changes to the risk profile or new risks arise between 
the regular reporting cycles, these are recorded and evalu-
ated as part of the ad hoc reporting process."
"Should nega-
tive trends arise, we can then take countermeasures at an 
early stage."
"In addition to risk reporting, regular financial reporting 
to management is an important tool for managing and con-
trolling risks."
"Detailed monthly and quarterly reports are 
used to identify and analyze deviations of actual versus 
planned business development."
"In addition, the risk management and internal control sys-
tem includes organizational processes and safeguards, as 
well as internal controls and audits incorporated in our 
business processes, which help us to identify significant 
risks at an early stage and to counteract them."
"These include both quantitative and qualitative valuation 
methods."
"The assessment of a risk takes into account its 
likelihood of occurrence, its potential impact on our assets, 
liabilities, financial position and financial performance, and 
the time horizon."
"Fresenius assesses the potential impact 
on the results of operations consistently on the basis of the 
key figure EBIT."
"The risks are presented taking into ac-
count already initiated and implemented mitigating 
measures (net assessment of risks)."
"Risks are evaluated for 
a period of 12 months in order to assess the impact of the 
risk situation on the one-year forecast for the Fresenius 
Group."
"In addition, potential risks with an impact on the 
medium- and long-term company goals are analyzed and 
estimated."
"The risk matrix on page 91 shows the significant risks 
that could lead to deviations from the expected business 
performance within the one-year forecast period."
"On the basis of the quantitative risk assessment, the 
overall risk position is determined at Group level by means 
of a Monte-Carlo Simulation."
"This involves taking correla-
tions and dependencies between risks into account."
"The 
calculated overall risk position is compared to the Group’s 
risk-bearing capacity."
"The risk-bearing capacity represents 
the maximum acceptable level of risks beyond which the 
continued existence of the Fresenius Group could be at 
risk."
"Fresenius determines its risk-bearing capacity on the 
basis of selected key balance sheet figures, such as the li-
quidity reserve, and rating-related key figures of the Group, 
such as the leverage ratio."
"The overall risk position is fully 
covered by the risk-bearing capacity of the Fresenius 
Group."
"COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS PART OF 
THE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
In all business segments and at Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, 
we have set up dedicated risk-oriented compliance man-
agement systems."
"These are based on three pillars: preven-
tion, detection and response."
"Our compliance measures are 
primarily aimed at using preventive measures to avoid 
compliance violations."
"Key preventive measures include 
comprehensive risk identification and risk assessment, ap-
propriate and comprehensive policies and processes, regu-
lar training, and ongoing consultation."
"We also carry out in-
ternal controls to identify possible compliance violations 
and ensure that we act in accordance with the rules."
"For 
additional information about our Compliance Management 
System we refer to page 169 ff."
"INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AS PART OF THE RISK 
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM1 
The internal control system is an important part of 
Fresenius’ risk management."
"In addition to internal con-
trols with regard to the financial reporting, it includes con-
trol objectives for further critical processes, such as quality 
management and patient safety, cybersecurity and data 
protection, and sustainability."
"Fresenius has documented 
relevant critical control objectives in a Group-wide frame-
work, integrating the various management systems into the 
internal control system in a holistic manner."
"Overall responsibility for our ICS and RMS lies with the 
Management Board."
"The Group Risk Management & ICS or-
ganization supports the Management Board in designing 
and maintaining adequate and effective internal control and 
RMS activities by coordinating, monitoring and reporting 
these processes."
"Findings from this functional monitoring 
of the risk management and internal control system are ad-
dressed by appropriate measures."
"At the end of each fiscal year, the Management Board per-
forms an evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of 
the ICS and RMS."
"Nevertheless, there are inherent limitations on the ef-
fectiveness of any risk management and control system."
"For example, no management system -- even if deemed to 
be adequate and effective -- can guarantee that all risks that 
will occur will be identified in advance or that any process 
violations will be ruled out under all circumstances."
"Prior to the preparation of the management report, the 
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board engages with 
the assessment of the appropriateness and effectiveness of 
the RMS and ICS by the Management Board."
"The evalua-
tion process and the results of the evaluation are explained 
to the Audit Committee by the Management Board and its 
questions are discussed with the Management Board."
"Our four-tier reporting 
process especially promotes intensive discussion and en-
sures control of the financial results."
"At each reporting 
level, i.e.,  
 
► 
the local entity, 
► 
the region, 
► 
the business segment, and 
► 
the Group 
 
financial data and key figures are reported, discussed, and 
compared with the prior-year figures, budget, and latest 
forecast on a monthly basis."
"In addition, all parameters, assumptions, and estimates 
that are of relevance for the externally reported Group and 
segment results are discussed intensively with the depart-
ment responsible for preparing the Group’s consolidated fi-
nancial statements."
"These matters are also reviewed and 
discussed quarterly by the Supervisory Board’s Audit Com-
mittee."
"Control mechanisms, such as automated and manual 
reconciliation processes, are further precautions put in 
place to ensure that financial reporting is reliable and that 
transactions are correctly accounted for."
"All consolidated 
entities report according to Group-wide standards, which 
are determined at the head office."
"These are regularly ad-
justed to allow for changes made to the accounting regula-
tions."
"The consolidation proposals are supported by the IT 
system."
"In this context, internal Group balances, among 
other things, are reconciled in a comprehensive manner."
"To prevent abuse, we take care to maintain a strict separa-
tion of functions."
"Monitoring and assessments carried out by manage-
ment also help to ensure that risks with a direct impact on 
financial reporting are identified and that controls are in 
place to minimize them."
"Moreover, changes in accounting 
principles are closely monitored and employees involved in 
financial reporting are instructed regularly and comprehen-
sively."
"External experts and specialists are engaged if nec-
essary."
"The Treasury, Tax, Controlling, and Legal depart-
ments are involved in supporting the preparation of the fi-
nancial statements."
"Finally, the information provided is ver-
ified once more by the department responsible for prepar-
ing the consolidated financial statements."
"Potential risks for Fresenius include 
factors beyond our direct control."
"These also include the 
macroeconomic development, which we constantly moni-
tor."
"They also include factors immediately within our con-
trol, such as operating risks, which we anticipate at as early 
a stage as possible and to which we react with appropriate 
mitigating measures, as required."
"In synopsis, there are currently no recognizable risks 
that appear to present a long-term and significant threat to 
the Fresenius Group’s assets, liabilities, financial position 
and financial performance."
"The overall risk position is fully 
covered by the Fresenius Group's risk-bearing capacity."
"We have created organizational structures that provide 
all the conditions needed to rapidly alert us to possible risk 
situations and enable us to take suitable mitigating 
measures."
"RISKS AFFECTING THE ONE-YEAR FORECAST 
PERIOD 
The chart besides shows the significant risks that could 
lead to deviations from the expected business performance 
within the one-year forecast period."
"In addition, the potential im-
pacts of risks with regard to quality, competition and inno-
vation has been increased."
"Potential impacts  of Compliance related risks increased, 
while at the same time the likelihood of occurrence de-
creased."
"While the likelihood of occurrence of risks in the 
areas of procurement and personnel has increased, the 
likelihood of occurrence of risks in the areas of currencies 
and interest rates has decreased."
"The inflationary environment -- 
which is also attributed to the Ukraine war-- continues to 
pose the risk of significantly rising energy, material supply 
and transportation costs."
"However, this risk has decreased, 
mainly due to the inclusion of expected additional costs in 
corporate planning and an easing of the situation on indi-
vidual procurement markets, particularly the one for en-
ergy."
"With deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care, 
Fresenius Group's assets in Russia and Ukraine amounted 
to less than 1% of its total assets as of December 31, 2023."
"Therefore, the direct impact of the Ukraine war on 
Fresenius’ remaining business is limited."
"Nevertheless, the Ukraine war is still accompanied by a 
very distinctive threat situation for cyber security, espe-
cially with regards to critical infrastructure, such as 
healthcare facilities, in countries that support Ukraine."
"Therefore, the risk of cybersecurity attacks on our systems 
and data is still increased."
"In general, Fresenius is affected 
to a minor extent by economic fluctuations."
"We expect de-
mand for our life-saving and life-sustaining products and 
services to continue to grow."
"In addition, Fresenius aims to achieve a balanced distri-
bution of business in the major regions of the world and 
between established and emerging markets."
"The risk situa-
tion of our business segments depends in particular on the 
development of the markets relevant to them."
"We therefore 
also carefully monitor and assess country-specific political, 
legal and financial conditions, particularly in the current 
macroeconomic environment."
"This applies, for example, to 
our receivables portfolios in countries that are experiencing 
budgetary problems due to their indebtedness or countries 
that are exposed to hyperinflation."
"Overall, the aforementioned factors could have a nega-
tive impact on our assets, liabilities, financial position and 
financial performance."
"Despite the aforementioned effects, from today’s per-
spective the global economic development does not pose a 
risk for the going concern of the Fresenius Group."
"RISKS IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR  
Risks related to changes in the health care sector are of 
major importance to the Fresenius Group."
"The main risks 
are the financing of health care systems and the corre-
sponding reimbursement systems, as well as the develop-
ment of new products and therapies."
"Financing of health care systems - reimbursement 
rates and prices 
In our largely regulated business environment, changes in 
legislation, including those relating to reimbursement, can 
have a drastic impact on our business success."
"National insurance systems are financed very differ-
ently."
"For example, healthcare systems in Europe and the 
British Commonwealth countries are generally based on 
one of two funding models: the system with a mandatory 
employer and employee contribution, and the predomi-
nantly tax-funded system."
"In the Asia-Pacific region, universal health care (""UHC"") 
is at various stages of implementation, so reimbursement 
mechanisms can vary significantly from country to country 
(and even from province to province and city to city)."
"In 
Latin America, health care systems are funded by public or 
private payers, or a combination of both."
"In the hospital market in Germany, the current system 
of purely volume-dependent remuneration via flat rates per 
case is to be converted into a mixed remuneration system."
"The plan is to limit remuneration based on flat rates per 
case to 40%."
"In future, an average of 60% of the remuner-
ation is to be distributed independently of performance via 
so-called retention flat rates (including the care budget)."
"These retention costs are intended to cover the fixed costs 
associated with the provision of structures in the hospital 
care area."
"The clinics are largely occupied by statutory 
health insurance funds and pension insurance providers."
"The continued existence of contracts with these institutions 
therefore influences the success of Helios Germany."
"We 
keep a close eye on legislative activities and planning and 
work together with the state healthcare organizations."
"To a 
considerable extent, occupancy in the hospitals is provided 
by statutory health insurance funds and pension insurance 
institutions."
"The continuation of contracts with these insti-
tutions therefore influences the success of Helios Germany."
"We keep a close eye on legislative activities and planning 
and work together with the state healthcare organizations."
"As part of the Nursing Personnel Strengthening Act 
(PpSG), nursing costs were removed from case rates (DRG) 
from 2020 and the costs of patient-centered care were re-
imbursed in full by the health insurance funds via separate 
care budgets."
"As early as 2021, each additional or in-
creased bedside care position was fully refinanced by pay-
ers, and the care budget's inclusion criteria were changed."
"As negotiations with the payers on the care budgets 
have largely not yet been concluded, this gives rise to a po-
tential risk to the assets, liabilities, financial position and fi-
nancial performance."
"From 2025, the nursing budget for bedside care will 
only fund nursing staff who have 1-3 years of training."
"Nursing assistants with less than one year of training or 
further training will no longer be financed via the nursing 
budget from 2025."
"Funding will then once again be pro-
vided on a fixed-rate basis as part of DRG remuneration."
"In contrast, from 2025, all midwives and maternity 
nurses will also be financed within the framework of the 
nursing budget in the amount of the actual costs."
"Furthermore, hospitals can individually agree a sur-
charge of up to 4% for implementing measures that reduce 
the burden on nursing care."
"The hospital must both de-
scribe the reduction in nursing care per measure and cal-
culate the expected savings."
"This usually involves digital 
and technical measures that reduce or support nursing 
measures."
"In the German market, Helios Germany is observing a 
general trend towards outpatient treatment, which could 
lead to lower case number growth for inpatient treatments."
"To take account of this trend, Helios Germany is expanding 
outpatient services in a separate division."
"A decline in case 
numbers could have an adverse effect on our business and 
operating profit."
"Close monitoring of developments in both 
the inpatient and outpatient areas makes it possible to act 
accordingly."
"Our private hospital chain Quirónsalud in Spain operates 
hospitals, among other things, via PPP (Public-Private 
Partnership) contracts."
"These are part of the public 
healthcare system in Spain."
"The company has thus been as-
signed responsibility for certain areas of healthcare for 
Spanish citizens with statutory health insurance."
"In return, 
Quirónsalud receives remuneration in the form of a per 
capita flat rate or a fee for the respective service provided."
"The payment for the services of our private hospitals in 
Spain and Latin America is largely based on fixed-term 
contracts with private insurance companies."
"A deterioration 
in conditions, the loss of a contract or the insolvency of a 
payer can have a significant impact on our assets, liabili-
ties, financial position and financial performance of our 
clinics."
"Savings in the reimbursement of health care services 
may also have a negative impact on the sales prices of 
Fresenius Kabi's products."
"Due to the high share of the US 
market in Fresenius Kabi’s turnover, changes in the gov-
ernment reimbursement system can have a significant im-
pact on our business."
"Changes in legislation, reimbursement practices and 
health care programs could affect the scope of reimburse-
ment for services, the scope of insurance coverage and the 
product business."
"This could have a material adverse effect 
on our assets, liabilities, financial position and financial 
performance."
"Overall, we aim to counteract such potential 
regulatory risks via benefit enhancements and cost reduc-
tions."
"Competition and Innovation 
We face numerous competitors in our health care services 
business, some of which may possess substantial financial, 
marketing or research and development resources."
"Compe-
tition from new and existing competitors and especially 
new competitive developments and innovations in technol-
ogy, pharmaceuticals and care delivery models could mate-
rially adversely affect the future pricing and sale of our 
products and services."
"Growing competition, among other things induced by 
the recovery of some notable competitors, in particular in 
the U.S."
"market for generic IV drugs after halts to produc-
tion, may continue to materially affect the pricing and sale 
of our products and services."
"In addition, the introduction of 
generic or patented drugs by competitors may have an im-
pact on the revenue and operational results of our products."
"Generally, the health care sector is characterized by 
pricing pressure (including from tenders), competition, and 
efforts to contain costs."
"These factors could result in lower 
revenue and adversely affect our assets, liabilities, financial 
position and financial performance."
"In the United States, almost all Fresenius Kabi injecta-
ble pharmaceutical products are sold to customers through 
arrangements with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) 
and distributors."
"The GPOs also have purchasing agree-
ments with other manufacturers, and the bidding process 
for products is highly competitive."
"If Fresenius Kabi is not successful in maintaining its ex-
isting contracts or if new contracts are concluded on less 
favorable terms, this could have an adverse effect on our 
assets, liabilities, financial position and financial perfor-
mance."
"Similar developments with regard to price pressure in 
the tender business and increasing competition and price 
reductions are affecting our business in all major markets 
in Asia."
"Based on the directive from the Chinese State Council, 
drug price reduction will continue to be one of the major 
measures to further contain health care costs in a market in 
which volumes are steadily growing."
"In addition, in mid-2023, ministries and commissions 
across China implemented a one-year focus on eliminating 
corruption in the healthcare sector."
"This leads to uncer-
tainty in the sector, particularly among the medical profes-
sion which is currently resulting in a sharp decline in sales 
in the healthcare sector."
"This mainly affects products that 
are not listed in NVBPs or PVBPs."
"To ensure our permanent competitiveness, we work 
closely together with physicians and scientists."
"Important 
technological and pharmaceutical innovations are intended 
to be quickly identified and further developed, if necessary, 
also by adapting our business strategy."
"Moreover, we se-
cure our competitiveness by ongoing analyzes of our mar-
ket environment as well as the regulatory framework."
"The 
market activity, especially our competitors’ products and 
newly launched dialysis-related products are thoroughly 
monitored."
"The cooperation between the various technical, 
medical and academic institutions within our company also 
ensures our competitiveness."
"The introduction of new products and services or the de-
velopment of superior technologies by competitors could 
make our products and services less competitive or even 
superfluous and thus have a material adverse effect on their 
sales, the prices of the products and the scope of the ser-
vices."
"This also applies to the introduction of generic or pa-
tented drugs by competitors, which could have an impact 
on sales and earnings."
"Cooperation with doctors and scien-
tists enables us to take up on and promote important tech-
nological innovations."
"This means that we are always informed about the latest 
developments in alternative treatment methods so that we 
can evaluate our corporate strategy and adapt it if necessary."
"Significant risks of operations for the 
Fresenius Group are described in the following sections."
"We implement them by means of inter-
nal standards such as quality and work procedure manuals."
"Regular internal and external audits are carried out at the 
Group’s production sites and distribution companies to 
check compliance."
"This covers all requirements and regula-
tions, from management and administration to production 
and clinical services, right through to patient satisfaction."
"Our production facilities comply with the Good Manufactur-
ing Practice (GMP) requirements of the markets they sup-
ply."
"Our facilities are audited by local public health authori-
ties such as the U.S."
"Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other au-
thorities."
"If an authority identifies any deficiencies, 
Fresenius will immediately take comprehensive and appro-
priate rectifying measures."
"Non-compliance with the requirements of these authorities 
in our production facilities or at our suppliers could lead to 
regulatory actions, such as warning letters, product recalls, 
production interruptions, monetary sanctions, or delays in 
new product approvals."
"Any of these regulatory actions 
could adversely affect our business reputation and our abil-
ity to generate revenue and result in significant expenses."
"With its early warning system, Fresenius evaluates any 
quality-related information from various risk areas to iden-
tify risks at an early stage and take corrective and preven-
tive actions."
"For this purpose, Fresenius Kabi uses global 
safety officers, databases in which complaints and side ef-
fects are logged, internal and external audits, and key per-
formance indicators used for internal control purposes and 
the optimization of quality processes."
"In this way, safety 
profiles of the products can be created and evaluated 
worldwide."
"Product recalls, for example, are initiated as a risk-mini-
mizing measure in cooperation with the responsible regula-
tory authority; at the same time, the cause of the recall is 
analyzed thoroughly."
"Corrective action may be taken to 
avoid the circumstances that led to the recall occurring 
again in the future."
"In addition, changes made to requirements and regula-
tions by regulatory authorities, such as those affecting our 
production processes, can lead to lower production volumes 
during any transitional period or jeopardize production."
"Production could also be adversely affected by events 
such as natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, regula-
tory rulings, supply disruptions, such as of raw materials, 
or technical failures."
"To minimize these risks, stocks are 
built up, for example to bridge any gaps in the event of 
short-term problems."
"Potential risks arising from the start-up of new production 
sites or the introduction of new technologies are countered 
through careful planning, regular analysis, and continual 
progress reviews."
"Providing medical services in our hospitals and rehabili-
tation clinics is generally subject to inherent risks."
"For ex-
ample, disruptions to processes, also due to causes such as 
natural disasters or technical failures, involve risks for pa-
tients and the clinic."
"In addition, there are operational risks, 
for example regarding hygiene."
"We counteract these risks 
with strict operating procedures, continual personnel train-
ing, and patient-oriented work procedures."
"At Fresenius 
Helios, for example, a structured hygiene management sys-
tem is in place to ensure that infections within the hospital 
are avoided and their spread prevented as quickly as possi-
ble."
"Furthermore, we are constantly striving to improve the 
standard of patient treatment through our quality manage-
ment systems."
"Further information about our quality management pro-
cesses can be found in the separate Group Non-financial 
Report from page 118."
"We counter these risks by appropriately se-
lecting and working together with our suppliers, through 
long-term framework agreements in certain purchasing 
segments, and by bundling volumes within the Group."
"We counter the risk of poor-quality purchased raw ma-
terials, semi-finished products, and components mainly by 
requiring our suppliers to meet strict quality standards."
"This includes a structured qualification process, which 
comprises audits, document and advance sample inspec-
tions, as well as regular quality controls of deliveries."
"We 
only purchase high-quality products with proven safety and 
suitability from qualified suppliers that conform to our 
specifications and standards."
"Evaluating our risks and our management measures, we 
also take into account new regulatory requirements and le-
gal conditions, such as the Act on Corporate Due Diligence 
Obligations in Supply Chains, which became effective in 
Germany in 2023."
"Further information about our supply chains and our 
approach to the protection of human rights can be found in 
the separate Group Non-financial Report from page 179 ff."
"Personnel 
Fresenius addresses potential shortages of qualified per-
sonnel through appropriate employer branding measures, 
as well as recruitment, upskilling, and retention of qualified 
staff."
"In order to increase the awareness and attractiveness of 
the Fresenius Group, our employer branding relies on a 
mix of different formats."
"The centerpiece is the multi-
award-winning Group careers page with job advertise-
ments and video, image and text information about the 
Fresenius Group."
"In addition, we are represented on all rel-
evant social media channels and selected online career por-
tals with profiles and our own career content."
"As provider in the healthcare sector, we want to be an 
attractive employer for young people and their start in pro-
fessional life."
"To reach the student target group, we implement spe-
cific university marketing activities."
"These include, for ex-
ample, specialized lectures at universities by Fresenius em-
ployees, print and online ads and event formats at our tar-
get universities."
"Furthermore, we offer young academic tal-
ent the opportunity to gain initial practical experience and 
to establish contacts within our company in the context of 
internships and working student positions before or during 
their studies or in the context of their final papers."
"To promote internal career development and keep inter-
nal job opportunities as transparent as possible the global, 
internal job portal ""stayFresenius"" is available."
"To ensure a sustainable supply of qualified staff, we of-
fer, for example, targeted programs for young academic 
talent with subsequent retention programs, as well as com-
prehensive apprenticeships for students who just gradu-
ated high school."
"With more than 6,600 apprentices and dual students, 
Fresenius is one of the biggest training companies in Ger-
many."
"Fresenius offers 37 apprenticeships and 31 study 
programs throughout Germany."
"The number of our appren-
ticeships and study program offerings was further ex-
panded nationwide."
"Depending on the customer and market structure, our 
business segments place very different demands on con-
cepts and measures for personnel development."
"We 
strengthen employee loyalty to our company by offering 
our employees attractive development opportunities and 
fringe benefits and variable compensation and working-
time models."
"In addition, we promote international and in-
terdisciplinary cooperation."
"By using target-group-specific measures, Fresenius ad-
dresses the overall shortage of specialized hospital person-
nel."
"We thereby aim to recruit qualified and dedicated per-
sonnel, thus ensuring our high standard of treatment quality."
"Since January 1, 2019, the German hospital market has 
also been subject to the Ordinance on the Minimum Re-
quirements for Nursing Personnel in Hospitals (PpUGV)."
"Further statu-
tory regulations on minimum personnel levels in additional 
hospital departments with beds may further intensify com-
petition for qualified nursing staff."
"Helios Germany is there-
fore working intensively on additional measures to make it 
particularly attractive as an employer for nursing staff."
"These include the compatibility of family and career (e.g., 
through childcare facilities at hospital sites or the option of 
part-time work), attractive further and advanced training 
opportunities, occupational health management, and career 
opportunities."
"The Spanish hospital market is also in parts experienc-
ing a shortage of qualified nursing staff."
"Quirónsalud is un-
dertaking various measures to recruit and retain employ-
ees."
"This includes personnel marketing measures, person-
nel development programmes, market-driven remuneration 
and other measures to attract and retain qualified medical 
professionals."
"Further information about our measures for recruiting, 
developing, and retaining qualified personnel can be found 
in our separate Group Non-financial Report from page 146."
"Risk associated with research and development 
and product approval 
The development of new products and therapies always 
carries the risk that the ultimate goal might not be 
achieved, or it might take longer than planned."
"This is par-
ticularly true for our biosimilar products from Fresenius 
Kabi."
"The development of biosimilar products entails addi-
tional risks, such as significant development costs and the 
still-developing regulatory and approval processes."
"Regula-
tory approval of new products requires comprehensive, 
cost-intensive preclinical and clinical studies."
"Furthermore, there is a risk that regulatory authorities 
either do not grant, or delay, product approval, or withdraw 
an existing approval."
"In addition, adverse effects of our 
products that may be discovered after regulatory approval 
or registration may lead to a partial or complete withdrawal 
from the market, due either to legal or regulatory actions or 
our voluntary decision to stop marketing a product."
"Based on the re-
sults of a study investigating the routine use of HES in ac-
credited clinics, the EMA had advocated a suspension of 
the marketing authorization of HES-containing solutions, 
against which Fresenius Kabi has lodged an appeal."
"How-
ever, the EU countries were allowed to decide for them-
selves whether to implement the suspension of marketing 
authorization immediately or to make use of an 18-month 
transitional period."
"Follow-up studies as well as similar measures could also be 
taken by authorities in non-EU member states."
"Two regula-
tory studies have been conducted to evaluate the long-term 
safety and efficacy of our HES products in surgical and se-
verely injured (trauma) patients."
"The respective study re-
sults have been submitted to the Federal Institute for Drugs 
and Medical Devices (BfArM), which has confirmed that the 
requirements for lifting the suspension of the market au-
thorization have been met."
"The products may be authorized 
again in Germany."
"The Fresenius Group spreads its risk widely by conduct-
ing development activities in various product segments."
"We 
also counteract risks from research and development pro-
jects by regularly analyzing and assessing development 
trends and examining the progress of research projects."
"Furthermore, we strictly comply with the legal regulations 
for clinical and chemical-pharmaceutical research and de-
velopment."
"With IV drugs, it is also crucial that new products are 
continually brought to the market in a timely manner."
"Therefore, we monitor the development of new products on 
the basis of detailed project plans and focus on achieving 
specific milestones."
"In this way, we can take countermeas-
ures if defined targets are called into question."
"Fresenius Kabi is exposed to typical patent-related 
risks."
"These include insufficient protection by patents of the 
technologies and products we develop, which could enable 
competitors to copy our products without having to bear 
comparable development costs."
"In addition, the financing of our business ac-
tivities may give rise to interest rate risks which may also 
affect the value of our assets, in particular goodwill."
"In order to limit these risks, we use, among other 
things, derivative financial instruments."
"We restrict our-
selves to marketable instruments traded over the counter 
and use them exclusively to hedge underlying transactions, 
not for trading or speculative purposes."
"Transactions are 
conducted within limits approved by the Board of Manage-
ment, which are set depending on the counterparty's rat-
ing."
"For further information on the management of foreign 
currency risk and interest rate risk, please refer to the 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 341."
"Our foreign currency management is based on a pol-
icy approved by the Board of Management."
"It defines the 
objectives, organization and sequence of the risk manage-
ment processes."
"In particular, it defines who is responsible 
for identifying foreign currency risks, entering into hedging 
transactions and regular risk management reporting."
"The 
responsibilities correspond to the decision-making struc-
tures in the Group's other business processes."
"Decisions on 
the use of derivative financial instruments in interest rate 
management are generally made in close consultation with 
the Board of Management."
"With a few exceptions due to 
foreign exchange regulations, transactions with derivative 
financial instruments are carried out under the control of 
the Group Treasury of the Fresenius Group."
"They are sub-
ject to strict internal supervision."
"This ensures that the 
Management Board is always fully informed about all mate-
rial risks and about existing hedging transactions."
"In general, Fresenius is highly hedged against foreign 
currency and interest rate risks: Of the Group's financial li-
abilities as of December 31, 2023, approximately 83% 
were protected against an increase in interest rates by 
fixed-rate financing or interest rate hedges."
"Thus, around 
17% were subject to interest rate risk."
"A sensitivity analysis 
shows: If the reference interest rates relevant for Fresenius 
increase by 0.5 percentage points, this will affect the 
Group's net income by about 0.65%."
"As a global group, Fresenius is subject to foreign cur-
rency translation effects."
In view of the strong U.S.
"busi-
ness, the relationship between the U.S."
"dollar and the Euro 
plays a special role."
"Foreign currency exchange risks are 
not hedged."
"A sensitivity analysis shows that a change in the 
US dollar to the Euro of 1 cent would have an annual effect 
of around €20 million on Group sales, around €4 million on 
EBIT and around €3 million on the consolidated result."
"As a globally operating company, we have production 
capacities in all major foreign currency regions."
"In the ser-
vice businesses, our sales and cost base match to a high 
degree."
"Transaction risks in foreign currencies are quanti-
fied and managed using a cash flow-at-risk model."
"This 
analysis is based on the foreign currency cash flows that 
are reasonably likely to occur in the next twelve months, 
less any hedging that has been performed."
"As of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, the Fresenius Group's cash flow at risk was 
€25 million, i.e., with a probability of 95%, a potential loss 
from foreign currency cash flows in the next twelve months 
will not exceed €25 million."
"Further information on financial risks can be found in 
the Annex to the consolidated financial statements on 
pages 340 ff."
"Financial and non-financial reporting 
As a stock-listed company, Fresenius has the obligation to 
publish regular (quarterly) financial reports in accordance 
with current IFRS regulations."
"There is a risk that Fresenius 
does not comply with current IFRS regulations and / or that 
our reports do not represent true and fair financial report-
ing due to accounting errors."
"In addition, Fresenius is exposed to risks due to non-fi-
nancial reporting requirements."
"From 2024, the guidelines 
on sustainability reporting for companies and the corre-
sponding, comprehensive European standards on sustaina-
bility reporting will become binding for Fresenius."
"Taxes and duties 
As a global corporation, Fresenius is subject to numerous 
tax laws and regulations."
"Risks arising therefrom are identi-
fied and evaluated on an ongoing basis."
"Any changes in tax 
regulations or adjustments resulting from tax audits and 
additional duties, import levies, and trade barriers could 
lead to higher taxes and duties."
"In 2023, the Minimum Tax Act (MindStG) was passed in 
Germany, which serves to implement the Council Directive 
(EU) 2022 / 25234 to ensure global minimum taxation based 
on the OECD Pillar Two Model."
"Comparable laws have been 
passed in many other countries in which Fresenius con-
ducts business activities."
"Based on current analyses, the 
Fresenius Group estimates that the Pillar Two regulations 
may only have a minor impact on a small number of foreign 
subsidiaries."
"Accordingly, the Fresenius Group assumes 
that the application of the current Pillar Two rules will not 
have a substantial impact on the consolidated tax rate of 
the Fresenius Group in the financial years from 1 January 
2024 onwards."
"This includes compliance 
with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well 
as compliance with other country-specific data protection 
regulations."
"Breaches of these regulations or of the GDPR 
can result in substantial fines, damage to reputation, and 
loss of trust."
"The core element of data protection is the secure and 
lawful processing of personal data in accordance with these 
regulatory requirements."
"In addition to patient data, this 
also includes the personal data of employees as well as that 
of contractual partners and further persons."
"To comply with legal requirements, Fresenius has im-
plemented comprehensive data protection management 
systems, which provide the appropriate technical and or-
ganizational measures and controls for the protection of 
personal data."
"KGaA and all business 
segments maintain data protection organizations in accord-
ance with their organizational and business structures."
"This 
includes especially independent data protection officers re-
porting to the respective company’s management."
"Consequently, the business segments have implemented 
processes and standards also based on their organizational 
and business structures that provide internal guidelines for 
processing personal data in a secure and appropriate manner."
"Resulting from increasing internationalization, the depend-
ence of data protection and IT security / cybersecurity is 
considered within the data protection organization by en-
suring aligned and effective collaboration between the re-
spective departments."
"In addition, the individual data protection management 
systems also include appropriate control measures in order 
to adequately check compliance with regulatory and inter-
nal requirements."
"Further information about our data protection organiza-
tions and data protection management systems can be 
found in the Group Non-financial Report on page 176."
"Information technology and cybersecurity risks 
Digital information is a cornerstone and enabler for our 
global business as one of the leading healthcare groups."
"Ongoing digitization and digital transformation offer great 
opportunities for healthcare - with innovative technological 
and therapeutic approaches that improve patients' treat-
ment paths."
"Fresenius is continuously digitizing its pro-
cesses, opening up new markets with digital product solu-
tions, and taking into account that digitization is associated 
with cyber risks that can affect confidentiality, integrity, or 
availability."
"We continuously strive to strengthen our resilience to 
cyberattacks and reduce our cyber risks to avert harm to 
our patients, customers and the company."
"To this end, we 
conduct regular risk analyses along our value chains, as-
sess the cyber threat landscape and its implications for our 
infrastructures, critical systems and data in order to derive 
adequate risk mitigation measures."
"The overarching cyber risks that affect the Fresenius 
Group holistically include the theft and disclosure of per-
sonal and patient data, as well as trade secrets, attacks and 
associated failures of our IT infrastructures and applica-
tions, e.g."
"through malware, or the targeted manipulation 
of data."
"In addition, cyber risks exist in connection with the 
business activities of our respective business units: In the 
product business, these relate to the disruption of produc-
tion and logistics processes and the theft of intellectual 
property."
"In our healthcare facilities, cyber risks relate to 
patients, their patient data and the medical products or de-
vices used."
"The unavailability of IT systems in critical situa-
tions or the compromise of medical devices could nega-
tively affect patient safety and treatment effectiveness."
"The loss of sensitive data or non-compliance with data 
protection laws, regulations and standards could damage 
our competitive position, our reputation and the company 
as a whole."
"Furthermore, Fresenius or one of its Group 
companies could be subject to substantial fines in the event 
of a data protection breach."
"To comply with all legal re-
quirements, we have implemented comprehensive data 
protection management systems that provide for the appro-
priate technical and organizational measures and controls 
to protect personal data."
"Our stakeholders have great confidence in the cyber se-
curity of our products and services."
"To minimize cyber 
risks, we have implemented security architectures and con-
cepts that include preventive, detective and reactive 
measures."
"We can detect cyber threats at an early stage 
through monitoring mechanisms in our networks as well as 
on our end devices, such as desktops, servers, and mobile 
devices, among others."
"The security of applications that 
process sensitive patient or personal data is regularly 
checked by so-called penetration tests and red-teaming ex-
ercises that simulate targeted attacks."
"Critical systems, 
such as central communication systems or clinical infor-
mation systems, are subject to special protection concepts 
that can, for example, offset the failure of a system."
"Further 
information on our cyber security strategy, organization 
and measures can be found in our separate non-financial 
Group report on pages 142 ff."
"Acquisition 
processes often include closing conditions, including but 
not limited to antitrust clearance, fulfillment of assurances 
and warranties, and adherence to laws and regulations."
"Non-compliance with such closing conditions by either 
party to an acquisition could lead to litigation between the 
parties or with others and thus claims against Fresenius."
"Following an acquisition, the acquired company’s struc-
ture must be integrated while clarifying legal questions and 
contractual obligations."
"Marketing, patient services, and lo-
gistics must also be unified."
"During the integration phase, 
there is the risk that key managers will leave the company 
and that both the course of ongoing business processes 
and relationships with customers and employees will be 
harmed."
"In addition, change-of-control clauses may be 
claimed."
"The integration process may prove more difficult 
or require more time and resources than expected."
"Risks 
can arise from the operations of the newly acquired com-
pany that Fresenius regarded as insignificant or was una-
ware of."
"An acquisition may also prove to be less beneficial 
than initially expected."
"Future acquisitions may be a strain 
on the finances and management of our business."
"Moreover, 
as a consequence of an acquisition, Fresenius may become 
directly or indirectly liable towards third parties, or claims 
against third parties may turn out to be non-assertable."
"Furthermore, internal restructuring and transformation 
processes, such as currently at Fresenius Vamed, pose 
risks that can have a financial impact on the Fresenius 
Group."
"These processes are therefore very carefully moni-
tored by appropriate project teams in order to avoid the oc-
currence of largely unplanned costs as far as possible."
"The deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care and the 
associated investment character of the holding gives rise to 
a dividend risk for the Fresenius Group."
"This risk may arise 
from a deviation from the dividend payment planned in the 
financial planning."
"Therefore, we monitor market develop-
ments closely and adjust potential fluctuations in our finan-
cial planning accordingly."
"Compliance Risks 
Fresenius is subject to comprehensive government regula-
tion and control in nearly all countries."
"In addition, 
Fresenius must comply with general rules of law, which dif-
fer from country to country."
"There could be far-reaching le-
gal repercussions or reputation damage should Fresenius 
fail to comply with these laws or regulations."
"We must comply in particular with rules and regulations 
that monitor the safety and effectiveness of our medical 
products and services."
"Corruption is a core risk area across 
all business segments."
"Antitrust law, data protection, 
money laundering, sanctions, and the upholding of human 
rights are further significant risk areas."
"It is therefore of 
particular importance to us that our compliance programs 
and guidelines are strictly adhered to."
"Through 
compliance, we aim to meet our own expectations and those 
of our partners, and to orient our business activities to gen-
erally accepted standards and local laws and regulations."
"At Fresenius, risk-oriented compliance management 
systems are implemented in each business segment."
"These 
systems take into account the markets in which the respec-
tive business segment operates and are tailored to the spe-
cific requirements of the business segment."
"Furthermore, 
we at Fresenius assess compliance risks using a standard-
ized methodology."
"Our compliance programs set binding rules of conduct 
for our employees."
"We believe that we have taken adequate 
measures to ensure that national and international rules are 
observed and complied with."
"Nevertheless, even when a 
comprehensive compliance program is in place, individual 
cases of misconduct by individual employees or contractual 
partners cannot be ruled out, which could cause damage to 
the Company."
"Further information about our compliance management 
systems can be found in the Group Non-financial Report on 
page 169 ff."
"INSURANCE 
In its risk management, Fresenius uses the option to trans-
fer certain risks to external insurers."
"Fresenius Versiche- 
rungsvermittlungs-GmbH is the Fresenius Group’s insur-
ance department, which is organized as a captive insurance 
broker, and ensures appropriate insurance cover for large 
parts of the Group."
"Other sub-groups ensure adequate in-
surance coverage through their own departments."
"The aim 
is to protect the Company’s employees and assets against 
possible hazards within the risk management process by 
procuring insurance coverage that is appropriate to the 
risks."
"To this end, we purchase adequate coverage, taking 
into account the cost-benefit ratio."
"Our innovations enable us to offer products and ser-
vices that provide high-quality and affordable therapies 
to critically and chronically ill patients."
"We make a dif-
ference with our international expertise and interdisci-
plinary collaboration, which help us to optimize these 
offers."
"STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT 
OUR RESPONSIBILITY 
As a healthcare Group with more than 190,000 employees, 
Fresenius plays an important role in society."
"For more than 
100 years, our motivation has been to preserve life, pro-
mote health, and improve the quality of life for people who 
are ill."
"We aim to provide innovative products and services, 
and work proactively to enable a growing number of people 
to have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare."
"Our 
common goal is to improve healthcare quality and effi-
ciency."
The well-being of patients is always our top priority.
It is our point of reference for all our business decisions.
"For Fresenius, economic success is not an end in itself, 
but a means of continuously investing in medical progress 
and thus creating added value for society."
"THE BUSINESS MODEL 
Fresenius is a global healthcare Group and one of the lead-
ing companies in its respective markets."
"The Fresenius 
Group comprises three independently operating, fully con-
solidated business segments, managed by Fresenius 
SE & Co."
"KGaA as the operationally active Group holding 
company: Fresenius Kabi specializes in products for the 
treatment and care of critically and chronically ill patients."
"Fresenius Helios is Europe’s leading private healthcare 
provider."
"The company includes Helios Germany and He-
lios Spain, the largest hospital operators in their respective 
home markets, as well as the Eugin Group, which was sold 
on January 31, 2024."
"Fresenius Vamed delivers projects 
and services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities in-
ternationally and is a leading post-acute provider in Central 
Europe."
"The Corporate / Other segment comprises the 
holding functions of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and 
Fresenius Digital Technology GmbH, which provides infor-
mation technology services."
"HEALTHCARE MARKETS 
The business activities of the Fresenius Group are divided 
into the market segments healthcare products (Fresenius 
Kabi) and healthcare services (Fresenius Helios and 
Fresenius Vamed)."
"The majority of revenue (around 64%) 
is attributable to the area of healthcare services in the con-
text of patient care in the healthcare facilities of Fresenius 
Helios and Fresenius Vamed."
"In the area of healthcare 
products, Fresenius Kabi offers innovative solutions for 
critically and chronically ill patients."
"REVENUE BY MARKET SEGMENT 2023 
    
Material topics are presented as Group approaches."
"Fur-
ther, the material topics are presented by market segment, 
if their specific business activities require this."
"Information 
on the Fresenius Helios business segment includes all op-
erating and administrative units of the business segment, 
unless otherwise stated."
"This allows us to emphasize coun-
try-specific market conditions."
"In February 2023, Fresenius announced its intention to 
work towards a change in the legal form of Fresenius 
Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA to a stock corporation and to 
deconsolidate the business segment in this way."
"On July 
14, 2023, an Extraordinary General Meeting of Fresenius 
Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA approved the change of legal 
form to a stock corporation."
"Since the financial statement 
for the third quarter of 2023, Fresenius Medical Care has 
therefore no longer been included in the reporting on the 
operating activities."
"On November 30, 2023, the change of 
legal form of Fresenius Medical Care to a stock corporation 
became effective."
Further details can be found on pages 272 ff.
"in the 
Notes to the Consolidated financial statements."
"Further 
changes in the scope of consolidation of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA's scope of consolidation in the fiscal year 2023 are 
explained in the Group Management Report in the section 
Investment and acquisitions on pages 73 ff."
"and in the sec-
tion Acquisitions, divestments and investments starting on 
page 292 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
"With the announcement of the change in legal form in 
February 2023, steps were also taken to structurally imple-
ment the separation of the business segment of the Group."
"However, due to the stock exchange listing of both 
Fresenius and Fresenius Medical Care, both companies 
were already subject to strict requirements before the 
change of legal form, particularly in the area of compliance, 
and were highly independent."
"Furthermore, the change of legal 
form and deconsolidation have not changed the material 
topics for ESG reporting."
"The management approaches to 
these material topics are also not affected, as Fresenius 
Medical Care pursued its own governance approach in 
each case even before the change of legal form."
"Where 
Group approaches are described, they relate to the operat-
ing units of the business segments Fresenius Kabi, 
Fresenius Helios, and Fresenius Vamed, and the corporate 
functions of Fresenius SE & Co."
"Fresenius Medical Care publishes an Annual Report as 
well as a separate Non-financial Group Report."
"Further in-
formation can be found on the company’s website: 
www.freseniusmedicalcare.com."
"GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS 
The Fresenius Group’s business activities are subject to a 
wide range of regulatory requirements."
"These are supple-
mented, for example, by internal guidelines, management 
manuals, and process documentation."
"For units that are 
subject to external certification, the catalog of require-
ments resulting from the respective certifications, e."
"g., ISO 
(International Organization for Standardization), JCI (Joint 
Commission International), or GMP (Good Manufacturing 
Practice), is applied accordingly."
"The internal processes
and related documentation are continuously reviewed by 
the relevant specialist functions to determine whether an 
update to the internal guidelines is required due to changes 
in regulatory requirements or adjustments to the certifica-
tion criteria."
"Where references to specific regulations are 
useful for a better understanding of the material topics, 
process, and reporting structures, these are listed in the 
Group Non-financial Report."
"A comprehensive list of all rel-
evant regulations is not provided."
"The implementation and 
monitoring of compliance with relevant legal requirements 
and internal guidelines is within responsibility of the re-
spective specialist functions."
Our ethical values go beyond legal requirements.
"For 
us, this means acting not only in accordance with the law, 
but also in accordance with applicable industry codes and 
our values."
"If 
they are part of the remuneration of the Management 
Board, they are additionally explained in the Compensation 
Report on pages 222 ff."
"The Non-financial Report is audited 
with limited assurance, as explained in the independent 
practicioner’s report starting on page 201."
"Non-financial 
KPIs which are part of the remuneration of the Manage-
ment Board, are additionally audited with reasonable assur-
ance and are marked separately by footnote."
"In the Group 
Non-financial Report, additional key figures are reported 
that serve better understanding of the management ap-
proaches, control, or evaluation of the key non-financial 
topics."
"A comprehensive presentation of all internally rec-
orded key figures is not intended."
"OUR VALUE CHAIN 
Fresenius has subsidiaries in more than 60 countries, main-
tains an international distribution network and operates 
more than 50 production sites."
"In the Fresenius Group, all 
purchasing processes are managed by central coordination 
offices in the business segments."
"Competence teams pool 
requirements, conclude framework agreements, and con-
stantly monitor current market and price developments."
"They also coordinate global procurement for individual pro-
duction sites or healthcare facilities and initiate quality and 
safety checks on raw materials and procured goods."
"We are therefore constantly optimizing 
our purchasing processes, standardizing procurement ma-
terials, tapping into new purchasing sources, and negotiat-
ing the best possible price agreements."
"In doing so, it is 
important to maintain a high degree of flexibility and to 
meet our strict quality and safety standards."
"A broad sup-
plier portfolio reduces potential procurement or raw mate-
rial bottlenecks in both the product and service business."
"Further information on this can be found in the Group 
Management Report from page 26 onwards."
"SUSTAINABILITY RISKS AND CONTROLS 
The identification and assessment of potential sustainability 
risks (non-financial risks) initially takes place at both Group 
level and in the three business segments as part of the risk 
management system."
"Sustainability risks are covered by the 
Fresenius Group’s existing risk catalogs and risk reporting."
"As part of our risk management and the internal control 
cycle, key issues are regularly reviewed as described in the 
relevant sections of the Non-financial Report of the 
Fresenius Group."
"External partners, regulators, and inter-
nal audit experts conduct audits at least every two years, or 
more frequently."
"As explained in the Fresenius Group Op-
portunities and Risk Report on pages 87 ff., there were no 
deviations from the Group’s ethical standards in 2023."
"In-
formation on audits can also be found in the respective 
chapters of this report."
"As part of a Group-wide project to implement the re-
quirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Di-
rective1 (CSRD), an analysis was also conducted in the 2023 
reporting year to determine whether there are any further 
potential sustainability risks for material topics."
"Further in-
formation on this can be found in the Our materiality analy-
sis section on page 109."
"The Group 
Management Report contains further information on oppor-
tunities and risks as well as a detailed presentation of the 
risk management and internal control system from page 87 
onwards."
"In addition to identifying potential risks, the responsible 
functions are also tasked with designing internal processes 
to ensure that business operations can be quickly resumed 
or, at best, not disrupted in the event of an incident."
"At 
Group level, the Corporate Business Continuity function is 
responsible for corporate security, corporate crisis man-
agement, and travel security worldwide."
"Due to the interna-
tional nature of the Group and the wide range of security-
related tasks, those responsible deal with issues relating to 
the continuation or resumption of business operations dur-
ing or after crisis situations and also provide support in an 
operational context where necessary."
"Further information 
on business continuity is provided in the relevant chapters, 
if necessary."
"INTERNAL CONTROLS 
The internal control system is an important component of 
Fresenius’ risk management."
"It covers all critical processes, 
such as financial reporting, quality and patient safety man-
agement, cybersecurity, data protection, and sustainability 
management."
"Fresenius has documented the correspond-
ing key control objectives in a Group-wide framework, thus 
bringing together the various management systems in the 
internal control system in a holistic manner."
"Fresenius en-
sures the security and reliability of its processes with a 
large number of internal control measures, as well as their 
structured monitoring."
"Furthermore, the monitoring and 
evaluation by management help to ensure that process in-
herent risks are identified and that controls are in place to 
minimize these risks."
"INTERNAL AUDIT 
The regular internal and external controls, analyses and 
quality audits by the responsible specialist functions, topic-
specific management systems or external audit bodies are 
supplemented by the audit activities of the Internal Audit 
Group function."
It will replace the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) in future and will come into force gradually from the 2024 fiscal year onwards.
"To this end, Inter-
nal Audit conducts independent, objective audits to en-
hance the appropriateness and effectiveness of risk man-
agement, control and governance processes at all levels of 
the Group."
"Aspects such as ESG, cybersecurity and compli-
ance are also taken into account in a risk-oriented manner."
"In 2023, 36 audit engagements with different focus 
points and organizational topics were carried out."
"The audit 
results were analyzed by the responsible specialist func-
tions and incorporated into the continuous improvement of 
existing measures."
"If business segments conduct their own internal audits 
they review material topics, which is not under the control 
of the Group Internal Audit function."
"This encompasses, for 
example, audits of quality management provisions in the 
area of production."
"OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND PROGRAMS 
Advancing patient care is key to our daily work."
"It inspires 
us in how we understand our social responsibility, and how 
to act responsibly."
"We want to make a difference in 
healthcare and thus drive changes for the benefit of people, 
especially our patients."
At the level of Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA and the three 
business segments, we therefore pursue specific sustaina-
bility goals, set ambitions, and implement corresponding 
sustainability projects."
"Progress is regularly reviewed and 
evaluated."
"From this, we determine the extent to which the 
targets can be further developed and optimized."
"Further 
details on the respective targets are explained in the follow-
ing chapters."
"In May 2023, the Fresenius Annual General Meeting ap-
proved the adjustment of the compensation system for the 
members of the Management Board of Fresenius Manage-
ment SE."
"As part of the short-term variable compensation 
(short-term incentive --
- STI) with an assessment period of 
one year, ESG targets will continue to be included with a 
weighting of 15%."
"The focus here is on the areas of medi-
cal quality / patient satisfaction and employees."
"Medical 
quality / patient satisfaction is measured for the three busi-
ness segments on the basis of different key figures."
"Further 
information on this can be found in the Patient and product 
safety section starting on page 118."
"In the area of employees, employee satisfaction is 
measured on the basis of the Employee Engagement Index 
(EEI) for the Group."
"Further information on the EEI can be 
found in the Employees chapter starting on page 146."
"ESG criteria account for 25% of the target achievement 
for the long-term variable remuneration of the Manage-
ment Board (long-term incentive --
- LTI) with an assessment 
period of four years."
"ESG target achievement in the LTI is 
measured on the basis of CO2 reduction."
"The target corri-
dor is aligned with Fresenius’ long-term goals of reducing 
its own direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2; market-
based) CO2 emissions (calculated as CO2 equivalents) by 
50% in total by 2030 (base year 2020) and achieving cli-
mate neutrality by 2040."
"Further information on our climate 
target can be found in the Environment chapter on pages 
190 ff."
"In the reporting year, not all ESG targets for the members 
of the Management Board were achieved."
"A detailed 
presentation can be found in the Compensation Report in 
the 2023 Annual Report from page 222 onwards."
"The ESG 
methodology for determining target achievement is pub-
lished on the Fresenius SE & Co."
"OUR SUSTAINABILITY ORGANIZATION 
Fresenius Management SE is the general partner of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"At Fresenius, sustainability was 
within the responsibility of the Chairman of the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE until June 30, 
2023."
"The Group Management Board was informed about 
sustainability issues by the Investor Relations & Sustainabil-
ity department at least monthly."
"Due to the increasing im-
portance of sustainability, the organizational anchoring has 
been adjusted as of July 1, 2023."
"The Group Management 
Board member responsible for Legal, Compliance, Risk 
Management, ESG, Human Resources and for the business 
segment Fresenius Vamed (subsequently ESG Board mem-
ber) has overall responsibility for sustainability."
"The topic 
of sustainability has been separated from the Investor Rela-
tions & Sustainability Group function and the Group ESG 
function has been established."
"The function monitors regula-
tory developments, identifies key issues, and defines priori-
ties and opportunities for the implementation of the ESG 
strategy."
"It supports Group-wide implementation and re-
views progress as part of the annual reporting."
"Throughout 
the year, it aligns repeatedly with all Group functions and 
the ESG officers in the business segments to consider the 
respective business models and ensure the feasibility of 
measures."
"The Group ESG function is also responsible for 
internal and external stakeholder communication and, to-
gether with the Group Controlling function, for non-finan-
cial reporting."
"The ESG Steering Committee, which was newly cre-
ated at the end of 2023, consists of the ESG Board member 
(Chair), the Group ESG function, defined functions at 
Group level, and the ESG officers of the business segments."
"The committee will meet quarterly in the future starting in 
2024 and will be tasked with providing information on cur-
rent developments, deciding on appropriate measures to 
improve ESG performance, and monitoring the progress of 
implementation."
"The measures proposed by the ESG Steer-
ing Committee are submitted to the Fresenius Group Man-
agement Board for approval by the ESG Board member."
"The Management Board and the Supervisory Board re-
view the progress and results of sustainability manage-
ment, which are then published in the separate Group Non-
financial Report."
"The Supervisory Board is supported in 
this process by the audit performed by the external audi-
tors."
"The key figures that form part of the remuneration 
components of the Executive Board are audited with rea-
sonable assurance."
"The other key figures in the Group Non-
financial Report and the report itself are subject to a limited 
assurance review."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory 
Board has special responsibility for reviewing the Group 
Non-financial Report."
"The Supervisory Board as a whole is 
also responsible for monitoring Fresenius’ sustainability 
performance."
"Changes in the committees are presented in 
the 2023 Annual Report in the corporate governance state-
ment on pages 205 ff."
"and in the overview of the boards on 
pages 370 ff."
The departments and functions of Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA 
support the business segments in the development of 
guidelines and management concepts for the respective 
sustainability issues."
"The business segments have also each 
defined departments and persons responsible --
- often in the 
form of sustainability officers who coordinate all sustaina-
bility issues within the business segment."
"Other committees at segment level are explained in the 
respective sections on governance structures in this report 
where applicable."
"1 The overall structure shown in the graphic is valid as of January 1, 2024."
"This is carried out every two to three years, de-
pending on possible changes in the corporate structure and 
operating business performance."
"In addition, we review the 
material topics annually to ensure that they are up to date."
"Material are those aspects that are relevant for understand-
ing Fresenius’ business performance, results of operations, 
and position, as well as for understanding the effects of its 
business activities on non-financial aspects."
"We conducted our last comprehensive materiality analy-
sis in the 2020 reporting year."
"A review was carried out in 
the reporting year."
"The section on tax com-
pliance has also been included in the reporting, and the 
chapters on human rights and supply chain have been sum-
marized in the human rights chapter."
"However, these 
measures have not changed the fundamental process of 
identifying material topics."
"Rather, they confirm the effec-
tiveness and improved transparency of the reporting."
"Material issues also include environmental issues, among 
others."
"We also take into account the results of our commu-
nication with our stakeholders, as described in the follow-
ing section."
"In the reporting year, a Group-wide project was initi-
ated to implement the requirements of the CSRD, with the 
aim of preparing the basis for non-financial reporting from 
2024."
"Among other things, the project included a new ma-
teriality analysis based on the principle of double material-
ity to identify the material topics for the Fresenius Group."
"We will apply the results of the analysis to our non-financial 
reporting from the 2024 fiscal year."
"Based on the double 
materiality analysis, a gap analysis was conducted to iden-
tify the areas in which additional data and information must 
be collected in the future in order to fully meet the require-
ments of the CSRD."
"The projects required for data collec-
tion were launched in the reporting year."
"All relevant 
Group functions as well as departments at the business 
segment level are involved in the implementation."
"We gain valuable insights from this exchange, 
which we use to continuously develop the management of 
material topics as well as our reporting procedures."
"Our 
main stakeholders are presented in the graph aside."
"Our 
exchange with political institutions and external organiza-
tions is focused on the fields of healthcare and patient care."
"In addition to these stakeholders, other third parties, 
such as patients’ families and professional groups related 
to our products and services, may also be important stake-
holders in certain circumstances."
"To improve the readabil-
ity of this report, we have refrained from listing all relevant 
stakeholder groups for individual topics and have used the 
term third parties as a collective term where appropriate."
"Fresenius has signed the World Economic Forum’s 
Zero Health Gaps Pledge ahead of the 2024 World Eco-
nomic Forum in Davos."
"This commitment to promoting 
equal opportunities in healthcare is part of the Global 
Health Equity Network (GHEN), which brings together key 
players from the public and private sectors to advance a 
shared vision of equitable healthcare in line with the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"In early 2024, 
more than 80 companies have signed the world’s first vol-
untary commitment of this kind."
"By signing the pledge, 
Fresenius commits to acting responsibly and working to-
gether for equal opportunities in healthcare."
"STAKEHOLDER DIALOG IN ALL AREAS  
We communicate with our stakeholders through various 
channels: Fresenius’ corporate functions focus on those 
that are relevant to the Group as a whole."
"The business 
segments are in active contact with patients, customers, 
and regulatory authorities, among others."
"In particular, 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA is in constant contact with inves-
tors and analysts due to its stock market listing and clarifies
information requests."
"Further information can be found on 
pages 22 ff."
We plan to expand our stakeholder outreach.
"For the 
reporting year, we again took into account the require-
ments of rating agencies and regulatory requirements."
"The 
specialist and corporate functions contributed the views of 
their respective stakeholders."
"At the request of some stakeholders, we also re-
port ESG information in accordance with the TCFD (Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) reporting 
standard as well as an overview of material information and 
indicators in accordance with the requirements of the U.S."
"reporting standard SASB (Sustainability Accounting Stand-
ards Board)."
"This additional information is not part of the 
Group Non-financial Report and its business audit, but is 
made available on the website with a time delay, latest in 
the second quarter of the following year."
"Transparency in the healthcare sector 
In the healthcare sector, transparency with regard to busi-
ness conduct, patient information, and the quality of care is 
of great importance."
"Further information can be found in 
the Patient and product safety section starting on page 118."
"We undertake to comply with the codes and principles 
associated with membership of various associations."
"In ad-
dition, we disclose all benefits to healthcare professionals 
in the companies of the Fresenius Group in accordance 
with the disclosure requirements that apply to us."
"OUR WORK IN ASSOCIATIONS AND INITIATIVES 
Our employees contribute their expertise to national and 
international bodies, committees, and associations."
"In some 
cases, this is accompanied by industry agreements or com-
mitments."
"The following initiatives and memberships are 
currently of particular strategic importance for the business 
segments:

"EU TAXONOMY 
In the reporting year 2022, we reported on the EU Taxon-
omy eligibility and, for the first time, on the EU Taxonomy 
alignment of our economic activities for the environmental 
objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation."
"The as-
sessment of EU Taxonomy alignment of those activities will 
be mandatory as of the reporting year 2024."
"The EU Taxonomy reporting is conducted in accord-
ance with the mandatory disclosures required by the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020 / 852 of June 18, 2020 and 
the supplementing delegated acts."
"In the reporting year 2023, the deconsolidation of 
Fresenius Medical Care impacts the EU Taxonomy report-
ing."
"From the FAQ and its reference to IFRS 
5.33, it can be implied that Opex from Fresenius Medical 
Care is also not part of the Opex KPIs as Opex from discon-
tinued operations must also be presented separately."
"In 
contrast, investments of Fresenius Medical Care are part of 
the Capex KPIs for the period from January 1, 2023 to 
June 30, 2023."
"Capex are therefore presented in line with 
the financial details."
"Further information can be found in 
the Notes on pages 272 ff."
"We again compared the descriptions of economic activi-
ties from Annex I (climate change mitigation) and Annex II 
(climate change adaptation) to the Climate Delegated Act 
with our products and services, investment expenditures 
and expenses."
"For this purpose, further information on the revenue, 
Capex, and Opex KPIs has been discussed, collected and 
consolidated at business segment level and their divisions 
in a multi-stage process."
"The determination of the EU Tax-
onomy KPIs was based on our financial reporting system to 
ensure a complete and unambiguous reconciliation to the 
corresponding items in the annual financial statements and 
to avoid double counting."
"This process confirmed that, as in the previous years, 
we can focus on analysing the requirements relating to the 
environmental objective climate change mitigation."
"Analy-
sis has confirmed that none of the activities is considered 
an enabling activity under climate change adaptation, as 
only specific investments for so-called adapted activities 
are relevant, which have not been made in the reporting 
period."
"Further, due to the reasons mentioned before, the 
activities are treated as non-eligible under climate change 
adaptation because no such specific Capex has been in-
curred and turnover cannot be shown under climate 
change adaptation for adapted activities."
"Furthermore,  
RELEVANT ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES 
economic activities from the new environmental objectives 
must only be assessed regarding their EU Taxonomy align-
ment as of the reporting year 2024."
"In contrast to previous years, parts of our core business 
activities performed by Fresenius Kabi are now covered by 
the EU Taxonomy due to the extension of environmental 
objectives to be applied to date."
"This is reflected in the in-
creased EU Taxonomy-eligible revenue share."
"However, as 
a global healthcare Group with products and services for 
dialysis, hospital and outpatient care, some of our core 
business activities are still not covered by the environmen-
tal objectives."
"Our EU Taxonomy-eligible investments cover assets 
and processes that are directly related to EU Taxonomy-eli-
gible revenue activities as well as the purchase of output of 
from EU Taxonomy-eligible activities such as existing and 
new building infrastructure."
"For our Opex, EU Taxonomy-
eligible shares solely relate to assets and processes associ-
ated with EU Taxonomy-eligible revenue activities at 
Fresenius Kabi (especially research and development 
(R & D) expenses)."
"For this purpose, current construction projects 
of the business segments were analysed with the relevant 
technical experts to determine the applicability and level of 
compliance with the EU Taxonomy requirements."
"Substan-
tial contribution criteria for building activities under the en-
vironmental objective of climate change mitigation focus on 
energy efficiency."
"Some of these criteria exceed current le-
gal requirements substantially and are also not adjusted to 
the healthcare sector and the operational requirements for 
hospitals and healthcare facilities."
"Compliance with the EU Taxonomy criteria would 
therefore be partly contradictory to adherence with the hy-
giene and quality standards applicable to Fresenius."
"As a 
result, even the most energy-efficient hospitals and 
healthcare facilities do not currently meet the criteria of 
substantial contribution and Do No Significant Harm 
(DNSH) (e."
"g., primary energy demand lower than that of 
nearly zero-energy buildings, thresholds for water flow 
rates of water appliances, etc.)."
"In the future, we will continue to review and implement 
the EU Taxonomy alignment criteria in our construction 
projects, where feasible."
"EU Taxonomy alignment for the 
new economic activities of the Environmental Delegated 
Act must be initially reported for the fiscal year 2024."
"Compliance with the minimum safeguards is assessed 
for all activities by using a Group-wide approach."
"The crite-
ria for minimum safeguards are applied on the basis of the 
Final Report on Minimum Safeguards of the Platform on
Sustainable Finance from October 2022."
"Key topics are hu-
man and labour rights, bribery and corruption, fair compe-
tition, and taxation."
"Information on these topics can be 
found in the Group Non-financial Report and in the Notes 
on pages 179 ff., 169 ff."
"For the detailed tables in accordance with the EU Tax-
onomy Regulation, please refer to the Further key figures 
chapter on page 194."
"REVENUE 
Total revenue in fiscal year 2023 forms the denominator of 
the revenue KPIs and can be taken from the consolidated 
Group’s income statement prepared in accordance with IAS 
1."
"Of 
the Group's total amount €5,822 million, the majority of 
€5,088 million are related to the economic activity manu-
facture of medicinal products (1.2 pollution prevention and 
control) performed by Fresenius Kabi."
"In addition, €147 
million are associated with the manufacture of active phar-
maceutical ingredients (1.1 pollution prevention and con-
trol) and €170 million with the manufacture of electrical 
and electronic equipment (1.2 transition to a circular econ-
omy)."
"At Fresenius Vamed, €411 million are related to the 
economic activity construction of new buildings (7.1 cli-
mate change mitigation) and the remaining part to renova-
tion of buildings (7.2 climate change mitigation)."
"For the 
reporting year 2023, no further EU Taxonomy-eligible eco-
nomic activities are relevant for Fresenius."
"The EU Taxon-
omy-eligible economic activities of Annex I to the Climate 
Delegated Act do not currently meet the substantial contri-
bution criteria and are therefore not EU Taxonomy-aligned."
"For the mentioned EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activi-
ties of the Environmental Delegated Act, the assessment of 
EU Taxonomy-alignment is not necessary in fiscal year 
2023."
"CAPEX 
The amounts used to calculate the Capex KPI (denomina-
tor) are based on the capital expenditures reported in the 
consolidated financial statements resulting from additions
in the fiscal year to property, plant, and equipment (IAS 16) 
and intangible assets (IAS 38) excluding goodwill."
"In addi-
tion, the EU Taxonomy KPI takes into account right-of-use 
assets (IFRS 16)."
"That also includes the additions from 
business combinations."
"This information can be found in 
the Notes on pages 305, 307, and 329."
"For the identification of the EU Taxonomy-eligible share 
(numerator), the Capex projects of the business segments 
were examined in more detail on the basis of this defini-
tion."
"This was done by allocating the value-based compo-
nents to the relevant economic activities."
"As of the reporting year 2023, investments in 
the construction of new buildings for own use are reported 
under economic activity acquisition and ownership of 
buildings (7.7 climate change mitigation) instead of con-
struction of new buildings (7.1 climate change mitigation)."
"This change to an economic activity whose alignment crite-
ria better reflect Fresenius' hospital business in particular 
creates the prerequisite for possible future EU Taxonomy 
alignment."
"The EU Taxonomy-eligible Capex share 2023 (44.3%) 
essentially relates to investments of all business segments 
in new construction and renovation of buildings, such as 
clinics or production facilities."
"In 2022, the share was 
36.7%."
"For Capex associated with the purchase of products 
and services from an EU Taxonomy-eligible economic ac-
tivity, €183 million relate to the renovation of buildings (7.2 
climate change mitigation), consisting entirely of additions 
to buildings and additions to assets under construction."
"Of the total EU Taxonomy-eligible 
Capex share €0 million resulted from business combina-
tions."
"For the reporting year 2023, no further EU Taxon-
omy-eligible economic activities are relevant for Fresenius."
"The EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activities of Annex I 
to the Climate Delegated Act do not currently meet the 
alignment criteria and are therefore not EU Taxonomy-
aligned."
"For the mentioned EU Taxonomy-eligible eco-
nomic activities of the Environmental Delegated Act, the as-
sessment of EU Taxonomy-alignment is not necessary in 
fiscal year 2023."
"OPEX 
The amounts used to calculate the Opex KPI (denominator) 
are based on the direct costs of research and development 
reported in the consolidated financial statements (Notes, 
page 298) and the costs of short-term leases (Notes, page 
329)."
"In addition, the cost of maintenance and repair in-
cluding repair materials, were queried from the local man-
agement reporting systems for all business segments."
"For the identification of EU Taxonomy-eligible shares 
(numerators), the above line items were matched with the 
descriptions of the economic activities."
"As part of 
the analysis, we identified that material EU Taxonomy-eli-
gible Opex components relate in particular to non-capital-
ized R & D costs as well as costs of short-term leases and 
costs of maintenance and repair which are directly attribut-
able to EU Taxonomy-eligible revenue."
"The main expendi-
tures for the maintenance of our building infrastructure, 
however, are capitalized and are thus reflected in the EU 
Taxonomy-eligible Capex share."
"For the mentioned EU Taxonomy-eligible eco-
nomic activities of the Environmental Delegated Act, the as-
sessment of EU Taxonomy-alignment is not necessary in 
fiscal year 2023."
"FOSSIL GAS RELATED ACTIVITIES 
Fresenius Kabi and Fresenius Helios operate gas turbines, 
and combined heat and power plants to generate electric-
ity, heat, and steam from fossil fuels for own use."
"Fresenius' activities in the area of the operation of com-
bined heat, cool and power generation facilities using fossil 
gaseous fuels are not material."
"Fresenius does not carry out 
any other nuclear and fossil gas related activities."
"Fresenius is committed to providing access to 
high-quality and affordable therapies to as many people as 
possible worldwide."
"We believe equal opportunity in 
healthcare is a moral obligation and an economic benefit to 
society."
"Reporting in this chapter encompasses two categories 
that we deem essential: 
► 
Access to healthcare and medicine
► 
Patient and product safety
ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND MEDICINE 
Every year, we assume responsibility for the well-being of 
millions of patients."
"We offer lifesaving products and thera-
pies."
"In their development, we consider different social and 
regulatory requirements and adapt them to different 
healthcare systems."
"This enables us to meet the growing 
global demand for innovative, high-quality and affordable 
therapies."
"Numerous research projects and studies are car-
ried out in our business segments."
"In this way, we investi-
gate and develop new treatment standards, improve cur-
rent standards, e."
"g., by studying side effects by biological 
sex or age group, and facilitate best practice exchange be-
tween our healthcare professionals."
"Further, in our 
hospitals in Spain and Germany, various approval studies 
for pharmaceuticals are conducted."
"We report on our clini-
cal study management in the Innovation chapter from page 
132 onwards."
"Our range of products and services includes the ser-
vices of a comprehensive network of hospitals, post-acute 
care solutions --
- such as rehabilitation --
- and high-quality 
drugs and medical products."
"We also embrace digitaliza-
tion and develop advanced therapies, and measures de-
signed to expand primary care in emerging and developed 
countries."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
Our products are often used to treat people with serious or 
chronic diseases."
"Our task is to ensure the safety and  
quality of our products and services and to meet the high-
est safety and quality standards for all processes and thera-
pies."
"In 2023, we treated nearly 26 million patients at our 
hospitals, of which more than 23 million were outpatients 
and more than 2 million were inpatients."
"We achieved our 
quality targets."
"Further details can be found on page 118 in 
the Patient and product safety section."
"We want to simplify access to healthcare and medicine 
through, for example, digital processes and applications."
"In 
this way, we aim to reduce long waiting times for appoint-
ments in our facilities."
"Fresenius Helios in Spain, for exam-
ple, is pursuing the ambition of providing 70% of patients 
with an initial consultation within seven days."
"In the report-
ing year, we surpassed this goal with a rate of 78%."
"In ad-
dition, more patients are to be treated in less time in future."
"In order to achieve this, Helios Spain places diagnostic ex-
aminations before medical consultations whenever possi-
ble."
"Further details can be found on page 137 in the Digital 
transformation chapter."
"All people should be able to benefit from our healthcare 
services --
- and not experience any disadvantage due to a 
lack of financial resources or their geographical location."
"The goal of our healthcare services market segment is 
therefore to improve access to medical care, for example, 
by expanding the medical infrastructure and collaborating 
with organizations and initiatives."
"OUR APPROACH 
Fresenius’ long-term goal is to further develop its position 
as one of the leading international providers of healthcare 
products and services."
"In recent years, we have expanded 
our company along our value chain --
- increasing the global 
availability of our products and services."

nius transformation was launched in February 2023 with 
the aim of positioning the company with a clear focus for 
future growth."
"With our comprehensive range of products, which also 
includes generics and biosimilars, we provide access to 
modern, high-quality, and affordable therapies for patients."
"Generics and biosimilars are cost-effective alternatives to 
originator drugs."
"To pro-
mote accessibility and affordability of healthcare products 
in a resilient way, we support various programs and work 
together with other companies in industry associations."
"As many people as possible worldwide should have the 
chance to participate in this progress."
"We therefore want to 
help make access to health services more equitable world-
wide and support the development of stable health systems."
"This means we want to make treatment and health educa-
tion available to everyone who needs them, irrespective of 
age, income, race or ethnicity, or education."
"This ambition 
is particularly reflected in our commitment to society."
"In 
January 2024, Fresenius signed the Zero Health Gaps 
Pledge to promote equal opportunities in healthcare."
"Fur-
ther information can be found in the chapter Strategy and 
management on page 110."
"Among others, we cooperate with international organi-
zations such as Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without 
Borders)."
"A collaboration with Friedensdorf International, 
for example, makes it possible for Helios Germany to treat 
children from crisis regions free of charge in its clinics."
"In 
2023, more than 40 children benefited from this engage-
ment in our German hospitals and received either inpatient 
or outpatient treatment."
"Ensuring the availability of our products and access to 
our services is an important concern for us, including be-
yond crisis areas: avoiding bottlenecks in the supply of im-
portant medications is also a priority."
"This also includes our 
own facilities."
"Integrated healthcare concepts 
In recent years, healthcare providers, regulatory authori-
ties, and insurance companies around the world have been 
working to improve treatment outcomes for patients while 
simultaneously reducing healthcare costs."
"This benefits- 
and results-oriented concept is known as value-based 
healthcare."
"This scientific approach confirms our long-standing 
strategy: systematic establishment of regional care clusters 
and interdisciplinary knowledge sharing among experts, 
from which all hospitals in our network can benefit."
"Pa-
tients should benefit from the focus on technological ad-
vances, innovative treatment options, and our investments 
in high-level healthcare infrastructure and technical equip-
ment."
"With this approach, we want to help to tackle the in-
creasing cost pressure for insurers and relieve the burden 
on healthcare systems."
"We firmly believe that combining healthcare facilities, 
known as cluster formation, can prove beneficial both for 
the quality of healthcare and when it comes to the potential 
for reducing costs."
"In the hospital sector, one of the ways 
we are pursuing this approach is through our choice of ac-
quisitions in recent years."
"The aim with these choices is to 
link together the special care offerings of the individual 
hospitals, and to jointly improve quality, e."
"g., in oncology 
care or stroke treatment, through cluster conferences."
"This 
type of networking makes it possible to offer expensive and 
labor-intensive treatments within a hospital cluster without 
having to provide them at every location."
"Helios Germany, for example, supports certain projects that 
involve deploying multidisciplinary teams following surgi-
cal interventions in order to help speed up and improve pa-
tients’ recovery."
"One focus is on rapid mobilization after 
operations."
"This includes, for example, the Ortho-Campus 
model, in which surgery and rehabilitation are brought 
closer together."
"Further examples include Helios Ger-
many’s Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) initiatives 
and the certification of endoprosthetic centers in accord-
ance with the ENDO-Klinik standards."
"Another consequence of demographic change is the 
shortage of skilled workers."
"The ageing of society requires 
extensive, longer-lasting medical care for the population."
"This poses major challenges for the limited resources on 
the market for medical professionals."
"In order to counter the specific effects on healthcare, 
Helios Spain is pursuing the goal of significantly optimizing 
care processes."
"For example, the structured medical infor-
mation already obtained with the help of digitalized pro-
cesses is to be linked to a newly generated healthcare 
model."
"This should give doctors more capacity to provide 
valuable care to an increasing number of patients."
"Further 
details can be found on pages 137 ff."
"in the Digital transfor-
mation chapter."
"To ensure this, we have established high-performance and 
resilient emergency systems and programs in our business 
segments."
"Crisis situations are unforeseen events that may have an 
impact on the company or society, for example."
"In the 
healthcare products market segment, we have a crisis 
team for emergency situations that is summoned immedi-
ately after an event that could lead to a crisis."
"The crisis 
team comprises members of the Fresenius Kabi Manage-
ment Board, key staff units, and other relevant functions of 
the business segment."
"It coordinates the activities to main-
tain business operations and monitors the measures specif-
ically defined and initiated to deal with a crisis."
"Members of 
the crisis team and representatives of the business units 
are also responsible for coordinating product donations if 
these are requested by affected countries, e."
"g., in the event 
of a natural disaster or war."
"Fresenius Kabi has a long-standing partnership with action 
medeor e."
"This non-governmental organization trans-
ports our product donations to crisis areas and delivers 
them on-site."
"In the reporting year, one truck with vital 
medical supplies drove to Syria to support the medical 
treatment and care for patients after the earthquake in Feb-
ruary 2023."
"In the healthcare services market segment, there are le-
gal requirements for how care is to be organized in the 
event of an emergency."
"Accordingly, we have dedicated 
emergency plans to respond immediately to incidents that 
might be critical for patients."
"They encompass, among 
other aspects, evacuation plans, emergency systems in case 
of interruption of power or water supply, and plans to re-
spond to impacts on local infrastructure, e."
"Emergency power generators ensure that operations or 
vital therapies, such as artificial respiration, can continue 
even in the event of a power failure."
"PATIENT AND PRODUCT SAFETY 
The safety of our patients is our priority, and it plays a cen-
tral role in our management approaches."
"Patient safety and 
the unrestricted operation of healthcare facilities can be at 
risk from various factors."
"For example, disruptions in the 
process flow, such as natural disasters or technical failure, 
pose a risk to patients and the healthcare facilities."
"In addi-
tion, there are operational risks, for example potential hy-
giene deficiencies, that could jeopardize product safety and 
the health of patients."
"We counter these risks through 
structured processes, training, and quality management 
systems, among other things, and work to continuously im-
prove patient and product safety."
"Transparent information 
for the public is also part of our safety and quality commit-
ment."
"The potential consequences that non-financial risks 
can have for Fresenius are described in our Opportunities 
and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"In the following, we explain our approach to patient and 
product safety."
"In addition, this section covers specific in-
formation from the market segments healthcare products 
(Fresenius Kabi) and healthcare services (Fresenius Helios 
and Fresenius Vamed)."
"To achieve this, we set our-
selves specific targets in the business segments."
"These targets are part of the short-term variable com-
pensation of the Management Board."
"Further information 
can be found in this chapter as well as in the Compensation 
Report in the Annual Report 2023, pages 222 ff."
"OUR APPROACH 
At Fresenius, our aspiration is to provide patients with the 
best possible care."
"Therefore, we offer medical treatments 
and products that meet our strict requirements for quality 
and safety."
"in the independent practi-
tioner´s report."
"For healthcare professionals, relevant 
information on pharmaceutical products or medical equip-
ment is provided through dedicated communication chan-
nels, for example websites, and trained experts from our 
business segments."
"Training also encompasses acting with 
integrity and responsibility with third parties, if required 
for an individual function or an area of responsibility."
"Organization and responsibilities  
Within the Group Management Board, the Board member 
responsible for Legal, Compliance, Risk Management, ESG, 
Human Resources and for the business segment Fresenius 
Vamed steers strategic Group-wide provisions within his 
responsibilities."
"The Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of the 
business segments are responsible for operational manage-
ment."
"The responsibility for patient and product safety or 
quality management and quality assurance, respectively, is 
regulated by the respective Management Board committees 
or managements, e."
"g., via a business allocation plan."
"The 
business allocation plan of the Group Management Board 
does not provide for a separate department for this pur-
pose."
"As part of risk reporting, the Group Management
Board is informed quarterly."
"The effectiveness of the qual-
ity management systems is discussed, if risks were identi-
fied or incidents occurred that could have a significant im-
pact on the operating business, the reputation, or the value 
chain of the Group and its business segments."
"The Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed about de-
velopments on a half-year basis, the Supervisory Board on 
an annual basis."
"For further information, please refer to the 
Opportunities and Risk Report on page 87 onwards and to 
the Compliance section on page 169 onwards."
"In the business segments, employees must ensure that 
the applicable quality and safety regulations are always ap-
plied in their areas of responsibility."
"The employees in the 
production facilities, outpatient centers, and hospitals have 
a special obligation to exercise due care."
"The organiza-
tional structures and controls are adapted to the require-
ments of the individual business segments."
"In the area of quality management, we monitor, man-
age, and improve processes with the support of perfor-
mance indicators."
"Our quality management systems meet 
and are based on various standards or are adapted to them, 
because the requirements differ for healthcare facilities and 
for the development, production, and distribution of phar-
maceuticals or even medical-technical products."
"We use 
different applications, such as externally provided IT sys-
tems or self-developed applications, to support our quality 
management systems."

"Guidelines and regulations  
We comply with the applicable laws within quality manage-
ment."
"Internationally applicable frameworks are particu-
larly important for product quality at our production sites 
and distribution centers and subsequently also for product 
safety."
"We assess the effectiveness of our management sys-
tems based on key performance indicators (KPIs) which are 
explained on pages 121 ff."
"In our clinics and healthcare facilities, we apply interna-
tionally recognized standards from the hospital sector and 
local regulatory requirements and laws for the outpatient 
and inpatient care of patients, e."
"g., the Fifth Book of the 
Social Code (SGB V) in Germany, which regulates basic  
requirements for quality assurance."
"We measure the 
quality of patient care, patient safety and, patient satis-
faction with various indicators."
"In addition, hygiene provi-
sions in our healthcare facilities are monitored based on 
specific parameters."
"Depending on the business area and market, we are 
subject to further specific regulatory requirements and 
standards."
"This includes legislation on the Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals 
(REACH), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), 
and the Medical Device Regulation (MDR), among other 
standards."
"In addition, we have to adhere to regulations 
that specify products used in patient treatments, e."
"g., prod-
uct safety provisions with regard to hazardous materials in 
single-use products in hospitals."
"In addition, the business segments follow their own 
guidelines, which contain concrete instructions for specific 
processes."
"Responsible marketing, advertising, and sales in 
our product segments are controlled via internal guidelines 
and external regulatory provisions applicable to healthcare 
companies."
"For our healthcare services business, ethical 
marketing regulation applies based on regulatory provi-
sions regarding reimbursement schemes by healthcare au-
thorities and insurance providers."
"These provisions are also
incorporated into our compliance guidelines in our busi-
ness segments."
"Information on this is provided in the Com-
pliance section on pages 169 ff."
"and our Opportunities and 
Risk Report on pages 87 ff."
"Our commitment to patients’ health and well-being is 
reviewed and certified by external partners or regulatory 
bodies."
"We are continuously expanding the number of sites 
certified to ISO 9001 standard, applicable internationally 
acknowledged care or hospital standards, or quality stand-
ards provided for centers of expertise for certain areas of 
treatment."
"All new hospitals are subject to this certification 
process in the year following their opening or takeover."
"In 
Spain, 94% of hospitals were certified according to ISO 
9001 in the reporting year."
"Further clinics have also imple-
mented reporting in accordance with this standard."
"Not all locations have the same scope of certifications, 
as the coverage at business segment level depends on the 
standards or specifications to be applied."

The Fresenius Group quality management approach is con-
trolled by internal specialists or dedicated functions within 
the business segments."
"Relevant data is reviewed regularly, 
in some cases daily."
"If deviations occur, our specialists ini-
tiate root cause analyses or peer reviews; they evaluate de-
viations and, if necessary, determine corrective or preven-
tive actions."
"Regular internal audits and self-inspections --
- 
at least annually --
- as well as external reviews and audits, 
support data verification and management approaches, for 
certified and non-certified entities."
"In this way, we ensure 
that patient health activities comply with internal guidelines 
and regulatory provisions."
"The overarching ambition is to 
enhance the efficiency and coverage of our quality manage-
ment systems and, ultimately, the credibility of the proce-
dures and systems in place."
"HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS MARKET SEGMENT: 
FRESENIUS KABI 
Goals and ambitions 
An important goal of the quality management at Fresenius 
Kabi is to monitor the applicability, efficacy, and safety of 
products and services, as well as the success of therapies, 
and their continuous improvement."
"To ensure this, the 
company has established an integrated quality manage-
ment system, a monitoring and reporting system, and prod-
uct risk management."
"Organization and responsibilities 
Since December 2023, the central function Quality Man-
agement reports directly to the member of the extended 
leadership team of Fresenius Kabi (Executive Leadership 
Team --
- ELT), which is responsible for the function Tech-
nical Operations & Quality."
"Further quality assurance functions 
are defined throughout the business segment to ensure ad-
herence and compliance with the business-segment-wide 
standards and requirements."
"Guidelines and regulations 
Fresenius Kabi’s quality management system is organized 
in accordance with the ISO 9001 standard and is binding 
for all organizations of the business segment."
"Compliance 
with the standard is reviewed by TÜV SÜD in annual audits 
at a global level and covers 123 Fresenius Kabi organiza-
tions through a matrix certification; one further organiza-
tion holds a local ISO 9001 certificate."
"In addition, numer-
ous manufacturing plants have supplementary certifica-
tions, such as ISO 13485 for medical devices, a food safety 
management system according to ISO 22000, or GMP in 
general for pharmaceuticals."

"Fresenius Kabi regularly conducts internal quality audits to 
ensure the effectiveness of the quality management system 
and compliance with internal and external standards and 
requirements."
"Suppliers are subject to a qualification pro-
cess based on the relevance of the delivered material or 
service."
"Also, the supplier’s qualification and their recertifi-
cation are audited every three to five years."
"Inspections by 
regulatory authorities and audits by independent organiza-
tions are performed along the value chain at Fresenius 
Kabi."
"Fresenius Kabi promptly takes steps to deal with any 
weaknesses or deficiencies discovered during inspections."
"In 2023, Fresenius Kabi performed 58 internal audits."
"Based on the respective deviations, an audit and in-
spection score is calculated by Fresenius Kabi."
"The score 
is calculated by addition of the number of critical and major 
observations identified during GMP inspections by the au-
thorities mentioned above and the number of non-conform-
ities identified during TÜV SÜD ISO 9001 audits, divided
by the overall number of these inspections and audits."
"Criti-
cal observations or deviations, if any, or certification status 
withdrawal are weighted with a defined multiplier."
"The 
score shows the average number of major deviations identi-
fied during the inspections and audits considered."
"Observations have been and will continue to be ad-
dressed by corrective and preventive actions (CAPAs) and 
effectiveness checks have been and will continue to be de-
fined."
"The observations neither impacted the GMP certifi-
cation nor the ISO 9001 certificate."
"In 2023, no events with a material adverse impact were 
recorded that conflict with our aforementioned quality 
management goals."
"The statutory pharma-
covigilance commitments relate to our medicinal products 
for human use."
"Similar regulations exist for medical de-
vices."
"Fresenius Kabi has established various standard op-
erating procedures for the continuous monitoring of the 
benefit-risk ratio of its products and assesses their success-
ful implementation based on specific indicators."
"The com-
panies vigilance activities are designed to ensure the safety 
of its products: in this way, the company can identify any 
changes in the benefit-risk ratio of its products at an early 
stage and react in a timely manner."
"Fresenius Kabi’s Cor-
porate Safety Officers are responsible for the global vigi-
lance system."
"These functions help to ensure that the com-
pany can respond quickly to safety-relevant events."
"Fresenius Kabi promptly informs its customers and the 
public about matters or measures concerning product and 
patient safety; this may be done directly or through appro-
priate public channels, if applicable."
"These early-warning systems are designed in such a 
way that trained complaints and safety officers worldwide 
record complaints and side effects in IT systems and for-
ward the respective information to experts for review."
"Fresenius Kabi collects and assesses reports about indi-
vidual side effects and reports them to health authorities 
worldwide in accordance with regulatory requirements."
"The business segment aims to submit all safety reports in 
accordance with the applicable regulations and therefore  
COMPLIANCE RATES QUALITY 
strives to report 100% of the Individual Case Safety Re-
ports (ICSRs) to the authorities in time."
"In addition, Fresenius Kabi regularly evaluates the  
benefit-risk ratio of its products based on safety-related in-
formation from various sources (e."
"g., adverse event re-
ports, medical literature)."
"The results of these analyses are 
submitted to authorities as periodic safety reports."
"Fresenius Kabi aims to submit all periodic safety reports 
worldwide to authorities in due time."
"In 2023, the benefit-
risk ratio of all pharmaceutical products remained un-
changed."
"According to regulatory requirements, Fresenius Kabi, 
as a pharmaceutical company, is obliged to describe its vig-
ilance system in a Pharmacovigilance System Master File 
(PSMF)."
"Fresenius Kabi uses a global database to collect 
and evaluate vigilance data on a quarterly basis from all lo-
cal marketing and sales units for the PSMF."
"The goal is to 
receive timely data from all marketing and sales units 
worldwide."
"1 The calculation of the audit and inspection indicator takes into account all audits and inspections carried out in the reporting year for which information on deviations is available by the end of January 
of the following year."
"2 The KPI as part of the short-term variable remuneration (STI) of the Management Board is audited with reasonable assurance, as explained in the independent practitioner´s report starting on page 
201."
"These include important events, 
e.g., reports about side effects with a fatal outcome, to
evaluate if new information is available about a known side
effect profile or a new side effect of a product leading to a
changed benefit-risk profile."
"No such information became
known for the business segment’s products in the reporting
year."
"In the reporting year 2023, Fresenius Kabi accom-
plished very good compliance ratios for the quality-related 
reporting."
"In cases where targets were not achieved, 
measures were internally initiated to ensure that a timely 
submission of reports will be conducted in future."
"Product risk management 
Globally responsible safety officers react promptly when 
Fresenius Kabi becomes aware of potential quality-related 
issues."
"They initiate and coordinate necessary actions 
worldwide, such as product recalls."
"With its early-warning 
system, Fresenius Kabi evaluates any quality-related infor-
mation from various risk areas to identify risks early and 
take corrective and preventive actions."
"Information is ob-
tained from databases for complaints and side effects, in-
ternal and external audits, and from key performance indi-
cators used for internal control and optimization of quality 
processes."
"With these systems, Fresenius Kabi evaluates 
the safety profile of its products at a global level."
"We ensure through internal procedures that we can react 
promptly and adequately, if new adverse drug reactions are 
identified for one of Fresenius Kabi’s products."
"These new 
side effects are communicated to healthcare professionals 
via a specified format called a Dear Health Care Profes-
sional Letter in a timely manner."
"We thus help to ensure 
that patients are treated with products that meet our safety 
standards."
"In the reporting year, the benefit-risk ratio of no 
product changed due to new side effects."

Labeling and product information 
Fresenius Kabi’s products are classified, e."
"g., as pharma-
ceuticals, nutritional products, active pharmaceutical ingre-
dients, or medical devices, based on global or national reg-
ulations and standards."
"The marketing of these products is 
subject to various laws and regulations to ensure complete 
and fact-based product information."
"Fresenius Kabi has a 
global policy and global standard operating procedures for 
its product information to ensure that it is in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations and that the product 
information for correct use is clear, accurate, and not mis-
leading."
"The products of Fresenius Kabi are also subject to certain 
labeling requirements."
"The labeling of the products is 
checked regularly as part of the regulations and vigilance 
activities --
- e."
"g., compliance with laws relating to side ef-
fects of medicinal products --
- and updated if necessary."
"For 
example, product labeling is updated if competent authori-
ties, e."
"g., the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Commit-
tee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), pub-
lish relevant information."
"The dedicated function at 
Fresenius Kabi uses an electronic management system for 
product labeling to manage the information necessary for 
labeling or printed packaging material and to ensure its 
correctness."
"The requirements of the European Falsified 
Medicines Directive or the U.S."
"Drug Supply Chain Security 
Act (DSCSA) lead the way in this context."
"Fresenius Kabi 
takes into account their specifications and has introduced 
appropriate processes for serialization, testing, and tracea-
bility for the relevant products."
"Further information on 
transparency in healthcare can be found in the Strategy 
and management chapter on page 111."
"Besides quality of treatment, we also measure and con-
trol KPIs related to patient safety."
"Helios Germany has an-
chored the implementation of measures derived from liabil-
ity cases in a focus target on patient safety for hospital 
management as well as chief physicians."
"This aims to pro-
mote the processing of patient-safety-related incidents and 
the development of preventive measures."
"Helios sets company goals to measure the quality of 
treatment in its hospitals, using the España Inpatient Qual-
ity Indicator (E-IQI) methodology in Spain and the G-IQI 
methodology in Germany."
"These indicators are collected as 
metrics and are a quantitative measure that can be used to 
assess and evaluate medical quality."
"Each inpatient hospital 
treatment (inpatient case) is evaluated by making use of 
comparative measurements, with the benchmark being the 
German national average as calculated by the Federal Sta-
tistical Office or comparable national benchmarks in Spain."
"The target is in each case to be better than the national av-
erage for the respective indication."
"Further quality targets 
in our hospitals in Spain relate to patient satisfaction and 
are measured via the Net Promoter Score (NPS), among 
other methods."
"In the reporting year 2022, Helios Spain updated its patient 
safety strategy for the period 2023 to 2026, which is funda-
mental to various objectives and their improvement."
"It was 
expanded from seven to eight strategic line topics."
"It thus 
covers the most important fields of action of Fresenius He-
lios in Spain and Latin America to ensure that high-quality 
care is provided in the hospitals and that patient safety is 
guaranteed."
"New targets are: patient safety and digitaliza-
tion, qualification and safety of specialists, as well as pa-
tient safety in specific health processes (pregnancy, birth, 
and postpartum period; time-dependent pathologies; fragile 
patients)."
"The objectives add strategic relevance to the 
measures and processes already established for all the hos-
pitals we manage in Spain."
"Organization and responsibilities 
The business segment Fresenius Helios is managed by the 
holding company Helios Health."
"Due to the different na-
tional regulatory frameworks and standards as well as dif-
ferences in the business models, the responsibility for pa-
tient and product safety lies with the management of the in-
dividual divisions."
"The structure of the management ap-
proaches of the divisions is regulated within the respective 
managements, for example via a business allocation plan."
"The task of the quality management steering  
committee in Germany is to coordinate the central steering 
processes of medical quality management and patient 
safety measures on a quarterly basis."
"Also on a quarterly 
basis, the medical management committees of the hospitals 
evaluate all reportable key figures together with the medi-
cal consultants."
"Reporting meetings are subsequently held 
with the steering committee on those facilities which report 
deviations such as suspicious quality indicators or reported 
cases relating to patient safety, in order to determine 
measures that still need to be implemented during the 
course of the year."
"These range from peer reviews at the 
hospital level, for example, to location-wide quality man-
agement measures at the corporate level, if necessary."
"The leading physicians in their respective fields come 
together to form the total of 30 Helios specialist groups."
"They ensure that the knowledge of their medical specialty 
is anchored in all hospitals and represent this internally and 
externally."
"They also advise and decide on the introduction 
of standard processes, the selection of medical products, 
sensible innovations, and on campaigns."
"Furthermore, they 
discuss results from clinical trials and derive possible 
changes in treatment approaches from them."
"The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) function at Helios 
Spain is responsible for the coordination of patient care 
and safety, as well as research."
"The function is supported 
by the Corporate Operations department, whose focus is on 
improving therapies and other healthcare offerings, as well 
as developing and marketing digital applications in the out-
patient sector."
"The CMO is also responsible for defining annual targets 
in the area of quality, as well as patient safety and satisfac-
tion."
"These targets are included in the contracts both for di-
rectly employed doctors as well as contract doctors."
"Furthermore, the Corporate Risk Unit in Spain has been 
created to improve risk management within the Spanish 
clinic group."
"Measures are implemented and monitored by 
the Corporate Patient Safety Committee."
"It is responsible 
for implementing the central strategy for patient safety, 
which is supported by the aforementioned targets."
"The medical departments of Helios Germany and Helios 
Spain exchange ideas and information on specific topics."
"For example, the German hospitals benefit from Helios 
Spain’s very close networking of outpatient and inpatient 
care, and can take advantage of this experience."
"The CMO of Helios Health also coordinates synergy 
projects between the divisions in this area, as well as in the 
fields of medical quality and research."
"Guidelines and regulations 
In Germany, we had been engaged in the development of a 
quality management system in recent years with the aim of 
creating transparency regarding the quality of treatment re-
sults in the clinics and making them comparable."
"In 2008, 
Helios clinics joined forces with 14 other hospital operators 
to form the Initiative Qualitätsmedizin (IQM --
- Initiative for 
Quality Medicine)."
"IQM is now the largest voluntary quality 
initiative in the German healthcare system."
"Helios Germany applies the IQM management system and 
the related G-IQI in all German clinics."
"Newly acquired en-
tities are integrated into this management system from the 
start of the acquisition."
"Further certifications encompass 
acknowledgment as centers of medical expertise, e."
"g., for 
oncology, diabetes, endoprosthetics, or other areas."
"All hospitals and centers of Helios Spain are certified 
according to the ISO 9001 standard."
"They are also certified 
according to the Spanish Association for Standardization 
UNE, (e."
"g., for surveillance, prevention, and control of in-
fections as well as for patient safety) or according to other 
standards recognized in the hospital sector (e."
"g., according 
to JCI and the EFQM model)."

"Moreover, Helios Spain received the Gold Seal of the Joint 
Commission International Enterprise in 2022."
"This makes 
the company the first private hospital group in the world 
and the first operator of healthcare facilities in Europe to 
receive this award."
"In October 2023, Helios Spain’s certifi-
cation was presented as best practice at the JCI Global 
Leadership Summit."
"Treatment quality 
The quality management system at Helios Germany is 
based on administrative data (routine data) from patient 
treatments."
"The hospitals document each treatment step for
later billing with the health insurance companies."
"This rou-
tine data shows whether the healing process took longer 
than expected, and whether complications or even a death 
occurred."
"It also indicates whether a treatment took a nor-
mal course or if mistakes were made."
"Mistakes are then re-
viewed in peer reviews, for more information, please refer 
to page 127."
"In addition, patients can access the publicly 
available information how often certain treatments are per-
formed, among other things."
"This gives them important in-
formation on the doctors’ experience and routine and helps 
them to make their own decisions about their treatment."
"Each clinic and each department receives a monthly re-
port on the results of medical treatment quality."
"In this way, 
key quality parameters can continuously be monitored and, 
if necessary, countermeasures can be taken at an early 
stage."
"This data illustrates how the hospitals perform com-
pared to the national average, to other Helios hospitals, or 
to IQM member hospitals."
"In Spain, the number increased 
by around 5% in the outpatient sector and by more than 
5% in the inpatient sector."
"Around 21% of the clinics achieved a rate of 
100%, a further 40% achieved a rate of 90% or betterIn 
Spain, 23 targets were achieved.In Spain, a target rate of 
55.1% was achieved, based on the 45 total targets set."
"Particularly important are the specific audit 
procedures in the medical and nursing sectors, and the 
peer reviews --
- expert discussions of cases."
"In Germany, 
trained physicians from the hospitals of Helios Germany 
and from the IQM network in particular cooperate in the 
peer review, and question statistical abnormalities."
"Their 
insights are translated into concrete recommendations for 
action in the hospital with the aim of increasing patient 
safety."

Patient safety and reporting systems 
Fresenius Helios uses a reporting and learning system for 
critical events and near-misses of patients in all hospitals in 
Germany and Spain (Critical Incident Reporting System --
- 
CIRS)."
"This is anonymous, can be used in all areas of a hos-
pital site, and primarily serves the preventive protection of 
both patients and employees."
"Based on the information col-
lected via the reporting system, potential errors in pro-
cesses and workflows can be identified."
"Measures for im-
provement can be derived accordingly."
"In addition, one 
clinic at a time is subject to a safety inspection every quar-
ter."
"In this way, risks relevant for the overall division are 
identified and can be avoided."

"e., both risks and 
near misses as well as sentinel events."
"Furthermore, a dedicated system is used to regularly meas-
ure patient safety at its hospitals."
"Fresenius Helios also has 
an obligation to report certain incidents of harm, which are 
categorized using Patient Safety Indicators (PSI)."
"These 
include both internationally established and Helios’ own 
patient safety indicators."
"Examples of such reporting cases 
are mix-ups during an operation or unintentionally left for-
eign objects."
"An important part of Fresenius Helios error manage-
ment is the recording of allegations of treatment errors, 
justified or unjustified."
"These allegations include, to vary-
ing degrees, all specialties and all stages of treatment, from 
patient information, diagnostics, surgery, and therapy to af-
tercare."
"In our hospitals, we actively encourage reporting 
incidents, including dangerous or unsafe conditions and 
near misses, as a way of promoting patient safety."
"Helios 
Spain uses an online reporting system for all types of inci-
dents, from near misses to sentinel events."
"Based on the 
definition from JCI, these are serious patient safety events 
that result in death, permanent harm, or severe temporary 
harm."
"The system is accessible for all healthcare profes-
sionals and hospital employees."
"The reported events are 
analyzed at least quarterly by each hospital Patient Safety 
Commission."

3 The calculation of the success rate for the compensation is based on 30 of the overall 45 targets.
"This analysis is 
also recorded in the reporting system, and feedback is pro-
vided to the notifier."
"In 2023, a total of 11,487 incidents1 
were reported (2022: 11,299)."
"In addition, there were 17 of 
what are known as never events in the reporting year, 
which have a negative impact on the corporate goal of zero 
never events."
"These are easily preventable adverse events 
that can lead to particularly serious harm to patients."
"They 
include patient and lateral mix-ups, or foreign bodies left in 
the body after operations."
"Clinical alerts are also an important tool used by the 
Medical Directorate of Helios Spain to prevent patient 
safety incidents."
"These are designed to inform hospitals of 
important information related to adverse events and the im-
plementation of timely interventions."
"In 2023, four clinical 
alerts were sent to hospitals."
"In Spain, we also worked intensively on the implemen-
tation of measures resulting from liability cases and re-
ported incidents where there was room for improvement 
from a clinical practice and safety perspective."
"The aim is 
to promote the introduction of preventive measures in all 
hospitals in order to avoid the recurrence of such incidents."
"In this context, the Medical Directorate of Helios Spain or-
ganized sevenmeetings on patient safety and risk 
management in 2023 to share experiences."
"There is also a 
Corporate Medical Claims Committee that meets quarterly 
to analyze high-impact claims together with the medical di-
rectors of the hospitals involved."
"The implementation of 
and compliance with hospital hygiene measures in the clin-
ics is accompanied and monitored by our specially trained 
staff --
- e."
"g., hygiene specialist nurses, hospital hygienists, 
and hygiene officers."
"Training 
Helios Germany has three simulation and emergency facili-
ties in Erfurt, Krefeld, and Hildesheim."
"Among other things, 
surgical procedures or crisis scenarios in the operating 
room are trained there."
"In addition, such training courses 
take place in the clinics directly."
"In the fields of emergency 
medicine, anesthesia, intensive care medicine, and obstet-
rics, decisions on the content and number of participants in 
the mandatory training courses are based on resolutions of 
the respective specialist groups."
"In Spain, training is provided on patient safety, quality 
management, and on topics that are essential in hospital 
routine."
"In 2023, various patient safety and risk manage-
ment sessions were conducted in the hospital network of 
Helios Spain, over 1,500 people were trained."
"Furthermore, 
Helios Spain offers several online training courses on pa-
tient safety."
"They are mandatory for new employees and for 
those whose work is directly related to care."
"The exchange 
of knowledge amongthe hospital network should be pro-
moted through interhospital clinical training and meetings, 
which cover the field of gynecology and obstetrics."
"Patient information 
Fresenius Helios provides information within its hospitals 
to its patients and their relatives about the patient admis-
sion process, if needed, with the help of the treatment con-
tract, as well as special information documents and privacy 
statements."
"The therapeutic objective is discussed during 
admission and discharge discussions with the treating phy-
sicians."
"Throughout a hospital stay, nurses are an im-
portant point of contact and mediator for patients, their rel-
atives, and medical staff."
"Fresenius Helios communicates general focus topics via 
an online magazine, social media, its website, and in its 
communication campaigns for interested parties."
"In addi-
tion, information events on specific medical topics are held 
in all hospitals (known as patient academies)."
"Further de-
tails on transparency in healthcare can be found in the 
Strategy and management chapter on page 111."

"Employees on-site conduct short 
interviews on care and service."
"The anonymized results can 
currently be viewed individually by each clinic in a daily, 
weekly, or monthly cycle."
"The respective management of 
the hospital and other authorized persons receive the 
monthly survey results to obtain a general picture of satis-
faction and to be able to identify areas of criticism."
"In addi-
tion, Helios Germany publishes the results of patient sur-
veys, further data on medical treatment quality, and hy-
giene figures on its corporate website www.helios-gesund-

"Statistically conspicuous results are examined by local 
management and measures are taken if necessary."
"In Spain, Fresenius Helios uses the NPS to get specific 
feedback from patients who have been treated as inpa-
tients, outpatients, or in emergencies."
"48 hours after a hos-
pital stay, an email is sent to patients asking if they would 
recommend the hospital and its services."

"Fresenius Kabi does not conduct studies without a prior 
positive benefit-risk assessment."
"Furthermore, safety 
events occurring during a clinical study are constantly 
monitored and evaluated."
"Study participants are fully in-
formed prior to the start of the study and are enrolled only 
with their consent."
"Internally, clinical studies are docu-
mented in a central database and the results are published 
in accordance with applicable regulations."
"Fresenius Kabi’s research and development activities 
are focused on biosimilars, clinical nutrition, and generic 
drugs that are already well-established in markets and con-
sequently need no, less, or limited animal studies."
"These 
are conducted if required by national and international laws 
or regulations."
"Animal studies are only conducted accord-
ing to respective animal welfare legislations."
"Moreover, non-clinical CROs are audited by the Fresenius 
Kabi Quality Assurance department and requalified every 
three to five years based on the underlying risk."
"In 2023, Fresenius Kabi also underwent an inspection 
by the local regulatory authority."
"The focus was on a clini-
cal study."
"In cases of non-compliances identified during 
these inspections, the business segment initiates or imple-
ments appropriate measures."
"No critical events with a significant impact on the safety 
of study participants or compliance with the applicable re-
quirements and standards became known at Fresenius Kabi 
in the reporting year."
"In 2023, we started marketing of various new products, 
as explained on pages 43 ff."
"in the Group Management Re-
port."
"If clinical studies were conducted for the approval of 
these products, those were designed according to the 
aforementioned criteria."
"DIGITAL HEALTHCARE STRUCTURES 
In our Spanish hospitals, the Casiopea project was 
launched in 2020 with the aim of implementing a system 
platform through which all processes can be digitally con-
trolled centrally."
"A high level of digitalization has already 
been achieved in recent years, which is to be improved by 
further innovative applications."
"Potential additional training 
requirements will be assessed and implemented."
"Details of the digital processes already implemented can be 
found from page 139 onwards in the Digital transformation 
chapter."
"Findings from the Casiopea project that can lead to an 
improvement in process quality for the German hospital 
sites are discussed."
"In the long term, findings can also con-
tribute to the DigitalRadar."
"Further information can be 
found on page 139."
"INNOVATIVE TREATMENT CONCEPTS 
Innovative treatment concepts are key to our daily work in 
our clinics."
"The combination of clinical studies and 
knowledge gained through daily routines provides infor-
mation on how established treatment schemes can be 
changed."
"These options are discussed with experts both 
from the medical departments and from care."
"We focus on 
oncology and cardiovascular diseases in our acute care
hospitals, but health services research is also an important 
area."
"Improved treatment concepts can also result in lower 
mortality ratios, leading to better quality of treatment in our 
clinics."
"We conduct clinical trials at many sites, partly in coop-
eration with CROs, for example, to determine how effective 
and safe medicines are and whether medical products are 
suitable for approval in accordance with internationally ap-
plicable ethical and scientific standards."
"In addition, clinical 
data is collected, analyzed, and published to evaluate new 
and already-approved technologies and treatments in eve-
ryday care."
"Based on a clear commitment to evidence-
based medicine, the business segment encourages its em-
ployees to engage in scientific and technological research 
activities."
"The aim is for them to grow personally and use 
their insights to improve the well-being of patients."
"Projects funded by public grants focus on the develop-
ment of new forms of care and process plans (treatment 
pathways) for medical treatments."
"In cooperation with 
manufacturers, the focus is on testing new technologies in 
clinical application and thus assessing their benefit."
"Such 
clinical data on usage in day-to-day patient care is im-
portant for evaluating technologies and determining their 
market price (HTA --
- health technology assessment)."
"Helios 
Germany also provides the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) with 
data on severe acute respiratory infections (ICOSARI) such 
as influenza virus and COVID-19 incidents."
"The Helios Health Institute (HHI) is responsible for the cen-
tral study audit."
"The HHI ensures that all regulatory re-
quirements applicable to research activities, including con-
tractual or data protection requirements, are met as part of 
the study review."
"This enables clinics to ensure that scien-
tific, ethical, and legal requirements are met and that the 
project complies with applicable guidelines or quality 
standards."
"The respective Group guideline on research 
(Helios Konzernregelung Forschung) mandatorily provides 
that every research project, including all necessary docu-
ments, must be submitted to the HHI for review in order to 
protect its patients."
"With the final legal, regulatory and data 
protection assessment, a recommendation for the medical 
research project is made to the applicant and the manage-
ment of Helios clinic."
"HHI maintains a continuously developing quality man-
agement system, aiming for certification according to ISO 
9001 in 2024, so that it can also operate externally as a 
CRO."
"The Helios Group regulation on research funding fur-
ther specifies the framework conditions within which He-
lios specifically promotes research projects that are con-
ducted by its own employees and expected to have a high 
level of benefit for patients."
"Departments or clinics have special certifications, e."
"g., 
as certified organ cancer centers or as oncology centers of 
the German Cancer Society."
"Certification is based, for ex-
ample, on the quality of treatments or sufficient participa-
tion of patients in clinical trials."
"Like-
wise, individual Helios clinics are inspected according to 
the respective selection procedures for gaining a license as 
a specialized center of the state authorities."
"Conducting clinical studies is subject to strict require-
ments."
"These include the internal Group guideline on re-
search as well as numerous external guidelines, national 
regulatory requirements, the Declaration of Helsinki issued 
by the World Medical Association, and the requirements of 
GCP."
"For both medical and non-medical staff conducting 
central study reviews, regular GCP training organized by 
HHI is mandatory."
"Monitoring is ensured by audits as well as inspections 
by state, higher, and regulatory authorities."
"In case of com-
plaints, appropriate corrective actions are initiated by the 
respective clinic and reported to the inspecting authority."
"In 2023, no external inspections and audits took place at 
HHI."
"A prerequisite for any study to begin is a vote or consul-
tation from an independent ethics committee established 
under state law."
"In this sense, all clinical studies are re-
viewed by independent experts who are responsible for 
each respective German state (Bundesland) or the local 
state medical association (Landesärztekammer)."
"For re-
search projects of Helios physicians with university 
affiliation, the ethics committee of the university involved is 
responsible for the review of a study, depending on each 
state’s regulations."
"In experimental studies, investigations 
can be carried out in the laboratory,for example using tis-
sue samples or blood material; these studies are also re-
viewed by an ethics committee."
"All studies using sample 
material from patients must be evaluated by the ethics 
committee."
"If patients are interested in participating in a clinical 
trial, they discuss all questions in advance with the respon-
sible investigators."
"These discussions follow a guideline 
that includes study-specific, ethics-committee-approved pa-
tient information and a declaration of consent."
"External 
sponsors are responsible for preparing these documents 
themselves."
"Only after evaluation by the ethics committee, 
and in accordance with the Helios Group guideline on re-
search,may investigators use the documents."
"The patients’ 
consent is obtained in writing after sufficient reflection 
time and the patient information consultations are docu-
mented for the protection of patients."
"The data protection 
requirements must be complied with."
"In 2023, a total of 1,873 studies were conducted or re-
viewed in Germany and Spain, the majority of which had 
the goal of improving therapies for patients."
"In Germany, 
300 studies were initiated at 36 German sites, thereof 46 on 
the initiative of employees of Helios clinics."
"The focus was 
on oncology, hematology as well as cardiology."
"2 The majority of these studies are led by universities, mostly with public research funding."
"3 The majority of these studies are led by universities / professional societies, but are supported by 
drug / medical device manufacturers, which usually extends to the provision of the drugs / medi-
cal devices."
"4 The majority of these studies are supported by the pharmaceutical industry, less than 20% are 
medical device manufacturers."
"5 Total sum includes studies with employees as initiators at Helios Spain, which were counted in 
other categories."
"In 2023, 36 hospitals in the division Helios Spain were in-
volved in scientific projects in Spain, Colombia, and Peru."
"79% of the more than 1,500 studies were industry-spon-
sored; around 6% of them were publicly funded."
"11% 
were studies without additional funding."
"The most im-
portant area of research has been oncology, with approxi-
mately 55% of all clinical trials performed."
"In 2023, we received a total of around €6 million in 
public funding (2022: around €9 million) for our clinical re-
search activities in Spain, Colombia, and Peru."
"The 
tech paradigm shift is driven by advancements in technolo-
gies like AI, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), and predic-
tive analytics."
"The rise of new technologies is accompanied 
by the generation of a vast amount of real-time health data, 
leading to a paradigm shift in data."
"Health data combined 
with advanced analytics are key elements for the imple-
mentation of predictive, personalized, preventive, and par-
ticipative medicine, an approach that will leave a mark on 
health delivery and significantly improve treatment out-
comes."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
We aim to optimize and accelerate our internal processes 
with the help of digital processes and applications through-
out the entire Group."
"Also, we aim to
create value and efficiency in the daily use of products
or services."
"Thanks to data-driven insights and digital-
ized processes, Fresenius Kabi can improve produc-
tion, sales, and logistics, and thus patiente care."
"► 
Increasing digitalization in the healthcare services
market segment is streamlining processes and im-
proving treatment cycles in our hospitals."
"This in-
creases employee and patient satisfaction and also re-
duces costs."
"The goals and ambitions we are explaining here aim not 
only at driving digitalization in the Group."
"They also help us 
to achieve the goals of other relevant topics, such as patient 
satisfaction and treatment results."
"Further information can 
be found in the Patient and product safety section starting 
on page 118."
"DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION GOALS 
OUR APPROACH 
Our markets are changing rapidly."
"This is particularly true 
with regard to digital trends in healthcare, which have been 
further accelerated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic."
"We are seeing increasing demand for new digital services 
along the entire value chain."
"Patients increasingly want to 
receive remote diagnosis and healthcare services on de-
mand."
"Data-driven decision-making is increasingly inte-
grated into everyday clinical practice, and the proportion of 
digital components in medical devices is growing."
"The as-
sociated cybersecurity risks also highlight the need for 
standardized and resilient IT infrastructures."
"She oversees the IT 
transformation of the Fresenius Group."
"The Chief Executive 
Officers (CEOs) of the business segments are responsible 
for operational management."
"Digital transformation is the 
responsibility of the respective Management Boards, com-
mittees, or management functions of the business seg-
ments."
"They organize the management approaches and 
regulate the responsibilities within the Management Board, 
e.g., via a business allocation plan."
"The business allocation
plan of the Group Management Board does not provide for
a separate department for this purpose."
"Special IT working groups are set up across the Group, 
consisting of executives from the business segments and 
the Group division Fresenius Digital Technology."
"They 
work on topics that directly contribute to the corporate 
goals."
"In this way, they jointly develop the global IT trans-
formation for Fresenius."
"The IT working groups have re-
placed the global IT Board as of 2023."
"The development 
process of our further strategic IT orientation is steered by 
our subsidiary Fresenius Digital Technology and by the 
Chief Information Officer of the Fresenius Group."
"As part of risk reporting, the Group Management Board 
is informed quarterly."
"The effectiveness of the various IT-
based management systems is discussed if risks were iden-
tified or incidents occurred that could have a significant im-
pact on the operating business, the reputation, or the value 
chain of the Group and its business segments."
"The Audit
Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed about de-
velopments on a half-year basis."
"the Supervisory Board it-
self is informed on an annual basis."
"For further information, 
please refer to pages 87 ff."
"in the Opportunities and Risk 
Report."
"We further report on cybersecurity governance in 
the Cybersecurity chapter starting on page 142 and on data 
protection governance in the Data protection section on 
page 177."
"Ethics in digitalization 
Within the Fresenius Group, a working group for AI was es-
tablished in 2023."
"In addition to the Group functions Cyber-
security and Risk & Integrity, representatives of the busi-
ness segments also participate."
"It is led by the Corporate 
Development Group function."
"The aim of the working group is to create a Group-wide 
framework for the use of AI and to develop corresponding 
guidelines."
"This also includes ensuring that the ethical 
standards and values of Fresenius are taken into account in 
the development and implementation of applications in 
which AI is used at Fresenius."
"In the reporting year, we also published a guideline on 
the responsible use of AI on the intranet to sensitize em-
ployees to possible risks and to define key points to watch 
out for."
"Business segments also informed employees about 
this topic in written form."
"GROUP-WIDE IT TRANSFORMATION 
In recent years, the system infrastructure within the 
Fresenius Group has been characterized by a high degree 
of diversification, primarily due to the numerous 
acquisitions."
"The goal of the central IT function was there-
fore to reduce this degree of heterogeneity and fragmenta-
tion and optimize the IT structures."
"Fresenius continued 
this IT transformation in the reporting year."
"By using cloud technologies, we are striving to improve 
performance and efficiency in the areas of finance, supply 
chain, production, human resources, sales, and customer 
engagement."
"With these strategic steps, Fresenius laid the foundation 
for future innovation and growth ambitions."
"This not only 
improves scalability, but also enhances the security of IT 
systems and their application and drives the digitalization 
of global business processes."
"The migrated systems show 
improved performance in general and thus also support the 
maintenance of key processes."
"The Cloud migrationg was 
completed in 2023."
"The plan is to start implementing the 
SAP S4 / HANA-strategy in the 2024 reporting year."
"DIGITALIZATION STRATEGIES 
The digitalization of processes in the healthcare products 
market segment is important in two respects: on the one 
hand, for the effective care for critically and chronically ill 
patients and, on the other hand, for compliance with regu-
latory requirements."
"We are leveraging insights from 
generated data and digital processes."
"Our goal is to im-
prove and streamline operations with digital capabilities 
that are both cohesive and efficient."
"We rely on business in-
telligence and analytics to optimize decision-making."
"Our 
strategy also includes creating new offerings through the 
introduction of innovative digital products and services."
"We focus on using data from interactions with custom-
ers to understand and improve their experience with our 
services."
"The data helps us to improve customer communi-
cation through both digital and non-digital channels, help-
ing to support the use of our products, and thereby patient 
safety."
"With this in mind, Fresenius Kabi launched several 
initiatives in 2023 to harmonize the IT and digital land-
scape."
"In the healthcare services market segment, the expan-
sion of digitalization is of central importance."
"On the one 
hand, to ensure the future viability of our own clinics and 
outpatient facilities, and on the other hand, to continuously 
improve the quality of healthcare and the service for pa-
tients."
"Helios Germany has the ambition to become a digital 
pioneer in the German healthcare sector."
"To this end, the 
division has set itself gradual targets for the automation of 
processes by 2026."
"We measure the degree of digitalization 
in German Helios clinics using the DigitalRadar Score in-
troduced by the legislator in Germany in 2021."
"1,624 hospi-
tals took part in the initial survey and the average Digi-
talRadar score was 33.3 out of a possible 100 points."
"The 
average DigitalRadar score in Helios facilities was 45.1 in 
the initial survey in 2021."
"For 2024, the survey will be up-
dated and the improvement evaluated."
"Helios Spain has also set corporate goals for all hospi-
tals --
- including for digitalization."
"Each hospital implements 
these goals and assesses the extent to which they are 
achieved."
"The results are presented to the Helios Spain 
steering committee."
"To support this, Helios Spain has de-
veloped a new digitalization path for its hospitals consisting 
of four phases: 1."
"the introduction of new tools, 2."
"the digi-
tal transformation, 3."
"the transformation of the healthcare 
model, and 4."
"In each phase, Helios 
Spain measures several key performance indicators (KPIs) 
to define when a hospital is ready to pass to the next phase."
"The overarching goal is to expand the digital care manage-
ment system and patient portal Casiopea."
"For further infor-
mation, please refer to the Innovation chapter starting on 
page 134."
"The implementation of this strategy and 
the continuous improvement of digital processes are com-
pany-wide objectives."
"In this way, the business segment 
aims to achieve digital excellence in the area of medical 
care to increase patient benefit and operational efficiency."
"Fresenius Vamed is also working on establishing a digital-
first culture to create the environment and enablement for 
digital innovation."
"To this end, the business segment imple-
mented a Digital Board in 2023."
"Interdisciplinary teams 
conduct digitalization workshops, for example, and work 
together with external partners on the further development 
of the digitalization strategy."
"DIGITAL PROCESSES AND APPLICATIONS 
We develop devices and applications in various medical 
fields to support ongoing digitalization, for example, in 
hospitals."
"These solutions not only have to be optimized in 
their core functions, but need to be embedded into the spe-
cific IT systems of healthcare facilities."
"To this end, we will 
continue to focus on increasing the share of software in 
medical technology and its application area."
"Digital solutions are continuously being developed 
along the entire value chain to make internal work pro-
cesses more efficient and simplify them."
"In various areas, 
such as compliance, supply chain, purchasing, and produc-
tion, we are increasingly relying on intelligent automation 
and AI to improve business processes in administrative 
functions, e."
"We have already implemented various solutions and 
identified potential savings that can be successively real-
ized."
"Since September 2023, a chatbot has been supporting 
the global IT service desk, through which IT problems can 
be reported and, in some cases, resolved directly."
"In the reporting year, we continued to work on develop-
ing overarching approaches to support the increasing auto-
mation of complex processes, for example in commercial 
areas such as sales and customer service processes."
"In pro-
duction and quality management, Fresenius Kabi, for ex-
ample, is using digital platforms to implement process con-
trol systems for industrial production plants, monitor 
equipment efficiency, and manage data and support work-
flows in laboratories."
"In this way, the business segment can 
also use the data to analyze and automate decision-making 
processes."
"We also use digital solutions for what are known as 
track-and-trace systems for the traceability of products."
"These applications enable us to share information with cus-
tomers, for example regarding the safety of products."
"They 
also support, for example, the monitoring of inventories in 
hospitals."
"For example, Fresenius Kabi uses radio fre-
quency identification (RFID) technology, known as smart 
labels, for some of its drugs in the United States."
"The smart 
label enables hospitals to automatically manage their in-
ventories."
"In 2023, Fresenius Kabi launched the new digital applica-
tion, PreparePlus, which supports customers in the paren-
teral, i."
"e., artificial, nutrition of patients."
"Pharmacists and 
pharmacy technicians use PreparePlus to prepare the phys-
ico-chemically stable formulations."
Following the acquisition of Ivenix Inc.
"in 2022, 
Fresenius Kabi now offers healthcare providers a broad 
portfolio of advanced infusion pumps and solutions to meet 
healthcare needs across the continuum of care."
"In 2023, 
Fresenius Kabi further expanded its offerings to meet in-
creased customer demand in geographies such as the 
United States."
"At the same time, the business segment is 
improving clinical workflows by integrating its products 
into the digital hospital environment."
"In this way, Fresenius 
Kabi helps to reduce the risk of medication errors and im-
prove patient safety."
"The KetoApp, by contrast, supports patients with 
chronic kidney disease."
"Information on nutrition and the 
nutritional values of foods is intended to enable them to eat 
a varied diet appropriate to their disease."
"The application 
has now been rolled out in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mex-
ico, and Peru."
"In order to further optimize the treatment of patients, 
Fresenius Vamed is working on digital assistance systems 
such as apps that support a healthy and independent life, 
as well as on digital rehabilitation services."
"In the project business, Fresenius Vamed relies on what are 
known as building information modeling (BIM) systems for 
the planning and operation of healthcare facilities."
"These 
enable digital mapping and optimization of the entire life 
cycle --
- from planning, design, construction, and operation 
to maintenance --
- of a healthcare facility."
"AI can be used to 
optimize staff scheduling in clinics, for example."
"This is achieved, for ex-
ample, through video conferences and chats in which pa-
tients can present their medical history, but also through 
protocols and automated tests for certain diagnoses."
"The 
result is digital patient care, known as the Digital Patient 
Journey."
"It requires the digitalization of a large number of 
interdependent processes, as well as digital applications 
such as the Helios patient portal and the electronic patient 
file (EPF)."
"These ensure that nec-
essary laboratory examinations are initiated and appoint-
ments made for patients prior to a treatment consultation, 
depending on their individual health status."
"They follow es-
tablished protocols."
"It is also ensured that the responsible 
physician receives all diagnoses and information prior to 
the consultation."
"The availability of real-time test results or 
existing patient data makes it possible for 30% of patients 
to be discharged directly after an initial consultation."
"In ad-
dition, they only spend around two hours in a clinic instead 
of an average of eight."
"g., in the oncological 
and dermatological outpatient clinic, have also decreased 
significantly as a result of digitalization."
"Helios Spain aims 
to reduce overcrowding in emergency departments through 
a Virtual Urgent Care Program."
"Patients with low levels of 
suffering are cared for via video conference."
"In this way, 
both the clinical burden and the waiting times for those be-
ing treated are reduced, and the overall treatment time is 
reduced on average by 9 minutes."
"Via our digital patient portals, our patients can access 
treatment documents such as findings, book appointments 
online, or attend video consultations around the clock and 
from home."
"The clinics benefit from central data storage 
and improved data transmission, as well as coordination 
between medical staff."
"At the majority of workstations in the Helios clinics in Ger-
many and Spain, an EPF with doctor’s letters, findings, and 
complete clinical imaging, as well as nursing documenta-
tion and medication, is available."
"It contains all the essen-
tial information needed for the treatment of patients."
"In about half of the Helios clinics, integrated software 
solutions already issue warnings of possible interactions 
with other drugs."
This further increases patient safety.
"The 
expansion of the Germany-wide telematics infrastructure, 
ordered by the government, into which the EPF will be in-
tegrated in the future, will also lead to better quality of 
care."
"This is because in-
novative technological and therapeutic approaches improve 
the treatment paths of our patients."
"Fresenius is continu-
ously digitizing its processes and entering new markets 
with digital product solutions while always acknowledging 
the associated cyber risks."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
It is our ambition that both our patients as well as our cus-
tomers can rely on the cybersecurity of our products and 
services."
"Our stakeholders have a high level of trust in the 
cybersecurity of our products and services."
"We perma-
nently strive to meet their expectations by strengthening 
our resilience towards cyberattacks, reducing our cyber 
risks and thus preventing harm to our patients, customers, 
or the company."
"To do this, we evaluate the ever-changing threat land-
scape, define minimum security standards for our cyber 
risk domains, and implement appropriate security 
measures in a risk-based and cost-effective manner."
"The 
Fresenius Group adopted a cybersecurity strategy to be 
implemented by 2025 that sets targets for the Group and 
the individual business segments."
"The main focus areas are 
reducing risks, increasing resilience to cyberattacks, stand-
ardizing the organization, processes, and technologies, and 
improving the Group-wide level of maturity."
"OUR APPROACH 
At the Fresenius Group, we pursue a holistic approach for 
the management of cybersecurity."
"To this end, we bring cy-
bersecurity and business decision-makers in the Group to-
gether to execute a joint approach aligned with our strate-
gic objectives."
"The core of our approach is to determine the 
right level of protection that balances the added value of 
cybersecurity with the needs of the business as well as the 
cost."
"The Opportunities and Risk Report contains further in-
formation on cybersecurity and the impact on risk manage-
ment at Fresenius in 2023 in the Risk areas section from 
page 99 onwards."
"ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Group Manage-
ment Board oversees cybersecurity governance and re-
ceives direct reports --
- weekly and as needed --
- from the 
Group Head of Cybersecurity."
"The latter acts as the Group-
wide Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), has overall 
responsibility for the governance of cybersecurity within 
the Fresenius Group, and leads the Group Cybersecurity 
Office (GCSO)."
"In this role, he defines the Group-wide cy-
bersecurity strategy and coordinates this strategy with the 
respective cybersecurity heads in order to ensure a con-
sistent approach across all business segments."
"The Group 
Head of Cybersecurity reports quarterly to the Group Man-
agement Board and at least annually to the Supervisory 
Board."
"The GCSO enables and governs cybersecurity across 
the Fresenius Group."
"It ensures that cybersecurity is con-
sidered and coordinated holistically from a Group perspec-
tive, defines the baseline, and monitors its compliance."
"In 
addition, it controls the execution of the measures to com-
bat risk."
"Where necessary, the GCSO advises and supports 
the business segments in their activities."
"Within the Group, overarching committees complement 
the existing organizational structure."
"The Cybersecurity 
Board meets on a monthly basis."
"It ensures the exchange 
of information on Group-wide cybersecurity, defines crite-
ria for evaluating and monitoring the development of cy-
bersecurity across the Group, and reviews the progress and 
results of cybersecurity measures and initiatives."
"The Cy-
bersecurity Board monitors the adoption and implementa-
tion of the Group-wide cybersecurity policies."
"It ensures 
that the baseline requirements of the measures to combat 
risk are met."
"The steering committee formally enacted the CARE 
Governance Charta to emphasize the strategic objectives, 
the scope, and the responsibilities of the CARE Program."
"Accordingly, the Cybersecurity Steering Committee acts 
as a governance body and as an escalation and decision-
making authority for various overarching measures."
"These 
include, for example, those for identifying and protecting 
critical, highly relevant information assets or those for opti-
mizing the development of an appropriate cybersecurity 
structure."
"At business segment level, cybersecurity insurance poli-
cies are in place where they were available on the insur-
ance market and where they cover the risks appropriately."
"In the reporting year, cybersecurity insurance at Group 
level was evaluated again, but has not yet been taken out, 
as the transformation process #FutureFresenius is leading 
to structural changes in the Group."
"In addition, there are 
certifications such as ISO / IEC 27001 for our information 
security management system at Group and business seg-
ment level."
"We regularly evaluate the strategic cybersecurity risks 
along the value chain."
"As part of these bi-annual assess-
ments, we analyze the evolving cyber threat landscape to 
consider arising threats in order to derive our cybersecurity 
measures and effectively mitigate our risks."
"As part of the Group-wide #FutureFresenius transfor-
mation, the Group Management Board decided to further 
develop the organizational structure of cybersecurity in line 
with the Group and cybersecurity strategy, starting in the 
fourth quarter of 2023."
"The focus here is on strengthening 
the cybersecurity functions in the business segments and at 
Group level, as well as on standardizing the process organi-
zation."
"SECURITY CONCEPT 
To manage Group-wide cybersecurity and associated risks, 
we have determined five risk domains."
"These are managed 
by the respective Risk Domain Managers."
"Facilitated by the 
GCSO, the Risk Domain Managers form Special Interest 
Groups (SIGs) that define tailored cybersecurity require-
ments and coordinate risk management activities based on 
applicable best practices."
"They exchange expertise and 
knowledge across all cybersecurity areas throughout the 
Group."
"Neither the security concept nor the risk domains 
have changed compared to 2022."
"It forms the foun-
dation for cybersecurity in all business segments and 
Group functions."
"Within this framework, the protection re-
quirements of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
digital information, technologies, and systems form the 
central objective of Fresenius’ cybersecurity efforts along 
the risk domains."
"In 2023, the GCSO together with the busi-
ness segments have defined additional cybersecurity re-
quirements which were adopted in various areas, supple-
menting the existing framework."
"We have initiated and rolled out effectiveness metrics in 
accordance with the designed cybersecurity metrics system 
in recent years."
"We use these key figures to determine 
whether security controls are operating as intended."
"This 
helps us understand cybersecurity risks and how well pre-
pared or resilient we are against cyberattacks."
"Metrics are 
collected across all the Group’s cybersecurity environments 
and are regularly reported to the Cybersecurity Board and 
Cybersecurity Steering Committee."
"In addition, they are 
visualized in a scorecard that allows cybersecurity manage-
ment to steer Group-wide cybersecurity efforts."
"The score-
card is also shared with relevant stakeholders such as the 
Group Management Board and the Supervisory Boards to 
enhance transparency regarding the overall cyber-risk ex-
posure and inform decision-making."
"Our main objective is to prevent cyber risks from mate-
rializing."
"This is where our investments into the early de-
tection of cyber threats are paying off."
"Recurring analyses 
and defense processes are automated in order to react even
more efficiently."
"Every incident is thoroughly investigated 
in order to derive additional measures to improve our over-
all safety."
"TRAINING 
At Fresenius, we seek to imbed a human-centered risk 
model, combining this with our already-implemented Cy-
bersecurity Training & Awareness Program (CTAP)."
"We 
aim to share knowledge about emerging trends immedi-
ately."
"To this end, we introduce different cybersecurity ac-
tivities at Fresenius, as well as providing helpful tips on the 
secure use of devices, be that in the office or at home."
"In addition to mandatory training on cybersecurity fun-
damentals, CTAP offers various courses, videos, and other 
learning content, for example via, the different digital CTAP 
learning platforms and intranets."
"For example, we regularly 
simulate phishing attacks to internalize the required behav-
ior to be triggered if phishing is suspected."
"We calculate a 
personal risk score for all employees enrolled in these 
training courses, based on their behavior in phishing tests 
and the number of cybersecurity training sessions they 
have completed."
"All CTAP activities are tailored toward 
Fresenius’ specific risks and are available in several lan-
guages."
"The success of the CTAP activities is measured us-
ing predefined success criteria (e."
"g., the target phishing 
simulation click rate)."
"We inform our employees through various channels 
about current cyber risks and new types of cyber threats."
"In 
doing so, we use the knowledge derived from daily phish-
ing attempts, for example, which is analyzed and evaluated 
by the Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT)."
"With 
their help, we can design customized awareness content 
and roll out training campaigns."
"In 2023, 73 new training modules were offered to about 
179,000 employees."
"25% of the training courses were 
mandatory."
"The training focus was on raising employee 
awareness of social engineering, phishing, new threats re-
lated to the use of mobile devices, acceptable use policy, 
and strengthening fundamental cybersecurity knowledge."
"On average, 6.7 simulated phishing attempts were sent to 
employees via email."
"Overall, 88% of employees were suc-
cessful in detecting our phishing simulations."
"Continuous 
training on cybersecurity is also part of the variable com-
pensation of all employees who participate in Fresenius’ 
SHARE profit-sharing program."
"The program is explained 
in the Employees chapter on page 152."
"REPORTING PATHS 
If Fresenius employees suspect cyber threats, they can con-
tact CERT@fresenius.com, CyberAware@fresenius.com, or 
any cybersecurity employee."
"To improve reporting effi-
ciency, suspicious emails may be reported through the 
Phish Alert Button, which starts an automated analysis and 
involves the CERT, if required."
"Our CERT investigates pos-
sible threats and incidents in our IT, manufacturing, and 
health facility environments, as well as suspected viola-
tions."
"If a malicious phishing attempt is detected, the 
sender is blocked and the security protocols are adapted 
accordingly."
"From a Group perspective, these did not have a mate-
rial impact on our business operations."

"AUDITS AND MONITORING 
The Internal Audit departments perform independent au-
dits to improve the effectiveness of the risk management, 
control and governance processes at Fresenius SE & Co."
KGaA and in the divisions of the business segments.
"This 
was also the case in 2023, taking into account risk-oriented 
measures in the area of cybersecurity, such as policies and 
procedures and their implementation."
"In 2023, Internal Au-
dit conducted nine audits with a focus on information secu-
rity."
"If weaknesses are identified during the audits, the im-
plementation of the corrective actions defined by manage-
ment is monitored by Internal Audit as part of the quarterly 
reviews."
"For findings with a high potential for damage, the 
first review takes place after already two months."
"Their achieve-
ments, skills, and dedication help our business segments to 
hold leading positions in their respective markets."
"Further-
more, we report separately on the key topics of occupa-
tional health and safety, starting on page 157, and diversity 
and equal opportunities, starting on page 164."
"Occupa-
tional health and safety affects both employees and patients 
in our healthcare facilities."
"Diversity and equal opportuni-
ties have been identified as material to our company, and 
demonstrate their relevance in our Human Rights State-
ment and in the Human rights section starting on page 179."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and its business segments pursue 
segment-specific ambitions."
"We want to build on the posi-
tion of our business segments which focus on innovation in 
the healthcare sector and take account of the importance of 
the services they provide for society."
"Our aim in doing so is 
to attract new employees who contribute to the company’s 
success through their willingness to perform, their exper-
tise, their experience, and their willingness to work to-
gether as a team."
"As a Group-wide goal, we have integrated 
the engagement of our employees as an indicator in the 
short-term variable compensation of the Management 
Board."
of the independent practitioner´s report.
"OUR APPROACH 
We want to continue attracting, retaining, and integrating 
talents at Fresenius."
"To this end, we need to consolidate 
and build on our position as an attractive employer in a 
market environment characterized by a shortage of person-
nel."
"Employee-friendly working conditions, attractive bene-
fits, and a dialog-oriented corporate culture all help us to 
achieve this."
"The Chief Ex-
ecutive Officers (CEOs) of the business segments are re-
sponsible for the operating tasks of their business segment."
"The management boards of the business segments define 
the management approaches and regulate responsibility for 
HR topics, for example, via a business allocation plan."
"In 
the Fresenius Group HR Steering Committee, the HR 
managers or responsible functions of the business seg-
ments and of the Group function Corporate HR Manage-
ment align on a monthly basis on HR topics and decide on 
Group-wide projects and initiatives."
"The ESG Board mem-
ber participates in the meetings."
"As part of risk reporting, 
the Management Board of the Fresenius Group is informed 
quarterly."
"It discusses the effectiveness of measures in the 
area of HR, if risks were identified or incidents occurred, 
that could have a material adverse effect on the operating 
business, reputation, or the value chain of the Group and 
its business segments."
"In 2023, for example, this related to 
the shortage of personnel in the healthcare sector."
"The Au-
dit Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed about 
developments on a half-year basis, the Supervisory Board 
on an annual basis."
"Further explanations can be found on 
pages 87 ff."
"in the Opportunities Risk Report and on pages 
169 ff."
"in the Group Non-financial Report in the Compliance 
section."
"We explain the interaction between the Management 
Board, the Supervisory Board, and the employee represent-
atives, e."
"g., the European Works Council, in the Employee 
participation section starting on page 153."
"Reporting systems  
Violations of regulations with reference to employees can 
be reported via the complaint channels described in the 
Compliance section starting on page 170."
"Furthermore, 
there is the possibility of informing the local employee rep-
resentative body (works council), as far as they are estab-
lished."
"How this is done is explained in the Employee par-
ticipation section from page 153 onwards."
"In the reporting year, no violations of internal policies 
with reference to employees were reported via our report-
ing channels whose impact would have been material for 
the financial position or reputation of the company."
"For 
more information on opportunities and risks, please refer to 
the Opportunities and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS 
At Group level, the Code of Conduct forms the basis for 
day-to-day activities."
"Further segment-specific guidelines 
are derived from it."
"Within the Fresenius Group, there are a 
large number of guidelines that determine the working en-
vironment and the scope of activities of our employees."
"The 
respective content is the responsibility of the business seg-
ments and specialist areas."
"Collective bargaining agree-
ments set further provisions regarding wage levels and 
further specifications for functions, as well as tariff groups."
"Apprentices, student trainees, and interns generally work 
on the basis of employment contracts, specified for their in-
ternship or apprenticeship."
"The standards described in this 
guideline are our global social and labor law minimum 
standards."
"We expect our employees and managers in all 
business areas to fully comply with this guideline."
"Lower 
standards are not acceptable."
"If national laws or practices 
restrict or contradict the standards set out in this policy, we 
will nevertheless apply the policy to the extent permitted by 
local laws."
"Further information is provided in the Human 
rights section starting on page 179."
"Within the Fresenius Group, applications are used to 
help us manage, evaluate, and control personnel data."
"We 
collect and analyze selected personnel data globally every 
quarter."
"The evaluations serve as information for various 
internal stakeholders, such as employee representatives."
"In 
this way, we create transparency with regard to the most 
important key figures."
"WORKING CONDITIONS 
Global working conditions are defined on the basis of 
guidelines and regulations at Group level, as already ex-
plained."
"Within the business segments, there are internal 
guidelines for employees covered by collective agreements 
and non-tariff employees with regard to working hours, 
jobs, and benefits."
"Occupational health and safety regula-
tions apply to all persons in our healthcare facilities and op-
erating sites, regardless of their employment relationship, 
but also to visitors and patients."
"The remuneration is based on requirements set by law 
or, where applicable, specified by the salary structures ne-
gotiated with the respective trade unions."
"Remuneration is 
usually based on local market standards and should be fair 
and appropriate."
"The Group compensates employees on 
both permanent and temporary employment contracts ac-
cording to specific rates that meet or exceed local industry 
conditions, but at least match local minimum wages."
"Any 
discrimination on the basis of gender or other criteria, as 
described in the Diversity and equal opportunities chapter 
starting on page 164, must be prevented."
"As an interna-
tional healthcare Group, we create various incentives for 
employees, depending on the country and location."
"These 
include, for example, the chance to participate in the com-
pany’s success via variable and performance-based com-
pensation models."
"Benefits for full-time employees of the 
organization are also provided proportionally to part-time 
employees."
"In Germany, benefits can be based on joint 
agreements between employer and works councils."
"We de-
scribe our variable compensation models in detail on pages 
348 ff."
"Collective agreements 
In some European countries, Fresenius is subject to indus-
try-related collective agreements, e."
"g., in France, which are 
binding by law due to the industry to which we are affili-
ated."
"Where this is not the case, country-specific collective 
bargaining agreements can be negotiated with local trade 
unions or comparable social partners."
"Employees are in-
formed by trade unions (collective bargaining partners) or 
employee representatives about tariff agreements, tariff ne-
gotiations, and their results."
"This is regulated differently in 
the individual countries."
"General conditions for non-tariff employees are based 
on the provisions of the applicable collective agreement or 
local regulations."
"Further, depending on the function, addi-
tional agreements can be part of the employment contract."
"For executives, regulations are agreed in the employment 
contract."
"Salary transparency in the different countries is 
granted according to legal requirements and tariff con-
tracts."
"The Fresenius Helios hospitals in Germany are subject 
to a Helios Group collective agreement, the collective 
agreement for public service (TVöD), or company-specific 
collective agreements."
"At Helios Germany, there are regu-
lar compensation negotiations within the framework of col-
lective agreements that generally take place every two 
years."
"The locations in Germany are subject to the regula-
tions of the applicable working time legislation, which in
some cases provides for opening clauses for supplementary 
tariff regulations."
"The Works Constitution Act, which grants 
the works councils co-determination rights and control, 
also has a regulatory effect."
"The framework with regard to 
working hours for the individual companies is regularly 
agreed by the respective company parties on-site."
"In Ger-
many, the majority of workers are represented by the trade 
union ver.di."
"Employees in our Spanish clinics are covered by legally 
binding tariff agreements."
"Further, the trade unions 
Comisiones Obreras, Unión General de Trabajadoras y Tra-
bajadores (UGT) and the Sindicato de Enfermería (SATSE) 
care workers’ union are predominantly represented in the 
works councils."
"In 2023, 74% of our global employees were covered by 
a collective bargaining agreement."
"The reduction com-
pared to the previous year is due to the extension to a 
global scope since 2023."

many was negotiated."
"The collaboration with unions and works councils in 
various countries globally is explained on page 153 in the 
Employee participation section."
"In recent years, part-time and flextime 
models, job sharing, and mobile working models, among 
other things, have been further developed or introduced for 
employees in administrative areas in particular."
"Increasing digitalization of collaboration and work pro-
cesses is supporting the implementation of more flexible 
working models."
"In order to acquire the necessary digital 
skills, employees receive training tailored to their needs."
"For more information on the digitalization of Fresenius’ 
products and services, please refer to the Digital transfor-
mation chapter on pages 137 ff."
"The respective applicable legal regulations on parental 
leave are applied throughout the Group."
"To promote the 
compatibility of work and family, mothers or fathers can 
use our flexible working models to re-enter the workforce 
or, for example, work part-time during parental leave."
"At Fresenius Kabi in the United States, the extended 
paid family leave introduced in October 2022 was contin-
ued in the reporting year."
"Eligible employees may take up 
to eight weeks of paid leave for qualifying family reasons."
"Qualifying reasons include time away after the birth or 
adoption of a child, including a child placed for foster care, 
or for the care of an immediate family member with a seri-
ous health condition."
"The Fresenius Group also supports employees during ca-
reer changes."
"Intra-Group transfers, including across na-
tional borders, are made possible by the internal publica-
tion of vacancies in the business segments."
"This is intended 
to retain employees within the Group."
"This is partly com-
plemented by transition programs for people entering re-
tirement, e."
"g., long-term accounts or reconciliation of in-
terests negotiations in the event of terminations."
"The re-
spective programs and measures are based on local re-
quirements."
"There are individual agreements with employ-
ees or collective measures."
"RECRUITMENT 
In order to meet our future demand for qualified special-
ists, we use a variety of different tools to recruit staff."
"We 
monitor our working environment and competitive sur-
roundings closely to identify potential."
"Furthermore, we 
use digital personnel marketing, organize our own recruit-
ment events, and present the company at career fairs."
"In 
recent years, we have significantly broadened our range of 
personnel marketing activities."
"We also want to be per-
ceived as a reliable employer that values integrity."
"Further 
information is provided in the Compliance section on pages 
169 ff."
"Temporary workers are deployed in the business seg-
ments to compensate for short-term staff shortages, partic-
ularly in the area of care or in the event of temporary fluc-
tuations in capacity utilization in production."
"Temporary
workers are also partially hired for temporary replacements 
such as parental leave or long-term illness, or for interim 
support in projects."
"In 2023, more than 2,700 people worked for us as tem-
porary employees1."
"In relation to the total number of em-
ployees, the figure is around 4% (2022: more than 3,200 
persons; 5%)."
"The search for employees focuses on the following 
fields of action: training of qualified personnel internally, 
advertising for skilled workers, and searching the interna-
tional labor market."
"For example, Helios Germany partici-
pates in government-led campaigns to recruit personnel on 
the international labor market."
"In addition, employees who 
have qualified as nurses abroad are supported, for example 
with applications or in their searches for language schools 
in Germany."
"Many international nursing professionals have 
completed academic training at universities."
"This also ap-
plies to Spain, where prospective nurses complete their 
training at a university."
"These forms of vocational training 
are mainly aimed at complex medical activities and an of-
ten strongly cooperative collaboration in medical teams."
"The German vocational training system is a generalist train-
ing, which enables its participants to care for people of all 
ages."
"Specialization in care is possible during and after vo-
cational training."
"Bringing together the strengths of the dif-
ferent training systems is a great advantage and offers an 
opportunity to advance the overall quality of medical care 
in the hospitals."
1 Fresenius Helios and external consulting services excluded.
"Helios 
Spain has established partnerships with universities to pro-
vide classroom training there or in hospitals, in order to de-
velop the professional skills of nursing staff and to raise its 
attractiveness for potential candidates."
"The company’s own 
nursing schools complement the offering by expanding 
their training portfolio and adapting it to new market re-
quirements."
"It is also assumed that the vocational training situation 
in Germany and Austria may worsen in 2024."
"This supports 
our ambition to set the focus on training junior staff and 
specialists in the company’s own training facilities."
"In fiscal year 2023, the Fresenius Group continued to 
face strong competition for personnel in the healthcare 
markets."
"Particularly in the hospital sector, it became ap-
parent that positioning as an attractive employer, good 
working conditions, and flexible working models are essen-
tial in order to be perceived as an interesting company."
"The 
staff shortages continued, but were minimized by our focus 
on in-house training and development of own employees, 
as explained in the following section Employee develop-
ment."
"Human capital development programs will further 
support this progress."
"As part of its business strategy Vision 2026, Fresenius Kabi 
is further developing its HR organization with the aim of 
becoming an Employer of Choice and enhancing its strate-
gies for talent retention and development."
"Through the 
technological advancement of tools for global recruitment 
and strengthening employee orientation, the company is 
seeking to increase its attractiveness as an employer."
"The rate of new hires1, 2 in relation to the overall num-
ber of employees in each business segment is evidence of 
our efforts within recruitment."
"The length of service1 within 
the Group can vary with acquisitions in the business seg-
ments."
"In 2023, the average was 8.8 years (2022: 8.8 
years)."
"Further information is provided in the section Em-
ployee retention on page 152."
"To this 
end, we use different concepts and measures for personnel 
development --
- depending on their own customer and mar-
ket structures."
"We constantly adapt our approaches to cur-
rent trends and requirements."
"In addition to Group-wide 
mandatory training courses on the respective Codes of 
Conduct and on integrity, there are mandatory training 
courses on environmental management, occupational 
health and safety in the business segments, and, where ap-
propriate, quality management."
"Digitalization is also play-
ing an increasingly important role in the daily work done 
by our employees."
"Therefore, we integrate digital skills in 
alignment with the digitalization grade of the respective 
function."
"Segment-specific talent management and individ-
ual further training offerings for employees and managers 
are our other personnel development measures."
"All employees who are directly involved in production, 
as well as employees who work in a supporting role (e."
"g., 
technical maintenance, IT) receive mandatory training in 
job-related good manufacturing, control, and distribution 
practice and in occupational health and safety and environ-
mental protection."
"1 The data from Fresenius Helios includes all employees from its divisions, expect for the Eugin Group, which only covers the Spanish entities in 2022 and 2023."
"2 Calculated as the number of external hires in a business segment within the reporting period, relative to the number of employees in the business segment at year-end."
"In addition to mandatory 
training, the KPI includes targeted training on communica-
tion and social skills for quality experts."
"The production 
area comprises the following employee groups: opera-
tion/manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, 
maintenance/technical support and warehouse."
"More than 4,300 doctors and 
nurses were trained."
"In Switzerland, more than 1,100 pro-
fessionals were trained by Fresenius Vamed in over 80 
training sessions in fields such as emergency management, 
delirium therapy, care documentation, hygiene, resuscita-
tion, gerontotraumatology, and depression."
"In addition, all certified sites conduct occupational 
health and safety and environmental and energy manage-
ment training."
"Further training supplements this and serves 
to support the introduction, further development, and im-
provement of the corresponding management systems and 
measures."
"Especially in the nursing sector, the demand for skilled 
workers has continued to increase over the past few years."
"For this reason, Fresenius Helios plans to acquire a large 
proportion of the necessary nursing personnel through in-
company training or training cooperations."
"In Germany, the 
business segment has 34 of its own training centers."
"At the 
Helios Academy, in the training centers, and in other coun-
try-specific training programs offered by Fresenius Helios, 
employees can learn, train, and further develop their exper-
tise --
- in professional and personal skills."
"In Spain, Fresenius Helios focuses on cooperations with 
universities and also operates university hospitals and 
training facilities itself."
"More than 5,000 students are 
trained annually by experts; they acquire practical skills 
during their undergraduate and postgraduate training."
"In 
its two nursing schools, Helios Spain covers classroom and 
hands-on training as well as vocational training; for exam-
ple to qualify students as Imaging Technicians for Diagno-
sis and Nuclear Medicine and Technicians in Radiation 
Therapy and Dosimetry."
"The division also has eight univer-
sity hospitals where the classroom-based content of a med-
ical school is taught and more than 400 medical staff are 
fully trained each year."

"Leadership development 
We offer two Group-wide programs to our executives."
"In 
the reporting year, we fundamentally revised the Maximiz-
ing Leadership Impact program, which is directed at upper 
management levels exclusively."
"A first execution of the pro-
gram together with the Harvard Business School is planned 
for 2024."
In conjunction with the University of St.
"Gallen, 
we target middle management with a leadership program 
that focuses on strategy implementation, change manage-
ment, and collaboration."

of which 69% were women."
"The focus was on a total of 92 
key positions up to two levels below the Group Manage-
ment Board."
"Members of the Group Management Board 
were not included in the succession planning."
"Both succes-
sors who can assume the corresponding role in a timely 
manner in the event of an emergency and potential succes-
sor candidates were named."
"The key positions will be re-
vised in 2024 to reflect the Group’s future portfolio."
"In the reporting year 2023, there were changes in the 
Group Management Board as well as in the management 
boards of the business segments."
"In the process, around 
half of the positions were filled internally by executives."
"EMPLOYEE RETENTION 
Fresenius offers employees at corporate and business seg-
ment level a fair and appropriate basic compensation."
"This 
is defined, for example, on the basis of collective agree-
ments or internal remuneration guidelines."
"In addition, we 
offer various benefit components, for example employee 
benefit programs, profit-sharing bonuses, pension plans, 
compensatory time accounts, and tariff-based future pay-
ments."
"Not all elements are implemented equally within the 
Fresenius Group, but can, however, be accompanied by lo-
cal benefits depending on the market and employee re-
quirements and regulatory provisions."
"The focus of development is for the rewards to reflect the 
relative value of each job and support career progression in 
line with market trends and local requirements."
"Due to the ongoing reorganization measures within the 
Group, the management approaches to employee retention 
focus on creating structures that support the long-term suc-
cess of the company."
"After successful implementation of 
the planned measures within the framework of #Future-
Fresenius, further employee retention activities can be im-
plemented as needed."
"In addition, Fresenius is working in-
tensively on positioning and strengthening its employer 
brand."
"In the reporting year, the new employee participation 
program Fresenius SHARE was introduced in Germany."
"The program consists of two 
components: on the one hand, participants can annually 
purchase a share package with ordinary shares of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
KGaA at a significant discount.
"Sec-
ondly, four targets have been set, upon achievement of 
which a certain amount will be issued in ordinary shares of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"In addition to increasing the 
Group’s net income, the targets include the topics of cyber-
security (training and internal rating) and quality."
"The first 
shares will be issued in 2024, corresponding to the 
achievement of the targets in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Our efforts in employee development and retention should 
also lead to improved employee KPIs in the long term."
"To 
achieve this, we will continue to invest in our employees."
"The average employee expense was €51.9 thousand in 
2023, compared to €50.1 thousand in 2022."
"In 2023, the proportion of employees who voluntarily 
left1, 2 the company decreased to 10.4% (2022: 11.1%)."
"This KPI was positively influenced by the transformation 
processes at Group and business segment level, the need 
for qualified personnel while the stressful labor conditions 
in the healthcare sector impacted the development in vol-
untary turnover."
"This allows the Management Board to pro-
vide employees with information on important issues per-
sonally."
"In addition, we promote our feedback culture and 
the constructive exchange of ideas."
"1 The data from Fresenius Helios includes all employees from its divisions, expect for the Eugin Group, which only covers the Spanish entities in 2022 and 2023."
2 Calculated as the number of employees who left the organization voluntarily in relation to the number of employees at the end of the year.
"In 
2022, we introduced an annual Group-wide employee sur-
vey for this purpose."
"In this way, we regularly collect feed-
back from our employees on their working environment in 
the business segments."
"We inquire about the strengths as 
well as about opportunities to improve."
"The aim is to obtain 
a picture of opinion and sentiment about working at 
Fresenius based on the survey results."
"In addition, the 
business segments can include their own questions, e."
"g., 
on teamwork, feedback culture, or appreciation."
"In the reporting year, more than 80% of our employees 
were invited to participate in the annual survey."
"Those ex-
cluded from participation are, for example, in entities en-
gaged in ongoing transformation processes."
"The participa-
tion rate was 44%1."
"Once the survey is completed, a 
Group-wide Engagement Index is created from the three 
globally collected Employee Engagement questions."
"The in-
dex is the weighted average of engagement scores derived 
from a business segment’s entities included in the survey."
"The initial evaluation at the end of 2023 revealed an en-
gagement index of 4.132 within the range of 1 (strongly dis-
agree) to 6 (strongly agree)."
"Thus, we did not achieve our 
target under the short-term variable Executive Board com-
pensation --
- an engagement index of at least 4.33."
"Based on the overall results of the employee survey, follow-
up measures can be derived and implemented for each 
business segment to increase employee engagement."
"Fresenius Helios in Spain, for example, has set up commit-
tees for dialog between management and employee groups 
in order to incorporate their direct feedback into improve-
ment measures."
"The Corporate / Other segment has used fo-
cus groups to gather new insights on the topic of recogni-
tion and feedback frommanagers."
"The employee survey and 
the assessment of the Employee Engagement Index are im-
portant tools for developing as an employer, attracting new 
talents, and retaining our employees in the long term."
"Em-
ployee engagement is also related to relevant HR KPIs such 
as absenteeism, turnover, productivity, and customer care."

"On 
this basis, meetings are held once a year between repre-
sentatives of the business segments, the employee repre-
sentatives of the Supervisory Board, and representatives of 
the international trade union associations."
"In the reporting 
year, the meeting took place in November."
"The exchange

(EU) and EEA (European Economic Area) member states in 
which Fresenius employs personnel."
"In total, the Fresenius 
Group employs 155,883 people in Europe, which corre-
sponds to 80% of the total number of employees."
"Of the 
employees in Europe, Germany alone accounts for 60%."
"The EWC represents all employees in the EU and the 
EEA."
"The EWC 
meets once a year, while its executive committee convenes 
three times a year, partially in hybrid form."
"There were also 
two extraordinary meetings of the Executive Committee in 
the reporting year."
"The European trade union federations 
IndustriALL and the European Federation of Public Service 
Unions (EPSU) attend the meetings at the invitation of the 
EWC."
"The focus topics of the EWC in the past fiscal year were 
projects in the Group’s business segments for reorganiza-
tion, e."
"The EBR also dis-
cussed the global engagement survey as well as interna-
tional projects, such as those in logistics or the supply 
chain."
"At its annual meeting, the EWC entered into dialog with 
the Management Boards of Fresenius Kabi, Fresenius Va-
med, and Fresenius Medical Care."
"Regular training courses are held for the members of 
the EWC, for example in the reporting on the topic of cor-
porate due diligence for human rights."
"In the reporting year, the EWC 
visited a Helios clinic in Germany."
"The Executive Commit-
tee was on site at a Fresenius Kabi location in Portugal."
"In 2021, the EWC elected six employee representatives 
to the Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, in-
cluding one representative of the trade unions."
"Due to the 
change in the legal form of Fresenius Medical Care, one 
employee representative left the Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"Her successor from Fresenius 
Kabi was appointed to the Supervisory Board of Fresenius 
SE & Co."

"EMPLOYEE FIGURES 
At the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the Fresenius Group had 
193,865 employees, which was above the previous year’s 
level (December 31, 2022: 188,876)."
"In terms of full-time 
equivalents (FTE), this represented a slight increase of 3%."
"The regional distribution is as follows: about 50% of 
employees are employed in Germany, 32% in the rest of 
Europe, and 11% in Latin America."
"The average age1 of Group employees in the reporting 
year was 41.3 years (2022: 41.4 years)."
"The majority (52%) 
of our employees are between 30 and 50 years of age."
"We 
aim to maintain a well-balanced age structure within our 
Group."
"The distribution again reflects the demand for a 
high proportion of skilled and experienced employees in
our business segments."
"The average age also corresponds 
to a stage in life marked by stability and professional 
growth."
"This circumstance encourages the development of 
internal talent and the professional career growth of peo-
ple, as explained on pages 150 f."

"1 The data from Fresenius Helios includes all employees from its divisions, except for the Eugin Group, which only covers the Spanish entities in 2022 and 2023."
"We have implemented numerous Group-
wide management systems and measures to protect em-
ployees from accidents and work-related illnesses."
"Creating 
a safe and healthy working environment is our priority, and 
prevention is our guiding principle: this is why we offer our 
employees comprehensive programs that aim to promote 
their health and prevent occupational diseases."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
We consider occupational health and safety (OHS) highly 
relevant."
"Our Group-wide ambition is to prevent all work-
related accidents, both for direct employees and third par-
ties, and to continuously improve workplace safety."
"In the 
healthcare products and healthcare services market seg-
ments, we manage our occupational health and safety 
measures in line with specific targets and ambitions, which 
are mainly defined at local level."
"We are guided by, for ex-
ample, data collection on preventive occupational health 
and safety, which we are successively expanding."
"OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY GOALS 
1 Implementation is concluded at all Fresenius Kabi production sites."
"The certification issuance 
from the individual certification companies may extend into 2024."
"OUR APPROACH 
Ensuring the health and safety of our employees is an es-
sential part of our corporate responsibility."
"The Fresenius 
Code of Conduct states that we must take all necessary 
measures to protect our employees and to prevent work-re-
lated accidents."
"All business segments focus on preventive 
measures and promote employees’ responsible conduct 
when it comes to occupational health and safety."
"Occupa-
tional safety concepts are adapted to the specific business 
models of each business segment."
"Our concepts focus on 
occupational health and safety within production, as well as 
occupational health management for employees in our 
healthcare facilities or administration."
"We promote the health of our employees with various 
programs and offers."
"The return of employees to work after 
an illness is governed by the workplace reintegration man-
agement system."
"For more information, see page 162."
"ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
Occupational health and safety within the Fresenius Group 
is organized on a decentralized and country-specific level."
"Within the Group Management Board, the Chief Executive 
Officers (CEOs) of our business segments are responsible 
for operational management."
"Responsibility and manage-
ment for occupational health and safety is regulated by the 
respective Management Boards of the business segments, 
their committees, or management functions and is embed-
ded in the local organizations."
"They decide on the manage-
ment approaches and responsibilities, e."
"g., via a business 
allocation plan."
"The business allocation plan of the Group 
Management Board does not provide for a separate depart-
ment for this purpose."
"Occupational safety specialists in the business seg-
ments advise and support on all issues relating to occupa-
tional health and safety."
"This includes, for example, deter-
mining the need for risk assessments as well as monitoring 
their preparation, implementation, and effectiveness."

"100% of the pro-
duction sites have been integrated."
"The next 
step will be certification at the sites  
integrated in 2023."
"In addition, ISO 45001-certified sites as well as all clin-
ics, subsidiaries and service companies of Fresenius Helios 
in Germany have an occupational health and safety com-
mittee."
"In addition, national requirements are to be ap-
plied, which may include the provision to establish health 
and safety committees."
"g., quarterly 
meetings, these committees discuss identified risks and 
possible measures and review the effectiveness of the de-
fined measures."
"At clinic locations in Germany and Spain, 
local employee representatives have introduced similar 
committees."
"At Fresenius Vamed, staff from temporary em-
ployment agencies can also participate in occupational 
health and safety committees or are informed about deci-
sions."
"In the healthcare services market segment, various 
committees monitor compliance with occupational health 
and safety regulations as part of their regular meetings."
"They also monitor potential incidents in the different divi-
sions and countries."
"We record and report data on occupational health and 
safety --
- such as health-related absences, occupational dis-
eases, or accidents --
- for example on a monthly or quarterly 
basis, to identify deviations."
"If deviations occur, our spe-
cialists initiate root cause analyses and evaluations; correc-
tive or preventive actions are implemented where neces-
sary."
"The risk reporting process ensures that the Group Manage-
ment Board is informed about occupational health and 
safety, i."
"e., about risks or incidents that could have a sig-
nificant impact on business operations, the reputation, or 
the value chain of the Group and its business segments."
"Consolidation takes place at Group level as part of our 
annual non-financial reports."
"The Supervisory Board is in-
formed at least annually about the results."
"Further infor-
mation can be found on pages 87 ff."
"in the Opportunities 
and Risk Report and on page 169 ff."
"in the Compliance sec-
tion."
"Reporting and systems 
We use notification systems or reporting processes for ac-
cidents at work to document and analyze all work-related 
accidents and incidents for our own employees and partly 
for temporary workers or other third parties working on our 
premises."
"Local management assesses these incident inves-
tigation reports."
"At Fresenius Kabi, global OHS manage-
ment is responsible for these assessments."
"The goal is to 
decide whether technical improvements, additional work-
ing equipment, instructions, or further training are re-
quired to avoid reoccurrence in future and to improve oc-
cupational health and safety for employees."
"We also docu-
ment first aid cases and unsafe situations, including near 
misses."
"These are taken into account in the occupational 
health and safety analysis."
"Work-related fatal accidents 
In accordance with legal requirements, all business seg-
ments document work-related fatal accidents in their re-
spective internal risk management systems."
"They use lo-
cally defined reporting channels to inform the safety spe-
cialists directly responsible."
"Depending on process design 
and severity, regional or global OHS management functions 
may be notified as well."
"HR departments also immediately 
report serious and fatal accidents to the competent authori-
ties and accident insurance organizations."
"Furthermore, as 
soon as work-related accidents with fatalities occur, we im-
mediately review existing work processes and initiate a risk 
assessment."
"In the reporting year 2023, no work-related fatalities oc-
curred among employees in the Fresenius Group that were 
attributable to misconduct or inadequate occupational 
health and safety."
"In one case, there was an incident involv-
ing a third-party fatality."

functions are subsequently informed about accidents."
"Fur-
thermore, we collect Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) data for internal reporting or are in the process of 
calculating this indicator at all Fresenius Helios locations in 
Germany."
"In the healthcare products market segment, occupa-
tional accidents are categorized according to their severity 
and reported to the responsible central OHS function --
- and 
to other relevant functions depending on the severity of an 
incident."
"This is how, for example, work-related accidents 
that result in at least one day of absence are reported to the 
central OHS function within two working days; other, less 
severe accidents without or with less than one day of ab-
sence are reported on a quarterly basis."
"Accidents that lead 
to at least one calendar day absence from work are investi-
gated, and the results are documented in bespoke reports."
"We also consider the 
lost time injury severity rate (LTISR)2 in the analysis."
"Occu-
pational health and safety reports are submitted to the 
Management Board and other relevant functions of 
Fresenius Kabi on a quarterly basis."

In the healthcare services market segment, we have a 
Critical Incident Reporting System (CIRS) for critical inci-
dents and near misses at all hospitals."
"e., at least semi-annual, time management reports 
that document absences and absenteeism and their devel-
opment are recorded and evaluated locally in hospitals."
"In 2023, Fresenius Helios introduced a comprehensive 
system for recording accidents at work and commuting ac-
cidents in Germany."
"For this purpose, a data tool for deter-
mining the LTIFR was implemented in all Helios clinics in 
Germany."
"At Fresenius Helios in Spain and Fresenius Va-
med, the LTIFR is already being recorded."
"In the reporting 
year, the LTIFR decreased compared to the previous year."
"This is partly due to the reinforcement of OHS training and 
the improved follow-up processes following accidents."
"In addition, on-site coordination serves the purpose of 
checking the effectiveness of risk assessments and of local 
management approaches to occupational safety and health 
protection."
"In the healthcare services market segment, 
occupational safety and hygiene specialists as well as 
occupational physicians monitor compliance with occupa-
tional medicine, occupational safety, and occupational 
health requirements and their management in accordance 
with public regulations."
"They cooperate continuously and 
across segments and develop improvement processes."
"The most common types of injuries, accidents, and ill-
nesses in the hospital sector were needlestick and cut inju-
ries, musculoskeletal injuries such as contusions or frac-
tures resulting from falls, and commuting accidents, as well 
as assaults by patients or relatives on our employees."
"Typi-
cal occupational illnesses in the post-acute area relate to 
the intervertebral discs, back, or shoulder."
"To prevent injuries in the future, Fresenius Helios, for 
example, updated its central instructions on the prevention 
of needlestick injuries, radiation protection, and handling 
tuberculosis in the reporting year."
"In the Fresenius Group, no violations of internal health 
and safety policies whose impact would have been material 
for the financial position or reputation of the company were 
reported via our reporting channel."
"Further information can 
be found in the Opportunities and Risk Report starting on 
page 87."
"GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS 
In occupational health and safety, all sites are subject to the 
respective local laws and regulations."
"Compliance with 
these regulations is ensured at local level."
"In addition to le-
gal requirements, internal guidelines and directives such as 
1 LTIFR: Number of work-related accidents resulting in at least one day of absence from work in relation to 1,000,000 working hours."
"In 2023, Fresenius Vamed adjusted the scope of reporting."
"2 LTISR: Number of days absent due to work-related accidents in relation to 1,000,000 working hours."
"The Group-wide Fresenius Code of Conduct is com-
plemented by business segments’ own guidelines govern-
ing occupational health and safety, such as the Clinical 
Code of Conduct for the areas of rehabilitation and nursing 
as well as for medical personnel in the healthcare services 
market segment."
"The internal requirements are supplemented by corre-
sponding internationally recognized standards for manage-
ment systems such as ISO 45001 at some sites and other 
certifications in accordance with ISO or national standards, 
e."
"The overarching goal of the ISO 45001 
management system is to continuously improve occupa-
tional health and safety management, to align it with inter-
nationally recognized methods, and to ensure the effective-
ness of existing procedures and systems."
"To drive this for-
ward, we are consistently expanding the number of entities 
certified with this standard."
"We have the ambition to create 
a uniform occupational health and safety management sys-
tem in all areas of the company in order to optimize occu-
pational health and safety in a standardized manner."
"The management systems as well as applicable occupa-
tional health and safety regulations and instructions for em-
ployees of the Fresenius Group also apply to individuals 
with temporary employment contracts."
"This ensures that 
people performing work on a company site or in our build-
ings are protected to the necessary extent."
"Our commitment in the market segments regarding OHS is 
supported, monitored, and certified by external partners or 
regulatory bodies."

on the applicability of standards or policies."
"The certification issuance from the individual certi-
fication companies may extend into the following year."
"2 For ten entities, the certification process was finalized, the certificates were not submitted, yet."
"Local managers review our approach to occupational health 
and safety e."
"once a year for continued suitability, appro-
priateness, and effectiveness, and to identify potential for 
improvement."
"Regular, in some cases annual, internal au-
dits support the verification of data and management ap-
proaches for entities certified in accordance with ISO 
45001 and for those without certification."
"In this way, we 
ensure compliance with internal guidelines and regulatory 
provisions."
"The management system of our production 
sites, for example, is audited and certified annually by TÜV 
Rheinland."
"If other external institutions conduct audits, 
these are coordinated with local management."
"In 2023, we conducted more than 50 internal reviews to 
verify compliance with applicable requirements, consist-
ently analyze existing procedures, validate processes, and 
effectively optimize occupational health and safety manage-
ment."
"The number of health and safety audits depends on the 
size of the individual sites and the range of activities car-
ried out there."
"More than 30 certification audits were per-
formed by external organizations."
"RISK ASSESSMENTS 
The OHS system includes processes for identifying hazards 
and deficiencies, assessing risks for potential incidents, and 
determining control, correction, or mitigation as well as 
prevention and improvement measures."
"These risk assess-
ments are an important part of our occupational health and 
safety management."
"Physical as well as mental or psychosocial health and 
safety risks are identified, analyzed, and evaluated at work-
place level and reduced to an acceptable level through tar-
geted measures, or even eliminated completely."
"The as-
sessments include hazards that arise from work-related ac-
tivities in the immediate vicinity of the workplace, as well 
as those that exist outside of the workplace but that may 
still affect workplace health and safety and health for em-
ployees."
"Risk assessments include all employees who per-
form or have access to routine and non-routine activities at 
workplaces."
"The design of workplace infrastructure, equipment, and 
materials, whether provided by us or by third parties, is 
also included."
"Corresponding risk assessments are carried out regu-
larly --
- usually annually, but at least every three years --
- and 
in close consultation with the respective department heads 
and local experts responsible."
"In the production sector as 
well as in the hospital sector, employees are included in the 
risk assessment."
"Documentation is recorded in relevant 
safety and health protection documents."
"Key risk areas are 
identified via accident reports or employee input and un-
dergo rigorous assessment."
"In addition, risk areas in clinics 
and in production are also examined preventively for po-
tential hazards."
"Our assessments are implemented in ac-
cordance with applicable legal requirements for risk as-
sessments as well as the requirements for ISO 45001 certi-
fication and the implementation of necessary controls."
"In 
Spain, for example, sexual violence is part of the risk as-
sessments as required by Spanish regulations."
"In addition, processes are in place for dealing with par-
ticularly vulnerable employees."
"The 
purpose is to take special preventive and protective
measures through the health monitoring service tailored to 
their positions or activities --
- for example, by adapting their 
workplace or transferring their activity to another one."
"If an entity, be it in production or in clinical settings, 
uses biological agents, these substances are evaluated in 
accordance with applicable legal regulations."
"The corre-
sponding internal risk assessment is recorded in a health 
and safety document and preventive measures are estab-
lished before the respective process is initiated."
"In addition, 
hazardous materials inventories are maintained in the clini-
cal area."
"TRAINING 
The Fresenius Group conducts regular occupational health 
and safety training to prevent incidents in its fields of oper-
ation."
"To prevent work-related injuries and occupational ac-
cidents, all new employees receive safety training at the 
very beginning of their employment, and standard training 
at least annually thereafter."
"For incident scenarios with 
high risks, training takes place more frequently."
"Helios Ger-
many, for example, conducts quarterly drills on power fail-
ure scenarios, in different parts of the building each time."
"Our standardized approach to occupational health and 
safety is complemented by training modules for specific 
workplace risks."
"In our clinics, employee health and safety 
training courses cover, besides general topics, specific ar-
eas such as hand hygiene, safely handling work equipment, 
and hazardous chemicals, as well as emergency prevention
and response."
"Training provided at production sites fo-
cuses on, among other topics, safely handling work equip-
ment and chemicals, and emergency prevention and re-
sponse."
"All business segments employ specialists or representa-
tives for (occupational) safety."
"Vamed Technical Services, 
for example, runs a dedicated safety center."
"It is responsi-
ble for the safety-related operational support."
"In order to 
maintain and further develop their competence, all safety 
specialists are subject to an area-specific training program 
adapted to the respective needs of the organization."
"In ad-
dition, the manager of the safety center is certified as qual-
ity, safety, risk, and environmental manager and as lead au-
ditor."
"At Fresenius Kabi, the global OHS function checks not 
only compliance with applicable standards during internal 
audits, but also, for example, the training matrix and 
whether relevant training has been carried out."
"Any rele-
vant deviations will be included into the local and global 
Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) list, to ensure any 
potential gaps are closed systematically."
"In 2023, all health 
and safety specialists of Fresenius Kabi were offered one 
global training session."
"Furthermore, all sessions are avail-
able at the global EHS and OHS Intranet page."
"Based on this content review, Helios Spain updated its 
training on specific workplace risks to meet new regula-
tions and make the courses more user-friendly."
"More than 
30,000 training sessions were offered in which around 
16,000 employees participated."
"The increase in the number 
of trainings in Spain is a requirement of the JCI accredita-
tion."
"The segment is preparing the JCI accreditation of ad-
ditional centers and also the reaccreditation in 2024."
"WORKPLACE REINTEGRATION MANAGEMENT 
Statutory workplace reintegration management programs 
are in place at Fresenius sites in Germany and Austria."
"In Germany, employees who were unable to work for 
more than six weeks within a year (either one prolonged 
absence or multiple absences) are entitled to a reintegra-
tion procedure."
"In close cooperation with the person con-
cerned, local site management coordinates with relevant 
employee representatives to assess the options for over-
coming an employee’s inability to work."
"They also assess 
which services or assistance can prevent future instances  
of extended health-related absences."
"The aim is to make 
workplace reintegration flexible and as needs-oriented as 
possible, thereby ensuring that employees can return to 
work long-term."
"In a first step, affected employees are  
informed in writing about their options as well as about  
the structure and participants of an initial return-to-work  
conversation."
"In this context, it is also important to 
transparently communicate the goals of workplace reinte-
gration management as well as the type and scope of data 
collected and used for this purpose."
"Potential further measures resulting from this initial 
conversation can also involve additional groups and indi-
viduals --
- as agreed upon with the person concerned."
"In Austria, affected employees receive what is known 
as a reintegration allowance from responsible social insur-
ance agencies."
"This allowance is granted for the duration of 
part-time employment and in addition to an employee’s sal-
ary."
"As in the case of partial retirement, the allowance 
should compensate for a large share of financial losses."
"In Spain, a medical examination of the employees con-
cerned is carried out by the Risk Prevention Service after 
longer periods of sick leave involving extended hospitaliza-
tion."
"This examination reassesses the returning employee’s 
fitness for the workplace, which supports a quick return-to-
work process."
"Furthermore, subsequent tailored measures 
to protect an employee’s health and well-being can be co-
ordinated and implemented."
"The services provided by each 
respective local occupational health management unit also 
support the reintegration measures, e."
"g., sports and health 
offers."
"In the United States, we provide a Short-Term Disabil-
ity program for sick leaves."
"Eligible employees are granted 
up to 25 weeks’ leave of absence and receive between 60% 
and 100% of their normal wage."
"Upon their return, em-
ployees are retrained to facilitate their reintegration."
"In the Dominican Republic, our internal medical unit 
provides physical and emotional support to employees on
long-term sick leave when needed in accordance with legal 
requirements."
"If employees are able to return to work, we 
offer them a position with the lowest possible health risk 
considering business needs and personal qualifications."
"In 
addition, affected employees are supported by the internal 
medical unit and labor relations for a certain period of time."
"PATIENT SAFETY 
In addition to employee health and safety, patient and user 
safety at our facilities is also of great importance."
"For infor-
mation on patient safety in the context of medical treat-
ment, please refer to the Patient and product safety section 
on pages 118 ff."
"In the hospital sector, we have also imple-
mented various measures to protect patients from hazard-
ous situations outside of medical treatment."
"Such hazard-
ous situations can be, for example, fires, power outages, or 
weather-related circumstances, such as ice on parking lots 
or hospital access ramps in winter."
"If such situations occur, 
appropriate emergency and fire protection plans are in 
place, for example to ensure the evacuation of patients."
"Hospital staff are prepared for such crisis situations 
through annual mandatory training."
"Business continuity 
plans for crisis situations complement existing safety 
measures."
"These offers are organized on 
a decentralized basis so that they can be tailored to the 
needs of our employees as precisely as possible."
"On the 
one hand, our offers are aimed at promoting and maintain-
ing physical health and include, for example, vaccination 
programs and preventive medical check-ups by our com-
pany doctors."
"On the other hand, there are contacts, hot-
lines, and information focusing on mental health issues."
"In 
Germany and Spain, Fresenius provides courses on nutri-
tion and physical activity, as well as on emotional manage-
ment."
"In addition, employees and their families receive ex-
ternal and anonymous psychological counseling if needed."
"The diversity of our markets and locations is 
also reflected in our workforce."
"In Germany, we have em-
ployees of more than 140 nationalities."
"We attach great im-
portance to equal opportunities for all employees in the 
workplace as well as in the application, selection, and de-
velopment procedures."
"In order to integrate equal opportu-
nities into all processes and workflows and to overcome 
barriers or unconscious bias, the business segments de-
velop diversity concepts that are adapted to the require-
ments of their respective business models and regions."
"With this approach, we want to provide a framework that 
enables our employees to integrate into a workplace that 
supports them in pursuing their individual professional am-
bitions."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
The Group Management Board welcomes the efforts within 
the business segments to further expand and make greater 
use of activities for more diversity and inclusion in future."
"It 
is our ambition to continuously develop our corporate cul-
ture and attract, promote, and retain talent."
"Different back-
grounds, experiences, and perspectives can lead to better 
decision-making and outcomes and drive progress on all 
levels of an organization."
"In the business segments, we 
want to improve diversity management, e."
"g., with diversity 
training for employees and management."
"As part of the  
DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES GOALS 
    
 
corporate culture, measures to strengthen diversity man-
agement are being developed and implemented."
"The pro-
motion of women in management positions is also an im-
portant concern for us."
"We are developing new measures to 
this end."
"By setting diversity targets and reporting on them 
transparently, we aim to drive forward diversity in our lead-
ership positions."
"A clear goal also directs the focus to areas 
where action is needed."
"This enables us to implement ef-
fective diversity-related measures."
"OUR APPROACH 
At Fresenius, we support equal opportunities for all and 
consciously oppose discrimination of all kinds."
"No one may 
be discriminated against on the basis of skin color, ances-
try, faith, political views, age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, 
cultural background, sexual orientation, physical condition, 
social background, appearance, or other personal charac-
teristics."
"This extends equally to employees, business part-
ners, and patients."
"Our dealings with each other are char-
acterized by mutual respect: open, fair, and appreciative."
"We do not tolerate insults, humiliation, or harassment in 
our daily work, neither internally nor externally."
"Our man-
agers have a special responsibility in this respect and act as 
role models."
"These values and our aspirations with regard 
to diversity are laid down in the Fresenius Code of Conduct, 
which is binding for all employees."
"This lays the foundation 
of our cooperation and corporate culture."
"Further infor-
mation on our approach to equal opportunities is provided 
in the Human rights section on page 179 onwards, and on 
our diversity concept for the Group Management Board 
and the Supervisory Board in the Corporate Governance 
Declaration on pages 211 ff."
"Information about fair com-
pensation can be found in the Employees chapter on page 
148 onwards."
"In 2023, the Group Management Board signed the Ger-
man ‘‘Charta der Vielfalt’’ (Diversity Charter) for Fresenius."
"The healthcare Group is thus taking a strong stance for di-
versity and inclusion in its own company."
"The aim of the in-
itiative is to advance the recognition, appreciation, and in-
clusion of diversity in the working world in Germany."
"The Chief Executive Officers 
(CEOs) of the business segments are responsible for opera-
tional management."
"The management boards of the busi-
ness segments define the management approaches and 
regulate responsibility for DEI topics, e."
"g., via a business 
allocation plan."
The ESG Board member participates in the meetings.
"As 
part of risk reporting, the Management Board of the 
Fresenius Group is informed quarterly."
"The effectiveness of 
DEI measures is discussed, if risks were identified or inci-
dents occurred that could have a material adverse effect on 
the operating business, reputation, or the value chain of the 
Group and its business segments."
"The Audit Committee of 
the Supervisory Board is also informed of developments on 
a half-year basis, the Supervisory Board on an annual basis."
"Further information can be found in the Opportunities and 
Risk Report on pages 87 ff."
"and in the Group Non-financial 
Report in the Compliance section starting on page 169."
"In order to be able to address existing and potential chal-
lenges in connection with diversity and equal opportunities 
on a context-specific basis, responsibilities at regional level 
have been defined."
"Either the HR functions, diversity and 
gender representatives, or, e."
"g., the medical director, are 
responsible for the implementation of approaches and 
country-specific regulations are."
"In the Corporate / Other 
segment, the Group function Corporate HR Management is 
responsible for topics related to DEI."
"Experts in various di-
visions develop training courses, communication material, 
and programs in discussion with other Group functions."
"At Group level, data on diversity and inclusion is col-
lected as needed, but at least annually, and communicated 
to internal stakeholders, e."
"g., employee representatives or 
the respective representatives of the severely disabled."
"In 
addition, the business segments have supplementary re-
porting processes, e."
"g., on a monthly or quarterly basis, to 
identify deviations from internal targets or objectives."
"If de-
viations occur, the responsible persons initiate a root cause 
analysis, evaluate the results, and, if necessary, implement 
corrective or preventive measures."
"A key component of reporting is communication on the 
intranet and social media."
"These communication formats 
provide the Group Management Board with the opportunity 
to draw specific attention to initiatives in the area of DEI 
and to strengthen employee awareness of these issues."
"It is 
particularly important to include affected employee groups 
in this communication and to show them that we take their 
interests into account."
"In addition, we also want to address potential new employ-
ees with our initiatives."
"For example, Fresenius Vamed’s 
German sites are reaching out specifically to people with 
disabilities and chronic illnesses through the MyAbility job 
board with an employer profile."
"Reporting systems and dealing with incidents of 
discrimination 
Information about violations of the principles of the 
Fresenius Code of Conduct and other possible misconduct 
can be reported via various notification systems, e."
"g., 
online and in various languages --
- anonymously, if  
necessary, as described in the Compliance section on 
pages 170 f."
"In addition, employees have the option of confiding in 
an ombudsperson in the event of conflicts or misconduct."
"At Helios Spain, incidents involving sexual and gender-
based harassment can be recorded via a dedicated com-
plaint protocol."
"Within the Group, incidents involving discrimination are 
processed via the responsible function and, depending on 
the severity of the incident, escalated, e."
"g., to regional or 
central level."
"All information is carefully examined, and ap-
propriate action taken in accordance with the results of the 
investigation."
"Sanctions such as actions under employment, 
civil, or criminal law can be imposed."
"After finishing the in-
vestigation, measures that prevent future misconduct, or at 
least make it more difficult, are implemented."
"The reports were documented, in-
vestigated, and evaluated in accordance with the applicable 
compliance regulations."
"We also take reports that are not 
substantiated by the investigation as an opportunity to re-
view existing structures and, if necessary, adjust measures 
as a precaution."
"In 2023, this was not the case."
"No violations of internal policies on diversity and equal 
rights were reported whose impacts would have been ma-
terial for the financial position or reputation of the com-
pany."
"Further information on opportunities and risks can be 
found in the Opportunities and Risk Report starting on 
page 87 and in the Compliance section starting on page 
169."
"GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS 
At Group level, the business segments are subject to the re-
quirements arising from internal guidelines, e."
"g., the Code 
of Conduct, or external requirements, e."
"g., collective 
agreements."
"Collective agreements and works agreements 
also stipulate that all employees covered by these agree-
ments are entitled to defined benefits."
"Due to varying local 
legislation, these internal guidelines are important frame-
works for enabling a tolerant and appreciative working en-
vironment."
"In this way, we ensure that local law is taken 
into account."
"In addition, as part of our business activities, 
we make sure that people can work for us or are supplied 
with our products without fear of discrimination."
"In some locations, we are required by national law to 
establish equality plans to promote equal opportunities and 
wage transparency between men and women, and also 
guarantee non-discrimination in the workplace."
"In 2023, 
more than 70% of Helios Spain’s employees were covered 
by equality plans."
"GENDER BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 
1 First structured survey of the Other category for the 2023 fiscal year."
"DIVERSITY AMONG EMPLOYEES AND IN 
GOVERNANCE BODIES 
In the reporting year, the proportion of female employees 
in the Fresenius Group was 68%."
"The proportion of fe-
males in services or care is traditionally higher than in the 
area of production."
"This is reflected in the proportion of fe-
male employees in our business segments: our business 
segment Fresenius Helios has the highest proportion of fe-
male employees within the Group, with around 75%."
"We want to support employees in all phases of life and 
especially promote the compatibility of family and career --
- 
in the spirit of equity."
"That is why we offer them a variety of 
options for flexible working."
"The country- and location-spe-
cific offer depends on the applicable collective agreements 
and --
- if available --
- equality plans."
"Further information on 
flexible working models can be found in the Employees 
chapter starting on page 149."
"We illustrate the diver-
sity of our employees based on nationalities."
"We do not col-
lect employee data split by ethnicity."
"Following data is 
based on about 70%1 of global employees."
"Our employees 
come from more than 150 different nations."
"Around 57% 
of them have German citizenship, followed by Spanish citi-
zenship (2023: 27%) and Colombian citizenship (2023: 
6%)."
"KGaA in terms of age, gender, education, profes-
sional background, and international experience."
"To 
achieve this, the diversity concept for the Group Manage-
ment Board and Supervisory Board defines criteria to be 
implemented when nominating candidates."
"In addition, on 
page 216 of the Annual Report, we list the individual skills 
and competencies of the members of the Supervisory 
Board in a qualification and competency matrix, which also 
includes the implementation of the diversity concept."
"The 
diversity concept and its current application can be found 
on pages 211 ff."
in the Annual Report 2023.
"In 2023, the 
proportion of women at the first management level was 
30.0%, at the second management level 24.1%."
"To further determine the proportion of women in man-
agement positions in the Fresenius Group, we evaluate the 
participants in the Group-wide variable compensation pro-
gram (Long-Term Incentive Plan 2023 -- LTIP)."
"The LTIP is 
primarily aimed at management positions no more than 
two levels below the Executive Board."
"g., live with diabetes, 
rheumatism, or depression."
"Fresenius is committed to the 
inclusion of these people."
"We want to enable our employ-
ees to apply their knowledge and skills as fully as possible."
"In doing so, the respective local legal requirements must be 
implemented."
"As these differ significantly in some cases, 
management is decentralized and local."
"In Germany, elections for representatives of the se-
verely disabled are held every four years at Fresenius facili-
ties where at least five severely disabled persons are em-
ployed on a more than temporary basis."
"All members of the 
company can stand for election to this office."
"We also have 
corresponding committees in our clinics in Spain."
"Helios Germany concluded an overall inclusion agree-
ment with the division’s representative body for persons 
with severe disabilities."
"It strengthens the participation of 
(severely) disabled people and employees at risk of disabil-
ity and promotes equal opportunities."
"Furthermore, it aims 
to prevent employees with (severe) disabilities from being 
discriminated against or socially excluded."
"In addition, two 
online training courses on the topics of severe disability 
law and the Corporate Inclusivity Agreement are available 
to senior executives of Fresenius Helios in Germany and 
Fresenius Vamed via the training catalog of the manage-
ment academy."
"In 2023, around of 1,200 people completed 
one of these training courses."
1 Excluding employees from Fresenius Kabi and Fresenius Vamed outside of Germany as well as few international administrative offices.
"The segment thus com-
plies with the legal requirement in Spain to employ at least 
2% of people with disabilities relative to the total work-
force."
"Exceptions are possible and must be explained by 
the companies concerned before being accepted by the 
competent authority."
"In addition, Helios Spain has signed 
an agreement from the representative foundation Funda-
ción DKV Integralia to promote diversity in the division."
"DIVERSITY LIVED IN THE WORKING ENVIRONMENT 
At Fresenius, the international and interdisciplinary work 
environment leads to intercultural teams coming together 
to drive improvements in patient care, optimize internal 
processes, and convince potential applicants of our corpo-
rate culture."
"An international and intercultural composition 
of teams --
- especially in our corporate functions --
- can facili-
tate cooperation."
"In many central functions, for example, 
there are employees who are responsible for different re-
gions and are expected to provide the best possible support 
across different segments internationally."
"In order to sustainably promote tolerance and apprecia-
tion within these teams in the long term, it is not only nec-
essary to have a corresponding culture that is exemplified 
by the management bodies; employees are also taught 
through training and continuing education programs."
"For 
example, in 2023, Fresenius Vamed implemented a course 
on intercultural cooperation at the Austrian sites as part of 
the leadership program and conducted DEI training on 
generation management in some areas."
"In addition, an 
online training course on anti-discrimination has been 
available in the business segment since November 2023."
"The employees of Helios Germany were also able to take 
advantage of an online learning program on diversity in 
2023."
"Our aim is to increase employees’ awareness of diver-
sity and equal opportunities."
"Showing appreciation for all 
people and offering equal opportunities is at the core of di-
versity and inclusion."
"However, current research shows 
that we make our decisions largely unconsciously."
"This can 
be helpful in some situations."
"But it is also possible that we 
overlook or misjudge something as a result."
"This is because 
people are influenced by cognitive bias, known as uncon-
scious bias, when making decisions."
"This can lead to per-
son-related decisions --
- such as performance appraisals --
- 
being disadvantageous for individual employees."
"To raise 
awareness of this, we offer online training on the topic of 
unconscious bias for employees and especially for manag-
ers in the Corporate / Other segment."
"Unconscious bias
training was also carried out in individual areas of 
Fresenius Vamed."
"This gives our employees the oppor-
tunity to learn how to question decisions and recognize un-
conscious thought patterns, stereotypes, and prejudices."
"EMPLOYEE NETWORKS 
Within the Fresenius Group, various employee groups have 
been formed, such es employee impact groups or employee 
resource groups (ERGs) in the North America region."
"The 
Women’s Initiative is committed to networking, mentoring, 
and supporting of women."
"The initiative was established in 
2022, initially with a focus on Europe, and now has mem-
bers worldwide, e."
"g., in Australia, Taiwan, and the United 
States."
"These networks are central for the DEI strategy and 
support the Group’s aspiration to develop a work environ-
ment in which diversity and appreciation go hand in hand."
This aim is also reflected in the Diversity Charter.
(Hispanic / Latin employees).
"Detailed information can be found on the Fresenius Kabi 
website."
"In 2023, the segment Corporate / Other, Fresenius Digi-
tal Technology, and Fresenius Kabi again conducted a joint 
learning program on Leadership for Women --
- Boost your 
Self-Positioning."
"The 114 female participants were able to 
strengthen their self-positioning using various topic mod-
ules and network across divisions by means of peer group 
coaching."
"It forms the basis of all activities 
at Fresenius."
"For our employees, this is the foundation of 
their daily activities."
"For our business partners and suppli-
ers, it is the standard Fresenius sets for cooperation."
"In the following sections, we report on how we anchor 
this in our day-to-day business: 
► 
Compliance
► 
Data protection
► 
Human rights
Further information on changes in the reporting of material 
topics can be found on page 109 in the Strategy and man-
agement chapter."
"COMPLIANCE 
For Fresenius, compliance means doing the right thing."
"Our ethical values are based on more than just regulatory 
requirements."
"This means that we not only act in accord-
ance with the law, but also according to applicable sector 
codices, our internal guidelines and values, and using inter-
nal controls to ensure that we adhere to the requirements."
"For our employees, this is the foundation of all our activi-
ties."
"In this way, we want to help ensure that everyone can 
rely on us as a partner of trust and integrity."
"Compliance 
should also ensure what is most important to us: the well-
being of the patients we care for."
"COMPLIANCE GOALS 
Our risk-oriented compliance management system is 
aligned with the activity of our business segments."
"Our key 
ambition is to prevent corruption and bribery in our busi-
ness environment."
"Beyond that, prohibiting violations of 
antitrust law, data protection regulations, trade restrictions, 
and anti-money-laundering laws, preventing the financing 
of terrorism, and protecting human rights are also key ar-
eas, which we address with dedicated compliance 
measures."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
Our aspiration is to integrate our comprehensive under-
standing of compliance into our daily business."
"The aim is 
to prevent violations, continuously improve our compliance 
management system, and to further evolve a living compli-
ance culture, especially among our employees and the 
stakeholders we interact with."
"Exchange on best practices 
between our business segments plays a key role here."
"The 
business segments develop operational goals and measures 
on an annual basis to continuously strengthen the compli-
ance management system."
"In addition, we aim to ensure that we can comply with all 
applicable sanctions and requirements for export controls, 
even in the event of short-term changes in legislation, such 
as those experienced in 2023."
"We have no evidence that 
Fresenius has not complied with applicable sanctions and 
export control requirements."
"Key performance indicators (KPIs) and goals are being 
defined as part of our ongoing compliance monitoring pro-
cess."
Reporting is planned from the 2024 reporting year.
"OUR APPROACH 
Integrity, responsibility, and reliability form the core of our 
understanding of compliance."
"As stated in our Fresenius Code of Conduct, we are fully 
committed to adhering to statutory regulations, internal 
guidelines, and voluntary commitments, as well as acting in 
accordance with ethical standards."
"Violations are not to be 
tolerated."
"If a violation is detected, we perform an investi-
gation, initiate the necessary remediation measures, and 
impose sanctions if applicable."
"In addition, incidents 
prompt us to sharpen our compliance programs and pre-
vention mechanisms."

Implemented 
Pages 180 f."
"It is based on three pillars: prevention, de-
tection, and response."
"Our compliance measures are pri-
marily aimed at using preventive measures to avoid compli-
ance violations."
"At the first and second management level below the 
Group Management Board, as well as below the manage-
ment of the business segments, responsible compliance of-
ficers can also be evaluated according to defined compli-
ance targets."
"Targets are components of the individual vari-
able remuneration."
"The performance discussions of em-
ployees in the area of compliance are also based on compli-
ance criteria, among other things."
"The Group Chief Compliance Officer of 
the Fresenius Group has a direct reporting line to this 
Member of the Group Management Board."
"Within the executive boards of the business segments 
or their management, the responsibility for compliance is 
regulated by business allocation plans."
"The business seg-
ments also established their own compliance organizations, 
which reflect the requirements of the business organiza-
tion, regulatory requirements, and the associated internal 
controls."
"The Group function Risk & Integrity advises the 
corporate functions, sets minimum standards for the com-
pliance management system Group-wide, and manages the 
Group-wide compliance reporting."
"Risk Steering Committee 
The Risk Steering Committee (RSC) --
- under the manage-
ment of the ESG Board member --
- discusses internal and 
external developments regarding the risk management and 
internal control system as an advisory body."
"This includes, 
for example, developments relevant for the compliance 
management system."
"In addition, the RSC advises on sig-
nificant risks and prepares decision proposals for the 
Group Management Board."
"The meetings of the RSC are 
scheduled regularly, at least once per quarter."
"The mem-
bers of the RSC are managers with functional responsibility 
within Group functions and representatives of the business 
segments."
"In addition to the updates in the RSC, the Group Chief 
Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA regularly 
provides the Group Management Board with comprehen-
sive information on all Group-wide compliance initiatives 
and policies."
The Supervisory Boards of Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA and Fresenius Management SE (FMSE) are informed 
about the progress of the compliance measures at least 
once a year, most recently in December 2023."
"Functional reporting lines in the compliance 
organization 
Since the beginning of 2023, all compliance representatives 
of the business segments have reported functionally to the 
Group Chief Compliance Officer of Fresenius SE & Co."
"In 2023, we started to implement corresponding 
functional reporting lines in the business segments."
"Once 
the restructuring has been completed, all compliance offic-
ers will report to the respective Heads of Compliance of the 
business segments."
"The Group Chief Compliance Officer, 
the Chief Compliance Officers, or Heads of Compliance of 
each business segment and the Head of Group Reporting 
and Monitoring form the Group Compliance Management 
Team (GCMT)."
"This management team meets on a monthly 
basis and sets the governance standards for compliance at 
Fresenius and supports the effective implementation of the 
compliance management system."
"The GCMT regularly ex-
amines the results of the compliance risk analysis, the com-
pliance figures, the further development of the compliance 
management system and the results of monitoring 
measures."
"The management teams of the business segments re-
ceive regular reports on compliance from their Chief Com-
pliance Officers or Heads of Compliance."
"Reporting paths 
If Fresenius employees suspect misconduct, e."
"g., violations 
of laws, regulations, or internal guidelines, they can report 
the potential compliance incident to their supervisors or the 
responsible compliance officers."
"In addition, employees 
and third parties can report potential compliance incidents 
anonymously, where legally permitted, e."
"g., by telephone 
in more than 30 languages or online via whistleblower sys-
tems available in up to 8 languages and email addresses set 
up specifically for this purpose."
"Incoming reports are treated confidentially as described 
in the respective guidelines to protect persons reporting."
We take all potential compliance violations seriously.
"An in-
itial assessment focuses on the plausibility and possible se-
verity level of the potential violation."
"The compliance departments or, 
depending on the severity of the cases, the ombudspanels, 
carry out preliminary assessments of reports received and 
initiate risk-appropriate investigations on a case-by-case 
basis."
"The severity of the compliance violation determines 
who is responsible for further investigation."
"If necessary, a 
dedicated team takes over the investigation, which may in-
clude internal experts, but can also comprise external sup-
port."
"Measures are implemented in a timely manner by the 
responsible management in close cooperation with the 
compliance officers."
"Depending on the type and severity of 
the misconduct, disciplinary sanctions or remedies under 
civil or criminal law may be imposed."
"After completion of 
the investigation, we use the results of internal reviews and 
reports to review our business processes."
"We implement 
corrective or improvement measures where necessary to 
prevent similar misconduct in the future."
"Compliance cases are evaluated based on the Group-
wide policies as well as on those of the business segments, 
which comply with the Group-wide policies."
"The Group 
Chief Compliance Officer informs the responsible board 
member immediately about compliance cases, which could 
lead to a potential high impact, based on an internal assess-
ment."
"The Group Management Board also receives an an-
nual overview of reported cases by category and business 
segment from the Group Chief Compliance Officer of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and is informed in detail about the 
investigations relevant to the Group."
"In 2023, a total of 806 compliance reports (2022: 375) 
were received via the incident databases at Fresenius 
SE & Co."
"KGaA, and the business segments."
"They were rec-
orded via various reporting paths."
"We received the most complaints in the area of misuse 
of corporate assets and HR / Workplace, topics, which are 
part of this non-financial Group report."
"The increase in re-
ports is, among others, due to the introduction of auto-
mated fraud prevention systems, and internal communica-
tion campaigns, which have proven to be efficient."
"Further 
information is provided on pages 165 f."
"in the Diversity 
chapter."
"262 of the total reports received were not classified as 
relevant compliance reports following a detailed assess-
ment by our responsible compliance teams."
"Such reports 
mainly concerned the areas of HR and patient satisfaction 
and were further processed by the relevant departments."
"Guidelines and regulations 
The Fresenius Code of Conduct forms the framework for all 
rules applicable in the Fresenius Group."
"The Code of Con-
duct lays out the principles of conduct for all employees, in-
cluding managers at all levels and members of the Group 
Management Board."
"The Code is aligned with recognized 
international regulations and was adopted by the Group 
Management Board."
"In addition, the business segments im-
plemented their own Codes of Conduct, which are adapted 
to the individual characteristics of each business segment."
"The applicable Code of Conduct is part of the employment 
contracts and is available to all employees."
"Guidelines, or-
ganizational directives, and process descriptions supple-
ment and further define the rules of the Codes of Conduct."
"When implementing 
measures, we take into account the respective national or 
international legal frameworks."
"In addition, a law firm re-
viewed the design of the Corporate / Other’s segments com-
pliance management system and concluded that it is organ-
izationally effectively anchored and programmatically ap-
propriately designed."
"Stand-
ard operating procedures (SOPs) define the related docu-
mentation for the case management, such as templates for 
investigation plans and investigation reports."
"Furthermore, 
they are revised on an ad-hoc basis to take into account the 
requirements of recent legislation updates and to further 
improve the quality and consistency of case management 
work across the globe."
"In addition, we revised the Fresenius Code of Conduct 
for Business Partners and incorporated human rights as-
pects and requirements from the German Act on Corporate 
Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (Lieferketten-
sorgfaltspflichtengesetz --
- LkSG)."
"Risk management 
By using standardized methods, we regularly record, ana-
lyze, and evaluate compliance risks in the business seg-
ments and at Fresenius SE & Co."
"As part of inte-
grated risk reporting, defined core compliance risk sub-
groups are regularly reported and assessed, including, for 
example, bribery, corruption, and antitrust law."
"The com-
pliance representatives exchange information on key find-
ings from the respective risk assessments, which may re-
sult in additional compliance risk subgroups to reflect new 
risk areas or risk clusters."
"The internal control system is an important part of 
Fresenius’ risk management."
"In addition to internal con-
trols regarding the financial reporting, it includes control 
objectives for further critical processes, such as quality 
management and patient safety, cybersecurity and data 
protection, and sustainability."
"Fresenius documented rele-
vant critical control objectives in a Group-wide framework, 
integrating the various management systems into the inter-
nal control system in a holistic manner."
"We adapted our Group-wide integrated risk manage-
ment tool as well as our risk methodology to implement ap-
plicable regulatory requirements and to further improve the 
reporting quality of risks."
"Risk entries are validated by sub-
ject matter experts, i."
"e., the Compliance function, in order 
to ensure the consistency and quality of these entries."
"Risk 
mitigation plans will be tracked and monitored to ensure a 
steady mitigation effect."
"Due to the constantly changing external and internal re-
quirements and environment, our risk management and in-
ternal control system is being continuously developed."
"27 
out of 153 control objectives are currently related to com-
pliance processes, in particular in the areas anti-corruption, 
trade compliance, anti-money-laundering, and anti-
trust / competition compliance."
"In 2023, the internal control 
system was further expanded by the business segments, in-
cluding structured training and communication measures."
"In the reporting year, there were no incidents from the 
topics explained below that could have materially affected 
the reputation or financial position."
"Audits and inspections 
The Internal Audit departments conduct independent and 
risk-based audits to improve the effectiveness of compli-
ance and anti-corruption."
"If weaknesses are identified, In-
ternal Audit monitors the implementation of remediation 
actions taken by the respective management."
"In 2023,  
11 internal audits with audit reference corruption were 
conducted at operating sites of the business segments."
"The 
audit engagement results were analyzed by the compliance 
organizations and incorporated into the continuous im-
provement of existing measures."
"Structural changes to the 
processes related to the compliance organizations were not 
required."
"Dealing with stakeholders  
Our Code of Conduct and the related guidelines for 
Fresenius Group employees also regulate our relations with 
business partners and suppliers."
"We expect them to comply 
with applicable laws and standards, as well as ethical 
standards of conduct, in daily business and specified this in 
our Fresenius Code of Conduct for Business Partners."
"Among other topics, the Codes explicitly prohibit corrup-
tion and bribery and oblige our partners to comply with rel-
evant and applicable national and international anti-corrup-
tion laws."
"Business segments with significant exposure to 
interaction with healthcare professionals have specific rules 
for these interactions, as explained in the Transparency in 
the healthcare sector section on page 111 in the Strategy 
and management chapter."
"We inform our business partners 
about these requirements before entering a business rela-
tionship and perform a risk-based business partner due dil-
igence."
"The Codes of Conduct of the Fresenius Group are 
publicly accessible."
"An overview of the most relevant stake-
holder groups is provided on pages 110 f."
"in the Strategy 
and management chapter."

office in Berlin and an EU Relations Office in Brussels are 
available as contact points for politicians and the represent-
atives."

icy makers on policy initiatives that require expertise in 
medicine and the healthcare industry."

by Fresenius’ employees and representatives is governed 
by our Code of Conduct, as well as by the applicable legal 
standards regarding our relations with external partners 
and the public."
"Information on lobbying expenditures is 
published as required by law in the business segments and 
countries concerned."
"Business partner and investment due diligence 
All business segments and Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA con-
duct risk-based due diligence on business partners before 
entering into a business relationship."
"This also includes hu-
man rights aspects, as detailed on pages 181 f."
"The busi-
ness partners to be screened are selected on a risk-based 
basis according to defined criteria."
"A risk profile of the 
partner is drawn up and targeted measures are initiated: 
accordingly, the compliance contract clauses are based on 
the partner’s risk profile to prevent corrupt actions."
"We also 
reserve the right to terminate the contract in the event of 
misconduct."
"In 2023, we conducted various audits of busi-
ness partners, of which 939 alone related to human rights 
risks."
"Further information can be found in the Human 
rights section on pages 181 f."
All business segments and Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA 
perform regular checks of all business partners against the 
applicable sanctioned party lists."
"Every ac-
quisition and investment proposal submitted to the Group 
Management Board must first be discussed, reviewed, and 
evaluated by the AIC."
"If necessary, we initiate safeguarding 
measures and include, for example, compliance declara-
tions and guarantees in the contracts."
"Following an acquisi-
tion, we integrate the new company into our compliance 
management system as quickly as possible."
"Dealing with conflicts of interest 
We want to avoid potential conflicts of interest and assure 
patients of appropriate treatment options."
"In this context, 
integrity also means that our employees clearly separate 
private interest from that of the company."
"They make deci-
sions for Fresenius based on objective criteria."
"Our employ-
ees are obliged to make potential conflicts of interest trans-
parent to their supervisors as soon as they have identified 
the conflict and before the business action is taken."
"The af-
fected employee and his or her supervisor have to discuss 
the exact circumstances."
"The supervisor will derive a risk 
analysis from these circumstances and initiate the appro-
priate measures."
"Fresenius supports its employees in dealing responsibly 
with conflicts of interest by defining clear requirements and 
providing guidance, as well as answers to the most fre-
quent questions, on the intranet."
"Training and regular up-
dates of information complement the activities at the Group
level and within the business segments."
"Our Compliance 
departments are also available as a contact partner for all 
related questions."
"Our Guidelines for Dealing with Business Partners and 
Customers regulate the handling of donations."
"They state 
that Fresenius donates for scientific or charitable purposes 
and without expecting any consideration, on a voluntary 
basis only."
"Donations and other contributions to political 
organizations are provided in accordance with applicable 
legislation."
"Fresenius Helios prohibits unilateral monetary 
allocations and sponsorships from industry."
"Financial transactions 
Controls for cash transactions and banking transactions are 
part of our Internal Controls Framework and will be regu-
larly tested and adjusted, if required."
"For more information, 
please refer to the Opportunities and Risk Report starting 
on page 87."
"Money laundering 
Fresenius has established appropriate measures to address 
money laundering risks."
"These measures include internal 
controls, such as the prohibition of certain cash payments, 
as well as risk analysis and review processes for relevant 
transactions."
"We report suspicious transactions to the au-
thorities."
"The controls implemented are embedded in poli-
cies and appropriate training is provided."
"How-
ever, appropriate sanction mechanisms typically provide 
exemptions for such deliveries, and Fresenius expects that 
the scope of such exemptions will remain unchanged."
"It is 
particularly important to us to comply with all currently ap-
plicable legal provisions, e."
"g., with regard to sanctions or 
export controls."
"To this end, we introduced various 
measures, such as special IT system checks for deliveries 
that are subject to import or export restrictions."
"In our re-
sponsible central Group function and in our business seg-
ments, we have dedicated experts for trade compliance and 
a trade compliance program in place."
"In addition, automated IT-based checks for each 
transaction at Fresenius Kabi are an integral part of the 
trade compliance program."
"Training 
Compliance training is a high priority for Fresenius."
"Our 
employees are offered training on compliance issues via 
various formats --
- such as in-house training, live webinars, 
and on-demand video training --
- covering basic topics such 
as our Code of Conduct and corporate guidelines."
"Depend-
ing on the employee group, more specific topics such as 
anti-corruption, antitrust law, anti-money-laundering, data 
protection, and information security are also included --
- es-
pecially for particularly high-risk areas."
"Participation in essential basic training, such as on the 
Code of Conduct, is mandatory."
"Mandatory e-learnings will 
be distributed to all employees of the defined target group."
"Employees are prompted and reminded to participate in 
mandatory training courses."
"To promote a risk-conscious 
and value-oriented corporate culture, we train executives 
using a dialog-based approach."
"In the reporting year 2023, the Group function Risk & In-
tegrity rolled out three training modules on the topics of 
Business Integrity, Financial Compliance, and Finance In-
tegrity across the Group for the first time."
"Furthermore, all new employees of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA who started work by December 1, 2023, have been 
assigned to mandatory training on the Code of Conduct."
"Training is a key component of our compliance culture 
that is continuously developed further and is designed and 
implemented in a practical manner."
"Tax compliance 
As a global healthcare Group, we implement projects in 
more than 60 countries, distribute healthcare products and 
provide services to hospitals and healthcare facilities."
"Due 
to our business activities, we are subject to various local 
tax obligations."
"In the countries in which we operate, we not only sup-
port the development of healthcare systems, but also create 
jobs that contribute to local tax revenue."
"This enables us to 
make a significant contribution to preserving the macroe-
conomic stability of national economies."
"At the same time, 
we want our business activities and the contributions we 
make to be accompanied by compensation for the demands 
on resources, infrastructure, services, labor, and admin-
istration."
"Our approach 
The basis for paying taxes are the business activities of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA or one of our subsidiaries in a 
country."
"When choosing a location, other aspects such as 
the availability of qualified personnel, or political, eco-
nomic, legal, and regulatory framework conditions play a 
role in addition to strategic business issues."
"In the course 
of an overall assessment, the possibility of minimizing cur-
rency risks as well as tax considerations can also influence 
the choice of location."
"Adhering to all globally applicable tax obligations is the 
central principle of our understanding of compliance."
"Our goal is to fulfill all tax obligations seamlessly 
and punctually, and to always work within the legal frame-
work."
"We refrain from implementing tax structures without 
business purpose or commercial reason."
"Organization and responsibilities 
The chief responsibility for the tax affairs of Fresenius lies 
with the Group Management Board."
"The functional respon-
sibility for tax affairs is delegated by the Chief Financial Of-
ficer (CFO) to the management of the Corporate Tax de-
partment of Fresenius SE & Co."
"The Corporate Tax department is generally responsible 
for the tax affairs of Fresenius SE & Co."
"In addition, it 
provides various services for the individual business seg-
ments and advises decision-makers in the departments at 
Group and subsidiary level on the fulfillment of their tax 
obligations."
"The department also actively proposes ways in 
which corporate structures and business transactions and 
processes can be implemented."
"This approach is intended 
to minimize risks and promote corporate objectives 
through forward-looking tax planning."
"At the level of the business segments and their subsidi-
aries, the respective division or local CFOs are generally re-
sponsible for tax affairs."
"These are supported either by the 
local tax departments, external advisers, or the Corporate 
Tax department."
"Information on ways to report suspected acts of non-com-
pliance can be found in the Reporting paths section on 
page 170 onwards."
"We have published our Group Tax Pol-
icy on our website."
"Tax transparency 
Fresenius does not specifically settle in certain countries in 
order merely to generate tax benefits or create tax struc-
tures: the focus is always on the business activities of our 
companies."
"A few subsidiaries are located in countries 
known as tax havens."
"The Fresenius Group took over the 
majority of these companies as a result of acquisitions."
"The 
maintenance of these structures is always examined and 
evaluated in detail in the course of acquisitions."
"Relations with tax authorities 
The Fresenius Group maintains a cooperative, honest, and 
respectful relationship with the tax authorities and other 
public institutions."
"To achieve this, regional and cultural 
differences in the respective countries are always taken 
into account."
"Control system 
The Fresenius Group has internal control systems in place 
in order to meet its tax compliance objectives."
"Globally, 
these are subject to the requirements of our Group-wide 
Fresenius Code of Conduct and Group Internal Controls 
Framework."
"Based on this, the respective organizations 
have their own standards."
"In this way, we ensure that the 
Fresenius Group complies with the tax and reporting re-
quirements in all legal systems in which it operates."
"At the
same time, the tax processes are also subject to review by 
external auditors."
"Risk management 
In all business segments and at Group level, we imple-
mented risk-management systems that also cover tax risks."
"These are constantly identified, systematically recorded 
and assessed, taking into account the probability of occur-
rence and the possible financial risk."
"The risks identified 
through this process are reported in the external financial 
reporting."
"Emphasis is placed on preventing any acts of 
non-compliance regarding taxes before they occur."
"The Group Management Board is responsible for the 
Group’s risk management system."
"Further details on the 
risk management system can be found in the Opportunities 
and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"Transfer pricing 
We aim to make our business operations as efficient as 
possible."
"We therefore bundle requirements, map central 
business structures where it makes strategic sense, and 
produce locally wherever possible to ensure that patients 
receive the care they need quickly."
"This global distribution 
of business activities also leads to transactions between the 
individual companies of the Fresenius Group worldwide."
"This ensures 
that profits are generated and taxed where value is created."
"In addition, we undertake to comply with the relevant 
transfer pricing documentation requirements in the coun-
tries in which the Fresenius Group units operate."
"Co-operative Compliance is an initi-
ative to promote better tax compliance, whereby tax au-
thorities and taxpayers benefit equally from more transpar-
ency."
"DATA PROTECTION 
Networked data and globalized corporate activities open up 
decisive opportunities for high-quality and future-proof pa-
tient care."
"At the same time, the highly digitalized work 
within the Fresenius Group requires particularly careful 
handling of personal data, especially sensitive medical 
data."
"A Group-wide, holistic, and robust data protection con-
cept is therefore of the utmost importance for the compre-
hensive protection of personal data."
"It is our task to ensure 
a secure IT infrastructure, clearly regulated data processing 
procedures, and comprehensive awareness of all employ-
ees in all organizations."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
It is our ambition to raise our employees’ awareness of 
data-protection-compliant handling of personal data as 
much as possible through our data protection activities."
"They should be enabled to avoid data protection violations 
through extensive knowledge and careful handling of per-
sonal data and be able to identify any data protection viola-
tions immediately in order to take the necessary measures 
without delay."
"We report on data protection incidents on 
pages 170 f."
"We are also supported in this by internal guidelines and 
documented processes, such as responding to requests 
from data subjects in a timely manner, reporting data 
breaches to the relevant authority within the specified 
timeframe, and providing appropriate documentation."
"OUR APPROACH 
As a healthcare provider, we bear responsibility in a sensi-
tive environment on which the lives and health of many 
people depend."
"Accordingly, we know how to reconcile 
high quality standards with economical, efficient IT-sup-
ported processes in our regulated markets."
"In doing so, we 
are always aware of the sensitivity and increasing need for 
protection of the data and information we process."
"The Fresenius Group and its operating entities process, 
e."
"g., personal and other data of 
 
► 
our patients, 
► 
our employees, 
► 
customers, 
► 
suppliers, and other business partners."
"We are committed to respecting and protecting the rights 
and freedoms of all data subjects and personal data is pro-
cessed only for purposes specified in each case, in accord-
ance with legal requirements."
"We also require third parties 
with whom data is shared for specified purposes, e."
"g., for 
service provisioning, to comply with applicable data protec-
tion requirements."
"This is also verified by external audits, 
as explained on pages 106 f."
"in the Strategy and manage-
ment chapter."
"Data protection is core to our operating busi-
ness and embedded in our Fresenius Group Code of Con-
duct."
"To meet new requirements or to accommodate new 
technologies, we are constantly developing our data protec-
tion management systems and the accompanying data pro-
tection measures."
"The Data 
Protection Officer1 of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA reports di-
rectly to this person."
"The Management and Management Boards of the busi-
ness segments are responsible for the implementation of 
data-protection-related governance systems in their busi-
ness segment."
"The business segments have defined respon-
sibility for data protection, e."
"g., via a business allocation 
plan."
"In addition, data protection is a regular topic for the 
Risk Steering Committee, which includes the ESG Board 
member, among other members."
"The Data Protection Offic-
ers of the business segments act independently regarding 
the exercising of their tasks and report to their respective 
Management."
"Further information on the Risk Steering 
Committee can be found in the Compliance section starting 
on page 170."
"KGaA and all business segments 
maintain data protection organizations in line with their or-
ganizational and business structure, including the afore-
mentioned independent Data Protection Officers."
"The data 
protection organizations support the management and spe-
cialist departments of the assigned companies in opera-
tional data protection issues and in complying with and ad-
hering to the applicable data protection requirements in the 
respective countries."
"The respective Data Protection Offic-
ers are responsible for monitoring compliance with these 
requirements."
"They are the contact persons for national 
and international supervisory authorities and are supported 
internally by other specialists."
"Depending on the business 
segment, the data protection advisors and specialists are 
organized centrally, regionally, and / or locally."
"The data 
protection advisors have the task of advising the Business 
Process Owners (BPOs) and other employees on the Group 
in data protection matters and coordinating data protection 
activities."
"A BPO is a natural person in the company who is 
responsible for processes in which, among other things, 
data processing takes place."
"Responsibility for operating data protection tasks lies 
with the respective expert functions, supported by pro-
cesses of the data protection management system."
"In cer-
tain topics, our compliance management system provides 
additional support, e."
"Regular alignment meetings of experts, not only from 
data protection, but also from other departments such as 
IT, in dedicated committees ensure that IT security, infor-
mation security, and data protection topics are discussed."
"Based on the outcomes of these meetings, measures may 
be derived, or strategic decisions formulated and proposed 
to the respective management."
"In addition, the data protection experts regularly ex-
change information on best practices and initiatives, in-
cluding at Group Coordination Meetings and conferences, 
jours fixes, and in other formats."
"Reporting systems 
External parties and all employees of the Fresenius Group 
may raise concerns regarding data protection via the exist-
ing reporting systems or dedicated email addresses."
"We 
investigate and evaluate all reported indications of potential 
infringements as quickly as possible and, where necessary, 
question and adjust our corporate processes."
"When re-
quired, we report privacy breaches to the relevant authori-
ties and inform those affected without undue delay and in 
accordance with legal requirements."
"The data protection 
organizations conduct their own investigations and docu-
ment possible violations."
"In 2023, no data breach was reported via the reporting 
channels that had a direct impact on the financial position 
or reputation of the company."
"A total of 25 reports were 
submitted in the reporting year, as explained on pages 170 
f."
in the Compliance section.
"Audits and risk assessments took place at segment or
local level, as described below."
"Findings of these audits are 
remediated on the respective level, if necessary."
"For further 
information on opportunities and risks, please refer to the 
Opportunities and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"The Data Protection Officers prepare reports on the 
number, type, and processing status of data protection inci-
dents and data subject inquiries, which are communicated 
in accordance with the organizational structure explained."
"In the event of data protection breaches, additional pro-
tective measures or the adaptation of contractual clauses 
may be necessary to improve the protection of rights and 
freedoms, depending on the degree of severity identified."
1 The term Data Protection Officer is used in the following chapter as a synonym for the various functions and designations for those responsible for data protection.
"At the core of this is the 
joint commitment of all business segments and Fresenius 
SE & Co."
"KGaA to data protection, as specified in their 
Codes of Conduct."
"In the Fresenius Code of Conduct, we 
clearly commit ourselves to the careful handling of data 
and the right to informational self-determination."
"The pri-
vacy statements are publicly available, for example on the 
website of Fresenius SE & Co."
"We have also implemented mandatory internal policies 
for data protection and the handling of personal data, 
known as Binding Corporate Rules (BCR)."
"In the reporting 
year, we rolled out the BCR as a new data protection guide-
line at the Corporate / Other segment and Fresenius Kabi."
"The BCR are complemented by further standard operating 
procedures and working instructions guidelines."
"These 
support the employees in implementing the BCR in their 
areas of responsibility."
"To ensure compliance with data protection regulations, 
several functions in the Group perform regular checks with 
different focuses in all business segments."
"Internal Audit 
departments carry out independent audits to improve the 
effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance 
processes in all business segments."
"Aspects of data protec-
tion are also taken into account on a risk basis."
"The data-
protection-related results of performed audits are analyzed 
by the respective Data Protection Officers and are incorpo-
rated into the continuous improvement of existing 
measures."
"Furthermore, Data Protection Officers, among 
others, perform regular specific data protection audits."
"We 
are also subject to external controls and, if necessary, use 
third parties to carry out audits of business partners who 
implement data processing activities for us."
"In addition, data protection controls and data protection 
risk assessments are an integral part of various internal 
control frameworks in the business segments."
"Findings on 
potential improvements from data privacy audits, risk as-
sessments, and reviews are used to continuously develop 
our data protection processes."
"Risk assessment 
We regularly assess risks related to data protection, IT se-
curity, and information security using standardized meth-
ods."
All business segments and Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA 
record their data processing activities in central IT applica-
tions and subject them to a data protection review, includ-
ing a risk assessment, as early as possible in the implemen-
tation or adaptation process."
"In this context, the data pro-
tection officers support those responsible in preparing a 
data protection impact assessment if required."
"Among 
other things, this enables us to implement the data protec-
tion requirements through the use of appropriate technical 
and organizational measures in processing person-related 
data and to minimize potential risks."
"Regular reviews are 
conducted to ensure that they are up to date, e."
"g., with re-
gard to technical developments."
"Further, it is the responsi-
bility of the respective process owner to provide notifica-
tion of relevant planned changes in data processing activi-
ties in order to subsequently enable a new data protection 
review to be carried out if necessary."
"For more information 
on IT security, please refer to the Cybersecurity chapter 
starting on pages 142 ff."
"The regular internal and external controls, analyses and au-
dits by the responsible data protection advisors, data pro-
tection management systems or external audit functions 
are supplemented by the audit activities of the Group Inter-
nal Audit function."
"In this juncture data protection 
measures such as guidelines and their implementation are 
also considered in a risk-oriented manner."
"In 2023, eight 
audits with the audit reference data protection were carried 
out."
"The results of the audits are analyzed by the data pro-
tection organisations and incorporated into the continuous 
improvement of existing measures."
"Training 
We train employees on current requirements and threats in 
connection with data protection and data security, using an 
extensive range of e-learning courses, face-to-face training, 
and other training measures."
"Therein, we differentiate be-
tween specialist functions and responsibilities, the scope of 
training, and between voluntary and mandatory training."
"We supplement general training with training measures for 
specific employee groups."
"In this way, we ensure that em-
ployees entrusted with processing data are informed about 
the current legal situation and the corresponding internal 
requirements."
"In principle, basic training on data protec-
tion is mandatory for all employees."
"Newly hired employees also receive online mandatory 
instruction in data protection within a defined period."
"When and how often evidence has to be provided regarding 
the instruction of employees in data protection is also de-
termined."
"Within our Group, this ranges between eight 
weeks for initial training courses to at least every two years 
for update training courses thereafter."
"Data subject rights  
All business segments and Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA are 
committed to safeguarding the rights of data subjects by 
adequately informing them and by having established pro-
cesses and tools in place to ensure that requests are an-
swered sufficiently and in a timely manner."
"Fresenius in-
forms data subjects --
- whether employees or external par-
ties --
- about the processing, e."
"g., collecting and storing, of 
their data via privacy notices."
"We inform employees via in-
ternal communication channels of any amendments to the 
data protection information that affect them."
"Our technical and organizational measures, including 
the implementation of corresponding applications, serve to 
safeguard the rights of data subjects in accordance with the 
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU-
GDPR)."
"We provide data subjects with information in a con-
cise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible way for 
them to find out what personal data about them we pro-
cess."
"The requests can be evaluated and responded to at 
corporate or segment level in our Group, or both, or in the 
local language."
"With these solutions, we aim to support data subjects in ex-
ercising their rights to access, rectification, restriction, ob-
jection, portability, and deletion of their personal data in a 
timely manner."
"We comply with such data subject requests 
or rights in compliance with legal requirements."
"International data transfer 
As a globally operating company, we assign high priority to 
ensuring an appropriate level of data protection in all inter-
national data transfers as defined by the EU-GDPR and all 
other international legal requirements relating to interna-
tional data transfer."
"These include our BCR, accompanied 
by mandatory internal company policy and guidelines."
"BCR 
ensure the participating companies establish a uniform 
level of data protection aligned with the standards of the 
EU-GDPR and contribute to the lawful processing of per-
sonal data internationally within the companies."
"The latest 
developments in the area of international data transfer are 
closely monitored and taken into account in risk assess-
ments and when concluding contracts."
"The internally pub-
lished templates are subsequently adapted."
"When data is 
processed in another country by third parties, the contrac-
tor is subjected to a careful review."
"We take measures, 
such as additional safeguards like pseudonymization, to en-
sure compliance with privacy regulations and maintain an 
appropriate data protection level."
"The data protection de-
partments are involved in any negotiation relating to data 
protection contracts."
"HUMAN RIGHTS 
As a global healthcare company, Fresenius views respect 
for human rights as an integral part of our responsibility."
"Human rights areas of particular concern to the Group in-
clude, for example, working conditions at our own sites and 
in the supply chain."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
Fresenius is committed to respecting human rights."
"Our 
Group-wide ambition is to regularly analyze human rights 
impacts, prevent violations, minimize risks, and take neces-
sary remedial action in the event of violations --
- in our sup-
ply chain and in our own companies, as well as in connec-
tion with our products and services."
"OUR APPROACH 
Medical care for patients and the well-being of our more 
than 190,000 employees are among the most important en-
gagement areas of our human rights due diligence."
"Our 
commitment to human rights extends beyond our own 
company operations and core business."
"In line with our hu-
man rights due diligence program (Human Rights Pro-
gram), we take human rights aspects into account when se-
lecting and cooperating with our suppliers and business 
partners, too."
"We expect them, among other requirements, 
to respect human rights in their value chain as well."
"We 
specify and communicate these expectations in our Code of 
Conduct for Business Partners."
"Further details on our Hu-
man Rights Program can be found on pages 181 ff."
"The knowledge gained by doing so 
helps us to ensure secure supplies while addressing human 
rights risks in the procurement of important raw materials 
and supplies."
"Organization and responsibilities 
The Group Management Board oversees our Group-wide 
Human Rights Program."
"The Group function Risk & Integ-
rity reports directly to the ESG Board member."
"Within this 
Group function, the Group Human Rights Office estab-
lished in 2023 is responsible for the Group-wide human 
rights due diligence approach, such as the Human Rights 
Risk Assessment methodology."
"It supports the business 
segments in implementing requirements that serve to fullfil 
their human rights due diligence obligations."
"Operational implementation is ensured through Group-
wide governance and clear responsibilities within the busi-
ness segments and at Group level: 
► 
Group Human Rights Office:
The Group Human Rights Office is responsible for the
overall management of the Human Rights Program."
"It
supports the business segments in the implementation
and monitors the activities to implement their human
rights due diligence obligations."
"The Group Human
Rights Office consists of employees from the Risk & In-
tegrity function of the Fresenius Group."
"► 
Human Rights function in the business segments:
Each business segment has appointed a Human Rights
function."
"This Human Rights function is responsible
for the operational implementation of the Group-wide
human rights strategy in its own business segment and
in companies directly affected by the German Supply
Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorg-
faltspflichtengesetz --
- LkSG)."
"► 
Risk owners:
We have defined risk owners for relevant specialist ar-
eas."
"As subject matter experts, the risk owners are re-
sponsible for appropriate risk management and the im-
plementation of risk analyses in their area of responsi-
bility --
- for example in Human Resources, Procure-
ment, or Occupational Health and Safety."
"The members of the Group Human Rights Office, besides 
the Human Rights functions, participate in the Human 
Rights Council with other persons from specialist depart-
ments of the business segments."
"It meets quarterly and is 
the advisory body to the Group Human Rights Office."
"The 
approximately 20 members of the Human Rights Council 
are active in various functions within the Group, including 
compliance, legal, sustainability, communication, and pro-
curement, and thus cover the many perspectives of the 
topic."
"The participants discuss Group-wide initiatives and 
present new concepts and methods."
"In 2023, this included, 
e.g., the results of the risk analysis as well as reporting on
the status of the implementation of the Human Rights Pro-
gram."
"For further information on possible risks relevant to hu-
man rights, please refer to the Opportunities and Risk Re-
port on pages 87 ff., to the Group Non-financial Report on 
pages 169 ff."
"(Compliance section), or to the report submit-
ted to the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export 
Control (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, 
BAFA) on the LkSG."
"The publication of the BAFA report is 
planned for the first half of 2024."
"It covers our fundamental principles on human rights as 
a commitment for the Fresenius Group."
"It includes, among 
other things, that we do not tolerate any use of force, threat 
of force, or other forms of coercion."
"We strictly prohibit the 
use, support, or toleration of exploitative, child, or forced 
labor."
"Discrimination must be prevented, equal opportuni-
ties promoted, and safe working conditions created."
"We po-
sition ourselves on various topics both with regard to 
Fresenius’ employees and with regard to our suppliers."
"A revised version of the Human Rights Statement was pub-
lished in 2023 and reflects the requirements of the LkSG."
"We update it on the basis of the human rights focus topics 
that we identify, e."
as part of the risk analysis.
"A revised 
Human Rights Declaration will be published in 2024."
"Where applicable, topics such as the handling of con-
flict minerals, developing technologies, or ethical issues in 
research, development, and clinical studies are prepared 
and considered by the business segments or specialist ar-
eas concerned."
"Before the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation came into 
force, we already addressed this relevant topic."
"We do not 
purchase conflict minerals directly."
"However, it cannot be 
completely ruled out that they have been processed in com-
ponents and semifinished products that we purchase and 
further process or use in our products."
"In this case, the rel-
evant Group and business segment Codes of Conduct for 
dealing with suppliers and other business partners apply."
"In the reporting year 2023, no violation of the applicable 
requirements was detected."
"Our Codes of Conduct for Business Partners and Sup-
pliers take into account the respective business models of 
the business segments."
"The Codes of Conduct are used in 
purchasing contracts and contracts with other business 
partners, e."
"g., distributors and sales representatives --
- as 
annexes or references."
"Explicit human rights and environ-
mental clauses are also included in contracts on a risk ba-
sis."
"Furthermore, in the reporting year 2023, a Social & Labour 
Standards Policy was adopted."
"This sets minimum social 
standards for the entire Group and specifies the content of 
our Code of Conduct."
"Further details can be found on page 
147 in the Employees chapter."
"Human Rights Program 
Through our Human Rights Program, we establish preven-
tive measures helping Fresenius to identify and address hu-
man rights risks in its business processes and include hu-
man rights risks in our Group-wide risk management."
"An 
important component of risk management, as explained on 
pages 89 f."
"in the Annual Report, are internal controls."
"Findings from the processes of the internal control system 
(ICS) will be incorporated into the regular review of our 
Human Rights Program for appropriateness and effective-
ness."
"Human rights risk management and assessment 
The Fresenius Group has identified human rights areas and 
fields of action in all business segments that are particu-
larly relevant to our value chains."
"In doing so, we consider 
various factors, including business models of the business 
segments, and current public debates and regulatory devel-
opments such as the LkSG."
"A Group-wide standard operat-
ing procedure (gSOP) defines a framework for human 
rights risk management."
"Our Human Rights Risk Assessment methodology is in-
tegrated into our Group-wide risk management."
"We con-
sider potential risks based on country-, industry- and busi-
ness-segment-specific aspects."
"We assess them based on 
their potential impact and likelihood."
"This also takes into 
account what influence we as a company have on the prob-
ability of the risk occurring."
"Building on our assessment we 
define preventive and, if necessary, remedial measures."
"The responsible functions in the business segments are 
closely involved in carrying out risk analyses."
"In addition to 
the annual risk analysis, we also conduct event-related risk 
analyses."
"HUMAN RIGHTS RISK ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED 
In 2023, a total of 939 multi-step risk analyses were con-
ducted on human rights risks within the Fresenius Group."
"Where necessary, we use the results to adjust processes."
"We are continuously developing the processes of hu-
man rights risk assessment, e."
"g., by adapting it to regula-
tory requirements such as the LkSG or by optimizing inter-
nal department-specific processes."
"If we suspect human 
rights to be violated, we respond accordingly."
"In the report-
ing year, we established a Remediation Toolbox."
"This 
handout is intended to support our business segments in 
dealing with human rights violations.For more information 
on opportunities and risks, please refer to the Opportunities 
and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"Complaint mechanisms and reporting channels 
To make it as easy as possible for potentially affected peo-
ple, we offer internal and external reporting systems."
"In the reporting year, we received reports via the exist-
ing reporting channels, which we also examined for human 
rights aspects."
"REPORTS RECEIVED 
2023 
Human-rights-related reports received 
47 
Thereof substantiated 
3 
All information is processed by specially trained staff within 
a team of experts."
"Depending on the circumstances, it may 
be necessary for us to involve other specialist departments 
to clarify an incident."
"More information on our reporting 
channels and how we are dealing with potential compliance 
violations can be found in the Compliance section on page 
170 onwards and in the Data protection section on page 
177."
"For example, man-
datory training for employees on the respective Code of 
Conduct includes human rights aspects."
"Additionally, in 
2023, 61 training sessions were held on the Human Rights 
Program, risk analysis, dealing with human rights viola-
tions, and human rights due diligence."
"In addition to the 
central contact persons for human rights activities in the 
business segments, these training sessions were also di-
rected at other persons from specialist departments."
"In addition, we developed a human rights training 
course in the reporting year 2023, which will be gradually 
rolled out globally from 2024."
"Supplier evaluation 
Transparency in our supply chains is important to us, for 
example, to identify and address human rights risks."
"Addi-
tional information on procurement activities can be found 
in the Group Management Report on page 50."
"We expect our suppliers to comply with applicable laws 
as well as ethical standards of conduct in their day-to-day 
operations."
"We conduct risk-based business partner re-
views before entering into new business relationships."
"If 
high risks are identified based on risk analysis results or 
the business partner due diligence, we contact the supplier 
and evaluate the situation in more detail using another 
questionnaire on a risk-based approach."
"Based on the risk analyses results, we initiate preventive 
measures where necessary."
"Information on risk analysis 
and prioritized risks in the supply chain can be found on 
pages 181 f."
"If we become aware of a hu-
man rights violation in our supply chain, the goal is to take 
remedial action and avoid a future violation in our business 
operations."
"In the Fresenius Group, we maintained business rela-
tionships with more than 58,000 suppliers in 2023."
"Cur-
rently we do not collect data on the proportion of spend 
with local suppliers at Group level."
"It is important to avoid possible nega-
tive effects on the environment and health."
"To this end, we 
identify and evaluate potential hazards and take the neces-
sary measures to protect the environment."
"In its business operations, Fresenius is subject to numerous 
guidelines and regulatory requirements that must be ap-
plied and complied with at all times."
"We integrate national 
requirements into our internal guidelines, which are de-
fined in ISO-based or ISO-oriented management systems."
"We aim to analyze our impact on the material environ-
mental aspects in both the manufacturing and services ar-
eas, as the risks of financial or reputational costs linked  
to environmental litigation are expected to increase."
"Also, 
reducing in-process material is essential for many indus-
tries affected by growing natural resource scarcity."
"Dedi-
cated monitoring of natural resource consumption and 
waste-generating activities can lead to lower costs and, in 
some cases, new business opportunities."
"This is why we as-
sess trends and adapt our activities if deemed essential to 
support the sustainable, long-term growth of our business."
"The focus of the environmental management system in 
production is to improve environmental performance and 
prevent environmental incidents."
"Key opportunities arising 
from this include, e."
"g., reducing energy and water usage, 
as well as wastewater, waste, and emissions, in relation to 
production activities."
"We leverage these opportunities to 
optimize resource utilization and prevent overconsumption."
Key figures are reported on pages 187 and 192 f.
"The certifica-
tion issuance from the individual certification companies may extend into the following year."
Coverage applies to entities already certified or for which a certification is planned.
"Where divisional data is not available due to dif-
ferent reporting periods, it is extrapolated based on exist-
ing data."
An adjustment will be made in the next report.
"Prior year figures have been reclassified to conform to the 
current year presentation."
"Due to rounding, numbers and 
percentages in this report may not add up to absolute fig-
ures."
"The figures for the Eugin Group of Fresenius Helios 
only include the Spanish sites in 2023 and 2022."
"The fig-
ures for Fresenius Vamed only include fully consolidated 
units that are operationally active, i.e."
"in the field of pro-
duction or healthcare services."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
It is our ambition to further promote environmental action, 
awareness, and sensitivity throughout the entire organiza-
tion."
"Our efforts are embedded in the environmental poli-
cies of business segments."
"At Group level, total Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions are part of the long-term variable 
remuneration of the Management Board, as we explain 
starting on page 190 in this chapter."
"Timeframe  
Status 2023 
Further information 
Implementation of an environmental management system according 
to ISO 14001 at all production sites."
"g., in waste, water, wastewater, and energy con-
sumption, our ISO 14001 and 50001-certified organizations 
set themselves local targets in addition to Group-wide tar-
gets."
"Fresenius Helios in Spain sets its own annual ambitions 
together with the segment functions involved."
"These are 
derived from the analysis of new regulatory requirements, 
the most important environmental aspects for the hospitals, 
the analysis of environmental risks, and the results of previ-
ous audits."
"The hospitals are informed of the ambitions and 
implement measures to achieve them; they also carry out 
quarterly inspections."
"In addition, Helios Spain’s quality de-
partment checks compliance with the targets every six 
months."
"The results are reported annually to the manage-
ment."
"In 2023, the focus was on the following six environ-
mental aspects: consumption of electricity, natural gas, wa-
ter, and paper, and recycling of cardboard and light pack-
aging waste."
"OUR APPROACH  
As a healthcare Group, we have a special responsibility that 
requires all business segments to implement local, re-
gional, or global management systems to take into account 
the respective business models and adapt processes ac-
cordingly."
"The common foundation of environmental man-
agement approaches in our business segments is the ISO 
14001 standard."
"For further information on the energy 
management system according to ISO 50001, please refer 
to the Climate protection --
- energy and emissions section 
on page 191."
"Organization and responsibilities 
The Group Management Board member responsible for Le-
gal, Compliance, Risk Management, ESG, Human Re-
sources and the business segment Fresenius Vamed is re-
sponsible for steering strategic Group-wide targets, e."
"g., 
the Group-wide climate target."
"The Chief Executive Officers 
(CEOs) of the business segments are responsible for opera-
tional management."
"The management boards of the busi-
ness segments define the management approaches and 
regulate responsibility for environmental topics, e."
"g., via a 
business allocation plan."
"Since the requirements in our healthcare products and 
healthcare services market segments differ, environmen-
tal management is decentralized and organized according 
to the business model of the business segments."
"Each busi-
ness segment has functions that monitor and control the re-
spective environmental impacts."
"They analyze environmen-
tally relevant vulnerabilities, develop suitable standard pro-
cedures, and implement appropriate measures."
"They also 
support their certified local entities in effective, directed 
environmental goal-setting, monitoring these goals as well 
as developing and implementing mandatory guidelines for 
all entities."
"Relevant environmental data, e."
"g., on consumption, is 
reported regularly, e."
"g., quarterly, to the responsible cen-
tral function for performance control."
"If significant devia-
tions from previous performance occur, our specialists ini-
tiate a root cause analysis that is evaluated, and corrective 
or preventive actions are implemented where necessary."
"As part of risk reporting, the Group Management 
Board is informed quarterly."
"The effectiveness of the envi-
ronmental management systems is discussed if risks were 
identified or incidents occurred that could have a signifi-
cant impact on the operating business, the reputation, or 
the value chain of the Group and its business segments."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is informed 
about developments on a half-year basis, and the Supervi-
sory Board as a whole is informed annually."
"For further in-
formation, please refer to the Opportunities and Risk Re-
port starting on page 87 of the Annual Report, and the 
Compliance section from page 169 onwards."
"Reporting systems 
In the production area, a reporting process is implemented 
for environmental incidents such as violations of environ-
mental regulations, pollution caused by uncontrolled spills, 
or complaints from third parties."
"Environmental incidents 
are recorded internally and categorized into five levels --
- 
depending on the impact of an environmental incident."
"En-
vironmental incidents are reported to the global EHS (Envi-
ronmental, Health, and Safety) function responsible for pro-
duction, by local managers."
"Where necessary, environmen-
tal incidents are immediately reported to the relevant au-
thorities."
"Environmental incidents are analyzed to deter-
mine the cause and to prevent future incidents."
"In the hospital segment, there is a reporting process for 
incidents that require immediate communication to the lo-
cal community, such as the release of hazardous sub-
stances or accidents in the areas of energy or water."
"In ad-
dition to rectifying an incident, internal and external com-
munication takes place immediately, depending on the situ-
ation, followed by an investigation into the cause."
"In the reporting year, no environmental incidents were 
reported via the reporting channels whose impact would 
have been material to the financial position or reputation of 
the company."
"Further information

ties and Risk Report on page 87 onwards."
"In the reporting year 2023, local environmental inci-
dents were documented in the internal reporting system."
"Where necessary, local authorities were informed of the in-
cidents immediately after an incident became known of."
"Necessary measures were implemented to reduce the envi-
ronmental impact of the respective incidents."
"We have also 
taken the environmental incidents at the affected sites as an 
opportunity to implement preventive measures, such as 
training courses, in order to avoid future incidents."
"No inci-
dent led to a severe impact on the environment, biodiver-
sity, or the communities nearby."
"Guidelines and regulations 
In terms of environmental management, all locations are 
subject to the respective local regulations and laws."
"In ad-
dition, internal guidelines on environmental protection are 
implemented --
- e."
"g., specific regulations on how employees 
should handle hazardous substances or waste."
"Manage-
ment manuals and standard operating procedures provide 
the framework for the local environmental and energy man-
agement system."
"These can include detailed checklists for 
evaluating environmental protection measures and forms 
for assessing environmental risks."
"For the healthcare products market segment, we pub-
lished a corresponding environmental policy in 2023."
"The 
guidelines include general principles on how to address 
and mitigate environmental risks, as well as how to prevent 
environmental incidents."
"We also expect careful and 
responsible handling of nature and its resources from our 
suppliers; this is set out in the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct."
"In addition, we take sustainability criteria into account in 
decision-making processes for new projects, such as the 
development of products or capacity expansions."
"Our environmental commitment is reviewed or certified 
by external partners and regulatory bodies."
"We are contin-
uously expanding the number of sites certified according to 
ISO 14001."
"In this way, we want to ensure the effectiveness 
of existing procedures and systems."
"The overarching ambi-
tion is also to improve the efficiency of our management 
systems."
"In 2023, further entities were added on a Group 
level and the scope of entities for which the standard ap-
plies was extended."

"In 2023, no systematic non-compliances were detected dur-
ing the global ISO 14001 internal audits and by TÜV Rhein-
land with regard to the certification of environmental man-
agement in accordance with ISO 14001."
"Environmental protection includes protection of marine re-
sources, especially with regard to product development."
"For example, in the healthcare products market segment, 
fish oil suppliers certified by the label Friends of the Sea 
are selected for SMOFlipid® and Omegaven® lipid emul-
sions for infusion."
"Identification and management of environmental 
risks 
Our production sites and our clinics in Germany and Spain 
must identify environmental protection measures associ-
ated with environmental aspects of their activities and ser-
vices."
"This can relate to emissions into air, water, or soil, 
consumption of natural resources and raw materials, waste 
and wastewater, packaging, transport, or other local envi-
ronmental impacts."
"Environmental impacts of organizations 
are evaluated and, where necessary, environmental protec-
tion measures are implemented and reviewed for effective-
ness."
"Furthermore, using our internal audits, we identify fur-
ther improvement opportunities and develop appropriate 
measures with locally responsible managers to tap that po-
tential."
"In addition, internal audits cover preparedness for 
emergencies including heavy weather events, floods, earth-
quakes, or hurricanes, depending on relevance or location."
"The frequency of global internal audits depends on audit 
observations from previous audits, environmental inci-
dents, certification status, or the evaluation of the manage-
ment review, and can vary between one and four years."
"We, too, need this resource at our produc-
tion plants and in our healthcare facilities and want to han-
dle it responsibly."
"We work with management systems and 
control systems globally to ensure that water quality meets 
internal and external regulatory requirements."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
It is our ambition that water in any area of our business can 
be used safely and not harm the health of our patients and 
employees, and that it is sufficiently available at all times."
"We further aim to avoid unnecessarily polluting the sources 
from which we obtain water or into which we discharge our 
wastewater."
"OUR APPROACH 
We use local management systems, process owners, and 
operating procedures to ensure that the respective local 
guidelines on water and wastewater are strictly adhered to."
"Water management measures consider a reduction in water 
and wastewater volumes, and monitor the quality and au-
thorized withdrawal of water and discharge of wastewater."
"Fresenius continuously reviews national and interna-
tional regulations on water management."
"The internal prin-
ciples, guidelines, and standard operating procedures --
- 
which contain instructions for the responsible handling of 
water, including the control of wastewater --
- are adapted to  
the applicable regulatory requirements."
"Our water manage-
ment is closely linked to our hygiene management."
"De-
pending on the business unit, either environmental or hy-
giene experts ensure that internal guidelines and external 
regulations are adhered to."
"Water usage and withdrawal 
In production, water is used for sterilization and cooling 
processes, as a component in the production of medical 
products, and for hygiene procedures."
"The water used for 
our products, e."
"g., for infusion solutions such as sodium 
chloride, must meet stringent quality requirements to en-
sure product quality and patient safety."
"For our healthcare facilities, a sufficient supply of fresh 
water is central to patient well-being and hygiene."
"Most of 
the water withdrawal is from municipal water supplies."
"The 
largest freshwater users are rehabilitation clinics with ther-
apy pools, e."
"g., in the orthopedics department, and facili-
ties that sterilize used medical instruments."

Measures to reduce water consumption 
Some manufacturing sites are reusing water, e."
"g., by using 
condensate water from installed air handling units or in 
steam condensate recovery systems."
"In the reporting year, 
implementation of several projects to save water was 
started at the production sites."
"We have 
also optimized cleaning and sterilization processes at sev-
eral locations."
"Positive effects on water consumption are 
expected in 2024."
"Due to the material significance of fresh water use for 
compliance with hygiene measures and thus patient safety 
in our healthcare facilities, no significant reductions in wa-
ter withdrawal are made."
"Due to internal requirements re-
garding drinking water quality, we do not reuse water or 
use gray water --
- i."
"e., treated water from showers or wash-
basins."
"Water quality 
We have implemented applicable risk management proce-
dures in all facilities that come into action if impurities are 
detected or if the quality of water is not compliant with 
standards set --
- and established dedicated reporting lines."
"The local government is informed of any detected critical 
deviations from local drinking water provisions."
"In Ger-
many, some of our clinics are designated as testing centers 
for local drinking water quality."
"In this way, we support not 
only the safety of our patients, but also that of the sur-
rounding population and the municipalities that supply us 
with drinking water."
"In the case of contaminated fresh water from the public 
network, our clinics have the option of connecting addi-
tional water treatment modules upstream of the hospital’s 
own network in addition to its own treatment facilities."
"All 
hospitals have contingency plans in place in the event of 
supply bottlenecks to ensure healthcare for patients."
"Water discharge 
Water discharges are locally managed at the sites in ac-
cordance with applicable local regulations."
"In production, 
water discharge by quantity is regularly reported to global 
EHS in accordance with internal standards and guidelines."
"In addition, Fresenius Kabi has been a member of the Anti-
microbial Resistance (AMR) Industry Alliance (AMRIA) 
since 2020 and has been actively involved in the associa-
tion’s governing bodies since 2021."
"The business segment 
is working on the introduction of the AMR Industry Alli-
ance’s Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework 
(CAMF)."
"For further information, please refer to the Group 
Non-financial Report 2022 on page 208."
"In 2022, AMRIA and BSI Standards Limited released the 
Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard, providing guidance to 
manufacturers on responsible antibiotic production."
"The 
goal of this standard is to minimize the risk of developing 
antibiotic resistance and reduce aquatic ecotoxicity in the 
environment resulting from the manufacturing of human 
antibiotics."
"The standard complements the already high 
production quality and safety management at our produc-
tion sites."
"A pivotal component of the approach involves the 
use of a risk-based methodology to evaluate and control the 
waste streams generated during antibiotic manufacturing."
"The implementation, which began in 2022, involved the 
introduction of a comprehensive quantification mass bal-
ance template by Fresenius Kabi."
"The template’s function is 
to assist antibiotic manufacturing sites in determining anti-
biotic concentrations in manufacturing wastewater dis-
charge and conducting gap analyses, with the overarching  
goal of aligning with the Predicted No-Effect Concentra-
tions (PNEC) set forth by the AMRIA."
"PNEC represents the 
concentration level of a substance in the environment be-
low which no adverse effects are expected."
"Furthermore, a dedicated communication channel has 
been established to connect local sites with the global EHS 
team."
"This initiative fosters continuous alignment with the 
Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard, ensuring ongoing ad-
herence and improvement in the future."
"Identification and management of water risks 
We analyze water availability using the World Resources 
Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, which contains infor-
mation on current and future water risks at specific loca-
tions."
"We have identified manufacturing sites that are in ar-
eas with extremely high or high risk of water scarcity."
"At 
these sites, efficient water management is especially im-
portant to ensure water availability for production and to 
prevent negative impact on the local water situation as far 
as possible."
"Manufacturing plants are requested to conduct a cli-
mate risk assessment including water risks such as floods, 
droughts, or heavy rain and set up measures in case a risk 
is identified."
"In the hospital sector, evaluation of water risks is car-
ried out as part of Group risk management."
"We can only operate sustainably if we use 
the raw materials available to us efficiently."
"This also in-
cludes the responsible handling of waste --
- because it con-
tains valuable resources that can be returned to production."
"In the health sector, strict hygiene requirements apply to 
the materials used and to the safe disposal of hazardous 
waste."
"With clear internal guidelines and comprehensive 
controls, we ensure that these are complied with."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
Through systematic waste management, we aim to reduce 
our material consumption and minimize the amount of 
waste produced."
"To this end, Helios Spain, for example, is 
pursuing the ambition of increasing the recycling rate of 
packaging materials in the clinics by primarily using paper 
and lightweight packaging."
"The aim is to prevent metal, 
plastic, or brick packaging from ending up in the waste mix 
in order to promote the recycling of these materials."
"OUR APPROACH 
For Fresenius, as a healthcare Group, professional, safe 
waste disposal goes hand in hand with the requirements of 
hygiene and sterility in production processes and treat-
ments in hospitals."
"Our approach extends from the selec-
tion of suitable disposal containers to cleaning and sterili-
zation procedures and the occupational safety of our
employees in the professional disposal of hazardous, e."
"The waste must not pose a danger to our 
patients or the environment, either."
"The handling of waste in the health sector is strictly 
regulated."
"All locations are subject to the respective local 
regulations and laws."
"In addition, internal requirements for 
waste management are included in our environmental 
standard operating procedures."
"As the business models of 
our business segments are different, Fresenius conducts 
waste management on a decentralized basis."
"Responsibility 
for that lies with the management of the production sites, 
local EHS managers, or dedicated waste managers."
"Individ-
ual risks are assessed independently and, where necessary, 
internal guidelines for dealing with waste are established."
"The responsible persons provide training to their employ-
ees and carry out checks to ensure that the standards con-
tained therein are adhered to."
"Where necessary, local training courses on waste man-
agement are conducted."
"Internal and external audits of our 
waste management systems and of the commissioned 
waste disposal companies can be conducted by the local 
organizations to ensure compliance with the applicable 
regulations."
"Waste disposal 
Responsibility for the disposal of waste in accordance with 
the applicable local regulations lies with local organizations 
and healthcare facilities."
"All sites are required to separate 
their waste according to local, national, and industry-spe-
cific regulations and to store the waste under consideration 
of measures to protect the environment, e."
"g., to avoid con-
tamination."
"Non-recyclable waste is disposed of by com-
posting or incineration or is sent to landfill."
"In the healthcare products market segment, we record 
waste volumes generated at our production sites, logistics 
centers, compounding centers, and the further ISO 14001-
certified organizations and categorize them by waste type 
and disposal method."
"Waste is mainly generated as a by-
product of production processes or in the downstream 
value chain as packaging material of the product containers 
in hospitals, private households, or nursing homes."
"This in-
cludes both non-hazardous and hazardous waste, i."
"e., sol-
vents, cytostatics, or antibiotics."
"Plastic waste represents the largest portion of classified 
non-hazardous waste in production."
"Hazardous waste is, to 
a large extent, processed and reused for a different or simi-
lar purpose."
"To a large extent, the internally generated 
waste is recycled."
"Non-recyclable hazardous waste is 
mainly incinerated and a large part of it is led into energy 
recovery."
"No special requirements are 
placed on the collection and disposal of the former from an 
infection prevention perspective."
"Together with wound and 
plaster dressings, underwear, disposable clothing, and dia-
pers, for example, they make up the largest proportion of 
the total waste generated."
"Hazardous waste is specially dis-
posed of by professionals."
"Waste reduction and recycling 
If the design of a product is under the control of an ISO 
14001-certified organization, as part of the life cycle per-
spective, the design phase must take environmental aspects 
into account, for instance, sustainable, e."
"g., recycled com-
ponents or packaging."
"The influence of the organization on 
pharmaceutical products can be limited due to the im-
portance of patient safety and product quality require-
ments."
"The healthcare products market segment takes envi-
ronmental aspects into account during the development 
phase and is increasingly placing its strategic focus on 
more environmentally friendly products."
"There are also various projects in our hospitals to im-
prove the reduction, recycling, avoidance, and reuse of 
waste."
"In Germany, for example, reusable crockery can be 
borrowed free of charge from all Helios-owned canteens, 
double-sided printing has been introduced as standard and 
the use of recycled paper in printing devices in the admin-
istration."
"We were able to reduce food waste at 15 pilot lo-
cations in Spain in the reporting year by implementing effi-
ciency measures."
"Another current challenge is that energy is becoming 
more and more expensive, especially if it is obtained from 
dwindling fossil resources."
"Our production processes and 
the operation of healthcare facilities require a high level of 
energy input."
"Energy-efficiency measures can lead to

short- and long-term cost savings.
"In addition, through the 
increased usage and generation of renewable energies, we 
also want to make an important contribution to climate pro-
tection."
"OUR GOALS AND AMBITIONS 
We survey our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions annually in 
order to identify emissions-intensive activities and derive 
reduction measures."
"For example, we are introducing new 
technologies with a lower environmental impact which can 
improve the energy efficiency of our processes and thus 
lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions."
"We are also work-
ing on recording our Scope 3 emissions so that we can also 
include emissions from the upstream and downstream sup-
ply chain in our climate goals."

responding reduction of respective CO2 emissions."
"Uninterrupted energy supply, see the following expla-
nations, is a top priority for Fresenius in order to ensure 
patient safety and reliable production or care."
"Within this 
context, we implement energy-saving measures wherever 
possible."
"Guidelines and regulations

"We review the effectiveness of our management systems 
through internal audits and carry out independent audits, 
as presented in the Environmental management section on 
pages 184 ff."
"These external certification audits are carried 
out using a multi-site model, for example."
"The model fore-
sees the audit of a representative sample of sites."
"In 2023, prescribed audits were carried out in the busi-
ness segments."
No systematic deviations were identified.
"Uninterrupted power supply in healthcare facilities 
In recent years, refrigeration technology, which serves to 
cool technical equipment and hospital rooms, has become 
more important for hospital operations than heat genera-
tion."
"In addition, more frequent severe weather events may 
pose a threat to the smooth healthcare services of hospi-
tals."
"In order to ensure an uninterrupted energy supply at all 
times, every hospital has a mains backup system: in the 
event of a power outage, this system guarantees a secure 
supply of electricity for the principal energy consumers in 
the clinics within a few seconds."
"To safeguard this protec-
tion, these emergency power systems are inspected and 
tested regularly --
- monthly in Germany and at least once a 
year in Spain."
"In addition, we increase the security of the 
energy supply through self-generated electricity --
- Helios 
Germany, for example, covers 25% of its total electricity 
consumption through self-generated electricity."
"In the reporting year, we again focused our activities 
on energy efficiency measures and increasing our renewa-
ble energy usage across the Fresenius Group."
"Our main en-
ergy sources remain gas and electricity."

Expansion of renewable energies 
We derive energy to 99.7% from external providers."
"This 
includes the purchase of renewable energy such as hydro-
power, solar, or wind power."
"We are exploring the use of 
renewable energies and already generate our own electric-
ity at numerous production sites and clinics, e."
"g., via com-
bined heat and power systems or solar panels."
"In 2023, we purchased around 551,260 MWh of renew-
able electricity."
"We also use energy from photovoltaic and 
biomass plants or from thermal and electrical cogeneration 
and pellet boilers."
"Fresenius Kabi, for the first time, purchased green elec-
tricity for seven production sites in 2023."
"We intend to 
achieve a 6% annual reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions."
"We plan to continue theses activities for the fol-
lowing years."
"Fresenius Kabi also operates photovoltaic 
systems at six of its production sites, and two more were 
approved for operation in 2023."
"These will be completed in 
2024."
"Helios Spain commissioned three new photovoltaic sys-
tems on the roofs of hospitals in Málaga, Marbella and To-
ledo in 2023, bringing the total number to 23."
"Fresenius 
Helios switched to 100% certified green electricity in Ger-
many in 2022."
"With these efforts, we increased the share of 
renewable electricity consumption across the Group from 
about 12% in 2022 to about 18% in 2023."
"Increase in energy efficiency 
To increase energy efficiency in buildings, the performance 
of relevant energy consumers is measured, compared with 
more energy-efficient systems, and finally a decision is 
made about retrofitting."
"In this way, efficient as well as eco-
nomically sensible solutions are used --
- such as LED lamps 
or heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems 
(HVAC)."
"In the healthcare products market segment, we are 
gradually retrofitting the fans in a total of 21 HVACs at one 
of our production sites."
"In 2023, five systems were retrofit-
ted."
"Fresenius further invests in new buildings and mod-
ernizations that meet the latest energy standards and legal 
requirements."
"The air conditioning systems in our hospitals in Spain 
are responsible for a large proportion of the total energy 
consumption of Helios Spain."
"Since 2011, we have been 
working on automating the management of these devices 
and have implemented this mode of operation in ten hospi-
tals already."
"For example, when outside temperatures drop, 
the systems adjust their output automatically."
"This allows 
us to better adapt to increasingly frequent, abrupt, and ex-
treme temperature changes and save energy through more 
efficient use."

"In the reporting year, Fresenius generated a total of 
5311 thousand t CO2e (2022: 641 thousand t CO2e)."
"Our 
Scope 1 emissions account for 308 thousand t CO2e and 
could be decreased by 2% compared to the previous year 
(2022: 315 thousand t CO2e)."
"This decrease was due to 
overall lower energy consumption this fiscal year, achieved 
partly as a result of our energy efficiency measures."
"Our 
Scope 2 emissions (market-based) of 223 thousand t CO2e 
already reflect the emission reduction from the increased 
share of renewable electricity."
"Scope 2 emissions calcu-
lated according to the location-based approach amounted 
to 431 thousand tons of CO2e."
"In comparison to the 2020 base year, we reduced our 
total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by about 22% in absolut 
terms."
"This puts us on track to meet our Group climate tar-
get."
"An overview of total emissions according to the loca-
tion-based approach can be found on page 198 in the Fur-
ther key figures chapter."
"We have launched a project to reduce Scope 1 emis-
sions at five production sites which will serve as pilot sites."

"KGaA, 
Bad Homburg, (hereinafter the ‘‘Company’’) for the period 
from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 (hereinafter the 
‘‘Separate Non-financial Group Report’’)."
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are the external 
sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in 
the Separate Non-financial Group Report."
"This responsibility includes the selection and applica-
tion of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and 
making assumptions and estimates about individual non-fi-
nancial disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the 
circumstances."
"Furthermore, the executive directors are re-
sponsible for such internal controls as the executive 
directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a 
Separate Non-financial Group Report that is free from ma-
terial misstatement whether due to fraud or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts 
issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still 
subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for 
which clarifications have not yet been published in every 
case."
"Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed 
their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the 
Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section ‘‘Strategy 
and management - EU-Taxonomy’’ of the Separate Non-fi-
nancial Group Report."
"They are responsible for the defensi-
bility of this interpretation."

indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, 
the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to un-
certainties."
"AUDIT FIRM’S INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY 
MANAGEMENT 
We have complied with the German professional provisions 
regarding independence as well as other ethical require-
ments."
The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner`s report.
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accord-
ance with International Standard on Assurance Engage-
ments (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements 
other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Infor-
mation, issued by the IAASB."
"The procedures performed for the limited assurance en-
gagement part are less extensive than those performed for 
the reasonable assurance engagement part, and accord-
ingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the 
professional judgement of the assurance practitioner."
"In the course of our assurance engagement, we have, 
amongst other things, performed the following assurance 
procedures and other activities: 
►
Gain an understanding of the structure of the Group’s
sustainability organisation and stakeholder engage-
ment."
"►
Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant em-
ployees involved in the preparation of the Separate
Non-financial Group Report about the preparation pro-
cess, about the internal control system relating to this
process and about disclosures in the Separate Non-fi-
nancial Group Report."
"►
Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in
the Separate Non-financial Group Report."
"►
Evaluation of the implementation of central manage-
ment requirements, processes, and specifications re-
garding data collection through targeted sample test-
ing at selected sites."
"►
Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the
Separate Non-financial Group Report."
"►
Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corre-
sponding data in the consolidated financial statements
and group management report."
"►
Evaluation of the presentation of the Separate Non-fi-
nancial Group Report."
"►
Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible
and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the cor-
responding disclosures in the Separate Non-financial
Group Report."
"►
Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks and water
stress."
"►
Evaluation of CO2 compensation certificates exclusively
with regard to their existence, but not with regard to
their impact."
"►
Evaluation of the internal control system in relation to
the Indicators."
"►
Examination of processes for recording, controlling,
analysing and aggregating selected data from various
locations on a sample basis."
"In determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 
of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are 
required to interpret undefined legal terms."
"Due to the im-
manent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted 
differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, 
accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are sub-
ject to uncertainties."
"ASSURANCE OPINION

"OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION,  
PROFILE OF SKILLS AND EXPERTISE,  
AND DIVERSITY CONCEPT 
The Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA has set 
specific targets for its composition."
"It has further devel-
oped these existing targets and adopted them together 
with a revised skills and expertise profile for the entire 
Board in December 2022."
"The status of implementation is 
disclosed in the form of a qualification matrix."
"The Supervi-
sory Board has also adopted a diversity concept for itself 
and for the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE."
"OBJECTIVES FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THE 
SUPERVISORY BOARD AND PROFILE OF SKILLS  
AND EXPERTISE FOR THE ENTIRE BOARD 
The Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA is to be 
composed in such a way that its members in entirety have 
the required knowledge, skills, and professional experi-
ences for duly observing the tasks."
"Thereby, it is necessary 
to differentiate between the requirements for the individual 
Supervisory Board members and the requirements for the 
composition of the entire Board."
"Requirements for the individual  
Supervisory Board members 
The Supervisory Board members have to be professionally 
as well as personally qualified to advise and supervise the 
Management Board of a globally active health care Group."
"This in-
cludes knowledge of the main features of accounting, risk 
management, internal control mechanisms, and of compli-
ance matters."
"Sector experience and internationality 
Each Supervisory Board member is to have general 
knowledge of the health care sector, as well as a basic un-
derstanding of the global activities of Fresenius."
"Independence 
A minimum of half of the Supervisory Board members and 
a minimum of the half of the shareholder representatives in 
the Supervisory Board are to be independent within the 
meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"Inde-
pendent in this meaning is someone who does not have a 
personal or business relationship with the Company, its 
governing bodies, a controlling shareholder, or a company 
affiliated with such that may cause a substantial and not 
merely temporary conflict of interest."
"The shareholder 
structure may be appropriately taken into account."
"When assessing independence, in the view of the Su-
pervisory Board, neither an appointment to the Manage-
ment Board lapsed for more than two years nor the dura-
tion of the membership to the Supervisory Board exclude 
the classification as independent per se."
"With regard to the employee representatives, the inde-
pendence is not contested by the fact of representing em-
ployees nor by the employment relationship."
"Individuals exercising an office in a body of a signifi-
cant competitor of Fresenius or who hold, directly or indi-
rectly, more than 3% of the voting capital in such are not to 
be a member of the Supervisory Board."
"In cases where a Supervisory Board member is active for 
another company having business relationships with 
Fresenius, this activity is described in the section ‘‘Legal 
relationships with members of the corporate bodies’’ of the 
Annual Report."
"Time availability and limit to the numbers of offices held  
Each Supervisory Board member is to have sufficient time 
available for duly observing the office as Supervisory Board 
member and to comply with the limit to the offices held as 
recommended by the German Corporate Governance Code."
"Under the assumption of five meetings being held annually 
in the future, the expected time expenditure of new mem-
bers amounts to approximately 15 to 30 days a year."
"This 
includes the preparation and follow-up of the Supervisory 
Board’s meetings, the review of reports to the Supervisory 
Board, the participation in the Annual General Meeting, 
and regular training."
"Thereby, it is to be considered that 
the time expenditure also depends on the membership of 
one or several Supervisory Board committees."
"Age limit and duration limit on the term of membership  
A balance between experience and new ways of thinking is 
important for the activities of the Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"For this reason, the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA should have a balanced 
mix of experienced and new members."
"This not only allows 
different perspectives to be incorporated into the decision-
making process, but also promotes a continuous transfer of 
knowledge."
"As a rule, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius 
SE & Co."
"KGaA should only include members who have not 
yet reached the age of 75 at the time of their election or ap-
pointment."
"In addition, a regular limit for the length of 
membership of the Supervisory Board set out in the rules 
of procedure must be observed."
"Requirements for the entire Board 
Sector experience 
The Supervisory Board in its entirety needs to be familiar 
with the health care sector."
"Financial knowledge 
The Supervisory Board in its entirety needs to have finan-
cial knowledge, in particular in the fields of accounting, re-
porting, and auditing."
"At least one member must have ex-
pertise in the area of accounting and at least one other 
member must have expertise in the area of auditing."
"The 
Chair of the Audit Committee should be an expert in at 
least one of the two fields."
"Experience in the field of digitalization 
The Supervisory Board in its entirety is to have the re-
quired understanding of the requirements of digitalization."
"Internationality 
Fresenius has subsidiaries in more than 60 countries."
"Therefore, the Supervisory Board in its entirety is to have 
knowledge and experience in the regions important for 
Fresenius."
"The Supervisory Board is to include an appro-
priate number of members with, due to their origin or busi-
ness experience, a particular relation to the international 
markets relevant for Fresenius."
"Management experience 
The Supervisory Board is to include an appropriate number 
of members with experience in managing or supervising a 
medium-sized or large company."
"Diversity and appropriate representation of women 
The Supervisory Board is to rely on as different as possible 
expert knowledge, skills, and experiences."
"Therefore, di-
versity is to be appropriately considered for its composi-
tion, and when making election proposals, in the Com-
pany’s interest, attention should be paid to ensuring that 
the candidates’ profiles reasonably complement each 
other."
"At least 30% of the Supervisory Board are women and 
at least 30% are men."
"In general, the participation of 
women is a joint responsibility of the shareholder and em-
ployee sides."
"For nominations, both the shareholder and 
employee sides will consider, to the extent possible -- until 
equal representation is achieved -- whether the proportion 
of women can be increased with qualified female candi-
dates."
"Please note that the responsibility for electing em-
ployee representatives is with the European Works Council."
"Therefore, the Supervisory Board cannot provide a recom-
mendation here."
"DIVERSITY CONCEPT 
A diversity concept applies for the Management Board of 
Fresenius Management SE and the Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
The concept is outlined below.
"The objectives of the diversity concept, the way in which 
they are implemented, and the results achieved in the fiscal 
year are also explained."
"Diversity enables us to look at matters from different per-
spectives and against the background of different experi-
ences."
"Fresenius seeks diversity in the Management Board 
of Fresenius Management SE as well as in the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA in terms of age, gender, 
education, professional background, and international ex-
perience."
"Age 
Finding a balance between expertise and novel approaches 
is important for the Management Board of Fresenius Man-
agement SE and the Supervisory Board of Fresenius 
SE & Co."
"For this reason, both the Management 
Board of Fresenius Management SE and the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA should have a balanced 
mix of experienced and new members."
"This not only allows 
different perspectives to be incorporated into the decision-
making process, but also promotes a continuous transfer of 
knowledge."
"Gender 
Fresenius believes that a mix of women and men on both 
the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE and 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"At least 30% of the Supervisory Board are women and 
at least 30% are men."
"For nominations, both the share-
holder and employee sides will consider, to the extent pos-
sible -- until equal representation is achieved -- whether the 
proportion of women can be increased with qualified fe-
male candidates."
"Please note that the responsibility for 
electing employee representatives is with the European 
Works Council."
"Therefore, the Supervisory Board cannot 
provide a recommendation here."
"Besides, qualification is 
the decisive criterion for filling board positions."
"This takes into account 
the special requirements of a capital-market-oriented com-
pany."
The Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co.
"KGaA shall 
have a reasonable number of members experienced in the 
management or supervision of a medium-sized or large 
company."
"A reasonable number of Supervisory Board 
members should have leadership experience in the health 
care industry."
"At least one member must have expertise in 
the area of accounting and at least one other member must 
have expertise in the area of auditing."
"International experience 
Fresenius has subsidiaries in more than 60 countries."
"Against this background, the majority of the members of 
the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE are 
expected to have international experience in at least one of 
the markets relevant to Fresenius, based on their back-
ground, professional training or career."
"An appropriate number of members of the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA should also have a spe-
cial connection to international markets relevant to 
Fresenius as a result of their origin or business experience."
"Implementation of objectives 
In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, it meets the objec-
tives for its composition and fulfills both the skills and ex-
pertise profile and the diversity concept."
"The members of 
the Supervisory Board also fulfill the personal and profes-
sional requirements deemed necessary."
"In particular, the Supervisory Board members as a 
whole are familiar with the sector in which the Company 
operates."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board has the 
knowledge, skills and experience essential to the Company, 
including in production and profitability, digitalization and 
transformation, innovation and strategy development as 
well as human resources and leadership."
"The Supervisory 
Board also has knowledge and experience in the Compa-
ny's key business areas, including, in particular, medical 
products and services for critically and chronically ill pa-
tients, and the operation of hospitals."
"The diverse composition of the Supervisory Board en-
sures appropriate consideration of diversity in line with the 
diversity concept."
"Numerous Supervisory Board members 
have international experience."
"Stefanie Balling's term of office due to the change of struc-
ture of Fresenius Medical Care taking effect and her suc-
cession by Mr. Holger Michel on November 30, 2023, the 
Supervisory Board had four female members and eight 
male members in the 2023 fiscal year."
"This corresponds to 
a gender ratio of 33% to 67% of Supervisory Board mem-
bers."
"Both the shareholder representatives and the em-
ployee representatives are made up of two women and four 
men."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, all Supervisory 
Board members are to be considered independent."
"The 
agreed age limit will be taken into account at the time of 
the Supervisory Board's nominations to the Annual General 
Meeting."
"Three members of the Audit Committee, Ms."
"Susanne 
Zeidler as Chairwoman of the Audit Committee, Mr. Wolf-
gang Kirsch and Dr. Christoph Zindel, have expertise in the 
field of accounting."
"This expertise includes special 
knowledge and experience in the application of accounting 
principles and internal control and risk management sys-
tems."
Accounting also includes sustainability reporting.
"Susanne Zeidler has the necessary expertise in the 
areas of accounting and auditing due to her many years of 
experience as an auditor."
"She was able to deepen this ex-
pertise during her many years as a member of the manage-
ment board and chief financial officer of a listed company."
"Mr. Wolfgang Kirsch gained his expertise in the areas 
of accounting and auditing through his many years of work 
in the banking sector and his membership of the board of a 
financial institution, of which he was chairman."
"Dr. Christoph Zindel has the necessary expertise in the 
areas of accounting and auditing due to his many years of 
management activities, including his membership of the 
management board of a listed company."
"As a member of 
the management board of a listed company with responsi-
bility for sustainability, he also has expertise in sustainabil-
ity reporting and the auditing thereof."

"The basic rules of corporate conduct, partly extending 
beyond the requirements of law, are defined in the 
Fresenius Code of Conduct."
"It defines the framework of our 
rules and specifies the key principles for our conduct within 
the Company and in our relations with external partners and 
the public."
"We have published the Fresenius Code of Con-
duct on our website at www.fresenius.com/compliance."
"In 
addition, all Fresenius business segments have implemented 
their own Codes of Conduct."
"They cover the specifics of their 
businesses and reflect the values of the Fresenius Code of 
Conduct."
"COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS 
For Fresenius, compliance means doing the right thing."
"Because our core ethical values go beyond regulatory re-
quirements, it means acting not only in accordance with 
the law, but also with applicable industry codes, internal 
policies, and our values."
"Compliance is part of our corpo-
rate culture and, consequently, our daily work."
"Each of our business segments has appointed a Chief 
Compliance Officer, or a dedicated Compliance function, 
responsible for overseeing the development, implementa-
tion, and monitoring of the Compliance Management Sys-
tem (CMS) of the business segment."
"Furthermore, in line 
with the business structure and organization, the business 
segments have established compliance responsibilities at 
the respective organizational levels."
"The respective 
compliance organization supports management and em-
ployees in all compliance-related principles."
"Our Compliance Management Systems are designed 
to achieve the implementation of and adherence to our 
rules within the Company."
"We have implemented risk-
based Compliance Management Systems in all our busi-
ness segments and at Fresenius SE & Co."
"They comprise three pillars: Prevent, Detect, and Re-
spond."
"Emphasis is placed on actively preventing any acts 
of noncompliance before they occur."
"Such systems con-
sider the markets Fresenius is operating in."
"They are tai-
lored to the specific requirements of each business seg-
ment."
"Essential measures for prevention include comprehen-
sive risk recording and risk assessment, effective policies 
as well as adequate and effective procedures, regular train-
ing, and continuous advice."
"Through objective indicators, 
we try to detect potential compliance risks early on."
"To this 
end, we have implemented tools for early risk detection 
and internal control structures, e.g., for cash and bank 
transactions, and monitor these measures regularly in 
workshops and internal audits."
We take even potential misconduct seriously.
"This is 
why Fresenius employees who are aware of potential mis-
conduct can contact their superior or the responsible com-
pliance function or report a potential compliance case 
anonymously through whistleblowing systems or dedicated 
e-mail addresses."
"Most whistleblowing systems are open 
not only to employees, but also to third parties, such as 
customers, suppliers, and other partners, via the corporate 
website in many languages."
"Any illegal actions or violations of the rules may harm 
the individual and Fresenius."
"We do not tolerate non-com-
pliance."
"If a violation of applicable regulations is detected, 
we will take the necessary actions to remediate the viola-
tion and prevent any recurrence."
"We also take all reports as 
an opportunity to review our company processes for possi-
ble improvements."
"Further information on compliance and 
the Compliance Management Systems can be found on 
pages 169 ff."
of our Group Non-financial Report.
"RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEM 
In our view, responsible risk management is a crucial ele-
ment of good corporate governance."
"Fresenius has a sys-
tematic risk management and control system that allows 
the Management Board to identify risks and market trends 
at an early stage and to react promptly to relevant changes 
in our risk profile."
The well-being of our patients is important to us.
"Our risk 
management and control system, as well as efficiently de-
signed processes, help to enhance the Company’s perfor-
mance."
"Our early risk detection system is reviewed as part 
of the annual audit of the financial statements."
"The auditor 
assesses whether the monitoring system set up by the 
Management Board is suitable for the early identification of 
risks that could jeopardize the Company’s existence."
"The 
risk management and control systems are regularly re-
viewed by the Management Board and the Internal Audit 
department."
"The adequacy and effectiveness of our risk 
management and control system is the responsibility of the 
Management Board and is regularly audited by Internal 
Audit."
"Further infor-
mation is available on page 16 f."
"of the Report of the Su-
pervisory Board within the Annual Report 2023."
"In line with the German Corporate Governance Code, our 
risk management and control system also covers the sus-
tainability-related objectives anchored in our corporate 
strategy to the extent that this is not already required by 
law."
"This includes the processes and systems for recording 
and processing sustainability-related data."
"The Internal Audit department supports the Management 
Board as an independent function outside the Company’s 
day-to-day operations."
"The department assesses internal 
processes from an objective viewpoint and with the neces-
sary distance."
"Their goal is to create added value for 
Fresenius, and thus to help achieve organizational goals 
through improved internal controls, optimized business 
processes, and efficiency increases."
"Results from internal 
audits are analyzed both by the business segments and by 
the compliance organization to continuously improve pre-
ventive measures, for example to prevent corruption."
"GERMAN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND

The compensation report summarizes the main elements of 
the compensation system for the members of the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE as the general 
partner of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, and has been prepared 
jointly by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board 
of the Company."
"The contents of the compensation report 
comply with the regulatory requirements of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) (Section 162 AktG) as well as 
with the recommendations and suggestions of the German 
Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in the version dated 
April 28, 2022."
"In addition to disclosing the amount and 
structure of the compensation, the compensation report 
sets out how the compensation components comply with 
the relevant compensation system and how the compensa-
tion promotes the long-term development of the Company."
"To ensure comprehensive transparency, the compensation 
report also contains additional disclosures and explanations 
that go considerably beyond the statutory requirements."
"Fur-
thermore, the compensation report describes the main ele-
ments of Supervisory Board compensation and discloses 
their amount."
"KGaA has published the compensa-
tion report on its website (www.fresenius.com/corporate-
governance)."
"The compensation system of the Manage-
ment Board and the compensation system of the Supervi-
sory Board are also available on the Company’s website

"Clear, comprehensible, and transparent reporting is  
of great importance to both the Management Board and 
the Supervisory Board of the Company."
"For this reason, 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA voluntarily commissioned Price-
waterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-
schaft with a substantive audit of the disclosures in the 
compensation report, above and beyond the legally re-
quired formal review in accordance with Section 162 (3) 
AktG for the presence of the disclosures."
"The note regard-
ing the audit is attached to the compensation report."
"REVIEW OF FISCAL YEAR 2023 FROM A 
COMPENSATION PERSPECTIVE AND CHANGES 
WITHIN THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
The compensation report 2022 was submitted to the An-
nual General Meeting of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA for con-
sent on May 17, 2023, in accordance with Section 120a (4) 
AktG, and approved with 89.19% of the votes cast."
"The 
again very good voting result encourages the belief of the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board that com-
prehensible and transparent reporting is in place."
"During 
fiscal year 2023, the Company implemented additional im-
provements to meet the expectations of investors and the 
public as well as established market practice even more 
closely."
"Moreover, the revised Compensation System 2023+ for 
the members of the Management Board was submitted to 
the Annual General Meeting of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA 
for approval in accordance with Section 120a (1) AktG and 
approved with 93.01% of the votes cast."
"The compensation of the Management Board is directly 
linked to its performance (pay for performance) and is con-
siderably aligned with the Company’s success through the 
high proportion of variable compensation."
"Furthermore, 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE has 
for the first time, as part of the Compensation System 
2023+, integrated sustainability targets, also known as 
ESG --
- Environmental, Social, Governance --
- into the long-
term variable compensation of the Management Board."
"To compensate for the inflation trend, the target com-
pensation of the members of the Management Board was 
increased slightly in fiscal year 2023, however, the maxi-
mum compensation threshold remained unchanged."
"Details on these statutory 
restrictions and the effects on the compensation of the mem-
bers of the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE 
are presented in chapters 3.4.2.1, Short-term incentive, and 
3.4.2.2, Long-term incentive."
"In fiscal year 2023, several changes within the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE took place."
"In addition, Dr. Francesco De Meo left the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE on Septem-
ber 8, 2023."
"Mr. Robert Möller joined the Management 
Board of Fresenius Management SE on this date and has 
since assumed responsibility for the business segment 
Fresenius Helios."
"Moreover, Dr. Sebastian Biedenkopf left the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE at the end of 
November 30, 2023."
"Dr. Michael Moser, who was appointed 
to the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE for 
three years with effect from July 1, 2023, is responsible for 
Legal, Compliance, Risk Management, ESG, and Fresenius 
Vamed."
"With the withdrawal of Dr. Sebastian Biedenkopf, 
he also assumed responsibility for Human Resources  
(Labor Director)."
"In view of the deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical 
Care, Ms."
"Helen Giza, CEO of today’s Fresenius Medical 
Care AG, also left the Management Board of Fresenius 
Management SE as of November 30, 2023."
"Helen Giza 
received her compensation for this period exclusively from 
Fresenius Medical Care Management AG."
"Bonuses and 
other variable or comparable compensation components 
that Ms."
"Helen Giza received from Fresenius Medical  
Care Management AG or (after the change of legal form 
of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA became effective) 
Fresenius Medical Care AG are not subject to the statutory 
restrictions under the ‘‘Energy Price Brake Acts’’."
"COMPENSATION OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD 
3.1 COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE 
The Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE is re-
sponsible for determining the compensation of each Man-
agement Board member as well as for determining, review-
ing, and implementing the compensation system."
"The Super-
visory Board of Fresenius Management SE is assisted in 
this task by its Human Resources Committee, which is also 
responsible for the tasks of a Compensation Committee."
"In 
the past fiscal year, the Human Resources Committee of 
Fresenius Management SE was composed of Mr. Wolfgang 
Kirsch, Dr. Dieter Schenk, and Mr. Michael Diekmann."
"The 
Human Resources Committee makes recommendations to 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE, which 
are discussed and --
- where necessary --
- decided on by the 
Supervisory Board."
"With regard to the requirements of the German Stock 
Corporation Act and the GCGC, the Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius Management SE regularly reviews the appropri-
ateness and customary practice of the compensation of the 
members of the Management Board."
"KGaA, and that it 
does not exceed the usual compensation without special 
reasons."
"For this purpose, both external and internal com-
parative analyses are carried out."
"In addition, the total 
compensation contractually agreed with the individual 
members of the Management Board takes into account the 
interest of the Company in retaining the members of the 
Management Board at the Company or attracting new  
potential talents for the Management Board."
"The 
respective amount of the total target compensation and the 
underlying compensation components contractually agreed 
with the individual Management Board members are com-
pared with the compensation data of other DAX companies."
"When determining the compensation system and the 
compensation of the Management Board members, the 
Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE additionally 
conducts a vertical review (internal comparative analysis) 
with respect to the compensation levels of the Company’s 
employees."
"For this purpose, the ratios between the aver-
age compensation of the Management Board, the average 
compensation of the senior management of the Company, 
and that of the total workforce are determined."
"Senior man-
agement is defined as all employees who report to a Man-
agement Board member in a position of Vice President and 
above."
"When conducting the vertical review, the Supervi-
sory Board of Fresenius Management SE also considers 
the development of the compensation levels over time."
"Most recently in fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board 
of Fresenius Management SE examined the customary prac-
tice and appropriateness of the compensation of the mem-
bers of the Management Board."
"The support of an inde-
pendent consultant was called in to review the customary 
practice."
"In the past fiscal year, 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE did 
not make use of this right."
"3.2 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE  
COMPENSATION SYSTEM 2023+ 
The Supervisory Board of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA submit-
ted a revised Compensation System 2023+ to the 2023 An-
nual General Meeting for consent."
"The new Compensation 
System 2023+ was approved with 93.01% of the votes cast."
"It is even more strongly aligned with the interests of share-
holders and the long-term and sustainable development of 
Fresenius."
"The Compensation System 2023+ was generally 
applied to all members of the Management Board in fiscal 
year 2023."
"With the exception of the service agreements of 
the departing Management Board members Dr. Sebastian 
Biedenkopf, Dr. Francesco De Meo, and Dr. Ernst Wastler, 
all service agreements were adapted to the new compensa-
tion system."
"The compensation system of Fresenius Medical 
Care AG applies to Ms."
"Helen Giza, who was a member of 
the Management Board of Fresenius Management SE up to 
November 30, 2023."
"The LTIP 2023 also  
applies to members of the management of affiliated compa-
nies and selected executives of the Company and affiliated 
companies."
"The performance targets for long-term variable compen-
sation include total shareholder return (TSR) compared to 
competitors (relative TSR), return on invested capital (ROIC), 
and Fresenius’ sustainability targets."
"The relative TSR fulfills investor-specific expectations 
regarding the inclusion of a performance measurement 
compared to relevant competitors, is in line with both  
national and international market practice, and is an im-
portant indicator of Fresenius’ long-term capital market 
performance."
"ROIC is a strategically relevant internal performance 
target and describes the return on invested capital."
"It ex-
presses the long-term financing capability and value gener-
ation of Fresenius."
"To ensure genuine value generation, it 
is necessary that at least the cost of capital (weighted aver-
age cost of capital (WACC)) is generated."
"Sustainability is an essential and integral part of the 
corporate strategy."
"The consideration of key environmental, 
social, and governance targets (ESG targets) is in line with 
investor-specific and social requirements, the majority 
market practice among DAX companies, and promotes the 
long-term and sustainable development of Fresenius."
"As 
part of the long-term variable compensation, a significant 
reduction in CO2 emissions has been set as an ESG target 
for the grant 2023 --
- in line with the externally communi-
cated target of becoming climate-neutral by 2040."
"In addition, the other components of the compensation 
system were reviewed and adjusted slightly."
"ESG targets 
will continue to be used for the short-term variable com-
pensation."
"The initial focus will be on the areas of customer 
and employee satisfaction."
"Moreover, as already provided 
for in the Compensation System 2021+, the target achieve-
ment cap for the three performance criteria in the short-term 
variable compensation is set at 150% from fiscal year 2023."
"This means that the payout for short-term variable compen-
sation will be capped at 150% of the target amount."
"Furthermore, the share ownership guidelines were  
adjusted to a standard market level, meaning that the Chair-
man of the Management Board must now invest 200% and 
the other members of the Management Board must con-
tinue to invest 100% of their annual gross base salary in 
shares."
"Finally, the Compensation System 2023+ provides for 
members of the Management Board appointed for the first 
time after the 2023 Annual General Meeting a pension 
substitute in cash for self-provision instead of the pension 
commitment previously provided for in the Compensation 
System 2021+."
"It provides effective 
incentives for the achievement of the strategic goals as well as for the long-term value creation of the Company, taking into 
account the interests of patients, shareholders, employees, and other stakeholders."
"The Compensation System 2023+ is 
based on the following principles: 
 
Link to strategy 
 
The Compensation System 2023+ for the Management Board members promotes the execution of Fresenius’s 
global strategy."
"In particular, the long-term and sustainable development of Fresenius is taken into account."
"Alignment with 
shareholders’ interests 
 
With the aim of achieving cost-effective and profitable growth and taking into account total shareholder return, 
the Compensation System 2023+ is aligned with shareholders’ interests."
"Feedback from many investors has been considered in the design of the system and the link to the development 
of Company value has been enforced."
"Simple structure 
 
The Compensation System 2023+ is comprehensible and not complex."
"Long-term orientation 
 
The compensation components and the long-term-oriented compensation structure promote long-term and  
sustainable value creation."
"Rewarding financial  
performance and  
sustainability 
 
The performance targets reflect the Company’s strategy and enforce the Company’s commitment to  
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects."
"Cooperation across 
business segments 
 
Performance targets at Group as well as on business segment level are defined for the Management Board  
members."
"By measuring performance at the Group level, close cooperation across the Company’s business  
segments is promoted."
"Good corporate 
governance 
 
The Compensation System 2023+ is designed to comply with the recommendations set out in the German  
Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April 28, 2022."
"Current market 
best practice 
 
The Compensation System 2023+ is based on current market best practice."
"Alignment with 
performance 
 
The Compensation System 2023+ is significantly aligned to the Company’s success due to its high proportion  
of variable compensation."
"Accordingly, the grant value of 
the Long-Term Incentive always exceeds the target amount 
of the Short-Term Incentive for each fiscal year."
"Under the Long-Term Incentive, performance is meas-
ured over a period of four years."
"The compensation under 
the Long-Term Incentive is available to Management Board 
members after a period of at least four years."
"30%
Short-term variable compensation (STI) approx."
"30%
Long-term variable compensation (LTI) approx."
"The approximately 40% share of the 
Long-Term Incentive (approximately 57% of the variable 
components) reflects the long-term orientation of the com-
pensation structure."
"Maximum compensation 
Like the Compensation System 2021+, the Compensation 
System 2023+ provides for an overall annual maximum 
compensation amount (Maximum Compensation) for each 
Management Board member."
"These Maximum Compensa-
tion amounts limit the payouts to a Management Board 
member from the compensation contractually agreed for  
a fiscal year, irrespective of the dates of the payouts."
"The pension substitute and the pension commit-
ment that is part of the fixed compensation components are  
also included in the calculation of the Maximum Compen-
sation with the amount of the service cost incurred in the 
fiscal year."
"The Maximum Compensation amount for Man-
agement Board members can be below the sum of the po-
tentially achievable payouts from the individual compensa-
tion components contractually agreed for a fiscal year."
"If 
the calculated payout for a Management Board member  
is higher than the respective Maximum Compensation, 
the amounts accruing under the Long-Term Incentive are 
reduced accordingly until the Maximum Compensation is 
no longer exceeded."
"The Maximum Compensation in the Compensation Sys-
tem 2023+ remains unchanged at €10 million for the Chair-
man of the Management Board and €6.5 million for all 
other Management Board members."
"Compliance with the 
Maximum Compensation is reviewed annually."
"Compliance 
with the Maximum Compensation can only be finally deter-
mined once all contractually agreed compensation com- 
ponents of the Compensation System 2021+ for a fiscal 
year have been paid out."
"Fringe benefits can be of one-time or recurring 
nature."
"In fiscal year 2023, the 
Supervisory Board made use of this right to compensate 
Dr. Michael Moser for forfeited compensation from his pre-
vious employment agreement."
"The Supervisory Board of 
Fresenius Management SE may also award reimburse-
ments for fees, charges, and other costs in connection with 
or related to a change in the regular place of work of Man-
agement Board members."
"To cover 
such obligations, the Company took out Directors’ & Officers’ 
liability insurance, the deductible complying with the  
requirements of the Stock Corporation Act."
"The indemnifi-
cation covers the period during which the respective mem-
ber of the Management Board holds office as well as any 
claims in this regard after termination of the service on 
the Management Board."
"Pension substitute / Pension commitments 
Management Board members appointed to the Manage-
ment Board for the first time after the 2023 Annual General 
Meeting will receive a pension substitute in cash amount-
ing to 40% of their respective base salary."
"Management Board members who were first appointed 
to the Management Board between January 1, 2020 and the 
2023 Annual General Meeting were promised a pension 
commitment within the framework of a defined contribu-
tion plan."
"Management Board members who were first appointed 
to the Management Board before January 1, 2020 were 
promised a contractual pension commitment in the form of 
a defined benefit scheme that provides for pension benefits 
and surviving dependents’ benefits."
"The pension commitments are described in detail in 
chapter 3.7.2."
"The Short-Term 
Incentive for the Management Board members reflects the 
success of the Company in the relevant fiscal year."
"The  
Short-Term Incentive is linked to the achievement of fi-
nancial and non-financial performance targets, balancing 
growth, profitability, and sustainability aspects."
"The respective target amount for the Short-Term Incen-
tive (i.e., the amount paid out if the target is reached to 
100%) is as a percentage of the respective base salary of a 
Management Board member individually agreed upon."
"In 
case of appointments to the Management Board during a 
fiscal year, the respective target amount will be prorated."
"2 The degree of fulfillment within each of the four business segments is weighted at 25% each;  
overall target achievement is identical for all Management Board members."
"To enable a better comparison of operating performance over several 
periods, the net income figures are adjusted for special items where necessary."
"Revenue 
 
20% 
 
As part of the growth strategy, the development of revenue at Group and business 
segment level, especially organic revenue growth, is of central importance."
"ESG targets 
 
15% 
 
The ESG targets reflect the Company’s commitment and strategy with regard to  
environmental, social, and governance aspects."
"The ESG targets are designed to 
achieve significantly improved ESG performance with reported and audited metrics 
that reflect Fresenius’ strategy."
"The financial performance targets reflect the key per-
formance indicators of the Company and support the Com-
pany’s strategy of achieving sustainable and profitable 
growth."
"The non-financial performance targets underline 
the Company’s commitment to implementing its global 
sustainability strategy."
"Sustainable actions are an integral 
part of the corporate strategy and ensure the future viabil-
ity from a social and economic perspective."
"Adjustment of the performance targets 
The financial figures underlying the financial performance 
targets can be adjusted for certain effects, in particular ef-
fects from significant acquisitions, divestments, restructur-
ing measures, and changes in accounting principles."
"In ad-
dition, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE 
can also adjust for one-time material special items for which 
the Management Board is not responsible, which have not 
been budgeted for, and which are therefore not included in 
the calculation of the target values."
"In this way, the Super-
visory Board ensures both comparability and that the calcu-
lation of variable compensation is based on actual Manage-
ment Board performance rather than on external effects."
"For Management Board 
members with Group responsibilities (Mr. Michael Sen, 
Dr. Sebastian Biedenkopf, and Dr. Michael Moser, respec-
tively, and Ms."
"Sara Hennicken), net income and revenue 
refer to the corresponding key financial figures of the Group."
"By measuring the financial performance targets at Group as 
well as on a business segment level, the financial success 
of both the individual business segments and the Group is 
reflected."
"The achievement of sustainability targets is measured 
at Group level to ensure close cooperation across the Com-
pany’s business segments in the field of sustainability."
"The 
non-financial performance targets relate to ESG focus topics 
such as quality, employees, innovation, compliance, and 
environment."
"Each year, one or more ESG targets are de-
fined, which in turn are applied to one or more of the focus 
topics."
"The overall ESG target achievement is identical for 
all Management Board members."
"Consequently, the short-term variable  
compensation for fiscal year 2023 will not be paid out  
to the members of the Management Board (see chapter 
3.4.2.2 for the effects on long-term variable compensation)."
"Nevertheless, for purely informational purposes, the 
performance targets set by the Supervisory Board for the 
short-term variable compensation for fiscal year 2023 and 
whether and to what extent these were achieved are pre-
sented below."
"Financial performance targets 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board 
of Fresenius Management SE set concrete target values for 
the financial performance targets, taking into account the 
market and competitive environment, the budget, and the 
strategic growth targets."
"After the end of the past fiscal year, the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius Management SE determined whether 
and to what extent the financial performance targets had 
been achieved."
"If the cap is exceeded, the target 
is deemed to have been reached by 150% (cap)."
"If the 
achieved financial indicators are between the respective 
values for target achievement of 0% and 100% or 100% 
and 150%, the target achievement is determined by linear 
interpolation."
"For the financial performance targets, the 
Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE set the 
following lower and upper thresholds as well as target val-
ues at Group and business segment level for fiscal year 
2023."
"Fresenius Medical Care 
Non-financial performance targets 
For fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius 
Management SE set two equally weighted ESG targets out 
of the five ESG focus topics quality, employees, innovation, 
compliance, and environment."
"In fiscal year 2023, the focus 
was placed on the areas of employees and quality."
"The ESG 
targets are relevant, derived from strategy, and integrated 
into corporate management."
"For the area of employees, the ESG target of employee sur-
vey was selected."
"The Employee Engagement Index on

"The ESG target 
patient satisfaction / medical quality, which is made up of

"As described above, 
the short-term variable compensation for fiscal year 2023 
will not be paid out to the members of the Management

"The long-term variable compensation of the

Details are described at the end of this chapter.
"Allocation for fiscal year 2023  
Overview 
Under the Compensation System 2023+, the Management 
Board members are entitled to receive long-term variable 
compensation in the form of stock awards with a measure-
ment period of four years (LTIP 2023)."
"Stock awards are 
virtual cash-settled payment instruments not backed by 
equity."
"A payout depends on the achievement of three per-
formance targets, on the development of the share price of 
the Company, and on the amount of dividends paid during 
the performance period."
"Grant values 
The grant value of the Long-Term Incentive for each Man-
agement Board member is defined by the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius Management SE."
"It corresponds to a 
percentage of the base salary, as stipulated in the individ-
ual service agreement."
"The final number of stock awards  
depends on the achievement of predefined targets, which 
are set by the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Manage-
ment SE prior to the beginning of the respective perfor-
mance period."
"These per-
formance targets have been chosen as they reflect the 
Company’s strategic priorities of increasing profitability, 
long-term sustainable growth, and the development of the 
Company’s value."
"At the same time, they include a relative 
comparison with competitors and thus ensure that the  
interests of shareholders are adequately taken into account."
"The performance targets under the Long-Term Incentive 
are among the most important key figures of the Company 
and support the implementation of the Company’s long-
term strategy."
"In order to ensure that all decision makers 
pursue uniform goals, the Long-Term Incentive for the 
Management Board and senior management is determined 
according to uniform targets and a uniform system."
"Target 
 
Weight 
 
Background and link to strategy 
Relative TSR 
 
50% 
 
Relative TSR as a performance target sets incentives to outperform the peer companies 
and, above all, takes into account the long-term development of Company value and the 
requirements of our shareholders."
"ROIC 
 
25% 
 
ROIC is a strategically relevant internal performance target and describes the return on 
invested capital."
"It expresses the long-term financing capability and value generation of 
Fresenius."
"ESG 
 
25% 
 
Sustainability is an essential and integral part of the corporate strategy."
"The considera-
tion of ESG also takes account of investor- and company-specific requirements."
"As part of the ESG targets, the reduction of 
CO2 emissions is initially set as an ESG target for the grant  
2023 -- in line with the externally communicated target of 
becoming climate-neutral by 2040."
"The ESG target or ESG targets 
must be relevant to the Company, strategy-derived, ambi-
tious, comprehensibly measurable, and integrated into 
corporate strategy."
"Target achieve-
ment in intermediate value ranges is determined by linear 
interpolation, unless the Supervisory Board has determined 
otherwise."
"In setting the target values, the Supervisory Board 
of Fresenius Management SE considers the medium-term 
planning, strategic growth targets, and the market, as well 
as the competitive environment."
"For the Relative TSR performance target, 100% target 
achievement is given if the TSR of the Fresenius share cor-
responds exactly to the TSR of the STOXX® Europe 600 
Health Care index in the respective fiscal year of the perfor-
mance period."
"If the TSR of the Fresenius share falls below 
the TSR of the STOXX® Europe 600 Health Care index by 
50 percentage points or more in the respective fiscal year of 
the performance period, the target achievement is 0%."
"If the 
TSR of the Fresenius share exceeds the TSR of the STOXX® 
Europe 600 Health Care index by 50 percentage points or  
more in the respective fiscal year of the performance period, 
the target achievement is 250%."
"Exceeding the TSR by more 
than 50 percentage points does not lead to a further increase 
in target achievement."
"For the ROIC performance target, 100% target achieve-
ment is given if the actual ROIC corresponds to the planned 
ROIC for the respective fiscal year of the performance pe-
riod."
"If the actual ROIC falls below the planned ROIC for the 
respective fiscal year of the performance period by 2 per-
centage points, the target achievement is 50%."
"If ROIC 
falls below the target by more than 2 percentage points, the 
target achievement is 0%."
"If the actual ROIC exceeds the  
planned ROIC of the respective fiscal year of the perfor-
mance period by 2 percentage points or more, the target 
achievement is 250%."
"Exceeding the ROIC target by more 
than 2 percentage points does not lead to a further increase 
in target achievement."
The base year for the grant 2023 is 2020.
"In addition 
to the planned CO2 reduction, the Supervisory Board sets 
values that lead to a target achievement of 50% and 250%."
"If the actual CO2 reduction is less than the value of the CO2 
emissions of the base year set for the target achievement 
of 50%, the target achievement is 0%."
"An actual CO2 reduction of more than the value of  
the CO2 emissions of the base year defined for the target 
achievement of 250% does not lead to a further increase in 
target achievement."
"In such a case, the 
target achievement for the fiscal years of this performance 
period corresponds uniformly to 25% of the total target 
achievement calculated in this way."
"The target achievement curve for the CO2 reduction ESG 
target initially set for the grant 2023 is as follows: 
At the end of the respective performance period, the Super-
visory Board of Fresenius Management SE determines the 
overall target achievement for the granted Long-Term Incen-
tive."
"For this purpose, the extent to which the three per-
formance targets have been achieved is determined and 
included with their respective weighting in the determina-
tion of the overall target achievement."
"The final number of stock awards is determined for each 
Management Board member on the basis of the overall tar-
get achievement and can increase or decrease over the per-
formance period compared to the number at the time of the 
grant."
"A total loss or (at the most) 2.5 times the granted 
stock awards if 250% target achievement is reached (cap) 
are possible."
"After the final determination of the overall target achieve-
ment, the final number of stock awards is multiplied by 
the average price of the Company’s shares over the last 
30 stock exchange trading days prior to the end of the re-
spective performance period."
"This amount plus the sum of 
the dividends per share paid during the performance pe-
riod by Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA corresponds to the payout 
amount."
"The payout is limited to 250% of the respective 
grant value."
"Payment is also conditional on the absence of 
a compliance violation and the continuation of the service 
or employment relationship."
"In this case, the Supervisory Board of Fresenius 
Management SE can correct the calculated overall target 
achievement accordingly, i.e., increase or decrease it."
"This 
also applies in the event that capital measures (e.g., capital 
increase, spin-off, or stock split) are conducted."
"Grants under the LTIP 2018 
Until the end of fiscal year 2022, performance shares with 
a measurement period of four years were allocated as a 
component with a long-term incentive effect as part of the 
LTIP 2018 of Fresenius SE & Co."
"Performance shares 
are virtual cash-settled payment instruments not backed by 
equity."
"The performance target of adjusted net income growth 
is deemed to have been achieved to 100% if this is at least 
8% p.a."
on average over the four-year measurement period.
If the growth rate is 5% p.a.
"or less, the target achievement 
is 0%."
If the growth rate is between 5% p.a.
"and 8% p.a., 
the degree of target achievement is between 0% and 100%, 
and if the growth rate is between 8% p.a."
"and 20% p.a., 
the degree of target achievement is between 100% and 
200%."
"Intermediate values are calculated by linear inter-
polation."
"The adjusted net income growth is calculated at con-
stant exchange rates."
"For the relative TSR target, 100% target achievement is 
reached if the total shareholder return of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA compared to the total shareholder return of the other 
companies in the STOXX® Europe 600 Health Care Index 
is at the median of the peer companies over the four-year 
measurement period, i.e., exactly in the middle (50th per-
centile) of the ranking."
"If the rank is equal to or below the 
25th percentile, the degree of target achievement is 0%."
"If the rank is between the 25th and the 50th percentile, 
the degree of target achievement is between 0% and  
100%, and if the rank is between the 50th and the 75th 
percentile, the degree of target achievement is between 
100% and 200%."
"Intermediate values are also calculated 
by linear interpolation here."
"At the end of the respective measurement period, the 
Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE determines 
the overall target achievement for the granted Long-Term 
Incentive."
"For this purpose, the extent to which the two 
performance targets have been achieved is determined 
and included with equal weighting in the determination  
of the overall target achievement."
"The final number of performance shares is determined 
for each Management Board member on the basis of the 
overall target achievement and can increase or decrease 
over the measurement period compared to the number at 
the time of the grant."
"A total loss as well as (at the most) 
doubling of the granted performance shares if 200% tar-
get achievement is reached (cap) is possible."
"KGaA, in or-
der to calculate the corresponding amount for the payment 
from the final performance shares."
"The payout is limited 
to 250% of the respective grant value."
"Payment is also conditional on the absence of a compli-
ance violation and the continuation of the service or employ-
ment relationship."
"Overall target achievement of the LTIP 2018 
for fiscal years 2019 to 2022 (grant 2019) 
In fiscal year 2022, the measurement period of the grant 
2019 ended in accordance with the LTIP 2018."
"The average growth of adjusted Group net income for 
fiscal year 2022 and the previous three years was -9.9%."
"Therefore, a target achievement of 0% was derived."
"For 
the relative TSR, the percentile rank at the end of the four-
year measurement period was 14."
"Hence, the target achieve-
ment was 0% for the relative TSR, too."
"As a result, no pay-
ment was made from the grant 2019 in fiscal year 2023."
"Overall target achievement of the LTIP 2018 for fiscal 
years 2020 to 2023 (grant 2020) 
The measurement period of the grant 2020 ended in fiscal 
year 2023."
"The average growth of adjusted Group net income for 
fiscal year 2023 and the previous three years was -11.8%."
"Therefore, a target achievement of 0% was derived."
"For 
the relative TSR, the percentile rank at the end of the four-
year measurement period was 15."
"Hence, the target achieve-
ment was 0% for the relative TSR, too."

ment will be made from the grant 2020 in fiscal year 2024."

ponent with long-term incentive effect."
"The benefits con-
sisted on the one hand of share-based compensation with 
cash settlement (phantom stocks) and on the other hand of 
stock options on the basis of the Stock Option Plan 2013 of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"Based on the LTIP 2013, both 
members of the Management Board and other executives 
were allocated stock options and phantom stocks."
"In fiscal  
year 2023, existing stock options under the LTIP 2013 could 
still be exercised."
"Payouts from phantom stocks were made 
for the last time in fiscal year 2022."
"Stock options may still 
be exercised in the future."
"Exercise of the stock options allocated under LTIP 2013 
of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA is subject to several conditions, 
such as expiry of a four-year waiting period, observance of 
blackout periods, achievement of the specified performance 
target, and continuance of the service or employment rela-
tionship."
"The vested stock options can be exercised within 
a period of four years."
"The performance target 
has also been achieved if the average annual growth rate of 
the adjusted consolidated net income of the Company dur-
ing the four-year waiting period is at least 8%, adjusted for 
foreign currency effects."
"If a member of the Management 
Board leaves the Company, the stock options are forfeited

to the Compensation System 2021+) of the base salary in 
shares."
"For ordinary Management Board members, the 
amount of obligation is unchanged at 100% of the base sal-
ary."
"The Management Board members are obliged to hold 
these shares permanently until two years after resignation 
from the Management Board."
"For a Management Board 
member, the investment in shares of the Company shall be 
built up cumulatively from the second full year of service 
onwards at the latest, each year with one quarter of the 
gross amount of an annual base salary."
"The share owner-
ship guideline must be met in full at the latest after the fifth 
year as a Management Board member."
"The share owner-
ship guidelines continue to apply if the first appointment to 
the Management Board is for three years and the Manage-
ment Board member is not reappointed thereafter."
"Shares 
already voluntarily acquired by a member of the Manage-
ment Board before or since the beginning of the (first) con-
tractual term as a member of the Management Board of 
Fresenius Management SE or its legal predecessor will be 
taken into account for the fulfillment of the SOG target."

of two years after resignation from the Management Board."
"Sara Hennicken, Mr. Robert Möller, and Dr. Michael 
Moser, the acquisition phases for the share ownership 
guidelines do not begin until their second full year of ser-
vice on the Management Board."

3.7.1 BENEFITS FROM THIRD PARTIES 
In the past fiscal year, no benefits were awarded or assured 
to any member of the Management Board by a third party 
with regard to their activities as a member of the Manage-
ment Board."
"The Chief Executive Officer of Fresenius 
Medical Care AG received her compensation exclusively 
from Fresenius Medical Care Management AG or, after the 
change of legal form of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."

ber 30, 2023, from Fresenius Medical Care AG in accord-
ance with the compensation system applicable to the mem-
bers of the Management Board of Fresenius Medical Care 
Management AG or Fresenius Medical Care AG."
"Any compensation awarded to Management Board mem-
bers for Supervisory Board mandates in subsidiaries of the 
Fresenius Group is offset against the Management Board 
member’s compensation."
"3.7.2 COMMITMENTS IN THE EVENT  
OF TERMINATION 
Company pension scheme 
Defined benefit pension commitments 
Management Board members appointed to the Manage-
ment Board prior to January 1, 2020, were awarded a con-
tractual pension commitment in the form of a defined bene-
fit scheme."
"Under this defined benefit scheme, pension com-
mitments provide for pension and survivor benefits (‘‘Hinter-
bliebenenversorgung‘‘) as of the time of conclusively ending 
active work or in case of occupational disability or incapacity 
to work (‘‘Beruf- oder Erwerbsunfähigkeit‘‘)."
"The amount 
of these benefits is calculated by reference to the amount 
of the contractually agreed pensionable income of the Man-
agement Board member."
"Until the start of their pension, 
this is adjusted annually based on the development of the 
consumer price index (as of January 1, 2022, for the first 
time)."
"The pension amount is calculated as 30% of the 
contractually agreed pensionable income and increases 
by 1.5 percentage points for each full year of service as a 
Management Board member, up to a maximum of 45%."
"There is an individual contractual defined benefit pen-
sion commitment for the Management Board member 
Dr. Francesco De Meo, who left the Company in fiscal year 
2023, based on his service agreement with the general 
partner of Fresenius SE & Co."
"This is promised at the beginning of the service 
agreement, with a waiting period of the first three years 
regarding the granting of benefits."
"Under such a defined 
contribution plan, the respective Management Board mem-
ber receives an annual contribution amounting to 40% of 
the base salary, which determines the future capital amount."
"After reaching the retirement age under the defined contri-
bution plan, payments can be made either as a one-off pay-
ment or optionally in 10 annual installments."
"An annuity or 
pension payment is not provided."
"The defined contribution 
plan may provide for survivors’ benefits (‘‘Hinterbliebenen-
versorgung‘‘) and benefits after the occurrence of a full or 
partial reduction in earning capacity (‘‘Erwerbsminderung‘‘)."
"The implementation of the defined contribution plan is car-
ried out in the form of external financing as a defined con-
tribution plan with a reinsurance policy."
"This provides for 
covering the risks of death and occupational disability as 
early as from the start of service and not just starting from 
non-forfeiture (after the expiry of three years since the start 
of service)."
"Mr. Michael Sen, Mr. Pierluigi Antonelli, and Ms."
"Sara 
Hennicken have received a pension commitment in the 
form of a defined contribution pension commitment."
"Accordingly, Mr. Robert 
Möller and Dr. Michael Moser receive a pension substitute."
"Severance regulations 
The service agreements of the Management Board mem-
bers are limited to a maximum of five years in accordance 
with Section 84 (1) AktG and provide for a severance pay-
ment cap."
"Accordingly, payments to a Management Board 
member in the event of early termination of a Management  
Board appointment, including fringe benefits, are limited to 
two years of compensation, but not exceeding the compen-
sation for the remaining term of the service agreement."
"If 
the Company terminates the service agreement for cause 
on grounds attributable to the relevant Management Board 
member according to Section 626 of the German Civil Code 
(BGB), no severance payment will be due."
"For the calculation of the severance 
payment cap in accordance with the Compensation System 
2021+, which was applied to the Management Board mem-
bers who left the Company in fiscal year 2023, the total 
compensation within the meaning of Section 285 No."
"a HGB of the past fiscal year and the expected total 
compensation for the fiscal year in which the termination 
occurs are used."
"Any payments under a post-contractual non-
competition clause are to be offset against any severance 
payments and benefits under the Company pension scheme."
"For the Chief Executive Officer of Fresenius Medical Care 
AG, who was a member of the Management Board of 
Fresenius Management SE until November 30, 2023, the 
compensation amount is half of the annual base salary."
"Change of control 
The service agreements of the Management Board mem-
bers do not contain any provisions in the event of a change 
of control."
"In 
the event of death of a member of the Management Board, 
the surviving dependents will receive 3 monthly payments 
after the month in which the death occurred, at most, how-
ever, until the expiry of the respective service agreement."
"In fiscal year 2023, 
the Supervisory Board made use of this right to compen-
sate Dr. Michael Moser for forfeited compensation from

"It is 
involved in strategy and planning as well as in all matters of 
fundamental importance for the Company."
"In view of these 
responsible duties, the members of the Supervisory Board 
of the Company receive appropriate compensation that also 
takes sufficient account of the time demands of the position 
of the Supervisory Board member."
"In addition, Supervisory 
Board compensation that is also in line with the market envi-
ronment ensures that the Company will continue to attract 
qualified candidates to its Supervisory Board in the future."
"In 
this way, the fair compensation of the members of the Super-
visory Board contributes to promoting the business strategy 
and long-term development of Fresenius SE & Co."
"This aspiration is met through the compensation for the 
members of the Supervisory Board governed in Section 13 
of the articles of association of Fresenius SE & Co."
"Furthermore, the compensation is in line with the sugges-
tions of the GCGC in the version dated April 28, 2022."
"The compensation of the members of the Supervisory 
Board was proposed for resolution to the Annual General 
Meeting of the Company on May 21, 2021 with a corre-
sponding amendment in Section 13 of the articles of asso-
ciation and approved with an approval rate of 98.86%."
"The compensation system has been effective since Janu-
ary 1, 2021."
"A resolution on the compensation of the mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board is passed by the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting at least every four years on the basis of a pro-
posal by the general partner and the Supervisory Board."
"The relative share of fixed compensation 
is always 100%."
"As fixed compensation, each member of the Supervisory 
Board of the Company shall receive an amount of €180 thou-
sand annually for each full fiscal year, payable after the end

sory Board of the Company, a member shall receive addi-
tional compensation of €40 thousand for each full fiscal 
year, while the Chairperson of the Audit Committee shall 
receive twice this amount."
"If a fiscal year does not encompass a full calendar year, or 
if a member of the Supervisory Board of the Company is a 
member of the Supervisory Board for only a portion of the 
fiscal year, the compensation shall be paid on a pro rata 
temporis basis."

of the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of the 
Company."

shall be refunded expenses incurred when exercising their 
functions."

of its Supervisory Board with insurance cover to an appro-
priate extent for exercising Supervisory Board activities."

for the Management Board, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA has 
also taken out Directors’ & Officers’ liability insurance for 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE and 
the Supervisory Board of the Company."

covers the legal defense costs of a member of a representa-
tive body in the event of a claim and, if applicable, any dam-
ages to be paid within the scope of the existing coverage

Board of the Company is at the same time the Chairman of 
the Supervisory Board of Fresenius Management SE, they

vice as Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the 
Company."

tion of Fresenius SE & Co."

opment of the Company, Group revenue and Group net

income of Fresenius SE & Co."

ous fiscal years."

"Deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care 
Fresenius announced in February 2023 its intention to  
initiate plans towards a conversion of the legal form of 
Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA) 
into a German stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft --
- AG) 
and thereupon to deconsolidate the business segment 
Fresenius Medical Care in accordance with the relevant  
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)."
"On 
July 14, 2023, the Extraordinary General Meeting of FMC-
AG & Co."
"After registration 
with the commercial register on November 30, 2023, the 
conversion of the legal form became effective."
"Since Novem-
ber 30, 2023, Fresenius Medical Care Management AG 
(prospective Fresenius Vermögensverwaltung AG), a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, has no longer 
been the general partner of FMC-AG & Co."
"Conse-
quently, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA no longer has rights or 
the ability to direct the relevant activities that significantly 
affect the earnings of Fresenius Medical Care AG."
"There-
fore, as of November 30, 2023, Fresenius Medical Care AG 
has no longer been fully consolidated in the consolidated  
financial statements of the Fresenius Group, but accounted 
for using the equity method."
"For the consolidated financial statements as of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, the specific accounting standards apply as 
follows."
"After registration 
with the commercial register (second step), the investment 
in Fresenius Medical Care was deconsolidated and subse-
quently accounted for at equity in accordance with IAS 28."
"The relevant IFRS required valuation of Fresenius Medical 
Care at fair value."
"As of July 14, 
2023, the market capitalization of Fresenius Medical Care 
was €13.7 billion based on a share price of 46.78 € and thus 
above the consolidated shareholders' equity of FMC-AG & Co."
"KGaA of €13.5 billion as of June 30, 2023."
"Therefore, the first step with the initial recognition dur-
ing the third quarter of 2023 did not result in any expenses."
"As part of the IFRS 5 subsequent remeasurement as of 
November 30, 2023, the fair value and consolidated share-
holders’ equity were again compared."
"As a result, a non-cash special item of €2.2 billion was 
recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the 
Fresenius Group, of which €0.6 billion was attributable  
to the shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and €1.6 bil-
lion to the noncontrolling interests of the Fresenius Group."
"The expenses are reported as part of the net income from 
deconsolidated Fresenius Medical Care operations under 
IFRS 5."
"The expenses are also re-
ported as part of net income from deconsolidated Fresenius 
Medical Care operations under IFRS 5."
"The effects of decon-
solidation are not taxable."
"In accordance with IFRS 5, the 
prior year figures in the consolidated statement of income 
and the consolidated statement of cash flows have been 
adjusted."
"At the same time, a 
far-reaching restructuring program was initiated with the 
clear objective of increasing the company’s profitability."
"As part of the transformation, Fresenius Vamed has  
realigned its project business, particularly in Germany."
"Moreover, the company has initiated the withdrawal from 
non-core activities in main non-European markets in the 
service business."
"This will lead to a redimensioning of  
activities and thus to a significantly lower risk profile."
"As a result of this transformation, Fresenius Vamed  
remeasured the affected business activities in fiscal year 
2023 and recognized special items of €554 million."
"These 
are attributable in particular to impairments of contract  
assets, receivables and inventories as well as of loans and 
investments and to restructuring expenses as well as the 
recognition of corresponding provisions."
"These special 
items are largely non-cash items."

nies are accounted for applying the purchase method."
"Capi-
tal consolidation is performed at the date of acquisition."
"Ini-
tially, all identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiaries as 
well as the noncontrolling interests are recognized at their 
fair values."
"Any remaining bal-
ance is recognized as goodwill and is tested at least once a 
year for impairment."
"All intercompany revenues, expenses, income, receiv-
ables and payables as well as other intercompany financial 
obligations and contingent liabilities are eliminated."
"Profits 
and losses on items of property, plant and equipment and 
inventory acquired from other Group entities are also elim-
inated."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized 
on temporary differences resulting from consolidation 
procedures."

Group entities not attributable, directly or indirectly, to 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and are recognized at fair value 
at the date of first consolidation using the full goodwill 
method."
"Profits and losses attributable to the noncontrol-
ling interests are separately disclosed in the consolidated 
statement of income."
"The Fresenius Group writes put options on certain 
noncontrolling interests."
"Some of the put options relate to 
mAbxience where put options were granted to noncontrol-
ling shareholders."
"When the put options are exercised they 
provide for settlement in cash."
"The Fresenius Group, in 
line with IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Account-
ing Estimates and Errors, paragraph 10, applies the present 
access method."
"According to the present access method, 
noncontrolling interests are recorded in equity when the 
risks and rewards of ownership reside with the noncontrol-
ling interests holders."
"The initial recognition of the put op-
tion liability, as well as valuation differences, are recorded 
in equity with no impact to the consolidated statement of 
income."
"b) Composition of the Group 
Besides Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, the consolidated finan-
cial statements include all material subsidiaries according 
to IFRS 10, which Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA controls an entity if it has power 
over the entity."
"That is, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA has exist-
ing rights that give Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA the current 
ability to direct the relevant activities, which are the activi-
ties that significantly affect the entity’s return."
"In addition, 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from the involvement with the entity and 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA has the ability to use its power 
over the entity to affect the amount of Fresenius SE & Co."
"Associated companies are accounted for using the equity 
method."
"Generally, entities in which Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, directly or indirectly, holds more than 20% and

nificant influence over their financial and operating poli-
cies are considered associates."
"As a result of the conver-
sion of the investment company Fresenius Medical Care 
AG & Co."
"KGaA into a German stock corporation (Aktien- 
gesellschaft --

"The equity result is reported as a separate line 
in the consolidated statement of income below operating

mation on receivables and payables in connection with 
non-consolidated companies has been adjusted in the con-
solidated statement of financial position to conform with 
the disclosure in the current year."
"In the consolidated statement of income for fiscal year 
2022, €416 million was reclassified from selling, general 
and administrative expenses to costs of revenue due to a 
voluntary change in presentation as result of an analysis for 
an increased transparency at Fresenius Medical Care."
"d) Hyperinflationary accounting 
Fresenius Group’s subsidiaries operating in Argentina and 
Türkiye apply IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflation-
ary Economies, due to inflation in those countries."
"For fiscal 
year 2023, the application of IAS 29 resulted in an effect 
on net income from continuing operations attributable to 
shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA of -€26 million 
(2022:-€26 million) included in other operating expenses."
"The ongoing re-translation effects of hyperinflationary  
accounting and its impact on comparative amounts are 
recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) within the 
consolidated financial statements."
"e) Revenue recognition policy 
Revenue is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers."
"Revenue from services and products is billed according 
to the usual contract arrangements with customers, patients 
and related third parties."
"For services performed for patients, 
the transaction price is estimated based on either Fresenius 
Group’s standard rates, rates determined under reimburse-
ment arrangements or by government regulations."
"These 
arrangements are generally with third party payors, such 
as German health insurance funds or commercial insurers."
"Amounts billed are recorded net of contractually agreed 
upon discounts or rebates to reflect the estimated amounts 
to be received from these payors."
"Estimates are determined 
on the basis of historical experience."
"Implicit price concessions are generally 
deductible amounts from patients with healthcare insurance 
coverage."
"Revenue from services is recognized on the date the ser-
vice is performed."
"At this point of time, the payor is obliged 
to pay for the services performed."
"Revenue from product sales is recognized when the cus-
tomer obtains control of the product, either after posses-
sion is transferred or upon installation and provision of the 
necessary technical instructions or at another point in time 
that better defines transfer of control."
"Fresenius Vamed has performance obligations from long-
term production contracts that are satisfied over time."
"Reve-
nue is recognized according to progress towards completion."
IFRS 15 does not apply to lease contracts.
"Revenue from 
leasing components is determined according to IFRS 16."
Revenue is reported net of sales tax.
"f) Government grants 
The Fresenius Group primarily receives governmental fund-
ing for hospitals in Germany to finance buildings and medi-
cal equipment."
"Public sector grants are not recognized 
until there is reasonable assurance that the respective con-
ditions are met and the grants will be received."
"Grants related to income are recognized 
in the period in which the related expenses are recorded."
"Depending on the nature of the respective type of grant, 
they are reported either under other operating income or 
as a reduction of the reimbursed expenses."
"For information 
regarding government compensation payments and reim-
bursements as well as COVID-19 related government grants, 
please see note 13, Government grants and impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic."
"g) Research and development expenses 
Research is the independent and planned investigation 
undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or 
technical knowledge and understanding."
"Development is 
the technical and commercial implementation of research 
results and occurs before the start of the commercial pro-
duction or use."
"The research and development phase of 
pharmaceutical products normally ends with the regula-
tory approval by the relevant authorities on the market of 
the particular country."
"Generally, a new pharmaceutical 
product is primarily approved in an established market, 
such as Europe, the United States, China and Japan."
Research expenses are expensed as incurred.
"Develop-
ment expenses that meet all the criteria for the recognition 
of an intangible asset are capitalized (see note 1."
"n,  
Intangible assets with finite useful lives)."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of the 
fair value less costs to sell and its value in use."
"The fair value 
less cost of disposal of an asset is estimated as its net realiza-
ble value."
"The value in use is the present value of future cash 
flows expected to be derived from the relevant asset."
"If it is 
not possible to estimate the future cash flows from the in-
dividual assets, impairment is tested on the basis of corre-
sponding cash generating units."
"Impairment losses, except impairment losses recognized 
on goodwill, are reversed if there are indications that the 
reasons for impairment no longer exist or there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's 
recoverable amount."
"This reversal shall not exceed the car-
rying amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognized before."
"i) Capitalized interest 
The Fresenius Group includes capitalized interest as part of 
the cost of the asset if it is directly attributable to the acqui-
sition, construction or manufacture of qualifying assets."
"For fiscal years 2023 and 2022, interest of €35 thousand 
and €2 million, respectively, based on an average interest 
rate of 2.10% and 4.20%, respectively, was recognized 
as a component of the cost of assets."
"j) Income taxes 
Current taxes are calculated based on the earnings of the 
fiscal year and in accordance with local tax rules of the 
respective tax jurisdictions."
"Expected and executed addi-
tional tax payments and tax refunds for prior years are 
also taken into account."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the 
future consequences attributable to temporary differences 
between the financial statement carrying amounts of exist-
ing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis."
"Fur-
thermore, deferred taxes are recognized on certain consoli-
dation adjustments which affect net income attributable  
to shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"Deferred tax 
assets also include claims for tax reductions which arise 
from the probable expected use of existing tax losses car-
ryforwards."
"The recognition of deferred tax assets from 
net operating losses and their utilization is based on the 
budget planning of the Fresenius Group and implemented 
tax strategies."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the 
tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the 
asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end 
of the reporting period."
"A change in tax rate for the calculation of deferred tax 
assets and liabilities is recognized in the period the new 
laws are enacted or substantively enacted."
"The effects of the adjustment are recognized  
in equity, if the temporary differences are related to items 
directly recognized in equity."
"The realizability of the carrying amount of a deferred 
tax asset is reviewed at each date of the statement of finan-
cial position."
"In assessing the realizability of deferred tax 
assets, the Management considers to which extent it is prob-
able that the deferred tax asset will be realized."
"The ulti-
mate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which those temporary differences and tax loss carryfor-
wards become deductible."
"The Management considers the 
expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected 
future taxable income in making this assessment."
"Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent it is 
probable that sufficient taxable income will be available for 
the utilization of parts or of the entire deferred tax asset."
"The Fresenius Group recognizes assets and liabilities for 
uncertain tax treatments to the extent it is probable the 
tax will be recovered or that the tax will be payable, respec-
tively."
"In North America and Germany, interest and penalties 
related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, 
do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore are 
accounted for under IAS 37."
"All other jurisdictions account 
for interest and penalties related to income taxes in accord-
ance with local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdiction 
either under IAS 37 or as income tax expense under IAS 12."
"The Fresenius Group is subject to ongoing and future 
tax audits in various countries."
"Different interpretations of 
tax laws, particularly due to the Fresenius Group’s interna-
tional activities, may lead to potential additional tax pay-
ments or tax refunds for prior years."
"To consider income 
tax liabilities or income tax receivables, Management’s esti-
mates are based on experiences with previous tax audits 
and local tax rules of the respective tax jurisdiction and the 
interpretation of such."
"Differences between actual results 
and Management’s estimates or future changes in these 
estimates may have an impact on future tax payments or 
tax refunds."
"Estimates are revised in the period in which 
there is sufficient evidence to revise the assumptions."
"k) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net  
income attributable to shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the year."
"Diluted earnings per share in-
clude the effect of all potentially dilutive instruments on ordi-
nary shares that would have been outstanding during the fis-
cal year."
"The equity-settled awards granted under Fresenius’ 
stock option plans can result in a dilutive effect."
"Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition 
and manufacturing cost (determined by using the average 
or first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value."
"Manu-
facturing costs are comprised of direct costs, production 
and material overhead, including depreciation charges."
"Repairs 
and maintenance costs are recognized in profit and loss as 
incurred."
"The costs for the replacement of components or 
the general overhaul of property, plant and equipment are 
recognized, if it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the Fresenius Group and these costs can be 
measured reliably."
"The useful lives of patents, product and distri-
bution rights range from 5 to 20 years, the average useful  
life is 13 years."
"The useful lives of customer relationships 
vary from 10 to 30 years, the average useful life is 18 years."
Technology is amortized over a finite useful live of 15 years.
"Licenses to manufacture, distribute and sell pharmaceutical 
drugs are amortized over the contractual license period."
"All 
other intangible assets are amortized over their individual 
estimated useful lives between 3 and 15 years."
"Losses in value are recorded as an impairment and are 
reversed if there are indications that the reasons for impair-
ment no longer exist and there has been a change in the  
estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount."
"This reversal shall not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined had no impairment loss 
been recognized before."
"Development costs are capitalized as manufacturing 
costs when the recognition criteria are met."
"Fresenius Kabi capitalizes development costs as soon as 
the registration of a new product is very likely."
"This mainly 
applies if a product is already approved on an established 
market."
"Costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
the expected useful lives."
"In 2023 and 2022, impairments 
were recorded (see note 7, Research and development  
expenses)."
"Generally, adjustments made to the fair value of identifi-
able assets and liabilities subsequent to the final purchase 
price allocation are recognized immediately in the consoli-
dated statement of income."
"Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful 
lives are not amortized but tested for impairment annually 
or when an event becomes known that could trigger an 
impairment (impairment test)."
"A CGU 
is usually defined one level below the segment level based 
on regions or the nature of the business activity."
"According to the organizational structure, the seg-
ment Fresenius Helios consists of two CGUs, Germany and 
Spain."
"The previous CGU Fertility was divested on Janu-
ary 31, 2024 and is classified as an asset held for sale in 
the consolidated statement of financial position in accord-
ance with IFRS 5."
"The segment Fresenius Vamed consists 
of two CGUs (Project business and Service business)."
"At 
least once a year, in the fourth quarter, the Fresenius Group 
compares the value in use of each CGU to the CGU’s carry-
ing amount."
"The recoverable amount as its value in use of a 
CGU is determined using a discounted cash flow approach 
based upon the cash flow expected to be generated by the 
CGU."
"In case that the value in use of the CGU is less than 
its carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal 
is not estimated to be higher than the value in use, the 
difference is recorded as an impairment of the carrying 
amount of the CGU goodwill."
"To evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives, the Fresenius Group compares the 
recoverable amounts of the smallest identifiable group of 
assets that generate largely independent cash inflows with 
their carrying amounts."
"An intangible asset’s fair value  
is determined using a discounted cash flow approach or 
other methods, if appropriate."
"The annual impairment assessments have not resulted 
in any indications of impairment in 2023 and 2022."
"p) Investments accounted for using the equity 
method 
Initial recognition using the equity method is generally at 
cost."
"In the case of investments that are deconsolidated due 
to loss of control and subsequently accounted for using the 
equity method, the fair value of the investment corresponds 
to the acquisition cost."
"At initial recognition of the invest-
ment in Fresenius Medical Care at equity, a notional pur-
chase price allocation was undertaken identifying and valu-
ing the fair value of the assets and liabilities included in the 
carrying amount of the equity investment."
"In subsequent 
periods, the value of the investment is adjusted by the share 
in the profit or loss of the investment, including the fair values 
identified which form the basis for additional depreciation, 
amortization of the purchase price allocation and other pro-
portionate changes in equity."
"q) Leases 
A lease is defined as a contract that conveys the right to 
use an underlying asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration."
"The Fresenius Group decided not to apply the guidance 
within IFRS 16 to leases with a total maximum term of 
twelve months (short-term leases) and leases for underlying 
assets of low value."
"These leases are exempt from balance 
sheet recognition and lease payments will be recognized 
as expenses over the lease term."
IFRS 16 is not applied to leases of intangible assets.
"With the ‘‘reasonably certain’’ assessments, the Fresenius 
Group determines if and which future costs based on exten-
sion and / or termination options have to be included in the 
lease liabilities."
"Addi-
tionally, the Fresenius Group’s historical practice regarding 
the period over which it has typically used particular types 
of assets, and its economic reasons for doing so, is also rele-
vant."
"Unrecognized extension options are shown as poten-
tial future cash outflows (see note 32, Leases)."
"Lease payments are discounted using the implicit inter-
est rate underlying the lease if this rate can be readily deter-
mined."
"Otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate of the 
lessee is used as the discount rate."
"Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost using the effective interest method."
"Furthermore, lease 
liabilities may be remeasured due to lease modifications or 
reassessments of the lease."
"The incremental borrowing rate is determined when 
the Fresenius Group initiates a lease contract or changes 
an existing lease."
"The interest rate is calculated based on 
the following components: available interest rate sampling 
points, group risk margins, shadow rating (credit risk) mar-
gins, country risk margins, handling margins and other risk 
margins."
"For lease contracts that include both lease and non-
lease components that are not separable from lease compo-
nents, no allocation is performed."
"Each lease component  
and any associated non-lease components are accounted 
for as a single lease."
"If the lease contracts include the lease 
and non-lease costs separately, the lease contract costs are 
divided into lease and non-lease components."
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset using 
the straight-line method."
"Where a lease agreement includes 
a transfer of ownership at the end of the lease term or the 
exercise of a purchase option is deemed reasonably cer-
tain, right-of-use assets are depreciated over the useful life 
of the underlying asset using the straight-line method."
"In 
addition, right-of-use assets are reduced by impairment 
losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements."
"Right-of-use assets from lease contracts and lease 
liabilities are presented separately from property, plant and 
equipment and other financial debt in the consolidated state-
ment of financial position."
"r) Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a 
financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity 
instrument of another entity."
"Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized 
or derecognized on the trading date."
"Furthermore, the 
Fresenius Group does not make use of the fair value option, 
which allows financial liabilities to be classified at fair value 
through profit or loss upon initial recognition."
"The Fresenius 
Group elects to represent changes in the fair value of se-
lected equity investments that are not held for trading in 
other comprehensive income (loss)."
"Financial instruments are allocated to categories follow-
ing the analysis of the business model and cash flow char-
acteristics as required by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments."
"The reconciliation of the categories to the positions in the 
consolidated statement of financial position is shown in 
tabular form in note 33, Financial instruments."
"Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash funds and all 
short-term investments with maturities of up to three 
months."
"Short-term investments are highly liquid and 
readily convertible into known amounts of cash."
"The risk  
of changes in value is insignificant."
"Trade accounts and other receivables 
Trade accounts and other receivables are stated at their 
nominal value less lifetime expected credit losses."
"Impairments 
According to IFRS 9, impairments are recognized on the 
basis of expected credit losses (expected credit loss model)."
"The Fresenius Group recognizes a loss allowance for  
expected credit losses on financial assets measured at  
amortized cost, contract assets and lease receivables as 
well as for investments in debt instruments measured at 
fair value through other comprehensive income."
"The Fresenius Group recognizes loss allowances for 
expected credit losses (allowance for doubtful accounts) 
mainly for trade accounts receivable and cash and cash 
equivalents."
"The amount of expected credit losses is  
updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit 
risk since initial recognition of the respective instrument."
"For trade accounts receivable, the Fresenius Group uses 
the simplified method which requires recognizing lifetime 
expected credit losses."
"Expected credit losses on cash and cash equivalents are 
measured according to the general method based on IFRS 9."
"A significant increase in credit risk will be assessed based 
on available qualitative as well as quantitative information."
"Based on external credit ratings of the counterparties, the 
Fresenius Group considers that its cash and cash equiva-
lents have a low credit risk."
"The Fresenius Group does not expect any material credit 
losses from financial instruments that are measured accord-
ing to the general approach."
"The allowances are estimates comprised of customer 
and financial asset specific evaluations regarding payment 
history, current financial stability, and applicable future 
economic conditions."
"Financial assets whose expected credit loss is not assessed 
individually are allocated to geographical regions."
"The  
impairment is generally assessed on the basis of regional 
macroeconomic indicators such as credit default swaps or 
scoring models."
"Due to the number of transactions and geographical re-
gions that the Fresenius Group operates in, the Fresenius 
Group’s policy of determining when an individual expected 
credit loss is required considers the appropriate individual 
local facts and circumstances that apply to an account."
"While payment and collection practices vary significantly 
between countries and even agencies within one country, 
government payors usually represent low to moderate credit 
risks."
"It is the Fresenius Group’s policy to determine when 
receivables should be classified as bad debt on a local basis 
taking into account local payment practices and local col-
lection experience."
"In case of objective evidence of a detrimental impact on 
the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset, the asset 
is considered to be credit impaired."
"This is generally the case 
after more than 360 days overdue, at the latest."
"When a counterpart defaults, all financial assets against 
this counterpart are considered impaired."
"The definition 
of default is mainly based on payment practices specific 
to individual regions and businesses."
"c, Allowances for expected credit losses."
"Put option liabilities 
The Fresenius Group, as option writer of existing put op-
tions, can be obligated to purchase noncontrolling interests 
held by third parties."
"If these put options were exercised, 
the Fresenius Group would be required to purchase all or 
part of the third-party owners’ noncontrolling interests at 
the appraised fair value at the time of exercise."
"Put option 
liabilities are recognized at the present value of the exer-
cise price of the option."
"The exercise price of the option  
is generally based on fair value and, in certain limited in-
stances, might contain a fixed floor price."
"Put options in the Fresenius Group mainly relate to  
the Fresenius Kabi segment The exercise price of the put 
options of Fresenius Kabi is based on the fair value of 
mAbxience."
"Common discounted cash flow valuation mod-
els are used to approximate this fair value."
"For the purpose of analyzing the impact of changes in unob-
servable inputs on the fair value measurement of put option 
liabilities, please see note 33, Financial instruments."
"Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments, in the form of a cross cur-
rency swap and foreign currency forward contracts, are 
recognized at fair value as assets or liabilities in the consol-
idated statement of financial position."
"The effective portion 
of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges is recognized 
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in share-
holders’ equity until the secured underlying transaction is 
realized (see note 33, Financial instruments)."
"Based on the 
spot rate changes of hedged items and hedging instruments, 
the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in 
current earnings."
"Changes in the fair value of derivatives 
that are not designated as hedging instruments are recog-
nized in earnings."
"Derivatives embedded in host contracts with a financial 
liability as host contract are accounted for as separate deriv-
atives if their economic characteristics and risks are not 
closely related to those of the host contracts."
"These embed-
ded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in 
fair value recognized in the income statement."
"s) Liabilities 
At the date of the statement of financial position, liabilities 
are generally stated at amortized cost, with the exception of 
contingent considerations resulting from a business combi-
nation, put option liabilities as well as derivative financial 
liabilities."
"t) Legal contingencies 
In the ordinary course of Fresenius Group’s operations, the 
Fresenius Group is party to litigation and arbitration and is 
subject to investigations relating to various aspects of its 
business."
"The Fresenius Group regularly analyzes current 
information about such claims for probable losses and pro-
vides accruals for such matters, including the estimated le-
gal expenses and consulting services in connection with 
these matters, as appropriate."
"The Fresenius Group utilizes 
its internal legal department as well as external resources 
for these assessments."
"In making the decision regarding 
the need for a loss accrual, the Fresenius Group considers 
the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and its 
ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss."
"The filing of a suit or formal assertion of a claim or  
assessment, or the disclosure of any such suit or asser-
tion, does not necessarily indicate that accrual of a loss  
is appropriate."
"u) Provisions 
Accruals for other obligations are recognized when there 
is a present obligation to a third party arising from past 
events, it is probable that the obligation will be settled in 
the future and the amount can be reliably estimated."
"Provisions for warranties and complaints are estimated 
based on historical experience."
"v) Pension liabilities and similar obligations 
Pension obligations for post-employment benefits are 
measured in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Benefits, 
using the projected unit credit method, taking into account 
future salary and trends for pension increase."
"The Fresenius Group uses December 31 as the meas-
urement date when measuring the deficit or surplus of all 
plans."
"Net interest costs are calculated by multiplying the pen-
sion liability at the beginning of the year with the discount 
rate utilized in determining the benefit obligation."
"The pen-
sion liability results from the benefit obligation less the fair 
value of plan assets."
"Remeasurements include actuarial gains and losses re-
sulting from the evaluation of the defined benefit obligation 
as well as from the difference between actual return on 
plan assets and the expected return on plan assets at the 
beginning of the year used to calculate the net interest 
costs."
"In the event of a surplus for a defined benefit pen-
sion plan, remeasurements can also contain the effect  
from Asset Ceiling, as far as this effect is not included in 
net interest costs."
"Remeasurements are recognized in accumulated other 
comprehensive income (loss) completely."
"It is not allowed 
to reclassify the remeasurements in subsequent periods."
"Components of net periodic benefit cost are recognized in 
profit and loss of the period."
"w) Debt issuance costs 
Debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability 
are presented in the consolidated statement of financial 
position as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of 
that debt liability."
"Debt issuance costs related to undrawn 
credit facilities are presented in other assets."
"These costs 
are amortized over the term of the related obligation or 
credit facility."
"x) Share-based compensation plans 
The Fresenius Group measures its share-based compen-
sation plans in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based  
Payments."
"The measurement date fair value of cash-settled per-
formance shares and stock awards granted to members of 
the Management Board and executive employees of the 
Fresenius Group is calculated using the Monte Carlo simu-
lation."
"The corresponding liability based on the measure-
ment date fair value is accrued over the vesting period of 
the performance share and stock award plans."
"y) Foreign currency translation 
The reporting and functional currency is the euro."
"Substan-
tially all assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries that 
use a functional currency other than the euro are translated 
at year-end exchange rates, while income and expense are 
translated at annual average exchange rates of the fiscal 
year."
"Adjustments due to foreign currency translation fluc-
tuations are excluded from net earnings and are reported  
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)."
"In addi-
tion, the translation adjustments of certain intercompany 
borrowings, which are of a long-term nature, are also re-
ported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)."
"Transactions in foreign currencies recorded by subsidiaries 
are accounted for at the prevailing spot rate on the date of 
the respective transaction."
"Foreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions 
are generally recognized in profit and loss."
"Financial instru-
ments denominated in a foreign currency are revalued at 
the spot rate as of the date of the consolidated statement of 
financial position."
"On the disposal of a foreign operation, all 
of the foreign currency translation differences accumulated 
in respect of that disposed operation are reclassified to the 
consolidated statement of income."
"On a partial disposal of 
a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation that does not 
result in the loss of control over the subsidiary, the propor-
tionate share of accumulated foreign currency translation 
differences is re-attributed to noncontrolling interests."
"Level 1 is defined as observable 
inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets."
"Level 2 is 
in application of recognized financial mathematical models 
defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active mar-
kets that are directly or indirectly observable."
"Level 3 is 
defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market 
data exists, therefore requiring the company to develop its 
own assumptions."
"The three-tier fair value hierarchy is 
used in note 33, Financial instruments and in note 21,  
Interests in associates."
"Actual results could differ from those 
estimates."
"bb) Non-current assets held for sale, discontinued 
and deconsolidated operations 
A non-current asset or disposal group held for sale is meas-
ured at the lower of its carrying amount or its fair value less 
cost to sell, and amortization / depreciation is ceased."
"Assets classified as held for sale and the related liabili-
ties are presented separately in a line within the current 
portion of the consolidated statement of financial position."
"If the disposal group is classified as a discontinued opera-
tion, the Fresenius Group also presents the results sepa-
rately in the consolidated statement of income and in the 
consolidated statement of cash flows and prior year figures 
are adjusted."
"The deconsolidation of the business segment Fresenius 
Medical Care as of November 30, 2023 was accounted for 
in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations."
"Fresenius Medical Care 
was recognized as a discontinued operation by the Fresenius 
Group from July 14, 2023 to November 30, 2023."
"At July 14, 
2023, the General Meeting of Fresenius Medical Care AG &  
Co."
"KGaA approved the conversion of the legal form into a 
German stock corporation and the deconsolidation within 
one year was considered highly probable."
"On November 30, 
2023, the conversion of the legal form was registered with 
the commercial register and Fresenius Medical Care was 
deconsolidated at that date."
"The Fresenius Group reports the results of Fresenius 
Medical Care up to November 30, 2023 separately in the 
consolidated statement of income and in the consolidated 
statement of cash flows and the prior year figures have 
been adjusted."
"Since November 30, 2023, Fresenius Medical Care has 
been an associated company and is accounted for accord-
ing to IAS 28 using the equity method."
"cc) Receivables management 
The entities of the Fresenius Group perform ongoing evalu-
ations of the financial situation of their customers and gen-
erally do not require a collateral from the customers for the 
supply of products and provision of services."
"dd) Recent pronouncements, applied 
The Fresenius Group has prepared its consolidated financial 
statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2023 in 
conformity with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, that must be 
applied for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2023."
"In fiscal year 2023, the following new standards rele-
vant for Fresenius Group’s business were applied for the 
first time: 
 
IAS 12 
In May 2023, the IASB issued Amendments to IAS 12,  
Income Taxes."
"The amendments temporarily exempt com-
panies from accounting for deferred taxes arising from 
the implementation of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development’s (OECD) international tax re-
form, known as Pillar Two model."
"The Pillar Two model 
aims at taxing large multinational companies with a rate 
of at least 15%."
"Moreover, the amendments prescribe tar-
geted disclosures."
"Disclosures are required for fiscal years 
beginning on or after January 1, 2023."
"In Germany, the Minimum Tax Act (MindStG) was passed 
in 2023, which serves to implement Council Directive (EU) 
2022 / 25234 to ensure global minimum taxation based on 
the OECD Pillar Two model."
"The Fresenius Group applies 
the exemption of the IASB Amendments to IAS 12, Income 
Taxes, in fiscal year 2023 and does not recognize deferred 
taxes in connection with temporary differences from  
the Pillar Two model."
"Based on the current status of the 
Fresenius Group's analyses regarding the possible effects 
of the Pillar Two rules on the companies of the Fresenius 
Group, the Fresenius Group identified only a small number 
of possible impacts relating to foreign subsidiaries."
"In addi-
tion, these subsidiaries only report an immaterial amount 
of income that could be subject to minimum taxation."
"Ac-
cordingly, the Fresenius Group assumes that the applica-
tion of the Pillar Two rules will not have a material impact 
on the consolidated tax rate of the Fresenius Group in the 
fiscal years from January 1, 2024 onwards."
"IFRS 17 
In May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts."
"In June 2020 and December 2021, further amendments 
were published."
"IFRS 17 establishes principles for the 
recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure 
related to the issuance of insurance contracts."
"IFRS 4 permitted the use 
of national accounting standards for the accounting of insur-
ance contracts under IFRS."
"As a result of the varied applica-
tion for insurance contracts, there was a lack of compara-
bility among peer groups."
"IFRS 17 eliminates this diver-
sity in practice by requiring all insurance contracts to be 
accounted for using updated estimates and assumptions 
that reflect the timing of cash flows and any uncertainty 
relating to insurance contracts."
"The adoption of IFRS 17 did not have a material impact 
on the consolidated financial statements of the Fresenius 
Group."
"All other mandatory new IFRS standards and interpreta-
tions had no material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Fresenius Group."
"The amendments clarify under which circumstances debt 
and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date 
should be classified as current or non-current."
"Among oth-
ers, the amendments state that liabilities shall be classified 
depending on rights that exist at the end of the reporting 
period and define under which conditions liabilities might 
be settled by cash, other economic resources or equity."
"On 
July 15, 2020, and October 31, 2022, the IASB deferred the 
effective date."
"The amendments to IAS 1 are now effective 
for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2024."
"Ear-
lier adoption is permitted."
"The Fresenius Group is currently 
evaluating the impact of the amendments to IAS 1 on the 
consolidated financial statements."
"In the Fresenius Group’s view, there are no other IFRS 
standards or interpretations not yet effective that would 
be expected to have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements."
"ff) Impacts of the macroeconomic environment on 
accounting 
There are still considerable uncertainties, in particular due 
to a possible further deterioration in the global macroeco-
nomic outlook."
"The macroeconomic inflationary environ-
ment --
- which is also attributed to the Ukraine war --
- contin-
ues to pose the risk of significantly rising energy, supply 
and transportation costs."
"However, this risk has decreased, 
mainly due to an easing of the situation on individual pro-
curement markets, particularly the one for energy."
"With 
the deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care, Fresenius 
Group's assets in Russia and Ukraine amounted to less than 
1% of its total assets as of December 31, 2023."
"Therefore, 
the direct impact of the Ukraine war on the Fresenius 
Group’s remaining business is limited."
"gg) Impacts of climate change on accounting 
The Fresenius Group continually analyzes potential sustain-
ability risks in the areas of climate change and water scar-
city."
"In both areas, the Fresenius Group has not identified 
any significant risks for its business model."
"Therefore, the 
Fresenius Group does not currently expect any material 
impact of sustainability risks on the accounting."
"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
In the opinion of the Management of the Fresenius Group, 
the following accounting policies and topics are critical for 
the consolidated financial statements in the present eco-
nomic environment."
"The influences and judgments as well 
as the uncertainties which affect them are also important 
factors to be considered when looking at present and future 
operating earnings of the Fresenius Group."
"a) Recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 
with indefinite useful lives 
The amount of goodwill and other non-amortizable intan-
gible assets with indefinite useful lives represents a con-
siderable part of the total assets of the Fresenius Group."
"At 
December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying 
amount of these was €15,103 million and €31,799 million 
(€15,754 million excluding Fresenius Medical Care), respec-
tively."
"This represented 33% and 42%, respectively, of total 
assets."
"An impairment test of goodwill and non-amortizable intan-
gible assets with indefinite useful lives is performed at least 
once a year, or if events occur or circumstances change that 
would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable."
"To determine possible impairments of these assets, the 
recoverable amount as its value in use of the cash generat-
ing units (CGUs) is compared to their carrying amount and 
the fair value less cost of disposal."
"The value in use of each 
CGU is determined using estimated future cash flows for 
the unit discounted by a weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) specific to that CGU."
"Estimating the discounted fu-
ture cash flows involves significant assumptions, especially 
regarding future reimbursement rates and sales prices,  
number of treatments, sales volumes and costs."
"In deter-
mining discounted cash flows, the Fresenius Group utilizes 
for every CGU its approved three-year budget, projections 
for years 4 to 10 and a corresponding growth rate for all re-
maining years."
"Projections for up to 10 years are possible 
due to historical experience and the stability of Fresenius 
Group’s business, which is largely independent from the 
economic cycle."
"As the market capitalization as of December 31, 2023 
was below the Group’s equity, the key parameters of the 
impairment test were reviewed."
"This review did not result 
in any impairment as of December 31, 2023."
"low to mid 
single-digit  
n.a."
"Biopharma 
  
low 
double-digit  
n.a."
"low to mid 
double-digit  
n.a."
"Nutrition 
  
mid 
single-digit  
n.a."
"high 
single-digit

"MedTech

"mid to high 
single-digit

"617 
Asia-Pacific 
  
n.a."
"525 
Latin America 
  
n.a."
"mid to high 
single-digit  
n.a."
"The WACC in the business segments 
Fresenius Helios and Fresenius Vamed consisted of a basic 
rate of 5.74% for 2023."
"This basic rate is then adjusted by a 
country-specific risk premium for each CGU."
"The WACC for 
the CGUs of the business segment Fresenius Kabi was based 
on a peer group analysis."
"If the value in use of the CGU is less than its carrying 
amount and the fair value less cost of disposal is not esti-
mated to be higher than the value in use, the difference  
is recorded as an impairment of the CGU’s goodwill."
"The Fresenius Group did not record any impairment 
losses related to goodwill in fiscal years 2023 and 2022  
after having compared each CGU’s value in use to its  
carrying amount."
"An increase of the WACC (after tax) by 
0.5 percentage points would not have resulted in the recog-
nition of an impairment loss in 2023."
"In connection with the implementation of the new 
global operating model at Fresenius Kabi, the Fresenius 
Group reallocated goodwill to the four new operating divi-
sions, which were also identified as CGUs."
"Goodwill was reallocated using the relative fair 
value allocation method on the basis of the value in use cal-
culation."
"The goodwill of the companies acquired in 2022, 
Ivenix and mAbxience, was allocated directly to the respec-
tive CGU."
"As of January 1, 2023, there was no indication 
of impairment in the new operating divisions."
"The good-
will of Fresenius Kabi as of January 1, 2023 amounted to 
€6,276 million, of which €2,374 million was attributable 
to the Pharma division, €1,687 million to the Biopharma 
division, €1,591 million to the Nutrition division and €624 
million to the MedTech division."
"Furthermore, 
changes in the macroeconomic environment could affect 
the discount rate."
"A possible consequence could be a mate-
rial and adverse effect on Fresenius Group’s future operat-
ing results due to additional impairments on goodwill and 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives."
"In fiscal year 2022, the recoverable amount of the CGUs 
Fresenius Kabi Europe and Fresenius Helios Spain exceeded 
the carrying amount by €1,122 million and €2,386 million, 
respectively."
"b) Legal contingencies 
The Fresenius Group is involved in several legal matters 
arising from the ordinary course of its business."
"The out-
come of these matters may have a material adverse effect  
on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows 
of the Fresenius Group."
"For details, please see note 31, 
Commitments and contingencies."
"The Fresenius Group regularly analyzes current infor-
mation about such claims for probable losses and provides 
accruals for such matters, including the estimated legal ex-
penses and consulting services in connection with these 
matters, as appropriate."
"The Fresenius Group utilizes its in-
ternal legal department as well as external resources for 
these assessments."
"In making the decision regarding the 
need for a provision for legal matters, the Fresenius Group 
considers the degree of probability of an unfavorable out-
come and its ability to make a reasonable estimate of the 
amount of loss."
"The filing of a suit or formal assertion of a claim or as-
sessment, or the disclosure of any such suit or assertion, 
does not necessarily indicate that a provision for a loss is 
appropriate."
"c) Allowances for expected credit losses 
Trade accounts receivable are a significant asset and the 
allowances for expected credit losses are a significant esti-
mate made by the local Management."
"Trade accounts  
receivable were €3,673 million and €7,161 million in 2023 
and 2022, respectively, net of allowance."
"Other than that, 
the Fresenius Group has no significant risk concentra- 
tion, due to its international and heterogeneous customer 
structure."
"The allowances for expected credit losses were €348 mil-
lion and €473 million as of December 31, 2023 and Decem-
ber 31, 2022, respectively."
"A valuation allowance is calcu-
lated if specific circumstances indicate that amounts will 
not be collectible."
"When all efforts to collect a receivable, 
including the use of outside sources where required and 
allowed, have been exhausted, and after appropriate review 
by the local management, a receivable deemed to be uncol-
lectible is considered a bad debt and written off."
"Deterioration in the aging of receivables and collection 
difficulties could require that the Fresenius Group increases 
the estimates of allowances for expected credit losses."
"Addi-
tional expenses for uncollectible receivables could have a 
significant negative impact on future operating results."
"ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES  
AND INVESTMENTS 
 
ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND INVESTMENTS 
The Fresenius Group made acquisitions, investments and 
purchases of intangible assets of €210 million and €833 mil-

"Fresenius Kabi 
In 2023, Fresenius Kabi spent €207 million on acquisitions,

of Merck KGaA’s biosimilars business which were already 
recognized as liabilities as part of the acquisition."
"In 2022, Fresenius Kabi spent €734 million on acquisitions, 
mainly for the acquisition of a stake of 55% of mAbxience 
Holding S.L."
"and for the acquisition of 100% of the shares 
of Ivenix, Inc."
"Acquisition mAbxience 
On August 1, 2022, Fresenius Kabi closed the acquisition of 
a stake of 55% of mAbxience Holding S.L."
"(mAbxience), a 
leading international biopharmaceutical company, focused 
on the rapidly growing market for the development and 
manufacturing of biological drugs (biopharmaceuticals)."
"The company has been consolidated since August 1, 2022, 
and has contributed €59 million to revenue in fiscal year 
2022."
"The consideration transferred in the amount of €511 
million is a combination of €499 million upfront payment, 
which was paid in cash upon closing, and performance-
based payments expected for future years with a current fair 
value of €12 million."
"These are strictly tied to the achieve-
ment of development and operating targets and could be  
in the low three-digit million euro range in total."
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.
"The following table summarizes the final fair values of 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed."
"During 2023, the 
acquisition accounting was reviewed and finalized."
"Adjust-
ments in the amount of €61 million were mainly attribut-
able to the fair value of the IPR & D portfolio recognized 
as intangible assets, as well as offsetting deferred tax  
effects of €15 million."
"Adjustments, net of related income 
tax effects, were recorded to goodwill and intangible assets."
"Since January 1, 2023, it has been allocated to 
the Biopharma cash generating unit in accordance with  
the applicable new reporting structure."
"Acquisition Ivenix

of 100% of the shares of Ivenix, Inc."
"(Ivenix), a specialized 
infusion therapy company."
"The cash purchase price amounts 
to US$240 million (€228 million)."
"In addition, milestone 
payments with a current fair value in the low three-digit 
million euro range were recognized."
"These are strictly 
linked to the achievement of commercial and operating 
targets and could increase by a low three-digit million euro 
amount."
"The transaction was accounted for as a business  
combination."
"Based on the final purchase price allocation, goodwill  
of US$199 million (€188 million) which is not deductible 
for tax purposes and an intangible asset of US$180 million 
(€171 million) were recorded in the initial statement of  
financial position."

the following disposals: 
On November 14, 2023, the Fresenius Group signed an 
agreement to transfer its plant in Halden, Norway, to HP 
Halden Pharma AS, a company of the Prange Group."
"The 
Prange Group, together with its affiliate Adragos Pharma, 
will take over the manufacturing facility with equipment 
as well as employees and will continue to manufacture 
Fresenius Kabi’s products."
"The transaction is expected to 
be completed in the first quarter of 2024."
"For the agreed 
disposal, an impairment loss of €20 million was recognized 
in connection with the classification as an asset held for 
sale, which is included in costs of revenue in the consoli-
dated statement of income and classified as a special item."
"The carrying amounts of the assets in the disposal group 
for the planned sale of the plant are recognized at fair 
value less costs to sell."
"On November 8, 2023, the Fresenius Group signed  
an agreement to sell the Eugin group to the global fertil-
ity group IVI RMA (a KKR portfolio company) and GED  
 
Capital."

cial item."

co-holding entity of the hospital Clínica Ricardo Palma in 
Lima, Peru."
"The stake is acquired by entities of the Verme 
family which already hold a stake in the hospital, together 
with other local investors."
"Subject to antitrust review, the 
transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter 
of 2024."
"The planned disposal of the hospital in Peru did 
not result in an impairment loss and the assets are recog-
nized at their carrying amount."
"Deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care 
On July 14, 2023, the Extraordinary General Meeting of 
Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"After registration  
with the commercial register on November 30, 2023, the 
investment in Fresenius Medical Care was deconsolidated 
and subsequently accounted for using the equity method 
in accordance with IAS 28 (see note 1."
"bb, Non-current 
assets held for sale, discontinued and deconsolidated

"At December 31, 2023, revenue recognized that was in-
cluded in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning 
of the period was €74 million (2022: €492 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the 
Fresenius Group had performance obligations that are un-
satisfied or partially unsatisfied and that are expected to be 
satisfied and recorded in revenue in the following years."
"PERSONNEL EXPENSES 
Costs of revenue, selling expenses, general and adminis-
trative expenses and research and development expenses 
included personnel expenses of €9,930 million and €9,439 
million in 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Furthermore, in 
2023, research and development expenses included impair-
ments of €53 million (2022: €25 million Fresenius Kabi)."
"These related to R & D projects of Fresenius Kabi that were 
not pursued further and to impairments of the discontin-
ued operations of Fresenius Helios in connection with the 
legacy portfolio adjustments."
"The expenses for the further 
development of the biopharma business included in the re-
search and development expenses amounted to €220 mil-
lion (2022: €164 million)."
"GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
General and administrative expenses amounted to €2,405 
million (2022: €2,348 million) and were related to expendi-
tures for administrative functions not attributable to research 
and development, production or selling."
"The increase was 
mainly due to expenses associated with the cost and effi-
ciency program and legacy portfolio adjustments."
"OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES 
Other operating income of €402 million (2022: €353 million) 
mainly included income from the reversal of provisions and 
other income from Fresenius Digital Technology GmbH in 
2023."
"In 2022, income from the release of provisions, other 
income from Fresenius Digital Technology GmbH and 
gains on sale and leaseback transactions were included in 
this position."

and interest income of €118 million (2022: €130 million)."
"Moreover, €61 million related to lease 
liabilities."
"The main portion of interest income resulted from 
interest income on receivables and from discounting effects."
"The expected 
corporate income tax expense is computed by applying the 
German corporation tax rate (including the solidarity sur-
charge) and the effective trade tax rate on income before 
income taxes."
"The respective combined tax rate was 30.8% 
and 30.7% for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"This is due to deferred taxes that are 
booked directly to equity, the effects of exchange rate 
changes on tax assets and liabilities denominated in cur-
rencies other than euro and the acquisition and disposal  
of entities as part of ordinary activities."
"The total amount of temporary differences in connection 
with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates as 
well as interests in joint ventures for which no deferred tax 
liabilities were recognized amounted to €150 million as of 
December 31, 2023."

as of December 31, 2023 includes an amount of €1,429 
million (2022: €1,676 million) that will probably not be  
realizable."
"For these operating losses, deferred tax assets 
were not recognized."
"The negative results of Fresenius Helios arose 
from the impairment for the Eugin group recognized in 
accordance with IFRS 5."
"Approximately two thirds 
of the payments were recognized on a pro rata basis in the 
consolidated statement of income and offset against the 
higher energy costs recognized in the costs of revenue."
"The German clinics of the Fresenius Group did not  
receive reimbursements and grants to compensate for 
COVID-19 related financial charges in fiscal year 2023 
(2022: €227 million, thereof €200 million recorded in

met the conditions to offset balances within this cash pool 
for reporting purposes."

(December 31, 2022: €102 million) of the cash balances

purchase approximately €522 million of raw materials 
and purchased components under fixed terms, of which 
€362 million was committed at December 31, 2023 for 
2024."
"The terms of these agreements run one to three 
years."
"The approval is 
evidenced in a letter written by the granting authorities 
that Fresenius Helios has already received."
"The increase 
in accounts receivable resulting from German hospital  
 
law mainly results from the reclassification of funds for  
investment promotion from the Hospital Future Fund 
(Krankenhauszukunftsfonds) from other assets in 2023."
"The compensation receivable resulting from German 
hospital law mainly relates to income equalization claims 
for hospital services."
"The increase in compensation receiv- 
able in 2023 is mainly due to delayed budget negotiations 
with providers."
"Contract assets mainly related to long­term production 
contracts for which revenue is recognized over time."
"The 
decrease in fiscal year 2023 is mainly caused by revalua-
tions due to the Vamed transformation."

ances for expected credit losses of €4 million (2022: €5 
million) had to be recognized as of December 31, 2023."

"PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS 
 
GENERAL 
The Fresenius Group recognizes pension costs and related 
pension liabilities for current and future benefits to quali-
fied current and former employees of the Fresenius Group."
"Fresenius Group’s pension plans are structured in accord-
ance with the differing legal, economic and fiscal circum-
stances in each country."
"The Fresenius Group currently has  
two types of plans, defined benefit and defined contribution 
plans."
"In general, plan benefits in defined benefit plans are 
based on all or a portion of the employees’ years of services 
and final salary."
"Plan benefits in defined contribution plans 
are determined by the amount of contribution by the em-
ployee and the employer, both of which may be limited by 
legislation, and the returns earned on the investment of 
those contributions."
"In their 
basic features, these are similar to the obligations for the 
employees."
"Upon retirement under defined benefit plans, the 
Fresenius Group is required to pay defined benefits to  
former employees when the defined benefits become due."
Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded.
"The 
Fresenius Group's major funded defined benefit plans are 
in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Belgium 
and Austria."
"Major unfunded defined benefit plans exist  
in Germany and France."
"Actuarial assumptions generally determine benefit obli-
gations under defined benefit plans."
"The actuarial calcula-
tions require the use of estimates."
"The main factors used 
in the actuarial calculations affecting the level of the bene- 
fit obligations are: assumptions on life expectancy, the 
discount rate and future salary and benefit levels."
"Under 
Fresenius Group’s funded plans, assets are set aside to 
meet future payment obligations."
"An estimated return on 
the plan assets is recognized as income in the respective 
period."
"Actuarial gains and losses are generated when 
there are variations in the actuarial assumptions and by dif-
ferences between the actual and the estimated projected  
benefit obligations and the return on plan assets for that 
year."
"A company’s pension liability is impacted by these 
actuarial gains or losses."
"Related to defined benefit plans, the Fresenius Group is 
exposed to certain risks."
"Besides general actuarial risks, e.g."
"the longevity risk and the interest rate risk, the Fresenius 
Group is exposed to market risk as well as to investment risk."
"In the case of Fresenius Group’s funded plans, the de-
fined benefit obligation is offset against the fair value of 
plan assets (deficit or surplus)."
"A pension liability is recog-
nized in the consolidated statement of financial position if 
the defined benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan 
assets."
"Under defined contribution plans, the Fresenius Group 
pays defined contributions to an independent third party as 
directed by the employee during the employee’s service life 
which satisfies all obligations of the Fresenius Group to the 
employee."
"The employee retains all rights to the contribu-
tions made by the employee and to the vested portion of 
the Fresenius Group paid contributions upon leaving the 
Fresenius Group."
"DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS 
At December 31, 2023, the defined benefit obligation (DBO) 
of the Fresenius Group of €924 million (2022: €1,558 mil-
lion) included €241 million (2022: €473 million) funded by 
plan assets and €683 million (2022: €1,085 million) cov-
ered by pension liabilities."
"Furthermore, the pension liability of the prior year con-
tained benefit obligations offered by other subsidiaries of 
Fresenius Medical Care in an amount of €45 million."
"The current portion of the pension liability in an amount 
of €18 million (2022: €31 million) is recognized in the con-
solidated statement of financial position within short­term 
provisions and other short­term liabilities."
"The non­current 
portion of €666 million (2022: €1,099 million) is recorded 
as pension liability."
"The decrease of the discount rate from 
4.3% to 3.6% led to an increase of the long-term pension 
liabilities of €82 million, which was offset by the deconsoli-
dation of Fresenius Medical Care and the classification of 
the Eugin group as disposal group."
"Therefore, in total, the 
long-term pension liabilities decreased by €433 million."
"The 
discount rate was applied for the German ""Versorgungs- 
ordnung der Fresenius-Unternehmen"", which accounts for 
the substantial portion of the pension liabilities at approxi-
mately 75% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively."
The major part of pension liabilities relates to Germany.
"42% of the beneficiaries were 
located in Germany, 33% in North America and the remain-
der throughout the rest of Europe and other continents."
"75% of the pension liabilities in an amount of €683 mil-
lion relate to the ‘‘Versorgungsordnung der Fresenius­ 
Unternehmen’’ established in 2016 (Pension Plan 2016) 
and to commitments to the Management Board."
"The Pen-
sion Plan 2016 applied for most of the German entities of 
the Fresenius Group for entries up until December 31, 2019 
except Fresenius Helios and Fresenius Vamed."
"For new 
entrants from January 1, 2020 onwards, a new defined 
contribution plan applies for these entities."
"The remaining 
pension liabilities relate to individual plans from Fresenius 
Helios entities in Germany and non­German Group entities."
"Plan benefits are generally based on an employee’s 
years of service and final salary."
"Consistent with predomi-
nant practice in Germany, the benefit obligations of the 
German entities of the Fresenius Group are unfunded."
"The 
German Pension Plan 2016 does not have a separate pen-
sion asset."
"Fresenius Group’s benefit obligations relating to fully 
or partly funded pension plans were €237 million."
"Benefit 
obligations relating to unfunded pension plans were €687 
million."
"The following table shows the changes in benefit obliga-
tions, the changes in plan assets, the deficit or surplus of 
the pension plans and the pension liability."
"Benefits paid as  
shown in the changes in benefit obligations represent pay-
ments made from both the funded and unfunded plans 
while the benefits paid as shown in the changes in plan  
assets include only benefit payments from Fresenius Group’s 
funded benefit plans."

"The plan assets are neither invested in the Fresenius 
Group nor in related parties of the Fresenius Group."
"Furthermore, for the years 2023 and 2022, 
there were no effects from asset ceiling."
"The discount rates for all plans are based upon yields of 
portfolios of highly rated debt instruments with maturities 
that mirror the plan’s benefit obligation."
"Fresenius Group’s 
discount rate is the weighted average of these plans based 
upon their benefit obligations."
"Mainly changes in the discount factor, as well as in- 
flation and mortality assumptions used for the actuarial 
computation resulted in actuarial losses in 2023 which  
increased the fair value of the defined benefit obligation."
"The actuarial losses of Fresenius Medical Care were re-
classified to retained earnings as part of the deconsolida-
tion in the amount of €57 million."
"The sensitivity analysis was calculated based on the 
average duration of the pension obligations determined at 
December 31, 2023."
"The calculations were performed iso-
lated for each significant actuarial parameter, in order to 
show the effect on the fair value of the pension liability 
separately."
"The allocation depends upon the area in which 
the beneficiary is employed."
"2 This category mainly comprises diversified equity portfolios (including Swiss equities, global hedged equities, global equities and emerging market equities)."
3 This category primarily represents investment grade bonds and high-yield bonds.
"4 This category is mainly comprised of obligations in Swiss francs and other foreign currencies, most of which are managed passively."
"5 This category mainly includes cash, money market funds and mortgages."
"The methods and inputs used to measure the fair value of 
plan assets are as follows: 
Index funds are valued based on market quotes."
"Other equity investments are valued at their market 
prices as of the date of the statement of financial position."
"Government bonds are valued based on both market prices 
(Level 1) and market quotes (Level 2)."
"Corporate bonds and other bonds are valued based on 
market quotes as of the date of the statement of financial 
position."
"Cash is stated at nominal value which equals the fair 
value."
Money market funds are valued at their market prices.
"DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS 
Fresenius Group’s total expense under defined contribution 
plans for 2023 was €152 million (2022: €148 million)."
"Of 
this amount, €116 million related to contributions by the 
Fresenius Group to several public supplementary pension 
funds for employees of Fresenius Helios."
"This includes €27 
million for contributions related to financing the deficit of 
past service costs."
"Given that employees from multiple participating 
entities are insured by these ZVK ÖDs, these plans are con-
sidered Multi-Employer plans."
"ZVK ÖDs are defined benefit plans according to IAS 19 
since employees are entitled to the statutory benefits regard-
less of the amounts contributed."
"There-
fore, the obligation is accounted for as defined contribu-
tion plan in accordance with IAS 19.34a."
"The contributions 
are collected as part of a pay-as-you-go system and are 
based upon applying a fixed rate to given parts of the  
employees’ gross remuneration."
"Paid contributions are accounted for as personnel ex-
penses within costs of revenue, selling expenses as well 
as general and administrative expenses and amounted  
to €116 million in 2023 (2022: €114 million)."
"Thereof,  
€67 million (2022: €66 million) were payments to Rheinische 
Zusatzversorgungskasse, to Versorgungsanstalt des Bundes 
und der Länder and to Zusatzversorgungskasse Baden-
Württemberg (supplementary pension funds)."
"The Group 
expects to contribute in 2023 €126 million (including pay-
ments relating to past service costs)."

by €142 million in connection with the capital increase of 
the subscribed capital."
"The accrued expenses in an amount 
of €0.8 million were charged against the capital reserves."
"OTHER RESERVES 
Other reserves are comprised of earnings generated by 
Group entities in prior years to the extent that they have 
not been distributed."
"DIVIDENDS 
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the 
amount of dividends available for distribution to sharehold-
ers is based upon the unconsolidated retained earnings  
of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA as reported in its statement of 
financial position determined in accordance with the Ger-
man Commercial Code (HGB)."
"KGaA 
to distribute a dividend for fiscal year 2023."
"In May 2023, a dividend of €0.92 per bearer ordinary 
share was approved by Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA’s share-
holders at the Annual General Meeting and paid afterwards."
The total dividend payment was €518 million.
"Thereby, the 
Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung was paid the dividend which 
it is entitled to as a shareholder in the ordinary share capital 
of Fresenius SE & Co."
"In 2022, the shareholders had the opportunity to ex-
change a portion of the dividend (Dividend Option Portion) 
for Fresenius SE & Co."
"In June 2022, €147 
million in dividend entitlements for new shares were dis-
tributed from authorized capital and therefore not substi-
tuted for cash."
"The remaining portion of the dividend in 
the amount of €367 million was paid in cash in June 2022."
"Thereby, the Else Kröner-Fresenius-Stiftung was paid the 
dividend which it is entitled to as a shareholder in the ordi-
nary share capital of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA in both, pro 
rata, shares and in cash."
"COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
As of December 31, 2023, future investment commitments 
existed in respect to acquired hospitals, which are projected 
to amount up to €7 million which relate to the year 2024."
"As of December 31, 2022, future investment commit-
ments existed in respect to acquired hospitals, which are 
projected to amount up to €54 million until 2024."
"Thereof 
€27 million relate to the year 2023."
"In addition to the contractual obligations mentioned 
above, there are other purchase obligations for services and 
materials that are used in the normal course of business."
"LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS 
The Fresenius Group is routinely involved in claims, law-
suits, regulatory and tax audits, investigations and other 
legal matters arising, for the most part, in the ordinary 
course of its business of providing healthcare services and 
products."
"The Fresenius Group records its litigation reserves 
for certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters to the 
extent that the Fresenius Group determines an unfavorable  
outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reason-
ably estimated."
"For the other matters, the Fresenius Group 
believes that the loss is not probable and / or the loss or 
range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated 
at this time."
"The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is of-
ten difficult to predict accurately and outcomes that are 
not consistent with Fresenius Group’s view of the merits 
can occur."
"The Fresenius Group believes that it has valid 
defenses to the legal matters pending against it and is  
defending itself vigorously."
"Nevertheless, it is possible that 
the resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently 
pending or threatened could have a material adverse effect 
on its business, results of operations and financial condition."
"General risks 
From time to time, the Fresenius Group is a party to or may 
be threatened with other litigation or arbitration, claims or 
assessments arising in the ordinary course of its business."
"Management regularly analyzes current information in-
cluding, as applicable, the Fresenius Group’s defenses and 
insurance coverage and, as necessary, provides accruals 
for probable liabilities for the eventual disposition of these 
matters."
"The Fresenius Group, like other healthcare providers and 
suppliers, conducts its operations under intense govern-
ment regulation and scrutiny."
"In case of non-compliance, the 
Fresenius Group could be subject to significant adverse 
regulatory actions by the competent supervisory authori-
ties."
"These regulatory actions could include warning letters 
or other enforcement notices from health authorities which 
may require the Fresenius Group to expend significant 
time and resources in order to implement appropriate cor-
rective actions."
"The Fresenius Group 
may not always be aware that an inquiry or action has  
begun, particularly in the case of whistleblower actions, 
which are initially filed under court seal."
"The Fresenius Group operates many facilities and han-
dles the personal data of its patients and beneficiaries 
throughout many parts of the world, and engages with 
other business associates to help it carry out its healthcare 
activities."
"In such a widespread, global system, it is often 
difficult to maintain the desired level of oversight and con-
trol over the thousands of individuals employed by many 
affiliated companies and its business associates."
"On 
those occasions, the Fresenius Group must comply with 
applicable breach notification requirements."
"The Fresenius Group relies upon its management struc-
ture, regulatory and legal resources, and the effective oper-
ation of its compliance program to direct, manage and 
monitor the activities of its employees."
"On occasion, the 
Fresenius Group may identify instances where employees 
or other agents recklessly or inadvertently contravene inter-
nal policies or violate legal regulations."
"Such conduct by 
employees can lead to liability on the part of the Fresenius 
Group or its subsidiaries."
"Physicians, hospitals and other participants in the 
healthcare industry are also subject to a large number of 
lawsuits alleging professional negligence, malpractice, 
product liability, worker’s compensation or related claims, 
many of which involve large claims and significant defense 
costs."
"The Fresenius Group has been and is currently sub-
ject to these suits due to the nature of its business and ex-
pects that those types of lawsuits may continue."
"Although 
the Fresenius Group maintains insurance at a level which it 
believes to be prudent, it cannot assure that the coverage  
limits will be adequate or that insurance will cover all as-
serted claims."
"A successful claim against the Fresenius 
Group or one of its subsidiaries in excess of insurance cov-
erage could have a material adverse effect upon it and the 
results of its operations."
"Any claims, regardless of their merit 
or eventual outcome, could have a material adverse effect on 
the Fresenius Group’s reputation and business."
"The Fresenius Group has also had claims asserted 
against it and has had lawsuits filed against it relating  
to alleged patent infringements or businesses that it has 
acquired or divested."
"These claims and suits relate both to 
operation of the businesses and to the acquisition and divest-
iture transactions."
"The Fresenius Group has, when appropri-
ate, asserted its own claims, and claims for indemnification."
"A successful claim against the Fresenius Group or any of its 
subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect upon its 
business, financial condition, and the results of its opera-
tions."
"Any claims, regardless of their merit or eventual out-
come, could have a material adverse effect on the Fresenius 
Group’s reputation and business."
"LEASES 
The Fresenius Group leases land, buildings and improve-
ments, machinery and equipment, as well as IT- and office 
equipment under various lease agreements."
"Costs of 
revenue, selling, general and administrative and research 
and development expenses comprise depreciation expense 
and impairments of €239 million (2022: €231 million  
(restated for Fresenius Medical Care)) depending upon 
the area in which the asset is used."
"As of December 31, 2023, lease liabilities comprised a 
current portion of €206 million (2022: €851 million) and a 
non-current portion of €1,792 million (2022: €5,741 million)."
"In 2023, approximately 59% of the lease liabilities related to 
Fresenius Helios, approximately 25% to Fresenius Vamed 
and approximately 16% to Fresenius Kabi."
"LEASES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT 
OF CASH FLOWS 
Total cash outflows from leases were €343 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2023 (2022: €325 million)."
"In the consolidated statement of cash flows, the interest 
component of recognized leases is shown in net cash pro-
vided by / used in operating activities, the amortization com-
ponent is shown in net cash provided by / used in financing 
activities."
"The major part of the potential future cash outflows 
resulting from extension options relates to real estate lease 
agreements, primarily for rehabilitation clinics of Fresenius 
Vamed in Switzerland."
"Individual lease agreements include 
multiple extension options."
"The Fresenius Group uses  
extension options to obtain a high degree of flexibility in 
performing its business."
"These extension options held are 
exercisable solely by the Fresenius Group."
2 The option to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income has been exercised.
"The option has  
been used for €16 million other investments (included in other financial assets)."
3 Other financial assets are included in the item other current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
"4 Other financial liabilities are included in the items short-term provisions and other short-term liabilities and long-term provisions and  
other long-term liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position."
"In fiscal year 2023, reclassifications between the categories were immaterial."
2 The option to measure equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income has been exercised.
"The option has  
been used for €88 million (included in other financial assets)."
3 Other financial assets are included in the item other current and non-current assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.
"4 Other financial liabilities are included in the items short-term provisions and other short-term liabilities and long-term provisions and  
other long-term liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position."
"In fiscal year 2022, no reclassifications between the categories occurred."
"The fair value of these assets, which are quoted in 
an active market, is based on price quotations at the date of 
the consolidated financial statements (Level 1)."
"Trade accounts receivable from factoring contracts are 
measured on the basis of observable market information 
(Level 2)."
"The majority of debt instruments included in other financial 
assets in 2022 are bonds that are quoted in an active mar-
ket and therefore measured at fair value (Level 1) which is 
based on price quotations at the date of the consolidated 
financial statements."
"At initial recog-
nition, the Fresenius Group elected, on an instrument-by-
instrument basis, to represent subsequent changes in the 
fair value of individual strategic investments in other com-
prehensive income (loss)."
"All equity investments for which 
changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive 
income (loss) relate to purchases of publicly traded shares 
or percentage ownership of companies in the health sci-
ences or adjacent fields and are made up of individually 
non-significant investments."
"At December 31, 2023, the 
Fresenius Group held 57 non-listed equity investments 
(December 31, 2022: 70) with a fair value of €16 million 
(December 31, 2022: €88 million)."
"In 2023, the Fresenius 
Group recognized dividends of €1 million (2022: €4 mil-
lion) from these equity investments."
"During 2023, due to the deconsolidation of Fresenius 
Medical Care, gains of €3 million were reclassified from 
other comprehensive income to retained earnings."
"(Fresenius Medical Care’s equity method investee) as well as 
a disposal of an investment."
"Of this amount, €22 million was 
attributable to the shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"The fair values of equity investments are based on ob-
servable market information (Level 2)."
"In addition, other 
equity investments and other financial assets are classified 
as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy."
"A discounted cash 
flow model is used for the valuation of these equity invest-
ments."
"The valuation models used to determine the fair 
value of rental deposit payments that are dependent on the 
proceeds from realization take into account the present 
value of the payments made, which are discounted using a 
risk-adjusted discount rate."
"The fair values of major long-term financial instruments 
are calculated on the basis of market information."
"Liabilities 
for which market quotes are available are measured with the 
market quotes at the reporting date (Level 1)."
"The fair values 
of the other long-term financial liabilities are calculated at 
the present value of respective future cash flows."
"To deter-
mine these present values, the prevailing interest rates and 
credit spreads for the Fresenius Group as of the date of the 
statement of financial position are used (Level 2)."
"The valuation of the put option liabilities is determined  
using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)."
"The method 
for calculating the fair value is described in note 1."
"r, 
Financial instruments."
"For the purpose of analyzing the 
impact of changes in unobservable inputs on the fair value 
measurement of put option liabilities, the Fresenius Group 
assumes an increase on earnings of 10% compared to the 
actual estimation as of the balance sheet date."
"The corre-
sponding increase in fair value of €50 million is then com-
pared to the total liabilities and the shareholder’s equity of 
the Fresenius Group."
"This analysis shows that an increase 
of 10% in the relevant earnings would have an effect of 
less than 1% on the total liabilities and on the shareholder’s 
equity of the Fresenius Group."
"At December 31, 2023, 
93% of the put option liabilities related to Fresenius Kabi 
(December 31, 2022: 23% (before deconsolidation of 
Fresenius Medical Care))."
"Contingent payments outstanding for acquisitions are 
recognized at their fair value."
"The estimation of the individ-
ual fair values is based on the key inputs of the arrangement 
that determine the future contingent payment as well as the 
Fresenius Group’s expectation of these factors (Level 3)."
"The Fresenius Group assesses the likelihood and timing of 
achieving the relevant objectives."
"The underlying assump-
tions are reviewed regularly."
"To determine 
the fair value of the cross currency swap, the contracted 
future cash flows are also compared with the expected  
future cash flows based on the market data prevailing on 
the measurement date."
"The corresponding results are then 
discounted on the basis of the market interest rates prevail-
ing at the date of the statement of financial position for the 
respective currency."
"Fresenius Group’s own credit risk is incorporated in the fair 
value estimation of derivatives that are liabilities."
"Counter-
party credit risk adjustments are factored into the valuation 
of derivatives that are assets."
"The Fresenius Group moni-
tors and analyzes the credit risk from derivative financial 
instruments on a regular basis."
"For the valuation of deriva-
tive financial instruments, the credit risk is considered in 
the fair value of every individual instrument."
"The basis for 
the default probability are Credit Default Swap Spreads of 
each counterparty appropriate for the duration."
"The calcu-
lation of the credit risk considered in the valuation is done 
by multiplying the default probability appropriate for the 
duration with the expected discounted cash flows of the 
derivative financial instrument."
"Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments com-
prise derivatives embedded in convertible bonds and call 
options which have been purchased to hedge the convertible 
bonds."
"The fair value of the embedded derivatives is calcu-
lated using the difference between the market value of the 
particular convertible bonds and the market value of an ade-
quate straight bond discounted with the market interest rates 
as of the reporting date."
"The fair value of the call options is 
calculated from price quotations."
"Therefore, these are classified as Level 2 in 
accordance with the defined fair value hierarchy levels."
"Derivative financial instruments are marked to market 
each reporting period, resulting in carrying amounts equal 
to fair values at the reporting date."
"Transfers of financial assets 
In 2022, the Fresenius Group entered into two factoring 
agreements for the sale of receivables from the provision of 
health care services with a volume of €440 million."
"In 2023, 
the Fresenius Group entered into two new tranches with a 
volume of €257 million under the existing agreements."
"The assessment of the risks arising from the receivables 
sold is based on the credit risk (default risk) and the risk of 
late payment (late payment risk)."
"The credit risk is trans-
ferred in full to the buyers."
"The late payment risk remains 
fully with the Fresenius Group."
"Substantially all of the risks 
and rewards associated with the receivables sold have nei-
ther been transferred nor retained (allocation of signifi-
cant risks and rewards between the Fresenius Group and 
the buyers)."
"The Fresenius Group continues to account for the receiv-
ables transferred at the amount of its continuing involve-
ment, i.e."
"the maximum amount for which it remains liable 
for the late payment risk inherent in the receivables sold, 
and recognizes a corresponding associated liability reported 
as liabilities to credit institutions."
"The carrying amount of 
the continuing involvement from the receivables sold as of 
the reporting date is €27 million."
"The carrying amount of the 
associated liability is €45 million and the fair value of the  
associated liability expensed is €18 million."
"The Fresenius 
Group continues to perform collection (servicing) for the 
transferred receivables without being remunerated for this 
service."
"Since existing structures within the Fresenius Group 
are used for this service and the expense attributable to 
the program is immaterial, no separate servicing liability 
was recognized."
"In addition, the Fresenius Group has other programs for 
the sale of trade accounts receivable and receivables from 
the provision of health care services under which substan-
tially all risks and rewards are transferred to the buyers of 
the receivables."
"The non-current portions indicated as assets or liabili-
ties are recognized in other non-current assets or in long-
term provisions and other long-term liabilities, respectively."
"The derivatives embedded in the convertible bonds and the 
call options to secure the convertible bonds are recognized 
in other current and non-current liabilities / assets in the 
consolidated statement of financial position."
"To reduce the credit risk arising from derivatives, the 
Fresenius Group concluded master netting agreements 
with banks."
"Through such agreements, positive and nega-
tive fair values of the derivative contracts could be offset 
against one another if a partner becomes insolvent."
"This 
offsetting is valid for transactions where the aggregate 
amount of obligations owed to and receivable from are not 
equal."
"If insolvency occurs, the party which owes the larger 
amount is obliged to pay the other party the difference  
between the amounts owed in the form of one net payment."
"These master netting agreements do not provide a basis for 
offsetting the fair values of derivative financial instruments 
in the consolidated statement of financial position as the 
offsetting criteria under International Financial Reporting 
Standards are not satisfied."
"At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the 
Fresenius Group had €39 million and €50 million of deriva-
tive financial assets subject to netting arrangements and 
€14 million and €28 million of derivative financial liabilities 
subject to netting arrangements."
"Offsetting these derivative 
financial instruments would have resulted in net assets  
of €32 million and €37 million as well as net liabilities of 
€7 million and €15 million at December 31, 2023 and  
December 31, 2022, respectively."
"In 2023, interest income of 
€118 million resulted mainly from interest income on receiv-
ables and from discounting effects."
"In 2022, interest income 
of €130 million resulted mainly from interest income related 
to the release of interest accruals on tax positions, from 
discounting effects as well as from accrued contingent 
payments outstanding for acquisitions."
"Moreover, €61 million related to lease liabilities."
"Interest 
expense of €345 million in 2022 resulted mainly from 
Fresenius Group’s financial liabilities, which are recog-
nized at amortized cost."
"Moreover, €52 million related  
to lease liabilities."
"Income of €29 million (2022: 
none) resulted from the valuation of accrued contingent 
payments outstanding for acquisitions."
"In 2023, income of 
€29 million (2022: €24 million) resulted from operating 
leases."
"Income and expense from financial instruments recorded 
in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives 
in cash flow hedging relationships and to equity investments 
and debt instruments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income."
Gains are shown with a negative sign and losses with a positive sign.
"Changes of the fair value of de-
rivative financial instruments that are designated as cash 
flow hedges are recorded and accumulated within other 
comprehensive income (loss)."
"The effective portion of changes in fair value of the spot 
element of the hedging instruments is accumulated in a 
cash flow hedge reserve within other comprehensive in-
come (loss)."
"The forward points of the foreign exchange 
forward contract is accounted for as costs of hedging re-
serve within other comprehensive income (loss)."
"For cash flow hedges of for-
eign currency risk associated with forecasted purchases of 
non-financial assets, the amounts accumulated in the cash 
flow hedge reserve are instead included directly in the  
initial cost of the asset when it is recognized."
"The same 
approach applies to the amounts accumulated in the costs 
of hedging reserve."
"MARKET RISK 
The Fresenius Group is exposed to effects related to for-
eign exchange fluctuations in connection with its interna-
tional business activities that are denominated in various 
currencies."
"In order to finance its business operations, the 
Fresenius Group issues bonds and commercial papers and 
enters into long-term credit agreements and Schuldschein 
Loans with banks."
"Due to these financing activities, the 
Fresenius Group is exposed to interest risk caused by 
changes in variable interest rates and the risk of changes  
in the fair value of statement of financial position items 
bearing fixed interest rates."
"In order to manage the risk of interest rate and foreign  
exchange rate fluctuations, the Fresenius Group enters into 
certain hedging transactions with financial institutions within 
the limits approved by the Management Board, which are 
set depending on the counterparty’s rating."
"The counter-
parties generally have an investment grade rating."
"Deriva-
tive financial instruments are not entered into for trading 
purposes."
"In general, the Fresenius Group conducts its derivative 
financial instrument activities under the control of a single 
centralized department."
"The Fresenius Group has estab-
lished guidelines derived from best practice standards in 
the banking industry for risk assessment procedures and 
supervision concerning the use of financial derivatives."
"These guidelines require amongst other things a clear seg-
regation of duties in the areas of execution, administration, 
accounting and controlling."
"Risk limits are continuously 
monitored and, where appropriate, the use of hedging  
instruments is adjusted to that extent."
"The Fresenius Group defines benchmarks for individual 
exposures in order to quantify interest and foreign exchange 
risks."
"The benchmarks are derived from achievable and sus-
tainable market rates."
"Depending on the individual bench-
marks, hedging strategies are determined and implemented."
"The Fresenius Group makes sure there is an economic 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging in-
strument and ensures reasonable hedge ratios of the desig-
nated hedged items with interest and currency risks."
"This is 
achieved by matching to a large extent the critical terms of 
the interest and foreign exchange derivatives with the criti-
cal terms of the underlying exposures."
"Therefore, the earn-
ings of the Fresenius Group were not materially affected by  
hedge ineffectiveness in the reporting period."
"In principle, 
sources of inefficiency are risk of credit default and time 
lags of underlying exposures."
"Foreign exchange risk management 
The Fresenius Group has determined the euro as its finan-
cial reporting currency."
"Besides translation risks, foreign exchange transaction 
risks exist."
"These mainly relate to transactions denominated 
in foreign currencies, such as purchases and sales, projects 
and services as well as intragroup sales of products to other 
Fresenius Group entities in different currency areas."
"There-
fore, the subsidiaries are affected by changes of foreign 
exchange rates between the invoicing currencies and the 
local currencies in which they conduct their businesses."
"Solely for the purpose of hedging existing and foreseeable 
foreign exchange transaction exposures, the Fresenius 
Group applies appropriate financial instruments."
"In connection with the issuance of the CHF bond and 
the resulting cash-effective foreign exchange risks, the for-
eign exchange risks were hedged by concluding a cross 
currency swap simultaneously."
"As of December 31, 2023, 
the notional volume of the cross currency swap was CHF275 
million (€297 million), its fair value amounted to €8 million 
with a remaining term to maturity of 58 months."
"For loans in foreign currencies, the Fresenius Group enters 
into foreign exchange swap contracts."
"The Fresenius Group 
solely designates the spot element of the foreign exchange 
forward contract as hedging instrument in cash flow hedges 
and uses a hedge ratio for designated risks of 1 : 1."
"The fair 
value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash 
flow hedges used to hedge operating transaction risks was 
-€1 million (December 31, 2022: €18 million) and in rela-
tion with loans in foreign currencies €1 million (Decem-
ber 31, 2022: -€7 million)."
"As of December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of for-
eign exchange contracts totaled €2,121 million (Decem-
ber 31, 2022: €4,420 million)."
"Thereof €2,080 million  
(December 31, 2022: €4,120 million) were due in less than 
12 months."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Fresenius Group 
was party to foreign exchange contracts with a maximum 
remaining term to maturity of 58 months."
"The Fresenius 
Group uses a Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) model in order to 
estimate and quantify such transaction risks from foreign 
currencies."
"The basis for the analysis of the currency risks 
are the foreign currency cash flows that are reasonably 
expected to arise within the following 12 months, less any 
hedges."
"Under the CFaR approach, the potential currency 
fluctuations of these net exposures are shown as probabil-
ity distributions based on historical volatilities and correla-
tions, using the values of the last 50 exchange rates with an 
interval of 21 trading days."
"The calculation is made assum-
ing a confidence level of 95% and a holding period of up 
to one year."
"the overall portfolio’s risk exposure is generally less than 
the sum total of the underlying individual risks."
"As of De-
cember 31, 2023, the Fresenius Group’s cash flow at risk 
amounted to €25 million based on a net exposure of €752 
million."
"This means, with a probability of 95%, a potential 
loss in relation to the forecasted foreign exchange cash flows 
of the next 12 months will be not higher than €25 million."
"The following table shows the average hedging rates 
and nominal amounts of foreign exchange contracts for

Interest rate risk management 
Fresenius Group’s interest rate risks mainly arise from 
money market and capital market transactions of the 
Group for financing its business activities."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Fresenius Group had 
not entered into any interest rate derivatives."
"For this particular part of its 
liabilities, the Fresenius Group assumes an increase in the 
reference rates of 0.5% compared to the actual rates as  
of the date of the statement of financial position."
"The cor-
responding additional annual interest expense is then com-
pared to the net income attributable to shareholders of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"This analysis shows that an in-
crease of 0.5% in the relevant reference rates would have an 
effect of approximately 1.1% on the consolidated net income 
attributable to shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA 
and an effect of less than 0.1% on Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA 
shareholders’ equity."
"CREDIT RISK 
The Fresenius Group is exposed to potential losses regard-
ing financial instruments in the event of non-performance 
by counterparties."
"With respect to derivative financial instru-
ments, it is not expected that any counterparty will fail to 
meet its obligations as the counterparties are highly rated 
financial institutions (generally investment grade)."
"The maximum credit exposure of derivatives is represented 
by the fair value of those contracts with a positive fair value 
amounting to €34 million (December 31, 2022: €58 million) 
for foreign exchange derivatives."
"The maximum credit risk 
resulting from the use of non-derivative financial instruments 
is defined as the total amount of all receivables."
"In order to 
control this credit risk, the Management of the Fresenius

"LIQUIDITY RISK 
The liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a company is 
potentially unable to meet its financial obligations."
"The 
Management of the Fresenius Group manages the liquidity 
of the Group by means of effective working capital and 
cash management as well as an anticipatory evaluation of 
refinancing alternatives."
"The Management of the Fresenius 
Group believes that existing credit facilities as well as the 
cash generated by operating activities and additional short-
term and long-term borrowings are sufficient to meet the 
company’s foreseeable demand for liquidity (see note 24, 
Debt)."
"INFORMATION ON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 
The Fresenius Group has a solid financial profile."
"Capital 
management includes both equity and debt."
"Principal ob-
jectives of Fresenius Group’s capital management are to 
ensure financial flexibility, to limit refinancing risks and  
to optimize the weighted average cost of capital."
"Further,  
it is sought to achieve a balanced mix of equity and debt."
"Due to the company’s diversification within the health 
care sector and the strong market positions of the busi-
ness segments in global, growing and non-cyclical markets, 
predictable and sustainable cash flows are generated."
"They  
allow a reasonable proportion of debt."
"Moreover, Fresenius 
Group’s customers are generally of high credit quality."
"Measures to strengthen the equity base may also  
be considered in exceptional cases to ensure long-term 
growth."
"KGaA is not subject to any capital 
requirements provided for in its articles of association."
"KGaA has obligations to issue shares 
out of the Conditional Capital relating to the exercise of

"NOTES ON THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The key figures used by the Management Board to assess 
segment performance, have been selected in such a way 
that they include all items of income and expenses which 
fall under the area of responsibility of the business seg-
ments."
"The Management Board is convinced that the most 
suitable performance indicator is the operating income 
(EBIT)."
"The Management Board believes that, in addition 
to the operating income, the figure for earnings before inter-
est, taxes and depreciation / amortization (EBITDA) can also 
help investors to assess the ability of the Fresenius Group to 
generate cash flows and to meet its financial obligations."
"Depreciation and amortization is presented for property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets with definite use-
ful lives of the respective business segment."
"Net interest is comprised of interest expenses and inter-
est income."
"Net income attributable to shareholders of Fresenius

and noncontrolling interests."
"The operating cash flow is the cash provided by / used 
in operating activities."
"The cash flow before acquisitions and dividends is the 
operating cash flow less net capital expenditure."
"Other operating liabilities include the sum of short-term 
and long-term liabilities, less debt and less liabilities for 
deferred taxes."

share-based compensation plans in place 
As of December 31, 2023, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA had 
three share-based compensation plans in place: the 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA Long Term Incentive Program 
2013 (LTIP 2013) which is based on stock options and 
phantom stocks, the Long Term Incentive Plan 2018  
(LTIP 2018) which is based on performance shares and  
the Fresenius Performance Plan 2023 --
- 2026 (LTIP 2023) 
which is based on stock awards."
"Currently, solely LTIP 
2023 can be used to grant stock awards."
"Fresenius Performance Plan 2023 --
- 2026 (LTIP 2023) 
On December 1, 2022 and March 16, 2023, respectively, 
the Management Board and Supervisory Board of the 
general partner, Fresenius Management SE, resolved the 
Fresenius Performance Plan 2023 --
- 2026 (LTIP 2023)."
"LTIP 2023 is based solely on cash-settled virtual shares 
in Fresenius SE & Co."
"The stock awards 
issued under the plan are cash-settled virtual payment in-
struments not backed by equity."
"They grant an entitlement to 
a cash payment by Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA or an affiliated 
company if the performance targets are achieved and the 
other conditions are met."
"The members of the Management Board of Fresenius 
Management SE (Management Board Plan Participants) 
and selected executives (Executive Plan Participants) are 
eligible to participate."
"Stock awards will be granted once a 
year over a period of four years."
"For Management Board 
Plan Participants the grant is made by the Supervisory 
Board of the general partner, Fresenius Management SE, 
the grant to the Executive Plan Participants by the Manage-
ment Board of Fresenius Management SE, in each case  
on the basis of a fixed grant value."
"At the end of each fiscal year, the an-
nual target achievement for each performance target is cal-
culated and fixed (lock-in)."
"At the end of the performance 
period, the target achievement of the individual performance 
targets is calculated by taking the average of the four annual 
target achievements."
"The annual target achievements of a 
performance target are equally weighted at 25% each."
"The result-
ing amount is paid out to the respective plan participant in 
cash."
"The potential payout entitlement of the plan partici-
pants is limited to a maximum of 250% of the grant value."
"Vesting is also conditional on the absence of a compliance 
breach and an active and non-terminated service or em-
ployment relationship."
"In the event of a compliance breach, the Supervisory 
Board of Fresenius Management SE is entitled to reduce 
the number of stock awards granted to a member of the 
Management Board down to zero at its reasonable discre-
tion."
"For the remaining plan participants, the Management 
Board of Fresenius Management SE is entitled to do so."
"Furthermore, within a period of three years from the date 
of payment, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA has a claim for repay-
ment in full or in part if a compliance breach has occurred 
which is not time-barred at the time of the reclaim."
"LTIP 2023 has three differently weighted performance 
targets: relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the 
Fresenius share compared to the STOXX® Europe 600 
Health Care Index (weighting: 50%), Return On Invested 
Capital (ROIC) (weighting: 25%) and ESG targets (weight-
ing: 25%)."
"As part of the ESG targets, the reduction of CO2 
emissions was set as an ESG target for the 2023 grant."
"For 
future grants, the Supervisory Board (for the Management 
Board Plan Participants) and the Management Board (for 
the Executive Plan Participants) may set another ESG tar-
get or several other ESG targets instead of or in addition  
to the ESG target reduction of CO2 emissions."
"For the performance target Total Shareholder Return, 
100% target achievement is given if the TSR of the 
Fresenius share exactly equals the TSR of the STOXX® 
Europe 600 Health Care Index in the relevant fiscal year of 
the performance period (TSR equal performance)."
"If the TSR 
of the Fresenius share falls below the TSR of the STOXX® 
Europe 600 Health Care Index in the relevant fiscal year of 
the performance period by 50 percentage points or more, 
the degree of target achievement is 0% (TSR underperfor-
mance)."
"If the TSR of the Fresenius share exceeds the  
TSR of the STOXX® Europe 600 Health Care Index in the  
relevant fiscal year of the performance period by 50 per-
centage points or more, the degree of target achievement is 
250% (TSR outperformance)."
"A TSR outperformance of 
more than 50 percentage points does not lead to a further 
increase in target achievement."
"For a relative TSR in the range between -50 percentage 
points TSR underperformance and TSR equal performance, 
the target achievement for the fiscal year will be determined 
by linear interpolation between these two key points."
"For a 
relative TSR in the range between TSR equal performance 
and +50 percentage points TSR outperformance, the target 
achievement for the fiscal year is determined by linear in-
terpolation between these two key points."
"Target achieve-
ment is commercially rounded up or down to the second 
decimal place."
"According to the consolidated financial statements, the 
performance target ROIC is calculated as EBIT less taxes 
divided by invested capital."
"ROIC is calculated on the basis 
the Fresenius Group's approved consolidated financial 
statements for the relevant fiscal years, adjusted for poten-
tial acquisition or divestment activities or changes in IFRS 
accounting standards during the performance period."
"The plan ROIC for the fourth year will be taken from 
the mid-term plan for the following year."
"If the actual ROIC falls below the plan 
ROIC for the relevant fiscal year of the performance period 
by 2 percentage points, the target achievement is 50%."
"A 
ROIC target underperformance of more than 2 percentage 
points results in a target achievement of 0%."
"If the actual 
ROIC exceeds the plan ROIC for the relevant fiscal year of 
the performance period by 2 percentage points or more, 
the target achievement is 250%."
"A ROIC target outperfor-
mance of more than 2 percentage points does not lead to 
a further increase in target achievement."
"In the event that the actual ROIC for the relevant fiscal 
year of the performance period falls below the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC), the target achievement for 
the performance target ROIC for this fiscal year is always 
0%, in deviation from the calculations described above."
"For the 2023 grant, 2020 is the base year."
"In 
addition to the planned CO2 reduction, the Supervisory 
Board (for the Management Board Plan Participants) and  
the Management Board (for the Executive Plan Participants) 
shall each set values that lead to a target achievement of 
50% and 250%."
"If the actual CO2 reduction is less than the 
value of the CO2 emissions in the base year specified for the 
target achievement of 50%, the target achievement is 0%."
"An actual CO2 reduction that exceeds the value of the 
CO2 emissions of the base year determined for the target 
achievement of 250% does not lead to a further increase 
in the target achievement."
"In such a case, the tar-
get achievement for this performance period corresponds 
uniformly to 25% of the total target achievement thus cal-
culated for the performance period."
"LTIP 2018 
On April 12, 2018 and March 15, 2018, respectively, the 
Management Board and Supervisory Board of the general 
partner, Fresenius Management SE, resolved the Long 
Term Incentive Plan 2018 (LTIP 2018)."
"The LTIP 2018 is based solely on virtual stocks (perfor-
mance shares)."
"The performance shares issued through the 
plan are non-equity-backed, virtual compensation instru-
ments."
"When performance targets are reached and other  
prerequisites are met, they guarantee the entitlement to  
a cash payment by Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA or one of its 
affiliated companies."
"The plan is available both for members of the Manage-
ment Board (with the exception of the Chief Executive Of-
ficer of Fresenius Medical Care, who received his compen-
sation from Fresenius Medical Care Management AG) and 
other executives."
"Performance shares may be granted once 
annually over a period of five years."
"The 
grant value is determined in consideration of the personal 
performance and the responsibilities of the concerned plan 
participant."
"The number of performance shares granted is 
calculated through applying the grant value and the aver-
age stock market price of the Fresenius share over the  
period of 60 stock exchange trading days prior to the grant 
date."
"The number of performance shares may change over a 
period of four years, depending on the level of achievement 
of the performance targets described in more detail below."
"This could entail the entire loss of all performance shares 
or also --
- at maximum --
- the doubling of their number."
"The number of vested performance shares is then multiplied 
by the average stock exchange price of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA’s share over a period of 60 stock exchange trading 
days prior to the lapse of this vesting period plus the total 
of the dividends per share of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA paid 
by Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA between the grant date and the 
vesting date."
"The resulting amount will be paid to the respec-
tive plan participant in cash."
"The potential disbursement 
entitlement of each member of the Management Board is 
limited to a maximum value of 250% of the grant value, 
the entitlement of all other plan participants is limited to  
a maximum value of 400%."
"The LTIP 2018 has two equally weighted performance 
targets: firstly, the growth rate of the adjusted consolidated 
net income (adjusted for currency effects) and, secondly, 
the relative Total Shareholder Return based on the STOXX® 
Europe 600 Health Care Index."
"Disbursement entitlement 
requires that at least one of the two performance targets 
must be reached or surpassed over the four-year perfor-
mance period."
"For the performance target ‘‘Net Income Growth Rate’’ 
a level of target achievement of 100% is reached when the 
same is at least 8% over the four-year performance period."
"If the growth rate falls below or corresponds to only 5%, 
the level of target achievement is 0%."
"If the growth rate is 
between 5% and 8%, the level of target achievement is 
between 0% and 100%, while, where the growth rate is 
between 8% and 20%, the level of target achievement will 
be between 100% and 200%."
"Intermediate values are cal-
culated through linear interpolation."
"The net income is the  
consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA reported in the consolidated  
financial statements of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA prepared 
in accordance with IFRS, adjusted for extraordinary effects."
"The determination of the adjusted net income (adjusted 
for currency effects) and the change in comparison with 
the adjusted net income (not adjusted for currency effects) 
of the previous Fresenius Group fiscal year will be verified 
in a binding manner by the auditors of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA on the basis of the audited consolidated financial 
statements."
"For the ‘‘Total Shareholder Return’’ performance target, 
a target achievement of 100% is met when the Total Share-
holder Return of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA in comparison 
with the Total Shareholder Return of the other companies 
of the STOXX® Europe 600 Health Care Index achieves an 
average ranking within the benchmark companies, i."
"exactly in the middle (50th percentile), over the four-year 
performance period."
"If the ranking corresponds to the 
25th percentile or less, the level of target achievement is 
0%."
"Where the ranking is between the 25th percentile  
and the 50th percentile, the level of target achievement is 
between 0% and 100%; and, for a ranking between the 
50th percentile and the 75th percentile, between 100% and 
200%."
"Intermediate values will also be calculated through  
linear interpolation."
"Total Shareholder Return denotes the 
percentage change in the stock market price within the 
performance period including reinvested dividends and all 
capital measures, whereby capital measures are to be cal-
culated through rounding down to the fourth decimal place."
"The ranking values are determined using the composi-
tion of STOXX® Europe 600 Health Care on the grant date."
"A level of target achievement in excess of 200% is not 
possible for both performance targets."
"To calculate the level of overall target achievement, the 
level of target achievement of the two performance targets 
are given equal weighting."
"The total number of performance 
shares vested on each plan participant is calculated through 
multiplying the number of performance shares granted by 
the overall target achievement."
"The performance targets for 
the 2018, the 2019 and the 2020 grant were not achieved."
"Therefore, the performance shares granted in 2018, 2019 
and 2020 forfeited."
"In the event of violation of compliance rules, the Super-
visory Board of Fresenius Management SE, in due exercise 
of its discretion, is entitled to reduce the number of perfor-
mance shares vested on a member of the Management 
Board to zero."
"Regarding all other plan participants, such 
decision is made by the Management Board of Fresenius 
Management SE."
"Furthermore, Fresenius SE & Co."
"Conse-
quently, the short-term variable compensation for fiscal 
year 2023 will not be paid out to the members of the Man-
agement Board."
"The long-term variable compensation of the 
members of the Management Board has also been affected, 
in that the tranche 2023 -- i.e."
"the part relating to the year 
2023 -- must be disregarded in the future payment of the 
grants under the LTIP 2018 and the LTIP 2023, the respec-
tive measurement period of which also includes fiscal year 
2023."
"This therefore affects the annual tranche 2023 of the 
grants 2020 to 2022 under the LTIP 2018 and the grant 
2023 under the LTIP 2023."
"As the overall target achieve-
ment for the grant 2020 is 0% and the grant 2020 will 
therefore not be paid out in total, the statutory restrictions 
do not have any impact."
"LTIP 2013 
The LTIP 2013 is comprised of the Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA 
Stock Option Plan 2013 (SOP 2013) and the Fresenius SE &  
Co."
KGaA Phantom Stock Plan 2013 (PSP 2013).
"It combines 
the granting of stock options with the granting of phantom  
stock awards which entitle the holder to receive cash pay-
ments upon exercising the phantom stock."
"Each of the 
SOP 2013 and PSP 2013 making up the LTIP 2013 have 
been established under a stand-alone legal documentation."
"SOP 2013 
Under the SOP 2013, which was approved by the Annual 
General Meeting of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA on May 17, 
2013, Fresenius Management SE was originally authorized 
to issue up to 8.4 million subscription rights for an amount 
of 8.4 million non-par value ordinary bearer shares of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA and its 
affiliated companies (except for Fresenius Medical Care)."
"In connection with the stock split in 2014, the total vol-
ume of not yet granted subscription rights increased in the 
same proportion as the subscribed capital (factor 3) as far 
as options had not yet been granted under the SOP 2013."
"The same applies to the subsets of the subscription rights 
that are attributable to individual groups of participants."
"For stock options that were granted before the stock split 
2014 came into effect, the entitlement of the participants to 
receive new shares through the exercise of stock options  
increased in the same proportion as the subscribed capital 
(factor 3)."
"The participants are now entitled to receive three 
bearer ordinary shares of Fresenius SE & Co."
"The 
exercise price was reduced proportionally."
"The granting of the options occurred in five annual 
tranches, each to the last Monday in July or the first Mon-
day in December."
"The exercise price of an option equals the volume-
weighted average stock market price (closing price) of the 
non-par value ordinary bearer share of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA in the electronic Xetra trading of Deutsche Börse AG 
in Frankfurt am Main, or a comparable successor system, 
on the last 30 calendar days prior to the respective grant 
date."
"Options granted have an eight-year term but can be ex-
ercised only after a four-year vesting period."
"The exercise 
of options is subject to the condition precedent, in each 
case, that the annual success target within a four-year wait-
ing period is achieved."
"The success target is achieved in 
each case if, after the granting of the options to the respec-
tive entitled person, either (i) the consolidated net income 
attributable to shareholders of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA according to IFRS, adjusted for extraordinary effects 
and on a constant currency basis, during the four years of 
the waiting period amounts to at least 8%."
"In the event that 
the success target within the four-year waiting period is not 
achieved for the individual years or for the compounded 
annual growth rate, the options issued in each case are for-
feited in proportion to the non-achievement of the success 
target within the waiting period, i."
"by one quarter, two 
quarters, three quarters, or completely."
"In the years 2013 
to 2019, the performance targets for stock options granted 
in 2013 to 2016 were met."
"For stock options granted in 2017, 
only one quarter of the performance target was achieved."
"Therefore, in 2020, three quarters of the stock options 
granted in 2017 were forfeited."

2023 under the LTIP 2023."

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF THE GROUP 
MANAGEMENT REPORT  
 
Audit Opinions 
 
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"In  
addition, we have audited the group management report 
of Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA for the financial year from 
1 January to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with Ger-
man legal requirements, we have not audited the content 
of the information contained in the section ""Internal con-
trol system as part of the risk management system"" of the 
group management report, which is labelled as unaudited."
"In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in 
the audit,  
 
► 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of 
German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs."
"In all material respects, this group manage-
ment report is consistent with the consolidated finan-
cial statements, complies with German legal require-
ments and appropriately presents the opportunities 
and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion  
on the group management report does not cover the 
content of the above-mentioned disclosure in the sec-
tion ""Internal control system as part of the risk man-
agement system""."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare 
that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the 
legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial state-
ments and of the group management report in accordance 
with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537 / 2014, 
referred to subsequently as ‘‘EU Audit Regulation’’) in com-
pliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Fi-
nancial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der 
Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] 
(IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in supplementary compliance with the Interna-
tional Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities 
under those requirements, principles and standards are 
further described in the ‘‘Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the 
Group Management Report‘‘ section of our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance 
with the requirements of European law and German com-
mercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our 
other German professional responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with 
Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we de-
clare that we have not provided non-audit services prohib-
ited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We 
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi-
cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinions on the consolidated financial statements and  
on the group management report."
"These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit 
opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opin-
ion on these matters."
"In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit 
were as follows: 
 
I."

"Deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care as of  
30 November 2023 
III."
"VAMED-transformation 
 
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been struc-
tured in each case as follows: 
 
1."
"Audit approach and findings 
3."
"Reference to further information 
Hereinafter we present the key audit matters: 
 
I."
"Recognition and measurement of goodwill 
 
1."
"Goodwill totalling EUR 15,089 million (33.4% of total 
assets or 76.8% of equity) is reported under the bal-
ance sheet item ""Goodwill"" in the company's consoli-
dated financial statements."
"In the 2023 financial year, 
goodwill decreased by EUR 16,401 million, mainly as a 
result of the deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care."
"Goodwill is subjected to an impairment test by the 
company once a year or on an ad hoc basis in order to 
determine a possible need for amortisation."
"The impair-
ment test is carried out at the level of the cash-generat-
ing units to which the respective goodwill, including ad-
ditions in the financial year, is allocated individually or 
as a group."
"As part of the impairment test, the carrying 
amount of the respective cash-generating units, includ-
ing goodwill, is compared with the corresponding re-
coverable amount."
"The recoverable amount is generally 
determined on the basis of the value in use."
"The meas-
urement is regularly based on the present value of fu-
ture cash flows of the respective cash-generating units."
"The present values are determined using discounted 
cash flow models."
"The approved budgets for the next 
three years and projections for years four to ten of  
the respective cash-generating units form the starting 
point, which are then extrapolated using assumptions  
about long-term growth rates."
"Expectations regarding 
future market developments and the effects of changes 
in macroeconomic conditions, including mitigating 
measures, are also taken into account."
"Discounting is 
performed using the weighted average cost of capital 
of the respective cash-generating units."
"No need for im-
pairment was identified as a result of the impairment 
test."
"Against this background and due to the complexity of 
the valuation, this matter was of particular significance 
in the context of our audit."
"As part of our audit, with the support of our internal val-
uation specialists, we reviewed, among other things, 
the methodology used to perform the impairment test, 
including reallocations."
"In doing so, we also assessed 
the admissibility of projections beyond the budget pe-
riod."
"In addition, we reconciled the future cash flows 
used in the calculation with the approved budgets for 
the next three years and with the projections for years 
four to ten of the respective cash-generating units."
"We also 
assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of 
Group functions."
"In order to take account of the existing 
forecast uncertainties, we reviewed the sensitivity anal-
yses prepared by the company for cash-generating units 
with low surplus cover, performed our own sensitivity 
analyses and satisfied ourselves that the required dis-
closures were made in the notes."
"The estimates made by the legal representatives and 
the valuation parameters and assumptions applied are 
in line with our expectations overall and are also within 
what we consider to be reasonable ranges."
"The company's disclosures on the balance sheet item 
""Goodwill"" are contained in section 1."
"a), section 2 and section 20 of the notes to the con-
solidated financial statements."
"Deconsolidation of Fresenius Medical Care as of  
30 November 2023 
 
1."
"On 14 July 2023, an Extraordinary General Meeting  
of Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co."
"KGaA (FMC) ap-
proved the change of legal form to a stock corporation 
with the required majority."
"Following the entry of the 
conversion in the commercial register on 30 November 
2023, the change of legal form became effective."
"As a re-
sult, Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA (FSE) loses control within 
the meaning of IFRS 10 over FMC and the Fresenius 
Medical Care business segment from this date, as 
Fresenius Medical Care Management AG, as a subsidiary 
of FSE, no longer has the rights to manage the business 
of FMC as general partner."
"FSE's shareholding of around 
32% of FMC shares remains unaffected by this and con-
tinues to exist unchanged as at the balance sheet date."
"The change of legal form and the associated loss of 
control is recognised as a notional sale at fair value 
(less costs to sell) in accordance with the provisions of 
IFRS 5."
"As a result of the resolution of the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting, FMC was to be recognised as a disposal 
group and discontinued operation."
"From the time of 
classification as a disposal group, it was recognised at 
the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value de-
termined on the basis of the FMC share price on the re-
porting date (less costs to sell)."
"The disposal group was 
measured for the last time immediately before decon-
solidation."
"This resulted in an impairment loss totalling 
EUR 2.2 billion, of which EUR 0.6 billion is attributable 
to the shareholders of FSE."
"In a further step, FMC was 
deconsolidated."
"This resulted in a deconsolidation loss 
of EUR 0.5 billion, which is mainly attributable to the 
realisation of currency translation losses through profit 
or loss, which were recognised in other comprehensive 
income in previous years."
"Both burdens on earnings are 
recognised in the income statement in the result from 
deconsolidated activities."
"Since 1 December 2023, the continuing sharehold-
ing now conveys significant influence over FMC, which 
is why the investment is included in the consolidated 
financial statements using the proportionate net assets 
in accordance with IAS 28 using the equity method."
"For 
this purpose, in accordance with IAS 28, a fictitious ac-
quisition of the 32% shareholding at the FMC share 
price on the reporting date was to be assumed and a 
purchase price allocation was to be carried out in ac-
cordance with the fair values of the FMC Group's assets 
and liabilities."
"As at the balance sheet date, the FMC 
investment is recognised in the consolidated balance 
sheet at EUR 3.5 billion."
"Due to the complexity of the accounting treatment 
as well as the impairment test and the measurement of 
the assets and liabilities as part of the purchase price 
allocation, this matter was of particular significance for 
our audit."
"As part of our audit, we first analysed the legal imple-
mentation of the change of legal form and the resulting 
loss of control."
"In a next step, we assessed the existence 
of significant influence after completion of the change 
of legal form."
"With regard to the respective valuations, we assessed 
the estimates and the valuation parameters and assump-
tions applied and analysed the calculations made to de-
termine the impairment loss and the deconsolidation."
"Based on this, we assessed the purchase price alloca-
tion underlying the notional acquisition."
"Among other 
things, we assessed the appropriateness of the models 
underlying the valuations as well as the valuation param-
eters and assumptions applied."
"In view of the particular-
ities of determining the fair values in the context of the 
purchase price allocation, we were supported by our val-
uation specialists."
"Finally, we assessed the application of 
the equity method to account for the 32% shareholding, 
including the extrapolation of the value adjustments from 
the purchase price allocation to 31 December 2023."
"We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates 
and assumptions made by the executive directors were 
sufficiently documented and substantiated."

of the organisation and business activities of Fresenius 
VAMED was resolved and largely implemented by the 
balance sheet date."
"Based on a comprehensive analysis, 
the business models, governance and central processes 
of the business segment were subjected to a far-reach-
ing transformation and restructuring."
"The aim of the 
measures is to sustainably improve the profitability of 
the division."
"To this end, the project business is being 
reorganised, particularly in Germany and certain inter-
national markets."
"The service business will be focussed 
on certain European markets and non-core activities 
will be discontinued."
"As a result, numerous balance sheet items, in partic-
ular loans, investments, receivables, inventories and 
contract assets, were revalued."
"In addition, provisions 
were recognised for restructuring measures and for any 
impending losses."
"These measures had a total negative 
impact of EUR 554 million on the consolidated result."
"In our view, this matter was of particular significance 
for our audit, as the recognition and measurement of the 
transformation and restructuring measures is based to a 
large extent on estimates and assumptions made by the 
executive directors."
"As part of our audit, we gained a comprehensive un-
derstanding of the transformation and restructuring 
measures as a whole."
"With the close involvement of our 
divisional auditors, we analysed and assessed the valua-
tions made on the basis of the evidence provided."
"In par-
ticular, we verified the underlying project calculations 
and the respective underlying estimates of project risks, 
which were updated in the course of the transformation."
"With regard to the restructuring provisions recognised, 
we assessed the existence of the recognition criteria 
and the appropriate measurement."
"We also verified the 
connection between the transformation measures and 
the charges to profit or loss recognised in the reporting 
year."
"We were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates 
and assumptions made by the executive directors were 
sufficiently documented and substantiated."
The company's disclosures are contained in section 1.
"I., section 3, section 16."
"and section 18 of the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"Other Information 
The executive directors are responsible for the other infor-
mation."
"The other information comprises the information 
contained in the section ""Internal control system as part of 
the risk management system"" of the Group management 
report, which is labelled as unaudited and is not an audited 
component of the Group management report."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that 
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we 
are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in 
this regard."
"1 HGB and that the consolidated finan-
cial statements, in compliance with these requirements, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position, and financial performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements,  
the executive directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also 
have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible 
for financial reporting based on the going concern basis 
of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the 
Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alter-
native but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing 
the Group’s financial reporting process for the prepara-
tion of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
group management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are con-
sidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated 
financial statements and this group management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain pro-
fessional skepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collu-
sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresenta-
tions, or the override of internal controls."
"► 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used by the executive directors and the reasonable-
ness of estimates made by the executive directors 
and related disclosures."
"If we conclude 
that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related dis-
closures in the consolidated financial statements and 
in the group management report or, if such disclo-
sures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit 
opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evi-
dence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going  
concern."
"► 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business ac-
tivities within the Group to express audit opinions on 
the consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"We are responsible for the direc-
tion, supervision and performance of the group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
"► 
Evaluate the consistency of the group management 
report with the consolidated financial statements,  
its conformity with German law, and the view of the 
Group’s position it provides."
"► 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective infor-
mation presented by the executive directors in the 
group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, 
the significant assumptions used by the executive di-
rectors as a basis for the prospective information, and 
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective infor-
mation from these assumptions."
"We do not express a 
separate audit opinion on the prospective information 
and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a sub-
stantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ 
materially from the prospective information."
"From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements of the current period and are therefore the key 
audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our auditor’s 
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure 
about the matter."
