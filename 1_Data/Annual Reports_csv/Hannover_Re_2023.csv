"We transact all lines of property 
& casualty and life & health reinsurance and are present worldwide with more than 
3,500 staff."
"The German business of the Hannover Re Group is written by the 
subsidiary E+S Rück."
"Established in 1966, Hannover Re is recognised as a reliable 
partner for innovative risk solutions, exceptional customer intimacy and financial 
soundness."
"The rating agencies most relevant to the insurance industry have awarded 
both Hannover Re and E+S Rück very good financial strength ratings: Standard & 
Poor’s AA- ""Very Strong"" and A.M."
"With Group net income of EUR 1.8 billion, for example."
"we 
outperformed our target for 2023."
"We similarly posted very good results in our two business groups, namely Property & Casualty 
reinsurance and Life & Health reinsurance, as well as in our investments and we generated further profitable growth."
"Despite the 
ongoing challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape, it is a source of pride for me that with our team of staff we were 
able to safeguard the sustained profitability of our business and thereby underscored our role as a reliable partner and robustly 
capitalised reinsurer."
"The strong demand for our reinsurance solutions shows that we are delivering the right – and above all reliable – risk protection 
in times of climate change, war and inflation."
Advances in technology with the associated new risks pose a further challenge.
"Not 
only that, disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, storms and severe weather events as well as flooding caused considerable 
losses around the world last year."
"We are seeing that medium-severity natural catastrophes are continuing to increase in number 
and frequency."
"In light of climate change, extreme weather events and environmental perils are expected to remain major con-
cerns for the reinsurance industry."
Hannover Re is optimally positioned for these challenges.
"Among other things, we used the financial year just ended to further 
bolster our financial robustness and the resilience of our balance sheet."
"Yet our business is not only financially sound, it is also 
globally diversified."
"With our clear focus on reinsurance, our superlative risk and capital management and our cost discipline, we 
are superbly equipped for the future."
Yet our risk protection can only ever be part of the measures for tackling the challenges that lie ahead.
"Preventive safeguards and 
adaptation to the effects of climate change must play an equally pivotal role in mitigating the impacts of changing climate pat-
terns."
"The answer lies in our team 
of people."
"With their know-how and the focus on growing with our customers and enabling their risk transfer – whether through 
traditional reinsurance or tailored solutions –, they play a crucial part in our company's success."
"With a solvency ratio of 269 percent, a strong equity base and a return on equity of 19 percent, we are also an appealing and en-
during partner for you, our shareholders."
"We are demonstrating this once again with a reliable and attractive dividend through 
which we enable you to share in the success of our company."
"For 2023, therefore, we are proposing an ordinary dividend of 
EUR 6.00 per share and a special dividend of EUR 1.20 per share to the Annual General Meeting."
"I am also encouraged by the support shown to us by you, our shareholders, as well as the good and trusting collaboration with our 
clients and business partners."
I am pleased that you have joined us on this journey.
"Speaking for all my colleagues on the Execu-
tive Board and the entire Hannover Re team, I thank you sincerely for your trust."
In 2023 we moved forward with Hannover Re's ongoing development as one of the world's leading reinsurers.
"We are very well 
positioned for the year ahead – resilient, financially strong, profitable – and we shall continue on our path with profitable growth 
over the coming year."
"Going into the new year 
at 13,923.59 points, it was quick to surge past the 15,000 mark 
on 12 January."
"This sharply improved market sentiment was 
fuelled by, among other things, the prospect of inflation easing 
in the United States."
"The collapse of three US regional banks at the beginning of 
March, however, cast a new shadow over the market."
"Turmoil at 
Credit Suisse added to the volatility on the capital market."
"In the 
absence of far-reaching repercussions on the banking sector, 
the DAX nevertheless climbed past the 16,000 mark for the first 
time since January 2022."
"Movements on capital markets in the second and third quarters 
were influenced by various trends."
"While economic data coming 
out of the United States was positive, the direction in China 
appeared increasingly uncertain."
"Policy actions on interest rates 
taken by the Fed and ECB to fight inflation remained the centre 
of attention."
"While lower energy and oil prices were crucial in 
bringing inflation down in the first half of the year, they surged 
sharply higher again in the summer."
"The war in Israel/Gaza depressed stock market sentiment in Oc-
tober, although it did not have a lasting influence on equity 
markets."
"From November onwards the DAX embarked on 
another rally, driven in part by the prospect of interest rate cuts."
"The German share index climbed to its highest level to date of 
17,003.28 on 14 December."
"The very favourable outcome of the year-end treaty re-
newals in property and casualty reinsurance had only minimal 
implications for the share price, which had already moved 
sharply higher in the second half of 2022 in expectation of sig-
nificant rate adjustments in reinsurance business."
"In March, the crisis affecting some US regional banks and at 
Credit Suisse in Switzerland led to uncertainty in the market, the 
effects of which were particularly evident in the share prices of 
financial services companies – and hence also Hannover Re."
"Persistently high inflation prompted interest rate hikes both in 
Europe and in the United States, further fanning fears of reces-
sion."
"The conviction that interest rates would stay higher for 
longer than anticipated took hold."
"In this environment the Han-
nover Re share recovered from the price declines seen at the 
end of the first quarter."
"The price trend in the second half of the 
year was further buttressed by quarterly results in line with ex-
pectations and a hurricane season that passed off fairly be-
nignly."
"The anticipation that the attractive market environment 
in property and casualty reinsurance would be sustained was 
another positive factor."
"On 13 December the share reached a 
new record high of EUR 228.90."
"The Hannover Re share closed out the 2023 financial year with 
a gain of 16.6% at EUR 216.30."
"The share performance of our 
main peers Munich Re (+23.4%), Swiss Re (+9.3%) and Scor 
(+23.1%) was positive in 2023."
"The performance including reinvested dividends amounted to 
+20.3% in 2023."
"The benchmark DAX index similarly showed a 
gain of 20.3%."
"In a three-year comparison, the Hannover Re 
share delivered a performance (including reinvested dividends) 
of 83.8%, thereby comfortably outperforming the DAX 
(+61.7%)."
"Based on the year-end closing price, Hannover Re’s market 
capitalisation totalled EUR 26.1 billion at the end of the financial 
year."
"According to the DAX rankings drawn up by Deutsche 
Börse AG, the company placed twenty-third at the end of 
December in terms of free float market capitalisation."
"With a 
book value per share of EUR 83.97, the Hannover Re share 
showed a price-to-book ratio of 2.58 at the end of the year under 
review; it was thus above the average DAX price-to-book ratio 
of 1.48 at year-end."
"Compared to the average price-to-book ratio 
for its peer group, the Hannover Re share continues to be 
significantly better valued."
"By the end of the 2023 financial year, 22 analysts had handed 
down opinions on our company: Eleven recommended the 
Hannover Re share as ""buy"" or ""overweight""."
"Altogether six 
opinions 
were 
a 
""hold""."
"""Underweight"" 
or 
""sell"" 
recommendations were issued by five analysts."
"Dividend proposal envisages a higher 
distribution  
The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board intend to 
propose to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 2024 that a 
total dividend of EUR 7.20 per share should be distributed."
"Against the backdrop of an improved earnings situation, it is 
envisaged that the ordinary dividend per share will be increased 
by EUR 1.00 compared to the previous year to EUR 6.00."
"In view 
of the comfortable level of capitalisation, the ordinary dividend 
is to be supplemented by a special dividend of EUR 1.20 per 
share."
"Annual General Meeting adopted all 
proposed resolutions 
The virtual Annual General Meeting of Hannover Rück SE was 
held on 3 May 2023."
"In his address to the meeting, Chief Executive Officer Jean-
Jacques Henchoz took stock of the year just ended and high-
lighted Hannover Re's role as a resilient, reliable and relevant 
partner."
"In a rapidly changing landscape, Hannover Re contrib-
utes significant value to society."
"By identifying, evaluating and 
protecting against new risks, the company remains true to its 
role as a reinsurer with its core business and expertise."
"This is 
vital, Henchoz noted, in helping to close protection gaps around 
the world and thereby contribute to society."
"12  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
The Annual General Meeting approved the proposal made by 
the Executive Board and Supervisory Board to pay a total 
dividend of EUR 6.00 per share for the 2022 financial year."
"The 
payment was composed of an ordinary dividend of EUR 5.00 per 
share – an increase of EUR 0.50 compared to the previous year 
– and a special dividend of EUR 1.00 (previous year: EUR 1.25) 
per share."
"In total, Hannover Re distributed an amount of 
roughly EUR 724 million."
"79.3% of the voting shares were rep-
resented this year in the voting."
"The next Annual General Meeting will be held on 6 May 2024 in 
Hannover."
"Dialogue with the capital market  
The Executive Board and representatives of the Investor Rela-
tions department again kept up a continuous open dialogue with 
(institutional) investors in the 2023 financial year."
"Activities remained focused on the financial centres of Europe 
and North America."
"Hannover Re took part in 17 capital market 
conferences and made additional visits to investors on twelve 
roadshow days."
"Demand among investors for face-to-face meet-
ings as well as individually arranged teleconferences remained 
very high."
"The discussions centred around financial reporting under the 
new accounting standard IFRS 17."
"Further topics frequently ex-
plored were the market environment in property and casualty 
reinsurance as well as profitability and growth opportunities."
"Considerable importance was once again attached to the sus-
tainability efforts made by Hannover Rück SE as well as to ESG 
(environmental, social, governance) topics in 2023."
"At its 26th Investors' Day held on 12 December in Berlin, Han-
nover Re previewed the upcoming 2024 financial year and its 
financial ambitions under the new strategy for the years 2024-
2026."
"The event was also webcast live on the company's web-
site, although analysts continued to take the opportunity to at-
tend in person."
"Sustainability continues to take on 
added relevance  
Along with traditional financial considerations, non-financial 
aspects are coming to play an increasingly important role in the 
evaluation of companies on the capital market."
"In the financial 
year just ended, Hannover Re again reported extensively on 
sustainability and ESG topics."
"The disclosures took the form of, 
among other things, a combined non-financial statement 
externally reviewed with limited assurance as an integral 
component of the Group management report."
"In this 
connection, we are reporting in full for the first time in the 
current year on the eligibility and alignment of our business with 
the requirements of the EU Taxonomy."
"This classification 
system for sustainable economic activities is intended to provide 
orientation for the capital market and redirect capital flows into 
the sustainable transformation of the European economy."
"In 
addition, we publish annual sustainability reports compiled in 
accordance with the internationally recognised reporting 
standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)."
"In the year 
under review, as in prior years, we maintained a dialogue with 
a number of different stakeholders on sustainability issues."
"In 
addition, Hannover Re participates in the feedback processes of 
various ESG rating agencies."
"The company has ratings from, 
among others, CDP, ISS ESG, MSCI and Sustainalytics and is 
listed in the FTSE4Good, the Global Challenges Index and the 
sustainability index of Deutsche Börse AG (DAX 50 ESG)."
"Further growth in the number of 
shareholders 
Our share register showed some 76,424 shareholders at the end 
of the year, another increase in the number of shareholders 
year-on-year (73,361)."
"The largest shareholders at year-end 
were Talanx AG with 50.2% as well as Deutsche Asset 
Management Investment GmbH with a reported 3.0%, FMR 
LLC with a reported 3.0% and BlackRock, Inc."
"with a reported 
2.9% of the voting rights."
"Within the free float, institutional 
investors accounted for 38.3% (37.8%) of the total shares 
outstanding, while private investors held 11.5% (12.0%)."
"Hannover Rück SE is a European Company, Societas Europaea 
(SE), based in Hannover, Germany."
"Our business model is focused on reinsurance, which we trans-
act worldwide in the Property & Casualty and Life & Health rein-
surance business groups."
"In this way, we strive for the broadest 
possible diversification and hence an efficient risk balance."
"This 
is achieved by accepting reinsurance risks with mostly little or 
no correlation across all lines and regions of property & casualty 
and life & health reinsurance."
"In conjunction with efficient 
capital management, this is the key to our comparatively low 
cost of capital."
"Guided by a clearly defined risk appetite, the Executive Board 
steers the company with the support of risk management with a 
view to acting on business opportunities while securing our 
financial strength on a lasting basis."
"Our business operations are dedicated to our goal of being the 
preferred partner for our clients."
"It is for this reason that our 
clients and their concerns form the focus of our activities."
"In addition, we generate competitive advantages to the benefit 
of our clients and shareholders by conducting our reinsurance 
business with lower administrative expenses than our peers."
"In 
this way we deliver above-average profitability while at the same 
time being able to offer our customers reinsurance protection 
on competitive terms."
"16  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Our subsidiary E+S Rückversicherung AG (E+S Rück), as the 
“Reinsurer for Germany”, offers a range of products and 
services tailored to the specific features of the German market."
"Of special importance here are the mutual insurers with whom 
we maintain a strategic partnership that is underscored through 
their participation in E+S Rück."
"In the Property & Casualty reinsurance business group we 
consider ourselves to be a reliable, flexible and innovative 
market player that ranks among the best in any given market."
"Cost leadership, effective cycle management and superlative 
risk management are the key elements of our competitive 
positioning."
"Particularly in the current market environment, we 
actively manage our portfolio to ensure long-term profitability 
on the underwriting side."
"In the Life & Health reinsurance business group we are 
recognised – as customer surveys confirm – as one of the top 
players for traditional covers and a leading provider of 
structured solutions."
"We achieve this standing by, among other 
things, anticipating the future needs of our customers through 
the early identification of trends."
"With a view to assuring Hannover Re's lasting stability, our 
strategy is grounded on a solid foundation: sustainability and 
integrated corporate governance."
"Sustainability reflects our as-
piration to economic, social and environmental accountability."
"Through integrated corporate governance we foster the trust 
placed in Hannover Re, especially by regulators and investors 
but also by our clients and staff."
"Management system 
Value-based management
Our integrated system of enterprise management constitutes 
the basis for attainment of our strategic objectives."
"Located at 
its core are, first and foremost, our profit and growth targets."
"In 
addition to traditional key performance indicators geared to the 
IFRS balance sheet, our system of strategic targets also includes 
economic targets derived from our internal capital model 
approved by the regulator and from the economic equity 
pursuant to Solvency II reporting."
"The targets are regularly 
analysed and adjusted in the context of the strategy review 
conducted at periodic intervals."
"Given that reinsurance business 
is subject to cyclical fluctuations, our primary focus is on 
medium- and long-term attainment of the strategic targets 
across the cycle."
"The targets set for the strategy cycle 2021-2023, which we had 
presented in a target matrix, were no longer entirely appropriate 
following the implementation of IFRS 17 in 2023."
"Accounting 
practice in the insurance industry underwent a fundamental 
transformation with the adoption of IFRS 17 compared to IFRS 
4 and reflects economic changes much more closely."
"For 2023, 
in the last year of the strategy cycle, we did not define the usual 
range of long-term targets according to the previous target ma-
trix."
"The strategic targets set for the Group with respect to the 
return on equity (1000 basis points above the risk-free rate of 
return) and the solvency ratio (≥ 200%) as well as the xRoCA 
for both business groups (≥ 2%) remained valid in the 2023 fi-
nancial year and were achieved."
"New financial ambitions have been defined with the adoption of 
the new strategy for the 2024-2026 cycle."
"Details are provided 
in the section ""Outlook""."
"This 
enables us to evaluate the acceptance of underwriting risks and 
investment risks both in light of individual risk/return aspects 
and against the backdrop of our overall risk appetite."
"Our 
internal capital model supplies the key parameters for this 
purpose."
"Starting out from the Group’s overall risk situation, 
capital is first allocated to the functional areas of underwriting 
and investments."
"We then further divide the capital within the 
underwriting sector, first between the business segments of 
property & casualty reinsurance and life & health reinsurance 
and then between the various reinsurance products according 
to risk categories / treaty types and lines."
"In this way, we ensure 
consistent adherence to our profit targets – allowing for risk, 
cost and return considerations – in the evaluation and pricing of 
our various reinsurance products."
"The attainment of targets in a particular 
financial year is also of interest – especially from the standpoint 
of shareholders."
"Based on our economic measurement and our 
internal capital model, the foundation of our enterprise 
management, we strive to generate a profit in excess of the cost 
of capital."
"This return – which is the decisive ratio for the 
management of our business activities – is referred to as 
Intrinsic Value Creation (IVC)."
"The IVC ratio makes it possible to compare the value 
contributions of the Group as a whole, its two business groups 
and the individual operational units."
"This enables us to reliably 
identify value creators and value destroyers."
"In this way, we can 
• optimise the allocation of capital and resources, 
• identify opportunities and risks and 
• measure strategy contributions with an eye to our 
demanding profit and growth targets."
"The IVC (Intrinsic Value Creation) is calculated according to the 
following formula: adjusted economic profit – (capital allocated 
× weighted cost of capital) = IVC."
"The adjusted economic profit is comprised of two factors: the 
IFRS Group net income recognised after tax and the change in 
the unrealised gains and losses recognised in the contractual 
service margin, after adjustment for reserving components."
"The 
latter makes allowance in the calculated values for economic 
effects not recognised in profit or loss under IFRS."
"In addition, 
interest on hybrid capital already recognised in the IFRS Group 
net income and the non-controlling interest in profit or loss are 
included back in the calculation."
"The allocated capital consists of the economic equity pursuant 
to Solvency II including non-controlling interests and the hybrid 
capital."
"Capital is allocated to the profit centres as described 
above according to the risk content of the business in question."
"A systematic distinction is made here between the assumption 
of underwriting risks, on the one hand, and investment risks, on 
the other."
"In calculating the cost of capital, our assumption – based on a 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) approach – is that the 
investor’s opportunity costs are 625 basis points above the risk-
free interest rate, meaning that economic value is created above 
this threshold."
"Our strategic return on equity target of 1,000 
basis points above risk-free thus already contains a substantial 
target value creation."
"We allocate equity sparingly and use 
equity substitutes to optimise our average cost of capital, which 
amounted to (unaudited by the independent auditor) 4.6% in 
2023 (previous year: 4.2%)."
"Since comparison of absolute amounts is not always 
meaningful, we have introduced the xRoCA (excess return on 
capital allocated) in addition to the IVC."
"This describes the IVC 
in relation to the allocated capital and shows us the relative 
excess return generated above and beyond the weighted cost of 
capital."
"The close interlinking of our internal capital model with the 
capital allocation and value-based management helps us to fulfil 
the requirements of the Solvency II use test."
"Operational management system 
A number of IFRS-based financial KPIs are also embedded in 
our strategic system of targets and coordinated with our metrics 
for value creation derived from the internal capital model."
"We 
use these KPIs for operational management within the year, in 
part because they are available promptly and also because they 
already provide initial pointers as to whether we are likely to 
achieve our higher-order strategic objectives."
"For 2023, these 
were the growth in reinsurance revenue and the EBIT for both 
business groups and the return on investment for the Group as 
a whole."
"Management by Objectives 
Key performance indicators from our management system are 
integrated into the individual agreements on objectives with 
managers."
"When it comes to the definition of objectives, the 
participants take into account not only standardised financial 
indicators but also non-financial variables derived from the 
strategic parameters."
"Further information on the individual 
objectives and associated remuneration elements of the 
members of the Executive Board is provided in the separately 
published remuneration report."
"According to estimates by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), global gross 
domestic product grew by 2.9% in real terms, slightly weaker 
than in the previous year (3.3%)."
"While the pace slowed in many 
advanced economies, the United States along with emerging 
market and developing countries performed better overall."
"Growth in China was volatile after the economy restarted follow-
ing the pandemic, with the real estate sector coming under 
growing pressure."
"The OECD sees the increase in corporate insolvencies as an in-
dication that the less favourable financing conditions have 
dampened global demand."
"Numerous companies found them-
selves facing higher debt servicing, stricter credit standards 
and, in many cases, slower sales growth."
"Despite low levels of 
unemployment, there were increasing signs of a weakening 
labour market in many economies."
"These include slower em-
ployment growth, declining churn rates and fewer job vacan-
cies."
"On the inflation side, central banks were successful with their 
restrictive monetary policy."
"Inflation rates fell almost every-
where last year, helped by the partial reversal of the previous 
sharp rise in energy prices."
"The upward trend in prices for ser-
vices remains more persistent than for goods, as wages are gen-
erally the most important production costs in the service sector."
"On the markets for fixed-income securities, interest rates fell in 
our main currency areas, particularly towards the end of the re-
porting period in medium and longer maturities, while short-
term rates continued to rise, resulting in – in some cases more 
pronounced – inverted yield curves."
"This primarily reflected 
central bank interest rate policy, the inflation issue and sover-
eign debt levels."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
19 
Uncertainties in the banking sector at the end of the first quarter 
led to unease on credit markets."
"This was reflected in some very 
volatile risk premiums on corporate bonds, although these had 
largely settled back to or even below the level at the beginning 
of the year by the reporting date."
"Central banks once again had a significant influence on capital 
markets and the economy."
"In our main currency areas, they 
raised their key interest rates in multiple increments in response 
to the ongoing vigorous inflation trend."
"Overall, the policies pur-
sued by central banks in our main currency areas consistently 
pulled off the difficult balancing act of keeping inflation in check 
while not stifling the sometimes still fragile economic momen-
tum."
"Stock markets enjoyed a strong first half of the year, primarily 
due to the anticipated end of interest rate hikes and buoyant 
price movements in the technology sector."
"The second half of 
the year got off to a much more subdued start, but recorded fur-
ther significant gains in the final quarter, particularly in Euro-
pean and US equities."
"Overall, the issue of inflation continued to dominate."
"Inflation 
rates are still above the targets set by central banks, despite re-
treating appreciably over the course of the year."
"The euro fluctuated quite significantly against the US dollar over 
the course of the year before ending the year under review with 
slight gains."
"While the euro fell slightly against the British 
pound, it also made gains against the Australian and Canadian 
dollars."
"Industry-specific environment 
The renewals in January 2023 marked a turning point for the 
property and casualty reinsurance market."
"There was a funda-
mental shift in pricing and risk appetite, particularly for property 
catastrophe risks."
"This shift continued in the subsequent rounds 
of renewals."
"Market conditions nevertheless remained complex, 
mainly due to unpredictable inflationary trends, geopolitical 
risks, deglobalisation and developments in the areas of climate 
change and cyber risks."
"In view of this risk situation and the further rise in claims costs, 
demand for insurance cover increased."
"AM Best and Guy Carpenter estimate that reinsurance capital is 
likely to have risen to USD 461 billion in 2023, adjusted for eq-
uity effects from higher interest rates, compared to USD 434 bil-
lion in the previous year."
"Sufficient capacity was therefore avail-
able to meet demand."
"However, subsectors of the market were 
in different phases of the market cycle, resulting in capacity bot-
tlenecks in some loss-affected segments."
"According to AM Best 
and Guy Carpenter, the market for alternative risk transfer re-
mained largely stable with a total invested capital volume of 
around USD 100 billion."
"Within this market, there was a further 
shift towards catastrophe bonds."
"At the same time, many risks changed."
"The first half of 2023 
brought a high frequency of weather-related natural disasters, 
particularly with respect to modelled secondary risks."
"Severe 
thunderstorms with tornadoes and hail in the United States 
caused losses in the first half of 2023 on a scale previously only 
expected from a major hurricane."
"Other natural hazards such as 
wildfires and floods, which do not rank among the historical 
peak events, also trended higher in many regions of the world."
"The most expensive insured losses in 2023 included the earth-
quake in Türkiye and Syria, storms in the US and Mexico and 
two consecutive flood events in New Zealand."
"Overall, the rein-
surance market was in a more sustainable state in 2023, with 
risk-adequate prices and higher investment income boosting 
profitability."
"The trend towards digitalisation in the insurance sector contin-
ued in 2023."
"Artificial intelligence, in particular, is a topic that 
has gathered significant momentum in recent months."
"As a re-
sult, digitalisation is playing a role in more and more areas, for 
example when it comes to the automation of business processes 
or the changing competitive landscape."
"At the same time, the 
ability to collect and analyse a wide range of additional data 
more precisely is opening up new opportunities."
"This means 
that risks can be better assessed and premiums calculated even 
more accurately."
"The insurance of cyber risks has also become 
increasingly important."
"Demand for insurance solutions to pro-
tect against potential losses caused by hacker attacks continued 
to grow."
"20  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Overall assessment of the business position 
For Hannover Re, the 2023 financial year was shaped by a 
complex macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape as well as 
a high frequency of natural catastrophes."
"We again 
demonstrated our risk-bearing capacity and profitability in this 
challenging environment."
"We achieved good results in both our 
business groups, namely Property & Casualty reinsurance and 
Life & Health reinsurance, as well as in our investments."
"The result in property and casualty reinsurance was particularly 
impacted by the considerable number of large losses."
"At the 
same time, the industry has turned the corner towards more ad-
equate prices and conditions."
"These continued to improve in the 
2023 treaty renewals in many lines on both the primary insur-
ance and reinsurance side."
"Following the losses incurred in pre-
vious years due to death benefits in connection with the Covid-
19 pandemic, life and health reinsurance delivered positive 
profit contributions again in the year under review."
"We further 
increased our investment income thanks in part to the higher 
interest rate level and positive operating cash flow."
"Overall, 
therefore, we were able to generate a Group profit slightly above 
our expectations."
"At the time of preparing the management report, it remains the 
case that both the business position of the Group and its finan-
cial strength can be assessed as very good."
"Within the frame-
work of our Group strategy, we determine our necessary equity 
resources according to the requirements of our internal capital 
model, solvency regulations, the expectations of rating agencies 
for our target rating and the expectations of our clients and 
shareholders."
"In order to ensure comparability of 
the results, the figures for the previous year have also been cal-
culated in accordance with the new standards."
"As one of the leading reinsurers in the world, Hannover Re has 
a far-reaching international network and extensive underwriting 
expertise."
"On this basis, we are able to offer our customers tra-
ditional, tailor-made and innovative reinsurance solutions and 
we work with them to open up new business opportunities."
"Global reinsurance markets have been experiencing fierce com-
petition and losses from natural catastrophes for some years 
now."
"At the same time, climate change, Russia's war of aggres-
sion on Ukraine and global macroeconomic developments are 
presenting major challenges for the insurance industry."
"Of the headwinds currently facing us, special mention should be 
made of the continued high levels of inflation."
"Combined with 
an increase in large losses, which can be attributed in part to 
climate change, this is leading to a sharp surge in expenditures 
for insurers and reinsurers alike."
"Despite these challenges, Hannover Re once again demon-
strated the resilience of its business model as a globally diversi-
fied and robustly capitalised reinsurer in the 2023 financial year."
"The market headwinds described above are fuelling demand for 
high-quality reinsurance protection such as that offered by Han-
nover Re."
"Against this backdrop, our business continued to 
chart a profitable growth track in 2023."
"Not only did we achieve 
the guided Group net income, we also strengthened the balance 
sheet to a greater extent than originally planned."
"Reinsurance revenue (gross) for the Group increased by 1.8% 
as at 31 December 2023 to EUR 24.5 billion (EUR 24.0 billion)."
"At constant exchange rates, growth would have reached 4.9%."
"We thus very nearly achieved our guidance of at least 5% 
growth."
"The reinsurance service result (net), reflecting the profitability 
of underwriting activity after deduction of business ceded (pri-
marily retrocessions and insurance-linked securities), rose by a 
substantial 24.1% to EUR 1,658.3 million (EUR 1,336.4 mil-
lion)."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
21 
The reinsurance finance result (net) adjusted for exchange rate 
effects, which is structurally negative, decreased by 50.9% to 
EUR -(880.2) million (EUR -(583.1) million)."
"Other income and expenses decreased by 118.5% to  
EUR -(481.7) million 
(EUR -(220.5) million) 
due 
to 
the 
elimination of positive one-time effects from the previous year."
"The operating profit (EBIT) grew by 30.1% to EUR 1,971.2 mil-
lion (EUR 1,515.7 million)."
"The develop-
ment of investment income in the 2023 financial year was posi-
tively affected above all by higher interest rates."
"In addition, the 
EBIT in the financial year was notable for a favourable underly-
ing business development on the reinsurance side."
"Against this 
backdrop, the reserves in property and casualty reinsurance 
were further strengthened – especially in the fourth quarter –, 
thereby increasing the resilience of the balance sheet."
"Expenditure 
for 
taxes 
decreased 
to 
EUR 26.3 million 
(EUR 525.9 million) due to different regional profit contribu-
tions and a one-time effect connected with adoption of the 
OECD's proposed global effective minimum tax rate."
"Group net 
income came in at EUR 1,824.8 million (EUR 780.8 million)."
"We 
thus achieved our Group earnings guidance of at least 
EUR 1.7 billion."
"Earnings 
per 
share 
stood 
at 
EUR 15.13 (EUR 6.47)."
"The shareholders' equity amounted to EUR 10.1 billion 
(EUR 9.1 billion) as at 31 December 2023."
"The increase in 
shareholders' equity derived principally from the Group profit 
generated less the dividend distributed to shareholders of Han-
nover Re for the 2022 financial year."
"The return on equity stood 
at 19.0% (8.2%) and thus comfortably beat the minimum target 
of 1,000 basis points above the risk-free interest rate."
"The book 
value per share reached EUR 83.97 (EUR 75.12)."
"The contractual service margin (net) grew by 17.4% to EUR 
7,699.1 million (31 December 2022: EUR 6,557.4 million)."
"The 
increase was driven mainly by the profitable new business writ-
ten."
"The risk adjustment for non-financial risk nudged slightly 
higher by 0.3% to EUR 3,728.6 million (31 December 2022: 
EUR 3,717.1 million)."
"The total policyholders' surplus, consisting of shareholders' eq-
uity, non-controlling interests and hybrid capital, amounted to 
EUR 14.2 billion (EUR 13.7 billion) as at 31 December 2023."
"Reinsurance revenue (gross) in our Property & Casualty rein-
surance business group rose by 6.5% adjusted for exchange 
rate effects."
"Despite a large number of medium-severity catas-
trophe losses, the expenditures from large losses amounting to 
EUR 1.621 billion remained within our budgeted expectation 
for the financial year of EUR 1.725 billion."
"The combined ratio 
in property and casualty reinsurance improved year-on-year to 
94.0% (94.5%)."
"In view of the challenging market environment 
described at the outset, prices and conditions for reinsurance 
protection continued to show sustained improvement."
"This sim-
ilarly led to a further increase in the cost of retrocession covers 
that we take out to protect our own portfolio."
"Thanks to its comparatively low administrative expenses and 
cost of capital as well as its above-average financial strength, 
Hannover Re has been and remains able to successfully assert 
itself in the market."
"Based on our positioning as one of the 
largest and most robustly capitalised reinsurers in the world, we 
enjoy sustained very good access to profitable business."
"The op-
erating profit (EBIT) booked in property and casualty reinsur-
ance 
improved 
by 
26.7% 
to 
EUR 1,098.6 million 
(EUR 867.3 million)."
"Due to the aforementioned higher-than-
planned increase in the liabilities from reinsurance contracts is-
sued, the EBIT was below our target EBIT of EUR 1.6 billion."
"Reinsurance revenue (gross) booked in our Life & Health rein-
surance business group grew by 1.6% adjusted for exchange-
rate effects."
"At the same time, demand for reinsurance covers 
remained strong in areas such as financial solutions and protec-
tion against longevity risks."
"Pandemic-related losses, on the 
other hand, were considerably lower."
"The operating result 
(EBIT) in life and health reinsurance improved sharply to 
EUR 871.2 million (EUR 650.3 million) and thus played an im-
portant part overall in the total result for the year under review."
"Our portfolio of investments amounted to EUR 60.1 billion at 
the end of the year (31 December 2022: EUR 55.3 billion)."
"The 
investment result improved on the previous year by 64.5% to 
reach EUR 1,588.2 million (EUR 965.4 million)."
"This was attrib-
utable primarily to higher interest income and fair value 
changes recognised in profit or loss as well as a lower charge 
for expected credit losses."
"In addition, the net realised gains 
recognised in the previous year in the presentation according to 
IFRS 9 were exceptionally low because the realisation of consid-
erable gains from our private equity portfolio was not reflected 
in the statement of income under IFRS 9."
"The resulting return 
on our investments stood at 2.8% overall and thus comfortably 
beat our minimum full-year target of 2.4%."
"We largely achieved and in some cases substantially outper-
formed the forecasts shown in the following table."
"Numerous nat-
ural catastrophes as well as persistently high inflation resulted 
in strains for the entire industry."
"In response, the trend towards a significant improvement in 
risk-adjusted prices and conditions in both primary insurance 
and reinsurance gained added momentum."
"The various rounds 
of renewals in 2023 marked a turning point for the industry to-
wards more adequate prices and better conditions."
"At the same 
time, demand for high-quality reinsurance protection increased."
"In sum, the renewals passed off favourably for us."
"We tradition-
ally report price changes on a risk-adjusted basis."
"In other 
words, the price developments that we report already make al-
lowance for higher inflation rates and model adjustments."
"In natural catastrophe business we continued to pursue our 
profit-oriented underwriting policy."
"Our risk appetite for cover-
age of natural catastrophes grew at a disproportionately low rate 
relative to the premium growth in property and casualty rein-
surance in original currency."

Thanks to our quality-focused underwriting approach, the new 
business CSM (net) was boosted by a substantial 29.7% to 
EUR 2,368.1 million (EUR 1,825.1 million)."
"The new business 
LC (net) contracted to EUR 40.3 million (EUR 236.0 million)."
"Reinsurance revenue (gross) in property and casualty reinsur-
ance grew by 3.4 % to EUR 16,823.9 million (previous year: 
EUR 16,264.9 million)."
"Growth would have reached 6.5% at 
constant exchange rates."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
23 
The 2023 financial year was characterised by a high frequency 
of medium-severity catastrophe losses."
"The net expenditures 
from large losses in the financial year totalled EUR 1,620.6 mil-
lion (EUR 1,705.7 million)."
"They were thus within the budgeted 
expectation of EUR 1,725 million for 2023."
"We classify events for which we expect gross loss payments in 
excess of EUR 10 million as large losses."
"The largest individual losses for Hannover Re included the se-
vere storms in Italy in July in a net amount of EUR 313.1 million."
"Also notable was the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and 
Syria at the start of the year with expenditure of EUR 270.1 mil-
lion, Hurricane Otis in Mexico at a cost of EUR 142.2 million and 
the wildfires in Hawaii amounting to EUR 96.8 million."
"Further 
losses of EUR 73.5 million were incurred from the major earth-
quake in Morocco."
"Tropical Cyclone Gabrielle in New Zealand, 
the flooding in New Zealand at the start of the year and losses 
caused by severe storms and flooding in Australia at year-end 
took 
a 
toll 
of 
EUR 67.1 million, 
EUR 46.8 million 
and 
EUR 43.8 million respectively."
"Further expenses totalling EUR 48.2 million were incurred in 
connection with the unrest in France."
"Additional pandemic-re-
lated losses – albeit in line with expectations and substantially 
lower than in the previous year – were recorded in accident and 
health insurance in the Asia-Pacific region."
"The reinsurance service result (net) climbed by 5.9% to 
EUR 848.5 million (EUR 801.3 million)."
"The result for the previ-
ous year had included provisions made for payments connected 
with the war in Ukraine."
"The combined ratio improved to 94.0% 
(94.5%) despite significant, higher-than-planned strengthening 
of the loss reserves in 2023."
"The reinsurance finance result (net) 
adjusted for exchange rate effects amounted to EUR -
(722.0) million (EUR -(475) million)."
"The net investment result for property and casualty reinsurance 
amounted to EUR 1,170.7 million (EUR 608 million)."
"Net re-
alised gains had been exceptionally low in the previous year as 
presented in accordance with IFRS 9 because the realisation of 
considerable gains from our private equity portfolio was not re-
flected in the statement of income under IFRS 9."
"The operating 
profit (EBIT) increased by 26.7% to EUR 1,098.6 million 
(EUR 867.3 million) and thus fell short of our EBIT target of EUR 
1.6 billion for property and casualty reinsurance."
"This was due 
to the previously mentioned higher-than-planned increase in the 
liabilities from reinsurance contracts issued."
"On the following pages we report in detail on developments in 
our Property & Casualty reinsurance business group."
"This is 
split into a number of reporting categories, sorted according to 
regional markets and worldwide markets."
"Heatwaves, 
floods and storms led to high claims burdens for insurers and 
reinsurers in many European countries."
"The devastating earth-
quake in Türkiye and Syria at the beginning of the year and the 
major earthquake in Morocco were also significant events."
"The growing number of large and frequency losses combined 
with persistent inflation have resulted in higher payments to our 
customers."
"Reinsurance prices and conditions consequently had 
to be appreciably increased again in the course of 2023 to take 
account of the higher expected claims values."
"Responsibility for Germany within the Hannover Re Group is 
assigned to our subsidiary E+S Rückversicherung AG."
"Insurance business in Germany was similarly characterised by 
an increased frequency of natural perils events in 2023."
"After a 
rather below-average first half of the year, summer storms Lam-
bert and Kay as well as Denis and Erwin led to considerable 
claims burdens in the motor own damage and property insur-
ance lines in the third quarter."
"In motor insurance, average claims were once again signifi-
cantly higher."
"At the same time, the tariff adjustments for 2023 
failed to produce the desired effects."
"Sharp rises in the costs of 
spare parts and repairs as well as increased claims frequencies 
in combination with exceptional expenditures due to severe 
weather conditions led to substantial losses across the entire 
market for own damage insurance."
"In total, the German Insur-
ance Association (GDV) puts the combined ratio for the market 
in 2023 at 110%, a considerable deterioration compared to the 
previous year."
"The high-volume property lines of residential building and in-
dustrial insurance once again recorded above-average premium 
increases."
"The price increases seen on cyber covers in previous years soft-
ened in 2023."
"Nevertheless, pressure for adjustments persists in 
connection with rising claims expenses."
"Controlling and limiting 
cyber accumulation scenarios has taken on added relevance, as 
is also reflected in the contractual terms and conditions."
"In France, the market hardened further in the 2023 financial 
year."
"The insurance industry faced headwinds from Storm Cia-
rán in the autumn, among other things."
"In terms of man-made 
losses, the serious social unrest in the summer and resulting 
losses are particularly noteworthy."
Italy experienced extreme losses from natural hazards in 2023.
"In addition to the spring floods in the Emilia-Romagna region, it 
was above all the storms with hail and heavy rainfall in the third 
quarter that led to massive losses."
"Following the increased fre-
quency of natural perils events already recorded in previous 
years, significant adjustments to retentions, conditions and 
prices were necessary and implemented on the reinsurance side 
in the motor own damage and property lines."
"In the markets of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia's war of 
aggression against Ukraine continued to influence economic de-
velopment in the region in 2023."
"Business here was also affected 
by extraordinary losses due to business interruptions caused by 
supply chain bottlenecks and the persistently high level of infla-
tion."
"We reduced our proportional business in the year under 
review and at the same time expanded our non-proportional 
portfolio."
"In view of the large loss expenditures and persistently 
difficult macroeconomic environment, we were able to secure 
further price increases."
"Northern Europe was similarly notable for a number of small 
and medium-sized frequency losses."
"In this region, too, we were 
once again able to push through price increases in the year un-
der review and thus further improve the quality of our portfolio."
"Insurers in the UK, Ireland and the London market obtained 
further rate increases in the year under review."
"Although these 
were sometimes lower than in the previous year, significant in-
creases were also realised in some lines of business."
"Property 
covers, in particular, benefited from the market situation as a 
result of negative claims trends from prior years, high inflation 
and the resulting capacity shortages."
"The wars in Ukraine and Israel prompted insurers and reinsur-
ers to focus their attention on covers from the terrorism and po-
litical risks (political violence) segment."
"Clear hardening of the 
market was evident here, and in some cases a move away from 
broker facilities."
"In certain liability lines, such as directors' and 
officers' (D&O) insurance, the prices that could be obtained set-
tled on the previous year's level."
"Rate reductions were also ob-
served in the primary insurance market."
"As announced last year, 
property insurance business recorded significant rate increases."
"Appreciably higher rates were seen on the reinsurance side in 
the motor line, in the area of terrorism and political violence and 
in natural catastrophe business."
"We were able to push through 
increases here in the retentions carried by primary insurers."
"As a result of the rate increases in the original market, which 
had the effect of boosting profitability in our proportional port-
folio, and price rises in the non-proportional book, our portfolio 
remained stable in 2023 due to targeted share reductions."
"In the Middle East we transact both traditional reinsurance for 
the Middle East and North Africa region and business in accor-
dance with Islamic law, known as retakaful."
"We offer retakaful 
capacities worldwide through our subsidiary Hannover ReTaka-
ful."
"Our focus is on the Middle East, North Africa and Southeast 
Asia."
"In both business segments we observed further premium 
 
26  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
growth in the markets of the Middle East and South Asia in the 
financial year just ended."
"In South Africa, the 2023 financial year was notable for a higher 
frequency of smaller and mid-sized losses, but no significant 
catastrophe losses."
"Risk management and firefighting in the re-
gion suffer from a lack of investment in infrastructure."
"The in-
surance industry has therefore enforced an exclusion for losses 
caused by a power grid failure, as this is now considered to be 
an uninsurable risk."
"Coverage for damage caused by switching 
the electricity on or off has also been significantly restricted."
"Americas 
We combine our business in North and Latin America in the 
Americas reporting category."
North America is the largest insurance market in the world.
Our business here is written largely through brokers.
"The economic landscape in North America was again dominated 
by surging inflation all around the world in 2023."
"In particular, 
the economy came under pressure in the first half of the year 
from increasing price rises and energy costs as well as supply 
chain disruptions."
"The US economy proved to be relatively resilient despite this 
general environment."
"The premium volume in primary insur-
ance consequently continued to grow."
"Insurers were able to 
push through further rate increases in light of the uncertainties 
in the markets."
"The trend towards higher prices in property and 
liability lines was also sustained for the fourth year in succes-
sion."
"On the claims side, the financial year was not dominated by 
large loss events."
"Instead, business was shaped by a high num-
ber of severe convective storms in the first three quarters."
"Par-
ticularly in the Midwest, these events caused considerable 
losses in primary insurance and reinsurance."
"Hannover Re was able to secure improvements in prices and 
conditions across all lines of North American business in the 
2023 treaty renewals."
"The pace of recovery on Latin American economies following 
the pandemic strains and natural disasters of recent years is var-
ied."
"Overall, economic growth was weak."
"Argentina was partic-
ularly challenged by high inflation."
"After a comparatively benign previous year, the region was once 
again hit by large losses in 2023."
"The most significant loss event 
was Hurricane Otis in October, which caused severe damage in 
Mexico and is considered the most expensive insured event 
there in the past 20 years."
"Against this backdrop, demand for 
natural catastrophe covers continued to rise, while the supply of 
reinsurance capacity remained stable or even tightened for 
some risks."
"This resulted in further improvements in prices and 
conditions for both insurers and reinsurers."
"Asia-Pacific 
The Asia-Pacific remains the region with the strongest eco-
nomic growth in the world and continues to evolve into one of 
the largest insurance markets."
"We have expanded our local foot-
print in recent years in order to leverage the growth potential 
offered by the region."
"The state of the economy in the ""Greater China"" area, which in-
cludes Mainland China as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong and 
Macau, was relatively stable in the year under review."
"Most in-
surers were therefore able to generate positive underwriting re-
sults."
"When it comes to natural catastrophe losses, a number of 
events occurred in 2023: Typhoon Doksuri, the historic record 
rainfall in Hong Kong and the earthquake in Gansu province 
were the most noteworthy large losses."
"In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, China enjoyed vig-
orous economic growth in the year under review, accompanied 
by low inflation."
"This development, together with the new focus 
on green and sustainable economic growth (green economy), 
offers business opportunities for insurers and reinsurers."
"At the 
same time, however, competition is also intensifying."
"We scaled back our market share in China over the course of the 
year due to inadequate rates."
"However, our customer relation-
ships remain stable and reliable."
"In Taiwan, claims relating to 
the Covid-19 pandemic affected the result in accident and health 
insurance on a far smaller scale than in the previous year."
"In the region of Southeast Asia – consisting of countries such as 
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam – 
the 2023 financial year was notable for restructuring in favour 
of significantly increasing the profitability of our portfolio."
"Particularly in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea, a hardening 
of the reinsurance market and associated appreciable improve-
ments in conditions were noticeable."
"For tactical reasons, we 
have shifted the focus of our portfolio from proportional to more 
non-proportional covers."
The Indian market remains intensely competitive.
"We neverthe-
less continued to grow as planned in the property insurance 
lines."
"In Australia and New Zealand, we further expanded our part-
nerships with key accounts in 2023 based on established, strong 
customer relationships or renewed existing large contracts over 
a longer period."
"Following what had in some cases been devastating natural 
catastrophe losses in prior years, the region was again hit by 
such events in 2023."
"Cyclone Gabrielle and the floods in Auck-
land caused extensive destruction and corresponding large loss 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
27 
expenditures in the first quarter of 2023."
"Convective storms and 
hail also took a toll in the final week of the year."
"The rate level increased significantly based on the claims expe-
rience of recent years and continuing inflation, both on the in-
surance and reinsurance side."
"We were also able to improve the 
reinsurance conditions for proportional programmes."
"We ex-
pect the rate level to stabilise further in the coming financial 
year."
"Worldwide markets 
Structured Reinsurance  
and Insurance-Linked Securities 
In the Structured Reinsurance and Insurance-Linked Securi-
ties reporting category we combine our business involving tai-
lor-made property and casualty reinsurance solutions and insur-
ance-linked securities (ILS)."
"In structured reinsurance we rank as one of the largest 
providers of innovative and bespoke reinsurance solutions in the 
world."
"These provide solvency relief and thus have a positive 
effect on the client’s capital and hence its rating, or they protect 
against the strain of frequency losses."
"Structured concepts also 
offer an alternative in cases where traditional reinsurance ca-
pacity cannot be accessed to the full extent."
"Along with the tra-
ditional clientele of primary insurers, structured reinsurance is 
increasingly in demand among large corporate groups and their 
in-house insurance captives."
"Globally, we were again able to grow our customer base and 
increased the number of treaties and associated premium vol-
ume at attractive conditions."
"The higher retentions carried by 
our clients prompted stronger demand for structured, volatility-
mitigating reinsurance solutions."
"The market for insurance-linked securities reached a new 
record high in 2023 with a capacity of around USD 100 billion."
"Cash flow were channelled particularly into catastrophe bonds 
due to the relatively higher liquidity and comparatively better 
investment results in recent years."
"At USD 16.2 billion, the 
worldwide market volume of newly issued catastrophe bonds is 
higher than in 2022 (USD 10.3 billion) and also beats the previ-
ous record year of 2021 (around USD 14.0 billion)."
"According to our estimates, collateralised reinsurance still ac-
counts for the bulk of the ILS market, even though catastrophe 
bonds became more attractive in the year under review."
"In col-
lateralised reinsurance, insurers and investors enter into private 
risk transfer agreements secured by collateral held in trust ac-
counts."
"Hannover Re leverages the entire spectrum of opportunities of-
fered by the ILS market."
"On the one hand, we ourselves take out 
reinsurance with ILS investors, while at the same time we offer 
to transfer our customers’ risks to the capital market as a ser-
vice."
"This is done in the form of catastrophe bonds or through 
collateralised reinsurance, under which our partners on the in-
vestment side are primarily specialised ILS funds."
"We also invest 
in catastrophe bonds."
"In 2023, the volume of new exposures that we transferred to the 
capital market in the form of catastrophe bonds totalled around 
USD 2.8 billion, spread across ten transactions."
"This volume is 
higher than the record year of 2021 with USD 2.7 billion."
"Covers 
were placed to protect against losses from natural catastrophes 
such as floods, windstorm events and earthquakes."
"The largest 
transaction was a USD 500 million catastrophe bond for the 
Texas Windstorm Insurance Association."
"Collateralised reinsurance, which remains by far our largest 
segment in the ILS sector, showed further pleasing growth in 
the year under review."
"Most notably, we were able to grow our 
business with existing clients."
"The important role played by the capital market in our purchas-
ing of retrocession protection was unchanged."
"In addition, we 
were able to transfer cyber risks to the capital market for the 
first time through a quota share cession, an innovation for the 
ILS market in view of the USD 100 million in capital support."
"In 
addition to the quota shares, we made use of the ILS market for 
other protection covers."
"Facultative Reinsurance 
In contrast to obligatory reinsurance, we write primarily individ-
ual risks in facultative reinsurance."
"The general framework 
conditions for both types of reinsurance in the various markets 
are extensively correlated."
"The attractive reinsurance conditions of the previous year con-
tinued in the 2023 reporting year."
"Exceptions were the direc-
tors' and officers' (D&O) and financial institutions lines."
"Coming 
off a high initial level, we observed a continuation here of the 
rate reductions that had already begun in 2022."
"The same is true of the cyber line, where we are currently seeing 
rate erosion following significant increases worldwide at the end 
of the previous year."
"There is a large discrepancy between US 
business and European placements, where pricing pressure was 
felt not only earlier but also more heavily."
"The supply of facultative reinsurance solutions was stable on a 
high level in the year under review, as capacities in obligatory 
reinsurance continued to tighten."
"The business result in facultative reinsurance was only impacted 
to a minimal extent by natural catastrophes."
"The largest losses 
 
28  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
were caused by the earthquake in Türkiye and Syria and by Hur-
ricane Otis in Mexico."
"Human-caused losses, on the other hand, 
increased."
"Mention should be made here of the fire at a shop-
ping complex in Panama, among others."
"Hannover Re has enshrined sustainability goals as part of its 
Group strategy."
"In recent years, for example, we have taken a 
very conservative approach to the coverage of thermal coal and 
oilsands risks in facultative business and from 2020 onwards we 
have no longer written any new business in these areas."
"Fur-
thermore, we exclude coverage for risks associated with the de-
velopment of new oil and gas fields and respect sustainability 
concerns around biodiversity and human rights."
"If we identify 
violations of internationally recognised conventions, we decline 
the business in question."
"What is more, in our facultative rein-
surance business we support the sustainable transformation of 
the economy, for example through the targeted provision of 
reinsurance protection for the expansion of renewables and new 
storage technologies."
"Credit, Surety and Political Risks  
Loss ratios were moderately higher in credit and surety insur-
ance as well as in the political risks segment due to deteriorat-
ing economic conditions around the world."
"Higher inflation and 
interest rates led to a markedly gloomier general economic sit-
uation and rising insolvency numbers."
"These developments spurred rising demand for insurance and 
reinsurance in 2023, while prices held stable or moved slightly 
higher."
"Claims activity picked up somewhat coming off a very 
low level, but remained below average from a multi-year per-
spective."
"Aviation and Marine  
The favourable trend for both proportional and non-proportional 
solutions in aviation reinsurance was sustained."
"As far as prices 
are concerned, the positive momentum is gradually slowing as 
expected, but at the same time we are still securing improve-
ments in treaty conditions."
"The primary insurance market, on the other hand, shows a more 
mixed picture."
"From a global perspective, the pricing trend in 
the general aviation and product liability segments ranges from 
slightly positive to stable."
"The airline segment, on the other 
hand, remains soft on account of persistent surplus capacities."
"In view of new geopolitical tensions and the continued uncer-
tainty around pending international proceedings between leas-
ing firms whose activities previously included Russia and their 
insurers, the subsegment of ""war risk insurance"" showed fur-
ther substantial price improvements."
"Turning to marine business, a normalisation of world trade was 
evident in the year under review following the impacts of the 
Covid-19 pandemic."
"Despite the ongoing war in Ukraine, mar-
itime trade picked up in the areas of both container and bulk 
shipping."
"Inflation drove costs higher, however, including the 
costs of making repairs to vessels."
"The marine insurance market continued the sustained upward 
trend already noted in previous reporting periods, albeit less 
vigorously, and rates in cargo and hull insurance moved slightly 
higher."
"In offshore energy business, on the other hand, prices 
were stable."
"Contrary to our expectations, the market for politi-
cal risks posted only modest price increases."
"On the claims side, it was pleasing to see that 2023 passed off 
rather benignly."
"Along with the impacts of various natural dis-
asters, such as the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria as well as 
Morocco, the explosion on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was 
especially noteworthy."
"In 2023 Hannover Re continued to write marine business with a 
sweeping exclusion for risks from the war in Ukraine."
"We were 
gratified that our existing customer relationships helped us to 
keep our premium largely on a stable level, albeit with structural 
improvements and at more attractive prices."
"In this context we 
were able to scale back our gross exposures to various sublines 
of marine business."
"In contrast to some sublines of marine primary insurance, the 
marine reinsurance market continues to see rate increases."
"Along with the pricing arrangements, we consider a risk-ade-
quate structure to be the second precondition for favourable 
evaluation of a reinsurance programme."
"In the treaty renewals 
during the 2023 reporting period, we were able to press ahead 
with our underwriting approach."
"Building especially on existing 
customer relationships, we generally secured more attractive 
pricing and structural conditions."
"Agricultural risks  
In the face of a growing need for commodities and foodstuffs as 
well as an accumulation of extreme weather events, demand for 
insurance and reinsurance solutions is rising in business with 
agricultural risks."
"We support our customers and partners here 
with both traditional reinsurance solutions and innovative insur-
ance concepts such as index-based and parametric covers."
"In 
addition, the further expansion of public-private partnerships is 
opening up new opportunities to write profitable business in 
hitherto immature markets and close protection gaps."
"The sustainable development of the market for agricultural risks 
is contingent on improved profitability for both insurers and 
reinsurers."
"The increasing exposures must therefore also be 
clearly reflected in the rate trend."
"In terms of loss expenditures, 2023 was a quiet year."
"We further 
expanded our portfolio in Brazil in the year under review at sig-
nificantly better rates and conditions."
"The profitability of the 
business written had improved considerably after the enormous 
drought losses of 2021."
"In China and India, on the other hand, 
we scaled back our portfolio in the year under review on account 
of unattractive conditions."
"It contributed a 31% share of our Group reinsur-
ance revenue in the year under review."
"In all segments of life and health reinsurance we enjoyed sus-
tained strong demand from our clients in 2023."
"Our business in 
the year under review was once again shaped by the trend to-
wards intense competition on the global life and health reinsur-
ance markets."
"In the area of financial solutions we wrote significant new busi-
ness, above all in the United States and China."
Longevity covers are also still sought-after.
"The exacting local 
capital requirements for such business continue to drive de-
mand at primary insurers and pension funds for corresponding 
reinsurance covers."
"A positive trend in traditional reinsurance business involving 
mortality and morbidity risks was evident in Latin America and 
countries such as Italy, France and Spain, among other markets."
"The Covid-19 pandemic had no further material impacts on our 
business in 2023."
"Compared to the previous year, this had par-
ticularly positive implications for the result in the mortality seg-
ment."
"The new business CSM (net) decreased to EUR 359.2 million 
(EUR 545.3 million)."
"The new business LC (net) amounted to 
EUR 14.4 million (EUR 3.9 million)."
"In addition, contract re-
newals and amendments in the in-force portfolio increased the 
contractual service margin (net) to EUR 5,950.3 million 
(EUR 5,456.9 million)."
"Reinsurance revenue for the Life & Health reinsurance business 
group reached EUR 7.6 billion (EUR 7.8 billion); the increase in 
the reinsurance revenue would have been 1.6% at constant ex-
change rates."
"The reinsurance service result (net) improved to EUR 809.8 mil-
lion (EUR 535.1 million)."
"The reinsurance finance result (net) 
before exchange rate effects, reflecting interest accretion on 
technical provisions discounted in prior years, fell to  
EUR -158.2 million (EUR –107.9 million)."
"Investment income generated by the Life & Health reinsurance 
business group increased by 16.2% to EUR 415.4 million 
(EUR 357.4 million)."
"This includes income of EUR 13.5 million 
(EUR 87.0 million) booked from our extreme mortality cover."
"The operating result (EBIT) grew by 34.0% to EUR 871.2 mil-
lion (EUR 650.3 million) and thus surpassed our EBIT target for 
life and health reinsurance of EUR 750 million."
"The United States has for years been an exceptionally important 
insurance market in our financial solutions business and in 2023 
again played a considerable part in the total result."
"What is 
more, we further expanded our new business with structured 
financial solutions in China as well as in Europe."
"Along with 
China, our new business also fared well in other Asian markets."
"Changes in local capital requirements, which enable us to pro-
vide corresponding relief for our clients, were a factor here."
"The 
new transactions range from standardised to highly complex 
structured covers."
"Longevity Solutions 
In the Longevity Solutions reporting category, we group to-
gether our reinsurance business in which we cover longevity 
risks for our customers."
"We develop innovative annuity prod-
ucts, for example, that are tailored to the individual needs of 
policyholders in different life situations."
"They include solutions 
for deferred annuities, unit-linked annuities, for the reinsurance 
of reverse mortgages and occupied life annuities, immediate 
LTC annuities and enhanced annuities."
"The latter assure pen-
sioners with a pre-existing condition of a higher annuity pay-
ment for their remaining shortened life expectancy."
"At the same 
time, we reinsure blocks of traditional annuity policies and pen-
sion blocks."
"Overall, we recorded further growth in demand in 2023 and 
were able to close new transactions all around the world, includ-
ing for example in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the Nether-
lands."
"In the United Kingdom, which is still by far the largest market 
for coverage of longevity risks, the reinsurance volume re-
mained high – especially in the form of smaller blocks of busi-
ness and funds."
"Mortality Solutions 
Mortality Solutions account for the largest share overall of the 
premium income generated in our Life & Health reinsurance 
business group."
"We provide reinsurance protection here for our 
customers against the risk that their insureds do not live as long 
as anticipated and hence the actual mortality negatively di-
verges from the originally expected mortality."
"Compared to the previous year, business in this segment per-
formed better in virtually all markets worldwide."
"This can be at-
tributed not least to sharply lower losses from the Covid-19 pan-
demic, which were a significantly heavier drag on the result in 
recent years."
The development of new business was generally pleasing.
"In 
Latin America, for example, we successfully renewed sizeable 
portfolios and were also able to acquire further new business."
"Morbidity Solutions 
Within the Morbidity Solutions reporting category, we cover 
business centred around the risk of a deteriorating state of 
health due to disease, injury or infirmity."
"A hallmark of this busi-
ness is the wide range of possible combinations of different cov-
ered risks, including for example strict (any occupation) disabil-
ity, occupational disability and long-term care insurance."
"The morbidity segment similarly benefited from the decrease in 
Covid-19 losses in the reporting year just ended – albeit not to 
the same extent as the mortality segment."
"Business generally 
developed in line with expectations."
"As far as new business is 
concerned, we were successful in entering the German group 
life market in the second quarter."
"Ordinary investment income was on a par with the comparable 
period at EUR 1,981.5 million (EUR 1,961.1 million)."
"This can 
be attributed primarily to strong earnings from our fixed-income 
securities."
"These delivered improved coupon payments that 
more than made up for the substantially lower amortisation 
amounts booked on our inflation-linked bonds, which came to 
EUR 180.0 million (EUR 458.5 million) in the reporting period."
"This reflects reduced inflation expectations compared to the 
previous year."
"Earnings booked from alternative investment 
funds were also down on the previous year."
"Income from mea-
surement at equity increased significantly to EUR 16.3 million 
(EUR -63.2 million), principally against the backdrop of a nega-
tive special effect associated with the measurement of one of 
our participations in the previous year."
"The 
net 
losses 
realised 
on 
disposals 
amounted 
to 
EUR 153.9 million (EUR 585.3 million) and were due principally 
to sales in the context of portfolio maintenance and the reduc-
tion of our exposure to the Chinese real estate market."
"The pre-
vious year's higher realised losses were notable for the sale of 
fixed-rate debt instruments as part of restructuring moves in our 
credit portfolios to strengthen our interest income and our liq-
uidity position over the medium term."
"In accordance with IFRS 
9, corresponding realisation gains in the previous year's period 
from our private equity portfolio were not presented in the state-
ment of income, but rather recognised directly in equity."
"We increased the provisions established for expected credit 
losses (ECL) in accordance with IFRS 9 by a net amount of 
EUR 22.8 million through profit or loss in the reporting period 
(2022: EUR 119.9 million)."
"This was primarily in response to the 
default on debt instruments of an issuer from the Chinese prop-
erty sector."
"Depreciation recognised on directly held real estate 
totalled EUR 56.3 million (EUR 48.5 million), reflecting our in-
creased exposure to this sector."
"In addition, we recognised im-
pairments here in an amount of EUR 79.1 million (EUR 18.2 mil-
lion) because market values for commercial property – an im-
portant sector for our company – came under pressure globally 
in the year under review."
"We made allowance for this by recog-
nising impairments in the balance sheet for a number of directly 
held properties."
"We are not affected by the turmoil surrounding 
the insolvency of the Signa Group, which is active primarily in 
German-speaking markets."
"The net changes in the fair value of our assets recognised at fair 
value through profit or loss amounted to EUR 76.0 million 
(EUR -14.2 million)."
"Particularly significant here were positive 
changes in the fair values of derivatives relating to the technical 
account and of fixed-income securities held directly and 
through funds."
"Fair value changes affecting alternative invest-
ment funds, primarily in the real estate sector, had an opposing 
effect."
"The 
net 
investment 
income 
of 
EUR 1,588.2 million 
(EUR 965.4 million) was on a pleasing level, principally thanks 
to strong interest income that more than made up for the re-
duced return from our inflation-linked bonds."
"The generated av-
erage return of average return of 2.8% comfortably beat our 
minimum target of 2.4%."
"The main drivers here were the ordi-
nary income and the net changes in the fair value of our assets 
recognised at fair value through profit or loss, which in each 
case proved to be higher than originally planned for the year 
under review."
"To this end we adhere 
to centrally implemented investment guidelines and incorporate 
insights gained from dynamic financial analysis."
"They form the 
basis for investment ranges which are specified in light of the 
prevailing state of the market and the requirements on the lia-
bilities side and within which operational management of the 
portfolio takes place."
"These measures are intended to safeguard 
the generation of an appropriate level of return."
"In so doing, we 
pay strict attention to compliance with our clearly defined risk 
appetite, which is reflected in the risk capital allocated to the 
investments and constitutes the foundation for the asset alloca-
tion of the entire Group and the individual portfolios."
"Our ability 
to meet our payment obligations at all times is also ensured in 
this way."
"Within the scope of our asset/liability management 
(ALM) the allocation of investments by currencies and maturi-
ties is determined by the technical liabilities."
"The modified du-
ration of our bond portfolio is geared largely to the technical 
liabilities."
"By adjusting the maturity pattern of our fixed-income securities 
to the expected payment patterns of our liabilities we reduce the 
economic exposure to the interest rate risk."
"As at year-end 2023 we held 30.6% 
(30.2%) of our investments in euros, 41.1% (42.2%) in US dol-
lars, 5.3% (6.0%) in pound sterling and 6.5% (6.5%) in Aus-
tralian dollars."
"The main 
positive factors here were inflows from operational business, in-
terest rate declines in medium and longer maturities in the euro 
segment and lower risk premiums on corporate bonds."
"Repay-
ment of a bond, currency effects and higher interest rates in 
short maturities were the primary opposing factors."
"Our investments benefited from the fact that we had already 
tended to adopt a more defensive posture from the beginning of 
the previous year onwards with an eye to anticipated central 
bank moves and inflation developments."
"In addition, we had no 
defaults in our bank exposure and did not hold any positions in 
stressed US banks."
"We were able to counter the turmoil in the 
Chinese real estate sector in part with sales, but also recognised 
impairments in profit or loss."
"Furthermore, the balanced interest 
rate positioning of our investments in relation to the technical 
provisions was reflected in the balance sheet in greater re-
silience to market volatility following initial application of the 
IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting standards in the period under 
review."
"This is because it is now also recognised in the balance 
sheet that the fair values of interest rate-sensitive assets and li-
abilities react in the opposite direction to changes in market 
rates."
"High interest rate volatility therefore has only a limited 
impact on our shareholders' equity and solvency."
"Overall, we kept our asset allocation largely stable in the year 
under review."
"Only in emerging markets did we slightly expand 
our portfolio, whereas in China we reduced it."
"In view of current 
market signals, we shall maintain this rather cautious posture 
for the time being."
"In Latin America and the APAC region, we 
were able to act on market opportunities to further strengthen 
our real estate portfolio."
"At 4.7 (4.8), the modified duration of 
our fixed-income portfolio was scarcely changed compared to 
the end of the previous year."
"In all other asset classes we made only minimal changes in the 
context of regular portfolio maintenance."
"The net charges on debt instruments recognised at fair value 
through OCI in other income and expenses amounted to 
EUR 3.2 billion (EUR 4.9 billion)."
"As to the quality of the bonds 
measured in terms of rating categories, the proportion of secu-
rities rated ""A"" or better remained on a consistently high level 
of 75.8 % (76.6%) at year-end."

Holdings of alternative investment funds increased overall in the 
year under review."
"As at 31 December 2023 an amount of 
EUR 2,018.9 million (EUR 1,981.1 million) was invested in pri-
vate 
equity 
funds, 
with 
a 
further 
EUR 665.2 million 
(EUR 579.9 million) attributable predominantly to fund invest-
ments in high-yield bonds and loans."
"In addition, altogether 
EUR 1,043.8 million (EUR 945.5 million) was invested in struc-
tured real estate and infrastructure investments."
"The uncalled 
capital with respect to the aforementioned alternative invest-
ments totalled EUR 1,161.6 million (EUR 2,061.7 million)."
"At the end of the year under review, we held a total amount of 
EUR 1,224.8 million (EUR 554.3 million) in short-term invest-
ments."
"Analysis of the capital structure 
The technical provisions and liabilities are of course by far the 
most significant item in our balance sheet."
"Further elements are 
equity and equity substitutes, which help to substantially 
strengthen our financial base and optimise our cost of capital."
"The following table shows our capital structure as at 31 Decem-
ber 2023, broken down into percentages of the balance sheet 
total."
"34  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
The equity including non-controlling interests at 16.6% 
(15.8%) of the balance sheet total as well as the long-term debt 
and – especially – notes payable at altogether 7.3% (8.8%) of 
the balance sheet total represent our most important sources of 
funds."
"We ensure that our business is sufficiently capitalised at all 
times through continuous monitoring and by taking appropriate 
steering actions as necessary."
"Group shareholders' equity 
Compared to the position as at 31 December 2022, Group share-
holders’ equity increased in the year under review by 
EUR 1,062.6 million, or 10.7%, to EUR 11,019.5 million."
"After 
adjustment 
for 
non-controlling 
interests, 
it 
grew 
by 
EUR 1,067.1 million to EUR 10,126.8 million."
"The book value 
per share increased accordingly by 11.8% to EUR 83.97."
"The 
changes in the shareholders’ equity were shaped chiefly by the 
following developments: 
 
Cumulative 
foreign 
currency 
gains 
amounting 
to 
EUR 160.5 million were recorded as at the balance sheet date 
due to exchange rate movements of foreign currencies against 
the euro."
"Compared to the cumulative foreign currency gains of 
EUR 509.0 million in the previous year, this constitutes an de-
crease of EUR 348.5 million in the foreign currency gains and 
losses recognised in OCI."
"This decrease in the currency transla-
tion reserve from the translation of the shareholders’ equity of 
foreign subsidiaries resulted principally from the appreciation 
of the euro against almost all relevant currencies, especially the 
US dollar."
"The balance of unrealised gains and losses on investments stood 
at EUR -1,985.1 million, an increase of EUR 1,168.9 million 
compared to the beginning of the year under review."
"This re-
flects the declines in interest rates in medium and longer matu-
rities as well as reduced risk premiums observed in our main 
currency areas in the course of the reporting period and the as-
sociated rise in the fair values of investments sensitive to inter-
est rate movements."
"This is opposed by a corresponding interest 
rate-driven decrease of EUR 844.9 million in the fair value of our 
technical provisions and liabilities to EUR 2,026.3 million."
"Non-controlling interests in shareholders’ equity contracted by 
EUR 4.5 million to EUR 892.7 million as at 31 December 2023."
"The bulk of this – in an amount of EUR 813.3 million 
(EUR 841.8 million) – is attributable to the non-controlling in-
terests in E+S Rückversicherung AG."
"The Group net income for 2023 attributable to the shareholders 
of Hannover Rück SE amounted to EUR 1,842.8 million 
(EUR 780.8 million)."
"The non-controlling interest in the profit 
generated in the year under review totalled EUR 2.8 million 
(EUR 117.5 million)."
"In its capital management Hannover Re is guided by the require-
ments and expectations of the rating agencies with an eye to its 
targeted rating."
"Furthermore, while making appropriate al-
lowance for business policy considerations and factors that in-
fluence market presence, the allocation of capital to the Group’s 
operational companies is based upon the economic risk content 
of the business group in question."
"The Group companies are 
also subject to national capital and solvency requirements."
"All 
Group companies met the applicable local minimum capital re-
quirements in the year under review."
"Adherence to these capital 
requirements is continuously monitored by the responsible or-
ganisational units on the basis of the latest actual figures as well 
as the corresponding planned and forecast figures."
"From the 
Group perspective we manage Hannover Re’s solvency largely 
through the use of our internal capital model (cf."
"opportunity 
and risk report)."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

Financing and Group debt 
In addition to the financing effect of the changes in sharehold-
ers’ equity described above, debt financing on the capital mar-
ket is a significant component of Hannover Re’s financing."
"It is 
essentially composed of bonds issued to ensure lasting protec-
tion of our capital base – in part also in observance of rating 
requirements."
"The total volume of long-term debt and notes 
payable stood at EUR 3,977.0 million (EUR 4,472.0 million) as 
at the balance sheet date."
"Our bonds supplement our equity resources with the aim of re-
ducing the cost of capital and also help to ensure liquidity at all 
times."
"As at the balance sheet date altogether six (seven) bonds 
had been placed on the European capital market through Han-
nover Rück SE and Hannover Finance (Luxembourg) S."
"The following table presents an overview of the amortised cost 
of the issued bonds."
"For further explanatory information please see our remarks in 
the notes to this report, section 6.7 “Financing liabilities” and 
section 6.8 “Shareholders’ equity and treasury shares”."
"Various financial institutions have provided us with letters of 
credit for the collateralisation of technical liabilities."
"We report 
in detail on existing contingent liabilities in the notes, section 
9.7 “Contingent liabilities and commitments”."

Analysis of the consolidated cash flow 
statement  
Liquidity 
We generate liquidity from our operational reinsurance 
business, investing activities and financing measures."
"Through 
regular liquidity planning and by managing the fungibility of our 
investments, we ensure that Hannover Re is able to make the 
necessary payments at all times."
"Hannover Re’s cash flow is 
shown in the consolidated cash flow statement."
"Hannover Re does not conduct any automated internal cash 
pooling within the Group."
"Liquidity surpluses are managed and 
created by the Group companies."
"Various loan relationships 
exist within the Hannover Re Group for the optimal structuring 
and flexible management of the short- or long-term allocation of 
liquidity and capital."
"The increase of 
altogether 
EUR 841.7 million 
was 
due 
to 
the 
positive 
development of operational business."
"Regarding the development of the investment portfolio, please 
see also our remarks at the beginning of this subsection."
"Cash flow from financing activities 
The cash inflow from financing activities amounted on balance 
to EUR -1,504.8 million (EUR 44.2 million) in the year under 
review."
"This item includes the dividends paid out in the financial 
year by Hannover Rück SE, E+S Rückversicherung AG and other 
Group companies to parties outside the Group totalling 
EUR 768.6 million (EUR 723.5 million)."
"The balance from the 
issuance and repayment of long-term debt, especially bonds, 
which is also included in the cash flow from financing activities, 
amounted to EUR -760.6 million (EUR 767.5 million)."
"Overall, the cash and cash equivalents therefore decreased year-
on-year by EUR 268.4 million to EUR 1,054.8 million."

control, inter alia following a takeover bid, as well as the result-
ing effects."
"The company has not concluded any compensation agreements 
with the members of the Executive Board or with employees in 
the event of a takeover bid being made."

Information on 
Hannover Rück SE 
(Condensed version in accordance with the German Commercial 
Code (HGB)) 
 
Hannover Re exercises the option to present a combined man-
agement report pursuant to § 315 Para."
"5 of the German Com-
mercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with § 298 Para."
"2 of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"Supplementary to the report-
ing on the Hannover Re Group, we discuss below the develop-
ment of Hannover Rück SE."
"The annual financial statement of Hannover Rück SE is drawn 
up in accordance with German accounting principles (HGB)."
"The balance sheet and profit and loss account in particular are 
reproduced here in condensed form."
"Hannover Rück SE transacts reinsurance business in the busi-
ness groups of Property & Casualty and Life & Health reinsur-
ance."
"Through its global presence and activities in all lines of 
reinsurance, the company achieves extensive risk diversifica-
tion."
"Since 1 January 1997 Hannover Rück SE has written active rein-
surance for the Group – with few exceptions – solely in foreign 
markets."
"Responsibility within the Hannover Re Group for Ger-
man business rests with the subsidiary E+S Rückversicherung 
AG."
"Results of operations 
Hannover Rück SE recorded a pleasing business development 
in the 2023 financial year."
"The gross premium in total business 
fell by 1% to EUR 27.3 billion (previous year: EUR 27.6 billion)."
The level of retained premium decreased to 64.3% (65.4%).
"Net premium earned retreated by 3% to EUR 17.4 billion 
(EUR 17.9 billion)."
"The underwriting result (before changes in the equalisation re-
serve) came in at EUR -336.9 million (EUR 31.8 million), reflect-
ing increased retrocession costs and commissions as well as the 
strengthening of the resilience of our loss reserves."
"This is also 
evident in the combined ratio, which stood at 102.0% (101.6%)."
"An amount of EUR 594.8 million was withdrawn from the equal-
isation reserve and similar provisions in the year under review 
(previous year: allocation of EUR 548.3 million)."
"A considerable number of large losses were again recorded in 
the 2023 financial year."
"The total net expenditure on large losses 
for Hannover Rück SE amounted to EUR 936.5 million 
(EUR 938.8 million)."
"Ordinary investment income including deposit interest came to

from 
fixed-income 
securities 
totalled 
EUR 825.5 million 
(EUR 626.1 million)."
"Net gains of EUR 8.4 million (EUR 745.1 million) were realised 
on disposals, principally due to sales of fixed-income securities 
as part of portfolio maintenance."
"The previous year's exception-
ally high figure derived from the contribution of private equity 
participations to a joint venture."
"Write-downs of EUR 41.7 million (EUR 157.0 million) were 
taken on investments, for the most part on bearer debt securities 
held as fixed assets."
"In the reporting period we wrote down a 
small part of our fixed-income securities held as fixed assets to 
the lower fair value even if impairment is not expected to be 
permanent."
This similarly applies to future reporting periods.
"In 
the period under review this accounts for EUR 17.9 million (EUR 
0.0 million) of the aforementioned write-downs."
"The write-downs contrasted with write-ups of EUR 3.1 million 
(EUR 3.4 million) that were made on assets written down in pre-
vious periods to reflect increased fair values."

investment 
result 
decreased

view closed as forecast with a profit for the year that amounted 
to EUR 892.2 million (EUR 753.0 million)."
"The cooperation and exchange of business be-
tween Hannover Rück SE and E+S Rückversicherung AG has

business on all continents, thereby achieving a good diversifica-
tion of risks."
"In many instances we are directly available as a 
local point of contact thanks to our extensive network."
"In addi-
tion to traditional mortality business, we write financial solu-
tions business as well as health and longevity risks on a world-
wide basis in life and health reinsurance."
"The underwriting re-
sult in the life line amounted to altogether EUR 36.2 million 
(EUR 162.9 million)."
"Other lines 
The lines of health insurance, credit and surety, other indemnity 
insurance and other property insurance are reported together 
under other lines."
"Other property insurance consists of the ex-
tended coverage, comprehensive householder’s (contents), 
comprehensive homeowner’s (buildings), burglary and robbery, 
water damage, plate glass, engineering, loss of profits, hail, live-
stock and windstorm lines."
"Other indemnity insurance encom-
passes legal protection, fidelity as well as other pure financial

sation reserve and similar provisions."
"The hidden losses on fixed-
income securities and bond funds amounted to EUR 1,105.8 
million (EUR 2,207.2 million)."

valuation gains due to reduced risk premiums and lower interest 
rates in medium- and long-term maturities."

vestments, remained virtually unchanged at EUR 9.8 billion 
(EUR 9.6 billion)."

of Hannover Rück SE grew to EUR 60.7 billion (EUR 59.6 bil-
lion)."
"An ordinary dividend of EUR 5.00 per share plus a special divi-
dend of EUR 1.00 per share was paid out in the year under re-
view for the 2022 financial year."
"This was equivalent to 
EUR 723.6 million (EUR 693.4 million)."
"It will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 
2024 that an ordinary dividend of EUR 6.00 per share plus a 
special dividend of EUR 1.20 per share should be paid for the 
2023 financial year."
"This corresponds to a total dividend of EUR 
7.20 per share and altogether EUR 868.3 million."
"The dividend 
proposal does not form part of this consolidated financial state-
ment."

Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Risks and opportunities  
The business development of Hannover Rück SE is essentially 
subject to the same risks and opportunities as that of the Han-
nover Re Group."
"As a general principle, Hannover Rück SE 
shares in the risks of participating interests and subsidiaries ac-
cording to the amount of its respective holding; these risks are 
described in the risk report."
"The relations with participating in-
terests of Hannover Rück SE may give rise to losses from legal 
or contractual contingent liabilities (particularly novation 
clauses and guarantees)."
"Please see our explanatory remarks in 
the notes to this report."
"Other information 
We received an adequate consideration for all transactions with 
affiliated companies according to the circumstances of which 
we were aware at the time when the transactions were effected."
"We incurred no disadvantages as defined by § 311 Stock Corpo-
ration Act (AktG)."
"Hannover Rück SE maintains branches in Australia, Bahrain, 
Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, South Korea, 
Malaysia, Sweden and the United Kingdom."
"We 
thus anticipate net premium earned on the level of the previous 
year for Hannover Rück SE, a significantly improved net under-
writing result and a somewhat higher profit contribution from 
the investments."
"To this extent, the profit reported for the 2024 
financial year under the German Commercial Code (HGB) is ex-
pected to improve substantially again on the previous year."

Combined non-financial statement 
The combined non-financial statement is a section of 
the report that the legislator has expressly exempted 
from the audit of the financial statements (§ 317 Para."
"2 Sentence 6 and Sentence 4 German Commercial 
Code (HGB))."
"The combined non-financial statement 
presented here has, however, been reviewed with lim-
ited assurance by the auditing firm of Pricewater-
houseCoopers in accordance with the audit standard 
ISAE 3000 (Revised) (see the section entitled ""Audit 
opinion on non-financial reporting"")."
"The identifi-
cation of material contents reflected the materiality definitions 
of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the German Com-
mercial Code (HGB)."
"The combined non-financial statement encompasses – unless 
presented separately – the disclosures for both the Group and 
the parent company Hannover Rück SE."
"It contains the legally 
required information relating to material environmental con-
cerns, employee concerns, social issues, respect for human 
rights and combating corruption and bribery."
"Within the indi-
vidual aspects, the underlying concepts and internal due dili-
gence processes are discussed and available findings are re-
ported."
"The identified material topics were allocated to the as-
pects (see section “Materiality analysis”)."
"In addition, the com-
bined non-financial statement is to be used to report on material 
risks pursuant to § 289c Para."
"3 and 4 German Commercial 
Code (HGB) to the extent necessary for an understanding of the 
business development, business result, position of Hannover 
Rück SE and the Group as well as of the implications for non-
financial matters."
"Information is also included pursuant to the requirements of Ar-
ticle 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"1 Sentence 3 German Commercial 
Code (HGB), reference is also made to non-financial disclosures 
provided elsewhere in the combined management report with 
respect to certain aspects."
"References to information outside the 
combined management report and the consolidated and annual 
financial statement do not form part of the combined non-finan-
cial statement."
"For a description of the business model, the reader is referred 
to the subsection “Business model” under “Foundations of the 
Group”."
"Strategic orientation 
Hannover Re's Group strategy is revised every three years."
"The 
current strategy cycle 2021 – 2023 concluded at the end of 2023."
"In the Group strategy 2021 – 2023, strong governance, risk man-
agement, integrated compliance and corporate social responsi-
bility form the foundations for our growth as a reliable global 
reinsurance partner."
"Three performance drivers – preferred 
business partner, innovation catalyst, earnings growth – address 
the global trends affecting the insurance and reinsurance indus-
try."
"Three performance enablers – empowered employees, a 
lean operating model, effective capital management – help us to 
outperform the industry average in terms of return on equity."
"Four strategic initiatives – client excellence, innovation and dig-
italisation, growth in the Asia-Pacific region, talent management 
– are at the heart of the strategic programme for the cycle."
"This 
programme is complemented by major Group projects (known 
as value streams) and joint strategy contributions spanning mul-
tiple departments, which also include goals of a non-financial 
nature."
"""Corporate Social Responsibility"" is one of these joint strategy 
contributions."
"Associated topics are specified more closely in 
our Sustainability Strategy 2021 – 2023."
"This is comprised of the 
four action fields Transparency, Employees, Core Business and 
Commitment as well as underlying measures and goals."
"The strategic programme is supported and monitored by the 
Group Strategy & Sustainability department and progress re-
ports are provided to the Executive Board on a quarterly basis."
"Materiality analysis and  
material topics 
Hannover Re regularly conducts materiality analyses to identify 
material ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues, 
most recently in the 2023 reporting year."
"The materiality analy-
sis was conducted based on the publication of the Global Re-
porting Initiative (GRI Standards 2021; GRI 3) and § 289c of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"When conducting a materiality analysis, the ""materiality of im-
pacts"" and ""financial materiality"" must be considered for identi-
fied ESG topics."
"The ESG topics identified were initially taken 
from the sector-agnostic European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and then supplemented by insurance-specific topics."
"In the subsequent assessment, a distinction was made between 
three areas of Hannover Re's business: own operations, reinsur-
ance and investments."
"The survey was conducted in the form of interviews and work-
shops using a standardised questionnaire."
"The respective topics 
were scored by the stakeholders surveyed on a scale from zero 
(unimportant) to ten (important)."
"Altogether 16 interviews were conducted with 19 stakeholders 
(seven interviews with internal stakeholders; nine interviews 
with external stakeholders) for the purpose of identifying the 
positive and negative impacts of Hannover Re's business model 
(inside-out)."
"The internal stakeholders reflected the perspec-
tives of the various market and service departments."
"The exter-
nal stakeholders covered the perspectives of market partici-
pants, non-governmental organisations and the scientific com-
munity."
"Workshops were held with Group Risk Management to 
determine the financial materiality and impacts of the defined 
topics on Hannover Re's business model (outside-in)."
"The average of all the scores for each topic was transferred to a 
materiality matrix."
"A topic was defined as material as soon as 
the threshold value of 6.5 for the inside-out analysis or 5.5 for 
the outside-in analysis was exceeded."
"The materiality analysis was approved by the Executive Board 
at its meeting on 10 July 2023."
"The Code of Conduct, which was completely revised in 2022, 
was adopted by the Executive Board and duly noted by the Su-
pervisory Board."
"Hannover Re employees were informed of the 
changes through various channels."
"All new employees receive 
the Code of Conduct as an annex to their employment contract."
"The Code of Conduct is guided by the motto ""Connected – out-
side, inside, and all-around""."
"The Code of Conduct makes it clear that active or passive bribery 
will not be tolerated."
"Hannover Re expressly emphasises in its Code of Conduct that 
it does not tolerate any form of discrimination, but rather it cul-
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

tivates respectful and fair treatment of one another, which forms 
the basis of our mutual relationships."
"This also includes the re-
spectful treatment of clients and business partners as well as the 
transparent provision of pre-contractual information."
"Hannover Re considers the assessment of internal and external 
stakeholders when determining the material topics."
"Regular dis-
cussions with investors and (ESG) analysts, participation in the 
feedback process for ESG ratings and scorings as well as this 
annual reporting similarly form part of the dialogue with stake-
holder groups."
"Risk management system 
As part of its business activity as a reinsurance company, Han-
nover Re knowingly enters into many different risks."
"It is 
equipped with an adequate and effective risk management sys-
tem for ongoing monitoring of these and other risks."
"Within the scope of its risk management system Hannover Re 
considers, among other things, sustainability risks, i.e."
"those 
risks that arise in connection with environmental issues, social 
issues or in connection with corporate governance."
"Such risks 
can adversely impact the company's assets and earnings."
"They 
include, for example, the risk of more frequent natural disasters 
caused by climate change."
"However, there is also the risk that 
Hannover Re's business activity may have – real or perceived – 
negative implications for social sustainability goals."
"This latter 
aspect, in particular, can affect Hannover Re's reputation."
"Han-
nover Re has a framework applicable Group-wide for the man-
agement of sustainability and reputational risks, which was re-
viewed and approved by the Executive Board in the year under 
review."
"For further information, we refer to the opportunity and risk re-
port in the combined Group management report."
"Information security and data protection 
For details regarding information security and data protection, 
we refer to the opportunity and risk report in the combined 
Group management report."
"Compliance management system 
Compliance encompasses not only compliance with statutory 
and regulatory requirements (legal compliance) but also fulfil-
ment of external standards, such as those from the German Cor-
porate Governance Code, as well as internal guidelines."
"At Han-
nover Re, compliance topics are addressed in a compliance 
management system."
"Execution falls to the Chief 
Compliance Officer (CCO), who reports in a direct line to the 
Executive Board on material compliance issues and develop-
ments."
"The annual compliance report is also submitted to the 
Supervisory Board and its Finance and Audit Committee."
"The 
CCO is supported in his work by the Compliance department, 
specially designated officers and a worldwide network of local 
compliance officers."
"Monitoring procedures are conducted for 
the management of compliance risks."
"Checks can also take place 
on an ad hoc basis where there are grounds for suspicion."
"The 
underlying compliance risk analysis is updated annually.The 
CCO works closely with Risk Management to ensure a consistent 
approach to operational risks, which include compliance risks."
"Several compliance committees also exist in various composi-
tions, comprised of members from the operational business 
groups as well as from the areas of Group Legal, Finance, Ac-
counting and Investments."
"Among other things, the compliance 
committees examine reinsurance treaties with a special eye to 
compliance with supervisory requirements and accounting stan-
dards and they take fundamental decisions on dealing with 
sanctions."
"Attentive and trained employees constitute a crucial component 
of a functioning compliance management system – both to avoid 
unconscious violations and to recognise and prevent deliberate 
violations and associated risks."
"Hannover Re uses various train-
ing activities to raise employee awareness of compliance-related 
issues."
"On joining the Group and throughout the entire duration 
of their employment, all members of staff receive compliance 
training."
"These training activities cover, among other things, 
topics such as combating money laundering and terrorist fi-
nancing as well as compliance with international sanctions."
"Our 
staff are also provided with information about the internal, on-
line speak-up system."
"In addition, focused training activities are 
held on various compliance topics throughout the year for spe-
cific target groups."
"This is supplemented by dedicated compli-
ance pages in the intranet containing more extensive informa-
tion."
"The speak-up 
system is available in four languages."
"In addition, violations can 
be reported in any language by e-mail."
"For further information, we refer to the opportunity and risk re-
port in the combined Group management report."
"Environmental concerns 
In connection with environmental matters, special importance 
attaches to the active exploration of the causes and conse-
quences of progressive climate change."
"What is 
more, further environmental concerns, such as the proper func-
tioning of ecosystems or the water resources of ground and sur-
face waters, are directly affected by climate change."
"If the 
earth’s temperature were to continue rising unchecked, this 
would increase the scale of such phenomena and risks."
"Yet the 
sought-after transition to a climate-friendly, resource-saving 
economy is also associated with a number of social and eco-
nomic impacts."
"In view of these extensive environmental, economic and social 
impacts, climate change is at the heart of numerous national and 
international regulatory initiatives and measures."
"The goals of 
the Paris Climate Agreement, under which the international 
community committed in 2015 to limit the rise in the global av-
erage temperature to well below 2 °C, preferably to 1.5 °C, com-
pared to pre-industrial levels, are considered a key driving force 
here."
"Overall, far-reaching implications are to be anticipated in 
this connection not only for the real economy but also for the 
financial sector, which has an important role to play both in cli-
mate change adaptation and when it comes to climate protec-
tion."
"Impacts on operations 
Climate change goes hand-in-hand with a range of impacts on 
Hannover Re’s operations, e.g."
"due to an increase in the fre-
quency and/or severity of losses (physical risks) or changing 
framework conditions with implications for reinsurance busi-
ness and investments (transition risks)."
"Furthermore, on the so-
cietal level an increase in environment-related lawsuits against 
businesses and public institutions can be observed (litigation 
risks) that may adversely affect the insurance industry."
"The risks posed by climate change can affect numerous risk cat-
egories of the risk register and are extensively monitored 
through the risk management system."
"ESG topics are also ad-
dressed as part of the management of sustainability and reputa-
tional risks."
"For information on the corresponding concepts and 
implemented stress test mechanisms, we refer to the opportu-
nity and risk report in the combined Group management report."
"Impacts of our operations 
Insurance business 
Fossil fuels are considered one of the main drivers of climate 
change."
"With a view to countering this and facilitating the trans-
formation to a lower-emissions economy, we support among 
other steps the expansion of renewable energy sources."
"These 
range from wind energy (both onshore and offshore) to photo-
voltaic and geothermal energy."
"Insurance protection begins 
with installation of the equipment and accompanies customers 
through many years of operation."
"In addition, we support spe-
cial coverages for the roll-out of new technologies, such as per-
formance guarantees for fuel cells (conversion of hydrogen or 
natural gas into electricity)."
"Furthermore, our products support 
the development of hydrogen infrastructure worldwide and we 
are participating in initial large-scale projects to advance the en-
ergy transition."
"At the same time, Hannover Re is consistently seeking to reduce 
its exposure to fossil fuels."
"The goal is to no longer cover any 
risks connected with the mining of and energy generation from 
power plant and thermal coal by the year 2038 in the entire port-
folio of property and casualty reinsurance business."
"An internal 
position paper has been adopted for the property and casualty 
reinsurance sector, fleshing out this approach in greater detail 
and addressing further issues (such as oil and gas)."
"The position 
paper is applicable to both facultative and obligatory reinsur-
ance business."
"In addition, the facultative division is guided by an ESG manual 
that deals with environmental issues, among other things, and 
regulates specific exclusions."
"In facultative reinsurance business, reinsurance contracts are 
written for individual risks, i.e."
"the treaties can be allocated to 
specific projects or policyholders."
"Since as long ago as April 
2019 the facultative division has no longer provided reinsurance 
for planned new coal-fired plants or thermal coal mines."
"More-
over, from February 2020 onwards all new facultative business 
connected with thermal coal or the associated infrastructure has 
been excluded."
"Thermal coal infrastructure encompasses 
mines, coal-fired power plants and facilities as well as port and 
rail operations allocable exclusively to the thermal coal industry."
"Reinsurance covers for individual risks that generate more than 
30% of their revenues from activities in thermal coal are simi-
larly excluded in the facultative division."
"As an additional step, 
an exit plan for existing facultative business in thermal coal was 
adopted in 2021."
"The phased plan provides for exclusions based 
on thresholds."
"It is envisaged that these thresholds will be progres-
sively reduced in the following years until complete exclusion of 
all thermal coal risks."
"Any expansion of existing capacities in the 
context of contract renewals is already ruled out."
"The facultative division also does not reinsure any new stand-
alone oil-fired power plants that were not in operation or under 
construction by 1 July 2023."
"Since as long ago as 2020, the facultative division has no longer 
accepted any new individual risks for companies that hold 20% 
or more of their oil reserves in oil sands and it excludes oil sands 
extraction and processing operations."
"The reinsurance treaties 
in the currently existing portfolio will not be renewed from 2025 
onwards."
"Oil sands extraction and processing encompass the 
extraction of bitumen from bituminous sand, refinement into 
synthetic crude oil, further processing of this synthetic crude 
into petroleum products and the associated transportation by 
pipeline or rail."
"Since 2021 the facultative division has no longer accepted any 
new risks connected with projects for the extraction of oil and 
gas in Arctic regions – this policy applies to both greenfield and 
brownfield projects."
"We define ""Arctic regions"" as the zone 
around the Arctic Circle which runs in a circle of latitude 66.34° 
north of the Equator."
"This includes the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge (ANWR) in the United States."
"In addition, no risks are 
written that are connected with the development of new oil and 
gas deposits in deep waters below 5,000 feet."
"In addition, the 
facultative division has not underwritten any projects connected 
with deep sea mining since 2023."
"The facultative division similarly declines transactions if they 
may entail damage to protected wetlands (Ramsar Convention) 
or damage to UNESCO world cultural heritage sites."
"In obligatory reinsurance, large-volume portfolios with some-
times heterogenous contents are accepted."
"We are engaged in 
talks with our customers to obtain an overview of the carbon 
intensity of the business ceded to us."
"We also began a dialogue 
with our clients in the year under review to gain a better under-
standing of their environmental strategies and goals, as well as 
their plans to reduce their portfolio's exposure to fossil fuels."
"We are already refraining from writing new treaties in obligatory 
reinsurance that are to be used exclusively for coverage of ther-
mal coal risks."
"The same is true of new treaties geared exclu-
sively to the exploration and/or development of new (greenfield) 
oil and gas reserves (upstream) or exclusively to transportation 
and storage (midstream) of such (greenfield) oil and gas re-
serves."
"We offer Web-based training courses on ESG for underwriters 
in property and casualty reinsurance and in life and health rein-
surance as well as for other interested employees."
"Investments 
ESG criteria are similarly applied to the assets under our own 
management."
"These are defined in writing in an internal Re-
sponsible Investment Policy, application of which is ensured by 
an ESG officer on the investment team."
"In its investing activities Hannover Re similarly works to consis-
tently reduce its carbon footprint."
"The focus here is on progres-
sive decarbonisation of the asset portfolio."
"We are doing this, in 
the first place, by reducing the carbon footprint (Scope 1 and 2) 
of the investments under own management from the areas of 
corporate bonds, covered bonds and equities by 30% by the 
year 2025 compared to the base year of 2019."
"Our decarbonisa-
tion efforts are guided by various external analyses and ratings 
that give us an extensive overview of our investment portfolio's 
carbon footprint as well as qualitative information about the car-
bon risks associated with individual issuers."
"Only a few niche funds or asset classes, such as real 
estate, private equity or structured investments, cannot be ana-
lysed using this system."
"Similarly, corresponding screening is 
carried out with an eye to existing ESG criteria before any new 
investments are made."
"Issuers who do not satisfy these criteria 
are actively scaled back."
"When it comes to environmental concerns, Hannover Re applies 
specific exclusion criteria to issuers that generate 25% or more 
of their revenues from the mining of or power generation from 
thermal coal or from oil sands extraction."
"We similarly exclude 
companies that generate 10% or more of their revenues from 
offshore extraction of oil and gas in the region within the Arctic 
Circle (66° 34' N)."
"In addition to application of the aforementioned exclusion crite-
ria, best-in-class analyses have also increasingly complemented 
our ESG management since 2019."
"They facilitate ongoing mon-
itoring of the existing portfolio's sustainability quality and are 
used in the implementation of specific ESG portfolio measures."
"Furthermore, Hannover Re is increasingly adding to its asset 
portfolio sustainable investments that support the transforma-
tion towards a resource-efficient economy."
"These include infra-
structure assets in areas such as renewable energies or clean 
transportation as well as investments in dedicated impact funds 
and sustainable technologies."
"We comfortably surpassed our 
 
48  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
goal of increasing the volume by at least 10% by the end of 2023 
compared to the end of 2020."
"Such opportunities are opening up, for example, through 
wider use of parametric covers on the underwriting side, growth 
in natural catastrophe business and expanded solutions for mit-
igation of / adaptation to climate-related risks."
"The same is true 
of investment opportunities in sustainable innovative technolo-
gies and economic sectors."
"Growing importance is attached to sustain-
ability-related aspects in all phases of their employment."
"Most 
notably, the demographic shift in industrial countries is leading 
to intensified competition for well-qualified junior staff."
"It is ev-
ident that members of Generations X, Y and Z are especially 
likely to consider not only monetary aspects when it comes to 
choosing their employer."
"At the same time, existing 
trends such as mobile working and virtual/hybrid meetings have 
gained added impetus."
"Employees are part of a company and part of social structures 
outside that company."
"All measures taken strengthen Hannover 
Re’s position on the labour market while at the same time having 
external implications."
"For this reason, we have chosen not to 
consider the impacts separately below."
"Impacts on our operations and impacts of our 
operations 
As a service provider in the insurance industry, Hannover Re 
operates in a highly specialised environment and at the same 
time finds itself faced with the framework conditions described 
above."
"A risk exists, for example, if vacancies cannot be filled 
quickly enough or candidates of the necessary quality cannot be 
appointed."
"At the same time, companies benefit directly from 
motivated, dedicated and high-performing employees."
"A Talent Management initiative sponsored by the Chief Execu-
tive Officer was launched in 2020."
"In addition, the ini-
tiative envisages measures to promote global mobility, the opti-
misation of relevant processes and systems as well as a greater 
interlinking of worldwide human resources activities."
"For information on operational risks that can arise in connection 
with or independently of the activities of the workforce, the 
reader is referred to the opportunity and risk report."
"For information about the requirements placed on the specialist 
qualifications and personal reliability (fit & proper criteria) of 
persons in key positions, we refer to the opportunity and risk 
report."
"Hannover Re employed 3,756 members of staff (previous year: 
3,519) Group-wide at the reference date of 31 December 2023."
"Development opportunities 
Hannover Re operates in a knowledge-intensive industry with a 
high level of specialisation."
"Continuous and appropriate (fur-
ther) training of employees serves to assure the high quality 
standard of services and a positive perception of the company."
"At the same time, the programme of further training enables 
employees to continue their personal growth and it promotes 
life-long learning."
"In support of our approach to talent manage-
ment, our goal is to align ongoing training activities more 
closely with the values, competencies and leadership fundamen-
tals and to extend reporting to additional locations."
"The global 
leadership development programme ""LEAD"" launched back in 
2021 was conducted multiple times in the year under review on 
both the Group management and team manager level."
"Addi-
tional modules for a comprehensive Leadership Development 
Journey as well as a mentoring programme have been added."
"A 
global assignment policy was also approved in 2021 and the in-
ternal job market was expanded to all locations around the 
world."
"Both of these measures made themselves felt again in the 
year under review and created added transparency around the 
internal filling of positions on the global level."
"Health and wellness 
The performance capability and health of our employees are es-
sential prerequisites for sustainable development of our busi-
ness."
"Given that they work for a service provider, our staff mem-
bers do not engage in activities that expose them to particular 
risk."
"With a view to protecting the health of the workforce, the appli-
cable employment protection legislation as well as requirements 
relating to ergonomic workplace design are systematically ob-
served and reviewed worldwide."
"Particularly close attention was 
paid to this issue in connection with the redesign of workplaces 
as part of ""New Ways of Working""."
"Instruction in health and 
safety at the workplace is provided regularly."
"In addition, well-
ness among staff is actively encouraged through health promo-
tion measures; these are in place worldwide, but are tailored to 
local needs in each case."
"Diversity and equal opportunities 
Supporting fair working conditions as well as a healthy and non-
discriminatory working environment is part of Hannover Re’s 
corporate culture."
"The Executive Board has recognised the Core 
Labour Standards of the Initial Labour Organization (ILO) for 
100% of the workforce."
"Hannover Re does not tolerate discrim-
ination or bullying in any form whatsoever and has enshrined 
this in a company-wide Code of Conduct."
"Furthermore, the right 
to form employee representative bodies and engage in collective 
bargaining negotiations over working conditions is recognised; 
employees are neither advantaged not disadvantaged on ac-
count of their membership of a trade union or employee repre-
sentative body."
"Hannover Re and its Executive Board are committed to equal 
opportunities in relation to diversity criteria and on all hierar-
chical levels."
"A current focus of the measures is on supporting 
women in leadership positions."
"Of the 174 senior executives 
around the world, 44 are women; this is equivalent to a propor-
tion of 25.3%."
"Our goal is to increase diversity on all levels of 
management worldwide."
"Explicit targets have also been set for 
the two management levels below the Executive Board, which 
can be found in the Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"As part of the Talent Management initiative, a DE&I strategy was 
developed in 2021 that builds on our purpose and values."
"We 
aim to ""create opportunities together"" while also being ""some-
what different""."
"Based on the DE&I strategy, we pressed ahead 
with implementation of the action plan with nine focus areas 
from 2022."
"In this context, for example, the women's network 
""Women@Hannover Re"" continued to expand in the year under 
review, further progress was evident in closing the gender pay 
gap and recruitment processes around the world were imple-
mented systematically with a focus on diversity."
"Techniques for more objective 
decision-making are also being integrated."
"Compatibility of the professional and private sphere is closely 
correlated with issues of diversity and equal opportunities."
"The 
Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated certain developments in the 
world of work that had already begun in prior years."
"These in-
clude, for example, greater combination of an office workspace 
with remote working as well as flexible working time models 
tailored to the employee’s situation."
"These changes are increas-
ingly becoming an integral component of a state-of-the-art, agile 
working environment and enhance the company’s attractive-
ness on the labour market as well as the satisfaction, loyalty and 
performance readiness of the workforce."
"Opportunities 
We link all measures to the possibility of recruiting, retaining 
and optimally fostering the best employees on the market."
"Such protection against threats to their 
livelihood is especially important in countries where social se-
curity systems are weak or not present at all."
"Yet it is here, in 
particular, that the comparatively high vulnerability of the pop-
ulation contrasts with what is still overall a minimal supply of 
insurance solutions tailored to the relevant financial, social and 
cultural requirements."
"In addition to protecting against personal life risks, insurance 
solutions also offer protection for economic activities."
"Conse-
quently, they form a vital basis not only for the economic devel-
opment of national economies but also for a transition from an 
informal economy – in which the vast majority of employees and 
their families enjoy scarcely any social protection – to a formal 
economy."
"Impacts on our operations 
Social issues can affect our operations in many ways."
"For exam-
ple, Hannover Re covers property damage resulting from social 
unrest under its reinsurance business."
"Growing social dispari-
ties can be associated with more frequent and severe social un-
rest."
"As part of the risk management of its reinsurance activities, 
Hannover Re also considers trends relating to current or future 
developments in social issues."
"Insurance business 
In our insurance business, we encourage the expansion of prod-
ucts that offer financial protection against extreme weather 
events."
"By covering insurance solutions such as micro- and agri-
cultural insurance products, we also contribute to economic de-
velopment in structurally deprived regions."
"This enables people 
with limited financial resources, particularly in regions that are 
severely affected by climate change, to protect themselves 
against basic risks such as the consequences of natural disasters 
or crop failures."
"To simplify access to insurance, we are also actively involved 
worldwide in the development of parametric insurance solutions 
and index-based covers."
"These products insure and settle claims 
on the basis of defined and clearly determinable parameters 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
51 
such as the amount of precipitation or wind speeds."
"In this case, 
the sum paid out is defined in advance and depends on the oc-
currence of a trigger event and not on the actual loss."
"Where 
risks are insurable, parametric insurance products can help to 
make coverage more accessible, settle claims more quickly and 
thus close the protection gap in many areas."
"In life and health reinsurance, too, we offer our worldwide cus-
tomers – primary insurers – reinsurance solutions tailored to 
their individual needs and support them around the world with 
our expertise and power of innovation in the development and 
launch of new insurance products."
"Our offerings span life and 
annuity insurance products, solutions for critical illness, inca-
pacity for work and long-term care as well as insurance products 
containing wellness and/or lifestyle components."
"Many of these 
solutions address special needs of end consumers or target 
groups that have hitherto not been adequately met by existing 
standardised products on account of specific requirements or 
challenges."
"Investments 
A budget for investments in dedicated impact funds was set up 
back in 2019."
"The primary objective here is to achieve apprecia-
ble improvements in the fields of food security and nutrition, 
education, health and well-being, ending poverty and climate 
action, among others, through the broadest possible coverage 
of the United Nations Social Development Goals (SDGs)."
"We 
were invested in 29 of these funds with a special impact focus 
as at 31 December 2023, with capital commitments entered into 
totalling around USD 150 million."
"In addition, we invest through 
funds and directly in the infrastructure sector in renewables and 
clean transportation concepts as well as in sustainable forest 
and agriculture funds."
"Opportunities 
We see particular opportunities in the context of the continued 
protection gap existing between economic and insured values 
and on the basis of changing requirements in the life sector."
"In life and health reinsurance, examples similarly include the 
cultivation of new markets through innovative insurance solu-
tions connected with changing demographics, special insurance 
solutions for new forms of community, service offerings for se-
niors and digitalisation."
"The requirements placed on companies in relation to human 
rights were fleshed out in greater detail in 2011 through the en-
dorsement of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Hu-
man Rights by the UN Human Rights Council."
"Companies are 
urged to implement adequate safeguards in order to avoid hu-
man rights risks within their entrepreneurial scope of influence."
"Hannover Re has issued a corresponding policy statement 
which can be viewed on its website."
"Statements on the Modern 
Slavery Act 2015 (United Kingdom) and the Modern Slavery Act 
2018 (Australia) are also published there."
"As a signatory to the 
United Nations Global Compact, Hannover Re also releases an 
annual progress report on the Ten Principles."
"Impacts on our operations 
Reputational and compliance risks could materialise in connec-
tion with the non-financial aspect."
"In view of our business oper-
ations, no direct and/or severe risks were identified."
"Please see 
the opportunity and risk report in the combined Group manage-
ment report for further information."
"Impacts of our operations 
As an internationally operating reinsurer, we consider impacts 
in relation to potential human rights violations from the perspec-
tive of the rightsholders."
"Employees 
In view of the fact that our employees are highly qualified spe-
cialists and we attach the utmost priority to compliance with ap-
plicable national regulations, collective bargaining provisions 
and company rules, we do not see any risk of serious violations 
of human rights."
"That said, issues such as discrimination, equal 
opportunities and oppression require constant attention and 
monitoring."
"We manage these issues in the context of our hu-
man resources management structure."
"For further information 
we refer to the remarks in connection with the aspect “Em-
ployee concerns”."
"We protect employee data through rigorous 
compliance with statutory data protection requirements."
"Suppliers 
Hannover Re does not have a traditional upstream or down-
stream supply chain of raw and auxiliary materials or produced 
goods as is the case with, for example, manufacturing compa-
nies."
"Nevertheless, we too source a broad range of goods and 
services."
"Hannover Re has a Third Party Code of Conduct for 
suppliers, the currently valid version of which was adopted by 
the Executive Board in the year under review and replaced the 
existing version upon entry into force."
"It additionally includes an explicit reference to the whistle-
blower system and various access channels."
"As far as human rights due diligence is concerned, we see the 
greatest risk in connection with the procurement of IT hard-
ware."
"For this reason, we have adopted an IT Procurement 
Guideline that is valid Group-wide and contains consistent rules 
governing the purchasing of IT products throughout the organ-
isation."
"All bottleneck, leverage and strategic suppliers are sub-
ject to monitoring."
"Recognition of the Third Party Code of Con-
duct or submission of the supplier's own more extensive code 
of conduct is mandatory."
"As of 31 December 2023 100% of core 
IT suppliers have committed to compliance with the Third Party 
Code of Conduct or equivalent rules."
"Insurance business 
With regard to our activities in insurance business, we refer to 
the remarks made in connection with the aspect “Environmental 
concerns”."
"Based on our risk analysis, we identified the greatest 
risk of potentially detrimental impacts on human rights in the 
following, particularly exposed areas: large construction 
projects (incl."
"dams, oil and gas projects, mines and pipelines), 
mining operations as well as companies connected with inter-
nationally banned weapons."
"The facultative division's ESG man-
ual provides for a screening process to identify and decline 
transactions that entail an inherent risk of severe breaches of 
fundamental human rights."
"Underwriters on both the property and casualty and the life and 
health reinsurance side are offered instruction in ESG issues in 
the form of a Web-based training programme."
"Investments 
As far as our activities relating to assets under own management 
are concerned, we refer to the remarks made in connection with 
the aspect “Environmental concerns” and the negative screen-
ing process described there."
"This is based inter alia on the Ten 
Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC); six of 
these Principles explicitly address the issues of human rights 
and labour standards."
"Our investment guidelines also exclude 
issuers involved in the development and proliferation of interna-
tionally banned weapons."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

Opportunities 
No particular opportunities are identified in connection with this 
non-financial aspect."
"On the political and ad-
ministrative level, corruption influences decision-making and 
the execution of approved measures in favour of individuals or 
parts of the population."
"This erodes trust in the state and can 
become a threat to state legitimacy as well as to democratic in-
stitutions."
"On the economic level, corruption distorts competi-
tion and causes business transactions to become more expen-
sive while obstructing the efficient use of resources."
"Combating 
corruption and bribery forms part of our compliance manage-
ment system."
"Impacts on our operations 
Compliance risks may become relevant in connection with the 
non-financial aspect “Combating corruption and bribery”."
"In view 
of the business operations and implemented structures, no di-
rect and/or severe risks were identified."
"For further information 
the reader is referred to the opportunity and risk report in the 
combined Group management report."
"Impacts of our operations 
Any form of unlawful or corrupt behaviour inflicts considerable 
harm on society and impedes free and fair competition."
"Compa-
nies in the financial sector have an important role to play when 
it comes to prevention and execution."
"Hannover Re has a so-
phisticated governance and compliance management system 
and adopts the “three lines of defence” approach."
"For details of 
the implemented structures please see the opportunity and risk 
report in the combined Group management report."
"Opportunities 
No particular opportunities are identified in connection with this 
non-financial aspect."
"The Taxonomy is a central element of the EU Action Plan 
for Financing Sustainable Growth and is intended – as a unified 
classification system – to foster transparency on sustainability 
in the financial market."
"The Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 supple-
menting Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation currently fo-
cuses exclusively on activities that contribute to mitigating or 
adapting to climate change."
"In this context, both the invest-
ments of the Hannover Re Group and our reinsurance solutions 
in property and casualty business fall within the scope of con-
sideration."
"Reinsurance business 
Reinsurance solutions that protect against climate-related natu-
ral perils such as flood or storm damage can contribute to cli-
mate change adaptation."
"The provision of corresponding rein-
surance capacities increases resilience in the face of natural 
catastrophes by protecting those impacted and compensating 
them in case of loss."
"Furthermore, reinsurance solutions ensure 
the continuation of major projects and the development of new 
technologies, thereby sustainably fostering economic growth."
"Long-standing experience in risk assessment and risk manage-
ment facilitates the early detection of new and emerging risks 
and the development of appropriate risk transfer solutions."
"The Taxonomy eligibility of our reinsurance activity specifies 
what proportion of our economic activities is described in the 
Taxonomy and for which economic activities technical screen-
ing criteria have been developed."
"These criteria determine the 
substantial contribution to the set environmental objectives, 
prevent harm to other environmental objectives and are in-
tended to ensure adherence to social minimum standards."
"The 
proportions of the economic activities established using the 
screening criteria are Taxonomy-aligned and must be reported 
for the first time for the 2023 financial year."
"Note: 
The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the underlying delegated acts 
contain requirements and passages that make unambiguous and 
consistent interpretation and implementation difficult."
"The new requirements will be explored in 
depth over the coming reporting year."
"As a reinsurer, we are also dependent on exten-
sive external data supplied by our clients and business partners 
in order to adequately analyse our Taxonomy alignment, many 
of whom are not subject to any European reporting obligation."
"Data gaps – which in some cases will be considerable – must be 
expected in the early reporting years in connection with infor-
mation on the avoidance of significant harm."
"Further informa-
tion on the conservative handling of such data gaps is provided 
in the corresponding description."
"Taxonomy eligibility 
In reinsurance business, we consider all revenues of one of the 
lines of business described in the Commission Delegated Regu-
lation (EU) 2021/2139 under Solvency II to be Taxonomy-eligi-
ble if direct covers of climate-related natural hazards can be es-
tablished."
"Evidence is provided, on the one hand, by our internal 
risk control and additionally by specific evidence of a corre-
sponding contract from each identified line of business."
"Subject 
to further specifications by the legislator, all other lines of busi-
ness that do not include direct climate-relevant covers or are not 
described in the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2021/2139 are classified as Taxonomy-non-eligible."
"It must 
then be demonstrated that these activities do not have a nega-
tive impact on the environmental objective of ""climate protec-
tion"" and that the minimum safeguards are met."
"Substantial contribution 
For reinsurance companies, the Commission Delegated Regula-
tion (EU) 2021/2039 includes five dedicated technical screening 
criteria."
"For further information on our approach to dealing with 
these risks we refer to our “Opportunity and risk report”."
"Supporting development and supply of enabling non-life rein-
surance products 
Hannover Re has implemented processes to ensure that the 
major needs of its clients regarding climate-related natural 
hazards are considered in reinsurance products."
"The pricing of 
such products is risk-based, meaning that preventive measures 
to minimise these risks (e.g."
"adherence to certain building 
standards) can be factored into the pricing."
"In the case of 
obligatory business, only the share of a portfolio's premiums 
that meet the technical screening criteria is reported as 
aligned."
"Innovative reinsurance coverage solutions 
Hannover Re supports the development of innovative reinsur-
ance solutions with regard to climate-related natural hazards in 
order to satisfy the growing needs of its clients and society."
"Data sharing 
Hannover Re engages in a regular exchange with local authori-
ties and shares data on request for analytical purposes to ad-
vance knowledge about changes caused by climate change."
"The requirements of technical screening criterion 4.1 are thus 
fully met."
"High level of service in post-disaster situation 
If large loss events connected with climate-related natural haz-
ards occur, Hannover Re has implemented high standards of 
claims management and takes fair and prompt action with re-
spect to its clients."
"Compliance with the technical screening criteria can be ensured 
through standardised processes, work instructions and guide-
lines."
"These apply to all reinsurance products (in both obligatory 
and facultative business) that are in principle considered to be 
Taxonomy-eligible and where we serve as risk carrier."
"This includes, among other things, wind-related nat-
ural hazards such as storms, water-related natural hazards such 
as floods and heavy rain, and temperature-related natural haz-
ards such as heatwaves and wildfires."
"The revenues that we 
recognise as Taxonomy-aligned on this basis thus make a sub-
stantial contribution to social adaptation to perils associated 
with climate change."
"Avoidance of significant harm 
In order to be able to recognise economic activities as sustain-
able within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy, it must be en-
sured that they do not significantly harm other environmental 
objectives (""Do No Significant Harm"", DNSH)."
"For reinsurance 
activities, this must be established for environmental objective 
1 ""Climate change mitigation""."
"This means that the activities 
recognised as sustainable do not include the transfer of insur-
ance for the extraction, storage, transport or production of fossil 
fuels or the transfer of insurance for vehicles, property, plant 
and equipment or other facilities used for these purposes."
"Hannover Re has implemented processes to ensure that the rev-
enues reported as Taxonomy-aligned do not include any covers 
related to fossil fuels as described above."
"In order to identify 
these covers in our obligatory reinsurance activities (the cover-
age of large portfolios), we are dependent on data supplied by 
our clients and brokers, which we actively request."
"In this re-
spect, sometimes sizeable data gaps are evident in the year un-
der review."
"Portfolios for which no information whatsoever is 
available are conservatively considered to be Taxonomy-non-
aligned."
"It can be assumed that increasing data coverage over 
the coming years will affect the ratio of Taxonomy-aligned rev-
enues."
"Compliance with minimum safeguards 
Economic activities must be carried out in accordance with the 
minimum safeguards criteria if they are to be reported as Tax-
onomy-aligned."
"In the absence of further clarification from the 
European Commission on this topic, we base our assessment on 
the requirements of the ""Final Report on Minimum Safeguards"" 
published by the Platform on Sustainable Finance (PSF) in Oc-
tober 2022."
"Four core topics that companies should consider are 
specified here: 
• Respect for human rights 
• Prevention of corruption and bribery 
• Fair taxation 
• Fair competition 
 
Hannover Re has implemented processes for all four core topics 
to ensure compliance in its business activities."
"There are no 
known incidents or pending proceedings for the reporting year 
that would indicate a breach of the minimum safeguards re-
quirements."
"Further information on reported key performance indicators:  
The Taxonomy KPIs for the 2023 financial year include disclo-
sures on our eligible and aligned revenues from economic ac-
tivity 10.2 Reinsurance (NACE Code K65.2.0)."
"The mandatory 
template for (re)insurance undertakings contained in Annex X 
to the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 was 
used for the presentation."
"In this context, the stated KPIs refer 
to the Group revenues of Hannover Re recognised and consoli-
dated in accordance with IFRS 17."
"Since disclosures on Taxon-
omy alignment were determined for the first time, we do not 
report any prior-year figures."
"Nor do we report any prior-year 
 
56  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
figures for Taxonomy eligibility, as our revenues had to be 
recognised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 17 for 
the first time in the year under review."
"Pursuant to the draft 
FAQs of the European Commission released on 21 December 
2023, we only report the premiums that demonstrably serve to 
provide concrete coverage for climate-related natural hazards 
as Taxonomy-aligned (premium split)."
"Premiums identified as 
connected with fossil fuels are deducted from these premiums."
"The Taxonomy ratio is derived from the Taxonomy-aligned rev-
enues (numerator) over the total revenues in non-life insurance 
business (denominator)."
"The share of the aligned revenues from 
our retrocession activities is determined from internal retroces-
sion ratios of our lines of business relevant to natural hazards."
"Our KPIs can be found in the table contained in the annex to this 
subsection."
"Investments 
The key performance indicators (KPIs) relating to the EU Tax-
onomy are determined in accordance with the requirements of 
the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178."
"At the 
present time, these are not incorporated into strategic business 
decisions because there is still considerable uncertainty around 
how they are to be understood as well as room for interpretation."
"The environmental sustainability of investing activities is man-
aged using other approaches."
"The denominator is derived from the investments of Hannover 
Re shown in the balance sheet excluding funds withheld."
"The 
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 further 
specifies under Article 7 (1) the exclusion of all exposures to 
central governments, central banks and supranational issuers 
from the calculation of the denominator."
"The observation horizon of the numerator includes, in particular, 
securities exposures to issuers covered by the European report-
ing obligation pursuant to the ""Non-Financial Reporting Direc-
tive"" (NFRD) as well as tangible assets and loans where the spe-
cific purpose of the lending is known."
"In the case of issuers whose reg-
istered office is within the EU, a check is made to verify the obli-
gation to publish non-financial information."
"As far as investment 
funds are concerned, the methodology has been changed in 
comparison with the previous year, with the result that this year 
around EUR 650 million in real estate funds are no longer re-
ported in the numerator as Taxonomy-eligible."
"In the case of issuers sub-
ject to a reporting obligation, the Taxonomy ratios published in 
the context of non-financial reporting are applied to the invest-
ments of Hannover Re."
"The reported ratios are similarly either 
obtained from an external service provider or subsequently ac-
quired manually, where such ratios are not available."
"All investments in tangible assets connected with the purchase 
and ownership of real estate are generally considered to be Tax-
onomy-eligible."
This includes investment property.
"One invest-
ment property is also considered to be Taxonomy-aligned be-
cause the technical screening criteria, the ""Do no significant 
harm"" criteria and compliance with minimum safeguards could 
be established."
"It has not so far been possible to establish Tax-
onomy alignment for 94% of the real estate assets."
"We were 
able to obtain information regarding the correct classification of 
around 96% of the total investments considered for the numer-
ator without undue effort."
"The missing roughly 4% will initially 
be conservatively reported as Taxonomy-non-eligible this year."
"We are making every effort to gradually enhance the data quality 
and coverage and it is our expectation that the information base 
will continue to improve, in part through progressive standard-
isation of the reporting and the expansion of regulatory report-
ing requirements."
"The key performance indicators for our Taxonomy-eligible and 
Taxonomy-aligned investments as well as the other required 
disclosures can be found in the reporting template in the annex 
to this subsection."
"There are currently no tangible assets or 
loans where the concrete lending purpose is known that are con-
nected with the generation of energy from nuclear power or gas 
within the meaning of the Commission Delegated Regulation 
(EU) 2022/1214."
"A minimal indirect exposure exists to issuers 
from the utilities industry."
"We do not report this separately in 
the annex because it is too low to be material."
"It was not possible 
to take full account of the draft FAQs released at the end of De-
cember 2023 due to the short time available and the remaining 
regulatory uncertainties."
"Requirements that have still to be ful-
filled will be elaborated over the current year."
"In 
addition, one investment property is included in our Taxonomy-
aligned investments."
"Given that the obligation to report on Tax-
onomy alignment is first appliable to financial undertakings for 
the 2023 financial year, information is so far only available on 
Taxonomy eligibility for exposures to such issuers."
"The align-
ment of these issuers will be considered in the calculation of the 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
57 
numerator for the KPIs from next year onwards."
"The interna-
tionally oriented investment horizon of Hannover Re naturally 
results in a large proportion of issuers not subject to mandatory 
reporting."
"At the same time, this gives rise to a small proportion 
of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-aligned investments."
"For 
the breakdown of the numerator by environmental objective, the 
value of the Taxonomy-aligned investments is used as the de-
nominator in the absence of a consistent interpretation."
"A com-
plete split of the Taxonomy-aligned investments into environ-
mental objectives 1-2 is not possible due to the inconsistent Tax-
onomy ratios published to date by counterparties."
"With regard 
to environmental objectives 3-6, the counterparties are report-
ing quotas for the first time this year, which means that liquid 
investments can only be considered with effect from the coming 
reporting period."
"The activity ""Acquisition and ownership of 
buildings"" has similarly only been released for environmental 
objectives 1-2, and we are therefore unable to provide a disclo-
sure for environmental objectives 3-6 for aligned tangible assets."

Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Opportunity and risk report 
Risk report 
• Hannover Re's capital resources over the course of the year are in excess of the defined 
threshold."
The capital position is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
"• Our risk management system constantly monitors newly added and changing risks and is able to 
respond flexibly to changes in internal and external factors."
"Strategy implementation 
Robust governance and strong risk management are important 
parts of the foundation for our business operations."
"This is an-
chored in our corporate strategy."
"Derived from the corporate strategy, the risk strategy is the core 
element for our handling of risks."
"It specifies more closely the 
goals of risk management and documents our understanding of 
risk."
"We have defined the following overriding principles within 
the risk strategy: 
 
1."
"We monitor adherence to the risk appetite set by the Ex-
ecutive Board."
"We integrate risk management into value-based manage-
ment."
"We promote an open risk culture and the transparency of 
our risk management system."
We fulfil the requirements of rating agencies.
We fulfil the regulatory requirements.
"We act in light of materiality and proportionality 
considerations."
"We make balanced use of both quantitative and 
qualitative methods."
"We ensure the independence of the risk management 
function 
 
In addition to the risk strategy, the risk register and the central 
system of limits and thresholds are components of our Risk and 
Capital Management Guideline which is reviewed at least once 
a year."
"In this way we ensure that our risk management system 
is kept up-to-date."
"Our solvency ratio should be at least 180%; 200% is already 
considered to be a threshold, and countermeasures would be 
triggered if the solvency ratio were to fall below this level."
"Ad-
herence to the regulatory requirement of a solvency ratio of at 
least 100% is therefore also ensured."
"In addition to the above mentioned threshold 
of 200%, the necessary equity resources are also influenced by 
the expectations of rating agencies and customers for our target 
rating."
"Major external factors influencing 
risk management 
This subsection describes geopolitical, regulatory and the capi-
tal market-related external factors that were particularly rele-
vant to risk management in 2023."
"Further current developments 
are discussed in the following sections."
"Geopolitical risks  
In 2023, the global tensions increased over the course of the 
year."
"The war between Israel and Hamas has added another mil-
itary conflict with far-reaching consequences."
Russia’s war against Ukraine continued.
"The far-reaching con-
sequences and ramifications for Europe and the world have 
been mitigated to some extend but are still felt."
"While the front-
line has remained largely unchained over the year, the risk of 
the conflict escalating beyond the territory of Ukraine remains."
"This could have potentially extensive consequences for the 
geopolitical order on a global scale."
"As reactions on the Russian 
invasion, Western countries have enacted numerous sanctions 
against Russia."
"Hannover Re ensures that sanctions are not vio-
lated."
"The business relationship with Russian cedants therefore 
remains suspended."
"The high level of inflation in Europe, which 
is partly attributable to the conflict, has eased over the course of 
2023 but remains well above the long-term targets set by Euro-
pean Central Bank."
"The war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ongoing 
and a solution is currently not in sight."
"The risk of an escalation 
or a spreading of the war to neighbouring countries persists."
The global terror risk is considered to be increased.
"Han-
nover Re is examining its covers for terrorism risks and unrest 
in this context during the treaty renewals."
"Generally spoken, risks from armed conflicts are excluded in 
reinsurance treaties but may be covered under special arrange-
ments such as for marine risks."
"Political risk and political vio-
lence covers, among others, are available for other risks from 
violent conflicts and their consequences."
"The risk situation for 
these policies is therefore elevated."
"Risks stemming from eco-
nomic tensions can have disruptive effects on supply chains."
The relations between China and Taiwan continues to be tense.
"In recent years, the Chinese government is emphasising its ter-
ritorial claims to the island and threatened a military solution to 
the situation."
"A violent escalation of the conflict harbours nu-
merous significant risks for the global economy."
"The Taiwanese 
high-tech industry plays a major role in global supply chains, 
particularly in the production of semiconductors."
"The upcoming US presidential elections in November 2024 
could – depending on the outcome – lead to a comprehensive 
reorientation of foreign policy with significant consequences for 
the conflicts mentioned above."
"Capital market environment 
In the reporting period, our investments continued to perform 
satisfactorily and in line with our expectations, although numer-
ous geopolitical and economic challenges continued to cause 
uncertainty."
"This was reflected in particular in exceptionally 
volatile interest rate markets."
"There was a lack of clear macroe-
conomic signals to counteract the volatility."
"With regard to the 
associated valuation swings, our investments benefited from the 
fact that we had positioned ourselves more defensively with re-
gard to credit risks since the beginning of the previous year in 
anticipation of the effects of central bank activities."
"An important external factor influencing the return achievable 
on our investments is the general interest rate level."
"The high level of liquidity in the 
markets was only reduced rather hesitantly."
"Even if the contin-
ued high interest rates compared to the past initially reduced 
the market value of our fixed-interest securities, we benefited 
from the overall increase in the level of new investments and 
reinvestments."
"At the end of the first quarter, uncertainties in the banking sec-
tor led to turmoils on the credit markets."
"This was reflected in 
some very volatile risk premiums on corporate bonds, which 
however at the time of reporting had largely even settled below 
the level at the end of the previous year."
"Overall, the market value of our fixed-interest securities in-
creased, although this was partially offset by our high propor-
 
62  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
tion of our US Dollar exposure and its slight loss in value against 
the Euro."
"In contrast to the interest rate markets, the equity markets were 
characterized by rather stable valuation levels and lower volatil-
ities."
"Due to the liquidation of our positions in the previous year, 
the equity markets currently have no significant impact on our 
investments."
"Inflation remains a key issue, with the measured inflation 
indices in both the Euro and US Dollar areas noticeably losing 
momentum."
"This is reflected in lower income from realized 
inflation amortization in our ordinary investment result 
compared to the exceptionally high rates of change in the 
previous year."
We continue to be exposed to the market for private equity.
"Here, changes in market value are based less on general market 
conditions and more on company-specific assessments."
"The 
risks are primarily in the business model and profitability and 
less in the interest component as part of the cash flow forecasts."
"We therefore also see the declines in market value observed in 
some cases during the reporting period as part of the risk profile 
specific to this asset class and company characteristics."
"The importance of real estate risks remains unchanged 
significant for us due to our ongoing commitment in this area."
"We spread these risks through broadly diversified investments 
in high-quality markets worldwide, each of which is preceded 
by detailed property, manager and market analyses."
"During the 
reporting period, there was global pressure on market values in 
the commercial real estate sector, which is important to us."
"We 
are not affected by the disposals in the wake of the insolvency 
of the Signa Group, which is primarily active in the German-
speaking region."
"We do not currently consider any other notable 
parts of our exposure to be critical."
"For the near future, we continue to expect increased volatility 
on the global capital markets for investments, but we also see 
this as an opportunity and believe that we are adequately 
prepared with our current investment strategy."
"For more 
information, please refer to the section ""Investments"" in the 
economic report of the combined management report."
"Regulatory developments 
In the year 2023, there were numerous regulatory developments 
at the international, European, and national levels."
"In the legislative process for the Solvency-II-Reform and the 
Directive on Recovery and Resolution in (re)insurance (IRRD), 
an agreement was reached in December 2023 during the final 
interinstitutional 
negotiations 
between 
the 
European 
Parliament, Council, and Commission."
"The negotiations 
included crucial elements of the directives, such as the 
definition 
of 
significant 
cross-border 
business, 
new 
macroprudential supervisory powers, as well as changes to yield 
curves and adjustments in the calculation of the risk margin."
"On a global scale, the International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors (IAIS) introduced the latest iteration of the 
Insurance Capital Standards (ICS) and began assessing the 
comparability between the American Aggregation Method and 
the ICS."
"Implementation of the ICS is set to commence in 2025, 
with Solvency-II expected to serve as a direct implementation of 
the standard for European companies."
"Within the EU, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence 
Directive 
(CSDDD) 
has 
also 
entered 
interinstitutional 
negotiations."
"In December 2023, discussions continued 
regarding the potential inclusion of financial service providers, 
leading to a preliminary agreement."
"It is anticipated that 
financial service companies will fall within the scope concerning 
their own business activities and supply chains, but not 
regarding the financial services they offer to customers."
"However, this is subject to a review clause, allowing a decision 
to extend coverage to financial institutions and products based 
on a comprehensive impact analysis at a later date."
"During 2023, EIOPA conducted a consultation on reinsurance 
from third countries aimed at national supervisory authorities 
(NSAs)."
"The consultation included a draft regulatory statement 
from EIOPA with recommendations on how reinsurance with 
third countries could be regulated in the future."
"Concerning the EU/US Covered Agreement, both sides issued a 
joint statement reaffirming the agreement's significance and 
recognizing its effective functioning."
"The EU and the USA also 
committed to continuously reviewing the progress of the 
agreement and close coordination."
"They called on relevant 
authorities to refrain from actions contradicting the agreement."
"Digital technologies play a crucial role in the processes of the 
financial services industry overall, including (re)insurance."
"The 
EU has developed a new framework, the Digital Operational 
Resilience Act (DORA), to ensure the performance of digital 
services in critical scenarios."
"Hannover Re must adjust 
numerous internal processes related to the review of external IT 
service providers for compliance with DORA, which becomes 
effective in 2025."
"The European approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI), the EU AI 
Act, establishes guidelines for the use of AI systems, including 
automated decision-making."
"A preliminary agreement was 
recently reached in the trilogue."
"Extensive obligations apply to 
AI systems classified as high-risk, including a mandatory 
fundamental rights impact assessment, which also applies to the 
insurance sector."
"The EU AI Act is expected to be applicable two 
years after its enactment, with some exceptions for specific 
provisions."
"Hannover Re is preparing for potential requirements 
regarding AI governance and AI risk management, planning to 
adapt existing practices for AI use considering legal 
requirements."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
63 
Growing regulatory protectionism in many parts of the world in 
2023 led to additional market access restrictions."
"Risk capital 
In the interests of our shareholders and clients, we strive to 
ensure that our risks remain commensurate with our capital 
resources."
"Our quantitative risk management provides a uniform 
framework for the evaluation and steering of the risks affecting 
the company as well as of our capital position."
"The internal 
capital model – a stochastic enterprise model – is a central tool 
in this context."
"It covers all subsidiaries and business groups of 
the Hannover Re Group."
"The core variable in risk and enterprise 
management is the economic equity, which is calculated 
according to market-consistent valuation principles and also 
constitutes the basis for calculating the own funds under 
Solvency II."
"Hannover Re’s internal capital model reflects the 
risks that influence the development of the economic equity."
"These are split into underwriting risks, market risks, 
counterparty default risks and operational risks."
"For each of 
these risk categories we have identified a number of risk factors 
for which we define probability distributions."
"The specification of the probability 
distributions for the risk factors draws upon historical and 
publicly available data, exclusive industry data and the internal 
data resources of the Hannover Re Group."
"This process is 
further supplemented by the know-how of internal and external 
experts."
"The fit of the probability distributions is regularly 
checked by our specialist departments, although more 
importantly it is also verified in the context of the regular, 
company-wide use of the capital model when assessing risks 
and allocating the cost of capital."
"The Hannover Re Group 
calculates the required risk capital as the Value at Risk (VaR) of 
the economic change in value over a period of one year with a 
confidence level of 99.5%."
"This corresponds to the 
requirements of Solvency II."
"For its capitalisation under 
Solvency II Hannover Re has set a limit of 180% and a threshold 
of 200% for the capital adequacy ratio (Solvency ratio)."
"Both, 
limit and threshold are exceeded."
"The  Solvency II balance sheet related audit procedures have still to 
be completed by independent auditor."
"The remaining figures have not been 
audited."
"The solvency capital requirements take the major model change 
for the tax module in the internal model into account, the approval process 
with BaFin is still pending."
"The eligible own funds of the Hannover Re Group for regulatory 
purposes are lower than the available economic capital because 
non-controlling interests are in part treated as non-eligible 
under Solvency II."
"The available economic capital, the eligible 
own funds and the required risk capital include the volatility 
adjustment, i.e."
"the add-on to the risk-free yield curve envisaged 
in the Solvency II supervisory regime."
"Apart from the Hannover Re Group, the legal entity Hannover 
Rück SE is also subject to regulatory capital requirements."
"The 
solvency ratio of Hannover Rück SE is typically higher than the 
solvency ratio of the Hannover Re Group because there are no 
restrictions with regard to the use of own funds attributable to 
non-controlling interests."
"We strive for a rating from the rating agencies most relevant to 
our industry that facilitates and secures our access to all 
reinsurance business worldwide."
"Hannover Re is analysed by 
the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s (S & P) and A.M."
"Best as 
part of an interactive rating process."
"The current financial 
strength is assessed as “AA-” (Very Strong, stable outlook) by 
Standard & Poor’s and “A+” (Superior, stable outlook) by A.M."
In this context both Standard & Poor’s and A.M.
"Best 
consider Hannover Re’s risk management to be a very important 
aspect in the evaluation of financial strength and rate it as very 
good."
"Against the backdrop of the planned growth of our business in 
property and casualty reinsurance and selected areas of life and 
health reinsurance, we continuously track the impacts on our 
capitalisation and rating."
"In order to safeguard an adequate level 
of capitalisation and our rating, we initiate measures promptly 
based on forecasts."
"Possible measures include, among others, 
adjusting the structure and scope of our retrocessions, adjusting 
the amount of debt capital and managing business growth 
through risk budgets."
"64  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Organisation and processes of 
risk management 
Hannover Re has set up Group-wide risk management functions 
to safeguard an efficient and effective risk management system."
"The individual elements of the risk management functions are 
closely interlinked and the roles, tasks and reporting channels 
are clearly defined and documented."
"We have implemented the 
three lines of defence model."
"The first line of defence consists 
of the risk steering and the original risk responsibility at 
divisional and company level."
"The second line of defence is 
made up of the core functions risk management, the actuarial 
function and the compliance function."
"These functions are 
responsible for process-integrated monitoring and control."
"The 
third line of defence is the process-independent monitoring 
performed by the internal audit function."
"The following chart 
provides an overview of the central functions and bodies within 
the overall system as well as of their major tasks and powers."
"Central functions of risk monitoring and steering  
 
 
 
 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
65 
Group-wide risk communication and an open risk culture are 
important to our risk management."
"Regular global meetings 
attended by the actuarial units and risk management functions 
serve as a major anchor point for strategic considerations in 
relation to risk communication and risk culture."
"In addition, risk 
management requirements are formulated in guidelines that are 
discussed and published throughout the organisation."
"Key elements of our risk 
management system 
Our Risk and Capital Management Guideline, including the risk 
strategy and the system of limits and thresholds for material 
risks of the Hannover Re Group, describe the central elements 
of our risk management system."
"This is subject to a constant 
cycle of planning, execution, verification, and improvement."
"Systematic risk identification, risk analysis, risk assessment, risk 
steering and risk monitoring as well as risk reporting are espe-
cially crucial to the effectiveness of the overall system."
"Our Guideline describes, among other aspects, the major tasks, 
rights and responsibilities, organisational frameworks and the 
risk control process."
"The rules, which are derived from the cor-
porate strategy and the risk strategy, additionally take into ac-
count the regulatory requirements for risk management as well 
as international standards and developments relating to appro-
priate corporate governance."
"Risk-bearing capacity concept 
The establishment of the risk-bearing capacity involves deter-
mining the total available risk coverage potential and calculating 
the funds required to cover all risks."
"This is done in conformity 
with the parameters of the risk strategy and the risk appetite 
defined by the Executive Board."
"Individual risks and the risk po-
sition as a whole are measured using our internal capital model."
"A central system of limits and thresholds is in place to monitor 
material risks."
"This system incorporates the limits and thresh-
olds derived from the corporate strategy."
"Adherence is verified 
on an ongoing basis."
"Risk identification 
The regular risk identification takes place on the basis of the 
documentation of all identified risks in the central risk register."
"It contains all material risks and is important for ensuring that 
our risk management is always up to date."
"Risks are identified 
through, among other things, interviews and scenario analyses 
as well as in the evaluation of new products and large transac-
tions."
"External insights from associations and working groups 
are incorporated into the process."
"Risk analysis and assessment 
In principle, every risk that is identified and considered material 
is quantitatively assessed."
"Types of risks for which quantitative 
risk measurement is currently impossible or only possible with 
difficulty are primarily assessed qualitatively."
"This encom-
passes, among other things, strategic risks, reputational risks 
and emerging risks."
"Qualitative assessment can take the form 
of, for example, expert evaluations."
"Quantitative assessment of 
risks and the overall risk position is performed using Hannover 
Re’s internal capital model."
"The model makes allowance for risk 
concentration and diversification."
"Risk steering 
The steering of all risks is the task of the operational business 
units on the divisional and company level."
"The identified and 
analysed risks are thereby either consciously accepted, avoided, 
increased or minimised."
"The risk / reward ratio is factored into 
the division’s decision."
"Risk steering is assisted by the standards 
specified in the central and decentralised underwriting and in-
vestment guidelines, including the defined limits and thresh-
olds."
"Risk monitoring 
The monitoring of all identified material risks is a core function 
of risk management."
"This includes, inter alia, monitoring execu-
tion of the risk strategy as well as adherence to the defined lim-
its and thresholds and to risk-related methods and processes."
"A 
further major task of risk monitoring is the assessment of 
whether risk-steering measures were carried out and whether 
the planned effect of the measures suffices."
"Risk communication and risk culture 
Risk management is firmly integrated into our operational pro-
cesses."
"It is assisted by transparent risk communication and 
dealing openly with risks as part of our risk culture."
"Risk com-
munication takes place, for example, through internal and ex-
ternal risk reports, in the context of committee and project work, 
through information on current risk complexes in the intranet 
and by way of training activities for staff."
"Risk reporting 
Our risk reporting provides systematic and timely information 
about all material risks and their potential implications."
"The cen-
tral risk reporting system consists primarily of regular risk re-
ports, e."
"on the overall risk situation, adherence to the param-
eters defined in the risk strategy or on the capacity utilisation of 
natural catastrophe scenarios."
"Complementary to the regular 
risk reporting, immediate internal reporting on material risks 
that emerge at short notice takes place as necessary."
"Process-integrated / -independent monitoring and 
quality assurance 
Irrespective of internally assigned responsabilities, the Execu-
tive Board is responsible for the orderly organisation of the com-
pany’s business."
"This also encompasses monitoring of the inter-
nal risk steering and control system."
"Process-independent mon-
itoring and quality assurance of risk management is carried out 
by the internal audit function."
"The risk management system is 
rounded off with process-integrated procedures and rules, such 
as those of the internal control system."
"66  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Internal control system 
The internal control system (ICS) serves, among other purposes, 
to secure and protect existing assets, prevent and reveal errors 
and irregularities and comply with laws and regulations."
"The 
core elements of Hannover Re’s ICS are documented in a guide-
line that establishes a common understanding of the differenti-
ated execution of the necessary controls."
"The guideline defines 
concepts, stipulates responsibilities and provides a guide for the 
description of controls."
"The ICS consists of systematically struc-
tured organisational and technical measures and controls within 
the company."
"These include, among other things, the principle 
of dual control, separation of functions, documentation of the 
controls within processes as well as technical plausibility checks 
and access privileges in the IT systems."
"The proper functioning of the ICS necessitates the involvement 
of management, executive staff and employees on all levels."
"Financial reporting must satisfy international and national finan-
cial reporting standards as well as regulatory requirements."
"This 
is safeguarded in the area of accounting and financial reporting 
by processes with integrated controls which ensure the com-
pleteness and accuracy of the annual and consolidated financial 
statements."
"A structure made up of differentiated criteria, con-
trol points and materiality thresholds assures our ability to iden-
tify and minimise the risk of errors in the annual and consoli-
dated financial statements at an early stage."
"We use a central IT solution with standardised accounting and 
consolidation processes, posting rules and interfaces for data 
delivery in order to draw up the consolidated financial state-
ment."
"Access rights for the reporting systems are assigned 
through an approval process."
"All components of the accounting-
related internal control system, the processes for the organisa-
tion and implementation of consolidation tasks and for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statement as well as 
the accompanying controls are consistently documented."
"In or-
der to safeguard and continuously improve the adequacy of the 
control system it is subject to regular review and evaluation."
"In 
this regard, the internal audit function ensures that the quality 
of the control system is constantly monitored."
"All relevant ac-
counting principles are collated in a Group Accounting Manual 
that sets out uniform Group-wide rules for the recognition, mea-
surement and reporting of items in the consolidated financial 
statement."
"The process for updating and, if necessary, adjusting 
these rules is clearly regulated with respect to information chan-
nels, responsibilities and period of validity."
"Not only that, we 
provide prompt Group-wide notification of significant develop-
ments and modified requirements in Group financial reporting."
"Within the scope of our control system, the Group companies 
are responsible for Group-wide adherence to the accounting 
policies and the internal control guidelines."
"The management 
and chief financial officers of the Group companies defined as 
material in our control system affirm to the Executive Board of 
Hannover Rück SE at each closing date the completeness, cor-
rectness and reliability of the financial data that they pass on to 
Group Accounting."
"Data for the preparation of the consolidated 
financial statement is delivered using a networked IT applica-
tion."
"The relevant data for Group financial reporting is collected 
in a database and processed via automatic interfaces in a con-
solidation system."
"As part of the financial reporting process, we 
perform preventive and detective checks on the reported figures 
in order to minimise the probability and reduce the impacts of a 
potentially incorrect disclosure."
"Depending upon the results of 
our checks, these figures can be corrected if necessary."
"Given 
that our Group financial reporting is heavily dependent on IT 
systems, these systems also need to be subject to controls; con-
tent-based and system-side checks have therefore been imple-
mented for system access."
"Risk landscape of Hannover Re 
In the context of its business operations the Hannover Re Group 
is confronted with a broad variety of risks."
"These risks are delib-
erately accepted, steered and monitored as appropriate to the 
actions taken on the associated opportunities."
"The parameters 
and decisions of the Executive Board with respect to the risk 
appetite of the Hannover Re Group, which are based on the cal-
culations of risk-bearing capacity, are fundamental to the accep-
tance of risks."
"In this context, crucial importance attaches to our 
risk management in order to ensure that, among other consid-
erations, risks to the reinsurance portfolio remain calculable and 
even exceptional major losses do not have an unduly adverse 
impact on the result."
"The specific risk characteristics and the principal monitoring 
and steering mechanisms are described in the following sec-
tions."
"Internal risk assessment 
In this subsection we compare the available economic capital 
with the required risk capital."
"Hannover Re calculates economic equity as the difference 
between the market-consistent value of assets and the market-
consistent value of liabilities."
"While fair values are available for 
most 
investments, 
the 
market-consistent 
valuation 
of 
reinsurance treaties necessitates a specific valuation model."
"We 
establish the market-consistent value of technical items as the 
present value of projected payments using actuarial methods."
"This is adjusted by a risk loading that factors in the potential 
fluctuation in future payments."
"Such fluctuations result from 
risks that cannot be hedged by means of capital market 
products, such as underwriting risks."
"For the discounting of 
future cash flows we use the risk-free basic yield curves 
calculated in accordance with Solvency II requirements 
increased by the volatility adjustment."
"Market prices for options 
and guarantees embedded in insurance contracts are 
determined or approximated using option valuation models 
from the field of financial mathematics."
"The volume of these 
options and guarantees in our portfolio is, however, 
comparatively minor."
"The adjustments for assets under own 
management shown in the following table indicate the 
difference between fair value and book value of those 
investments recognised under IFRS at book value."
"Other 
adjustments largely relate to deferred taxes."
"The available 
economic capital, which is available as liable capital for 
policyholders, is composed of the economic equity and the 
hybrid capital, and includes the deduction of foreseeable 
 
68  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
dividends as required by Solvency II."
"Hybrid capital is 
recognised at market-consistent value as required by 
Solvency II, with changes in the own credit risk not being 
included in the valuation."
"The available economic capital as of 31 December 2023 
increased compared to 31 December 2022."
"In life and health reinsurance we recorded strong, positive new 
business growth, additionally the changes in assumptions and 
experience variances from business in previous years also had 
a positive effect."
"The increase in risk capital led to an increase 
in the risk margin."
"In our property and casualty segment we experienced a strong 
and positive development of the new business as well."
"We 
remained within the forecasted budget for major claims and 
could also release technical reserves from previous years’ 
business."
"In property and casualty reinsurance we strengthened 
our reserves for inflation risks."
"All in all, the changes in the market environment had a slightly 
positive impact on Hannover Re’s economic capital."
"The main 
positive effect, caused by declining interest rates, was nearly 
offset by smaller negative effects from the development of 
exchange rates and credit spreads."
"During the last year Hannover Re repaid a hybrid bond in the 
amount of EUR 500 million."
"The Solvency II balance sheet related audit procedures have still to 
be completed by the independent auditor."
"The remaining figures have not 
been audited."
"² The reconciliation for 31 December 2022 was adjusted retroactively due 
to the transition to IFRS 17 and IFRS 9."
"³ Adjustments for technical provisions in life & health and property & 
casualty reinsurance including risk margin."
"The required risk capital of the Hannover Re Group at the 
confidence level of 99.5% has increased only slightly over the 
course of the year."
"This is primarily a consequence of business 
growth, which has led to an increase in the underwriting risks 
of property and casualty reinsurance and life and health 
reinsurance."
"The decline in interest rates and the resulting 
increase in the market value of fixed-income securities 
contribute to the increase in risk."
"On the other hand, the 
stronger euro and improved diversification lead to a decline in 
the SCR."
"Market risk increased slightly, primarily as a result of an 
increase in credit and spread risk due to higher market values 
of fixed-income securities as well as an increase in exchange 
rate risk and new investments in real estate."
"An increase in 
interest rate risk only contributes insignificantly to the increase 
in market risk."
"The underwriting risks in property and casualty reinsurance 
have increased mainly as a result of higher premiums and 
reserves."
"The higher volumes result from business growth 
including higher capacities for natural catastrophe risks, claims 
development and the associated higher reserves."
"The underwriting risks in life and health reinsurance are 
increasing mainly due to the higher business volume and the 
decline in interest rates."
"The increase particularly affects 
longevity risk and pandemic risk."
"The slight decrease in counterparty default risk can be 
attributed principally to a smaller volume of cedants in life and 
health reinsurance."
"The changes in the operational risk result above all from 
updated expert assessments regarding the impact of individual 
scenarios."
"The increase in the diversification effect can be attributed to 
changes in the composition of the risks."
"The loss-mitigating 
effect from taxes remains largely stable."
"The internal capital model is based on current methods from 
actuarial science and financial mathematics."
"In the case of 
underwriting risks, we are able to draw on a rich internal data 
history to estimate the probability distributions, e."
"For risks from natural perils we use external 
models, which are adjusted in the context of a detailed internal 
review process such that they reflect our risk profile as closely 
as possible."
"In the area of life and health reinsurance long-term 
payment flows are modelled under various biometric and lapse 
scenarios."
"With respect to all the aforementioned risks we use 
internal data to define scenarios and probability distributions."
"The internal data is enhanced by way of parameters set by our 
internal experts."
"These parameters are especially significant in 
relation to extreme events that have not previously been 
observed."
"When it comes to aggregating the individual risks, we make 
allowance for dependencies between risk factors."
"Dependencies 
arise, for example, as a consequence of market shocks, such as 
the financial crisis, which simultaneously impact multiple 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
69 
market segments."
"What is more, several observation periods 
may be interrelated on account of market phenomena such as 
price cycles."
"Generally, however, it is our assumption that not 
all extreme events occur at the same time."
"The absence of 
complete dependency is referred to as diversification."
"Hannover 
Re’s business model is based inter alia on building up the most 
balanced possible portfolio so as to achieve the greatest possible 
diversification effects and in order to deploy capital efficiently."
"Diversification exists between individual reinsurance treaties, 
lines, business segments and risks."
"We define the cost of capital 
to be generated per business unit according to the capital 
required by our business segments and lines and based on their 
contribution to diversification."
"The risk capital at the confidence level of 99.5% reflects the loss 
from the respective risk that will not be exceeded with a 
probability of 99.5%."
"The risk capital required for specific risks 
is shown before tax in each case."
"Underwriting risks in property and 
casualty reinsurance 
Risk management in property and casualty reinsurance has de-
fined various overall guidelines for efficient risk steering."
"These 
include, among other things, the use of retrocessions to reduce 
volatility and conserve capital."
"Furthermore it is important to 
utilize the available risk budgets based on the risk management 
parameters of the Hannover Re Group and to steer the accep-
tance of risks systematically through the existing central and lo-
cal underwriting guidelines."
"Our conservative reserving level is 
a key factor in our risk management, too."
"For risk steering purposes we make a fundamental distinction 
between risks that result from business operations of past years 
(reserve risk) and those stemming from activities in the current 
or future years (price / premium risk)."
"Particularly in the latter 
case, special importance attaches to the catastrophe risk."
"Diversification within the Property & Casualty reinsurance 
business group is actively managed through allocation of the 
cost of capital according to the contribution made to 
diversification."
"A high diversification effect arises out of the 
underwriting of business in different lines and different regions 
with different business partners."
"In addition, the active 
limitation of individual risks – such as natural catastrophes – 
enhances the diversification effect."
"They constitute the main concentration risk in property 
and casualty reinsurance."
"70  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
The reserve risk, i.e."
"the risk of under-reserving of incurred or 
foreseeable losses and the resulting burden on the underwriting 
result, is a high priority in our risk management."
"We attach im-
portance to maintaining a conservative reserving level."
"In order 
to counter the risk of under-reserving we calculate our loss re-
serves based on our own actuarial estimations and establish, 
where necessary, additional reserves supplementary to those 
posted by our cedants for reported claims."
"Liability claims have 
a major influence on the latter reserve."
"Reserves are calculated 
on a differentiated basis according to line of business and re-
gions."
"In calculating the reserves, we use actuarial methods based on 
run-off triangles."
"Run-off triangles show the changes in the re-
serve over time due to paid claims and the recalculation of the 
reserves to be established as at the respective balance sheet 
date."
Their adequacy is monitored by the actuarial departments.
"Our own actuarial calculations regarding the adequacy of the 
reserves are also subject to annual quality assurance reviews in 
the form of an external analysis."
"The price / premium risk lies in the possibility of a random 
claims realisation that diverges from the claims expectancy on 
which the premium calculation was based."
"Regular and 
independent reviews of the models used for treaty quotation as 
well as central and local underwriting guidelines are vital 
management components."
"We have put in place a quotation 
process to ensure the quality of our portfolios that considers the 
claims expectancy including anticipated rate of inflation, 
anticipated costs and cost of capital (volatility)."
"In addition, Hannover Re’s treaty departments prepare regular 
reports on the progress of their respective renewals."
"They report 
on, among other things, significant changes in conditions, risks 
(e.g."
"in relation to the premium level) and also on emerging 
market opportunities as well as the strategy pursued in order to 
accomplish targets."
"The monitor-
ing of the risks resulting from natural hazards is rounded out by 
scenario analyses."
"Risk management considers numerous scenarios and extreme 
scenarios, determines their effect on portfolio and performance 
data, evaluates them in relation to the planned figures and iden-
tifies alternative courses of action."
"For the purposes of risk limitation, maximum amounts are also 
stipulated for various extreme loss scenarios and return periods; 
the limits set take into account the profitability of the respective 
business."
"Risk management ensures adherence to these maxi-
mum amounts."
"The Executive Board, the Risk Committee and 
the P & C Executive Committee are kept regularly updated on 
the degree of capacity utilisation."
"Net expenditure on major losses in the year under review 
amounted to EUR 1,620.6 million (EUR 1,705.7 million); the ma-
jor loss budget for 2023 totalled EUR 1,725 million."
"Climate change 
In the year under review, the cyclone Gabrielle and the flooding 
in New Zealand, the tornadoes in the USA, the hurricane Otis in 
Mexico and the hailstorm and flooding in Italy caused high 
losses."
"Natural disasters should be viewed as inextricably linked to 
climate change."
"Climate change means that the probabilities of 
weather-related events occurring are changing, depending on 
the region and hazard."
"The associated impacts present a major 
challenge for risk management."
"We use both external and 
internal risk models for the stochastic modelling of the impacts 
of catastrophic events."
"Climate change trends are taken into 
account in the models."
"The monitoring of these risks is rounded 
off with scenario analyses."
"We are currently focussing on the 
dangers of storms, floods and forest fires, which are most 
strongly influenced by climate change in the short term."
"Climate change, defined as naturally occurring or human-
caused climatic changes, and the associated effects, is already 
influencing our lives today."
"Climate change poses a significant macroeconomic risk and has 
also wide-ranging implications for the (re)insurance industry."
"In 2015, with a view to combating climate change, the 
international community reached agreement on ambitious goals 
to protect the climate at the UN Climate Change Conference in 
Paris."
"Signed by 195 countries, the Paris Agreement seeks to 
limit the rise in the global average temperature to well below 
2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels."
"The 
path to achieving the Paris climate goal depends on a 
fundamental shift in the economic system and in human habits."
"The consequences of climate change affect all areas of our 
business, not only in property & casualty and life & health 
reinsurance but also in our investing activities."
"At the same time, 
the implications of climate change represent the most 
significant sustainability risk for our company and are therefore 
closely analysed, monitored and controlled."
"The focus of climate 
change risk analysis is currently on changes in the frequency 
and severity of natural catastrophes (physical risks)."
"In addition, 
we analyse investments (including transition risk), biometric 
factors and liability contracts in relation to risks from climate 
change (litigation risk)."
"The climate-related dislocation of 
infectious diseases and their vectors to global zones where they 
were previously unknown also poses a risk for life and health 
reinsurance."
"Physical risks affect us as a risk carrier primarily in property and 
casualty reinsurance, but also indirectly in life and health 
reinsurance."
"Changes in climate and weather events can, for 
example, cause higher and more frequent losses in property and 
casualty reinsurance as well as elevated numbers of deaths 
among the insured groups of persons, which in turn is 
associated with significant financial risks."
"Many forecasts in this 
connection are subject to uncertainty, especially if they refer to 
periods further in the future."
"In order to assess the possible 
consequences, we have developed scenarios designed to enable 
us to evaluate the physical, transitional and liability implications 
of climate change for all our business activities and initiate 
appropriate measures for steering the business."
"Various natural 
catastrophe scenarios are modelled, such as floods, hailstorms 
and tropical cyclones."
"Our interdisciplinary team for natural 
hazard modelling takes account of the insights gained in pricing 
for reinsurance solutions and in risk management, among other 
things, in determining the major loss budget."
"In addition, we 
conduct internal studies and explore the issue in international 
working groups so as to assess the risks posed by climate 
change."
"Currently, we primarily look at two scenarios (rise in 
temperature of 2°C or 4°C), under which we focus on the 
windstorm, flood and wildfire perils in the context of physical 
risks."
"The results of the analyses are presented to the Risk 
Committee and included in the annual Own Risk and Solvency 
Assessment (ORSA)."
"The economic transformation and the transition to a world 
largely free of greenhouse gas emissions also entails (transition) 
risks."
"For example, shares or bonds issued by companies could 
– gradually or abruptly – drop in value due to the failure of 
adopting the issuer’s business model to the changing climate 
(""stranded assets"")."
"In addition, ESG risks – in common with compliance risks that 
are generally associated with laws and regulations relating to 
environmental law or ESG standards – are subject to scrutiny 
under every New Product Process (NPP)."
"Our Sustainability and 
Reputation Risk Management Guideline, which contains 
supplementary work instructions and definitions regarding 
climate change and other ESG issues, is applicable throughout 
the Group."
"Various committees and organisations similarly 
develop and discuss climate-related strategic goals and 
operational measures."
"It is our expectation that over the long term (> 50 years) climate 
change will be material for all risk categories."
"Within the next 
five years we anticipate primarily impacts only on our P&C 
natural catastrophe business."
"The annual renewal of our treaties 
and the price adjustments described above, as well as the 
ongoing annual adjustment of the major loss budget, result in 
short response times for price / premium risk and reserve risk."
"Climate change can result in shifts that are reflected in stronger 
demand for reinsurance products to protect against natural 
catastrophes and in new business opportunities."
"Hannover Re 
offers a wide range of products that help customers to protect 
themselves against increased losses and damage (both in terms 
of frequency and severity) from natural disasters."
"What is more, 
changes in temperature extremes around the world can lead to 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
73 
higher rates of mortality, which in turn may trigger stronger 
demand for our products in life and health reinsurance."
"Inflation 
The persistently high inflation worldwide potentially affects 
multiple factors of our business activities, such as the insured 
values and their premium calculation, the loss reserves, the 
large loss budget, the investments, and the administrative 
expenses."
"We have developed measures to deal with inflation in 
all these respects."
"It should be borne in mind here that the 
general rise in consumer prices needs to be differentiated from 
the claims and cost inflation that is relevant to our company."
"The 
Hannover Re-specific claims inflation index is a blend of 
different regions and currencies and depends on the line of 
business."
"These include wages and salaries for liability 
business, construction costs for property insurance including 
natural hazards and medical expenses for life and health 
insurance."
Inflation is considered in our reserving process.
"Essentially, this 
process is based on average past inflation rates."
"If there are 
indications of a future rise in inflation, we review the need to 
apply loadings."
"This is especially important in long-tail lines as 
multiple underwriting years can be affected at the same time."
"We monitor inflation drivers over the entire course of the 
business and reduce them by, among other things, taking them 
into account in the premium calculation, means of index clauses 
and sliding-scale commissions."
"To partially hedge inflation risks, Hannover Re holds securities 
in its portfolio whose coupon and redemption payments are 
inflation-linked."
"The bonds mentioned contribute to partial 
protection of these parts of the loss reserves against inflation 
risks."
"Pandemic 
With the worldwide decline in cases of illness and death 
attributable to infection with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the claims 
burden for Hannover Re remains within expectations."
"Uncertainty exists with regard to the question of what 
proportion of primary insurance claims in a Taiwanese portfolio 
of short-term health reinsurance contracts is covered by 
reinsurance."
"The claims notifications from our cedants are 
continuously reviewed with regard to their appropriateness."
"Based on the information currently available, we do not expect 
any further significant effects on the result in health 
reinsurance."
"Should further information lead to the conclusion 
that this is no longer the case, this would have a negative impact 
on the IFRS result."
"Cyber 
Hannover Re offers reinsurance cover for cyber risks."
"The risks 
arising from the cyber portfolio are monitored and managed us-
ing the internal model, among other things."
"The management 
also includes cyber risks from insurance contracts that do not 
primarily cover this risk (silent cyber), although their weight has 
decreased due to the increased number of exclusions imple-
mented in the past year."
"In addition, part of the risk is trans-
ferred via external protection cover."
"The topics of information security and cyber security and the 
associated risks in underwriting are also dealt with by our 
Emerging Risks working group, which supports cross-depart-
mental monitoring."
"Further information on the topic of cyber can also be found in 
the section on operational risks and in the opportunities report."
"Asbestos- and pollution related claims 
Asbestos- and pollution-related claims account for only a small 
share of the Hannover Re Group’s loss reserves."
"It is particularly 
difficult to reliably estimate future loss payments for such 
claims."
"The adequacy of these reserves can be estimated using 
the so-called “survival ratio”."
"This ratio expresses how many 
years the reserves would cover if the average level of paid claims 
over the past three years were to continue."
"The survival ratio at 
the reporting date was 25,1 years."
"Underwriting risks in life and health 
reinsurance 
All risks directly connected with the life or health of an insured 
person are referred to as biometric risks."
"They include in 
particular the miscalculation of mortality, life expectancy, 
morbidity and occupational disability."
"Biometric risks are the 
material risks for our company in the area of life and health 
reinsurance."
"Our goal is to strike a balance between biometric 
risks."
"Furthermore, we are exposed to lapse risks because the 
cash flows resulting from our reinsurance treaties are in part 
dependent on lapse rates among policyholders."
"Counterparty 
default risks are also material since we partly prefinance our 
cedants’ new business acquisition costs."
"Furthermore, we are 
exposed to catastrophe risks, especially events involving a high 
number of fatalities in our insured portfolio such as those 
recorded in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic."
"The reserves are determined on the basis of secure biometric 
actuarial bases in light of the information provided by our 
clients."
"The biometric actuarial bases used and the lapse 
assumptions are continuously reviewed with an eye to their 
adequacy and if necessary adjusted."
"This is done using the 
company’s own empirical data as well as market-specific 
insights."
"Our current risk profile in life and health reinsurance 
is dominated by mortality and longevity risks."
"This is due to the 
fact that under some of our contracts we pay death benefits, 
while under others we pay survival benefits."
"The volume of our 
annuity portfolio contributes to diversification within life and 
health reinsurance."
"We calculate the diversification effect 
between mortality and longevity risks prudently because the 
 
74  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
contracts are normally taken out for different regions, age 
groups and individuals."
"Morbidity risks are also playing a 
significant role."
"catastrophe risk 
 
 
The monitoring of the risk exposure is complemented by regular 
stress tests performed with regard to selected underlying 
underwriting risk factors."
"We seek to spread risks as far as possible across different risk 
classes and different regions."
"In our pricing of reinsurance 
treaties we provide incentives to further increase diversification."
"Through our quality assurance measures we ensure that the 
reserves established by ceding companies in accordance with 
local accounting principles satisfy all requirements with respect 
to the calculation methods used and assumptions made (e."
"use of mortality and morbidity tables, assumptions regarding 
the lapse rate)."
"In addition, the assumptions are continuously 
reviewed on the basis of empirical data and modified if 
necessary."
"New business is written in all regions in compliance 
with underwriting guidelines applicable worldwide, which set 
out detailed rules governing the type, quality, level and origin of 
risks and how these considerations are factored into the pricing."
"These global guidelines are revised annually and approved by 
the Executive Board."
"Special underwriting guidelines give due 
consideration to the particular features of individual markets."
"By 
monitoring compliance with these underwriting guidelines we 
minimise the potential implications of an inability to pay or of 
deterioration in the financial status of cedants."
"Regular reviews 
and holistic analyses (e."
"with an eye to lapse risks) are carried 
out with respect to new business activities and the assumption 
of international portfolios."
"Large transactions are also examined 
by our risk management department."
"Individual actuarial 
reports and documentation ensure that regular scrutiny also 
takes place at the subsidiary level."
"The interest rate risk, which 
in the primary sector is important in life business owing to the 
guarantees that are given, is of only minimal relevance to our 
company thanks to the design of our reinsurance treaties."
"We 
have confidence in the entrepreneurial abilities of our 
underwriters and grant them the most extensive possible 
powers."
"In our decentralised organisation we manage risks 
where they arise using a consistent Group-wide approach in 
order to obtain an overall view of the risks in life and health 
reinsurance."
"Our global underwriting guidelines provide 
underwriters with an appropriate framework for this purpose."
"In recent years we have reported regularly on the results of our 
US mortality business, which have been poorer than anticipated."
"The reason for this development was the negative earnings 
performance of a large portfolio that we, as reported at the time, 
acquired at the beginning of 2009."
"As part of our inforce management measures we had initiated 
rate adjustments for the portfolio concerned in 2018."
"This 
process has now been completed successfully."
"The losses from the Covid-19 pandemic for this portfolio have 
continued to decline."
"We are continuously monitoring the 
further development of the underlying mortality in the aftermath 
of the pandemic."
"We monitor developments in the worldwide morbidity portfolio 
on an ongoing basis."
"The impacts of Covid-19 on our morbidity portfolio in life and 
health reinsurance have been limited."
"We continuously track the 
potential implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for our 
worldwide life and health reinsurance business, expecting a 
minor strain going forward."
"The risks arising out of life and health reinsurance are reflected 
in the internal capital model."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
75 
Market risks
Faced with a challenging capital market climate, particularly 
high importance attaches to preserving the value of assets under 
own management and the stability of the return."
"Hannover Re’s 
portfolio is therefore guided by the principles of a balanced 
risk / return profile and broad diversification."
"Based on a risk-
averse asset mix, the investments reflect both the currencies 
and durations of our liabilities."
"Market price risks include equity 
risks, interest rate risks, foreign exchange risks, real estate 
risks, spread and default risks."
"Our portfolio currently consists 
in large part of fixed-income securities, and hence default and 
spread risks account for the bulk of the market risk."
"We min-
imise interest rate and foreign exchange risks through the great-
est possible matching of payments from fixed-income securities 
with the projected future payment obligations from our insur-
ance contracts."
"Market risks derive from the investments man-
aged by Hannover Re itself and from investment risks of ceding 
companies that we assume in connection with insurance con-
tracts."
"The following table shows the risk capital with a confi-
dence level of 99.5% for the market risks from investments un-
der own and third-party management."
"This system defines clear thresh-
olds and escalation channels for the cumulative fluctuations in 
fair value and realised gains / losses on investments since the 
beginning of the year."
"They are unambiguously defined in con-
formity with our risk appetite and trigger specified information 
and escalation channels if a corresponding fair value develop-
ment is exceeded."
"The predefined discussion and analysis mechanisms upon trig-
gering of the escalation levels of the early-warning system were 
activated in the course of the year under review on account of 
interest rate and spread volatility as well as central bank moves 
in response to inflationary tendencies."
"In accordance with our 
guidelines, the Investment Committee therefore regularly dis-
cussed the potential implications for our invested asset classes 
and the current portfolio composition in each case."
"Thanks to 
the broad diversification and conservative posture of our invest-
ments, there was no need to modify the strategic orientation of 
our portfolios towards a more defensive investment strategy 
during the reporting period."
"In addition, we had already taken a 
rather cautious stance since the beginning of the previous re-
porting period in view of expected central bank activities and 
inflation developments at the turn of the year."
"The short-term loss probability measured as the Value at Risk 
(VaR) is another vital tool used for operational monitoring and 
management of the market price risks associated with our secu-
rities positions."
"It is calculated on the basis of historical data, 
e."
"the volatility of the securities positions under own manage-
ment and the correlation between these risks."
"As part of these 
calculations the decline in the fair value of our securities portfo-
lio is simulated with a certain probability and within a certain 
period."
"The VaR of the Hannover Re Group determined in ac-
cordance with these principles specifies the decrease in the fair 
value of our securities portfolio under own management that 
with a probability of 95% will not be exceeded within ten trad-
ing days."
"A standard market model is used to calculate the VaR 
indicators for the Hannover Re Group."
"It is based on historical 
time series of relevant market parameters (equity prices, yield 
curves, spread curves and exchange rates)."
"Against the back-
drop of a very turbulent capital market and interest rate envi-
ronment, volatilities – especially of fixed-income assets – again 
reached a high level at times in the year under review."
"Based on 
continued broad risk diversification and the orientation of our 
investment portfolio, our VaR was nevertheless clearly below 
the VaR upper limit defined in our investment guidelines."
"It 
amounted to 1.2% (1.3%) as at the end of the reporting period."
"In this context, the loss potentials 
for fair values and shareholders’ equity (before tax) are simu-
lated on the basis of already occurred or notional extreme 
events."
"The inter-
nal capital model provides us with quantitative support for the 
investment strategy as well as a broad diversity of VaR calcula-
tions."
"In addition, tactical duration ranges are in place, within 
which the portfolio can be positioned opportunistically accord-
ing to market expectations."
"The parameters for these ranges are 
directly linked to our calculated risk-bearing capacity."
"It should 
be borne in mind that the issued subordinated bonds and result-
ing induced interest rate exposure are actively factored into our 
ALM."
"Further information on the risk concentrations of our in-
vestments can be obtained from the tables on the rating struc-
ture of fixed-income securities as well as on the currencies in 
which investments are held."
"Please refer to our comments in the 
section ""Notes on the individual items of the balance sheet"", 
subsection ""Investments"" in the notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements."
"Equity risks result from the possibility of unfavorable changes 
in the value of shares, equity derivatives or equity index deriva-
tives in our portfolio."
"However, their relevance for our invest-
ments was very low, as we had liquidated our equity fund port-
folio at the beginning of the previous year."
"Our equity exposure 
therefore amounts to 0.0% (0.0%)."
We continue to be exposed to the market for private equity.
"Here, changes in market value are based less on general market 
conditions and more on company-specific assessments."
"The 
risks primarily relate to the business model and profitability and, 
to a lesser extent, to the interest rate component of the cash flow

forecasts."
"Please refer to our explanations in the section ""Notes 
to the individual balance sheet items"", subsection ""Investments"" 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"The portfolio of fixed-income securities is exposed to an interest 
rate risk."
"Declining market yields lead to increases and rising 
market yields to decreases in the fair value of the fixed-income 
securities portfolio."
"The credit spread risk should also be men-
tioned."
"The credit spread refers to the interest rate differential 
between a risk-entailing bond and risk-free bond with the same 
maturity."
"Changes in these risk premiums, which are observable 
on the market, result – analogously to changes in pure market 
yields – in changes in the fair values of the corresponding secu-
rities."
"We minimise interest rate risks by matching the durations 
of payments from fixed-income securities as closely as possible 
with the projected future payment obligations under our insur-
ance contracts."
"Foreign exchange risks are especially relevant if there is a cur-
rency imbalance between the technical liabilities and the assets."
"Through extensive matching of currency distributions on the as-
sets and liabilities side, we reduce this risk on the basis of the 
individual balance sheets within the Group."
"The short-term 
Value at Risk therefore does not include quantification of the 
foreign exchange risks."
"We regularly compare the liabilities per 
currency with the covering assets and optimise the currency 
coverage by regrouping assets."
"In so doing, we make allowance 
for collateral conditions such as different accounting require-
ments."
"Remaining currency surpluses are systematically quan-
tified and monitored within the scope of economic modelling."
"A 
detailed presentation of the currency spread of our investments 
is provided in the section “Notes to the individual balance sheet 
items"", subsection ""Investments"" in the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements."
"Real estate risks result from the possibility of unfavourable 
changes in the value of real estate held either directly or through 
fund units."
"They may be caused by a deterioration in particular 
qualities of a property or by a general downslide in market val-
ues."
"Real estate risks have grown in importance for our portfolio 
in recent years owing to our ongoing involvement in this sector."
"We spread these risks through broadly diversified investments 
in high-quality markets worldwide; each investment is preceded 
by detailed analyses of the property, manager and market con-
cerned."
"In the reporting period, there was global pressure on 
market values in the commercial real estate segment, which is 
important to us."
"This was reflected by recognizing property-spe-
cific impairments."
"We are not affected by the turmoils resulting 
from the insolvency of the Signa Group, which is primarily active 
in German-speaking countries."
"We do not currently consider 
any other significant parts of our exposure to be critical."
"We use derivative financial instruments only to the extent 
needed to hedge risks."
"The primary purpose of such financial 
instruments is to hedge against potentially adverse develop-
ments on capital markets."
"A portion of our cash flows from the 
insurance business as well as foreign exchange risks arising be-
cause currency matching cannot be efficiently achieved are 
hedged to some extent using forward exchange transactions."
"Hannover Re holds further derivative financial instruments to 
hedge interest rate risks from loans taken out to finance real es-
tate and to hedge inflation risks from the life reinsurance busi-
ness written by our Australian branch."
"In addition, Hannover Re 
holds hedges in the form of equity swaps to hedge price risks in 
connection with the stock appreciation rights granted under the 
Share Award Plan."
"These are intended to neutralise changes in 
the fair values of the awarded stock appreciation rights."
"Con-
tracts are concluded with reliable counterparties and for the 
most part collateralised on a daily basis so as to avoid credit 
risks associated with the use of such transactions."
"The remain-
ing exposures are controlled according to the restrictive param-
eters set out in our investment guidelines."
"Since 2019 we have entered into term repurchase agreements 
(repos) as a supplementary liquidity management tool."
"The 
holdings exchanged in this context are fully collateralised."
"Some insurance derivatives linked to insurance business are 
also recognised under the investments due to IFRS financial re-
porting requirements."
"Our investments entail credit risks that arise out of the default 
risk (interest and/or capital repayment) or a change in the credit 
status (rating downgrade) of issuers of securities."
"We attach 
equally vital importance to exceptionally broad diversification as 
we do to credit assessment conducted on the basis of the quality 
criteria set out in the investment guidelines."
"We measure credit 
risks in the first place using the standard market credit risk com-
ponents, especially the probability of default and the potential 
amount of loss – making allowance for any collateral and the 
ranking of the individual instruments depending on their effect 
in each case."
"We then assess the credit risk first on the level of individual se-
curities (issues) and in subsequent steps on a combined basis 
on the issuer level."
"In order to limit the risk of counterparty de-
fault we set various limits on the issuer and issue level as well 
as in the form of dedicated rating quotas."
"A comprehensive sys-
tem of risk reporting ensures timely reporting to the functions 
entrusted with risk management."
"² Including government-guaranteed corporate bonds 
 
In general terms, Hannover Re gears its investment portfolio to 
the principles of a balanced risk / return ratio coupled with 
broad diversification."
"Accordingly, we counter the risk concen-
trations that nevertheless arise in individual asset classes with 
the broadest possible spread of different issuers per asset class."
"This is just as much a key component of our investment policy 
as credit rating assessment and management based on the qual-
ity criteria defined in the investment guidelines."
"On a fair value basis EUR 5,761.9 million of the corporate bonds 
held by our company were issued by entities in the financial sec-
tor."
"Of this amount, EUR 4,687.1 million was attributable to 
banks."
"The vast majority of these bank bonds (70.0%) are rated 
“A” or better."
"Our investment portfolio under own management 
does not contain any written or issued credit default swaps."
"Counterparty default risks 
The counterparty default risk consists primarily of the risk of 
complete or partial unwillingness or inability to pay of counter-
parties and the associated default on payment."
"Counterparty de-
fault risks exist with respect to cedants, retrocessionaires and in 
connection with short-term deposits at banks."
"We address credit 
risks from fixed-income investments in the preceding section 
under market risks."
"The following table shows the required risk capital for counter-
party defaults with a confidence level of 99.5%."
"Our retrocession partners are carefully selected 
and monitored in light of credit considerations in order to keep 
the risk as small as possible."
"This is also true of our broker rela-
tionships, which entail a risk inter alia through the potential loss 
of the premium paid by the cedant to the broker."
"We minimise 
these risks, among other measures, by reviewing broker rela-
tionships with an eye to criteria such as the existence of profes-
sional indemnity insurance, payment performance and proper 
contract implementation."
"The Security Committee decides on 
measures where necessary to secure receivables that appear to 
be at risk of default."
"This process is supported by a risk manage-
ment application, which specifies cession limits for the individ-
ual retrocessionaires participating in protection cover pro-
grammes and determines the capacities still available for short-, 
medium- and long-term business."
"Depending on the type and 
expected run-off duration of the reinsured business, the selec-
tion of reinsurers takes into account not only the minimum rat-
ings of the rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and A.M."
"Best but 
also internal and external expert assessments."
"Overall, retroces-
sions conserve our capital, stabilise and optimise our results and 
enable us to act on market opportunities across a broader front, 
e."
following a major loss event.
"A close and regular dialogue 
with our retrocessionaires gives us a reliable overview of the 
market and puts us in a position to respond quickly to capacity 
changes."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

The following table shows how the proportion of assumed risks 
that we do not retrocede (i.e."
"Any 
counterparty default risks associated with investors in a capital 
market transfer are collateralised via LOCs or a trust account 
(e.g."
using cash) in favour of Hannover Re.
"54.4% of our recoverables from reinsurance business are se-
cured by deposits or letters of credit."
"For the majority of our 
retrocessionaires we also function as reinsurer, meaning that in 
most cases recoverables can potentially be set off against our 
own liabilities."
"In terms of the Hannover Re Group`s major companies, EUR 
669.7 million of our accounts receivable from reinsurance busi-
ness were older than 90 days as at the balance sheet date."
"In the 
previous year, the amount was EUR 860.2 million."
"Retrocession gives rise to claims that we hold against our retro-
cessionaires."
These reinsurance recoverables – i.e.
"the reinsur-
ance recoverables on unpaid claims – amounted to EUR 2,231.4 
million (EUR 2,401.6 million) as at the balance sheet date."

The volume of assets subject to collateral arrangements is well 
below 60% of Hannover Re’s total assets."
"This statement is rel-
evant for the calculation of the counterparty default risk with re-
spect to Hannover Re."
"Counterparty default risks, among other risks, are also relevant 
to our investments and in life and health reinsurance because 
we prefinance acquisition costs for our ceding companies."
"Our 
cedants, retrocessionaires and broker relationships as well as 
our investments are therefore carefully evaluated and limited in 
light of credit considerations and are constantly monitored and 
controlled within the scope of our system of limits and thresh-
olds."
"Lastly, short-term deposits at banks are also at risk of counter-
party default."
"Operational risks 
Operational risk means the risk related to business operations 
and due to inadequate processes, human errors, system failures 
or external events."
"Within the overall framework of operational 
risks, we pay particularly close attention to business continuity 
risks, business process and data quality risks, compliance risks, 
fraud risks, human resources risks, information security risks 
and outsourcing risks."
"Management of operational risks 
In contrast to underwriting risks (e.g."
"the reserving risk), which 
we enter into in a deliberate and controlled manner in the con-
text of our business activities, operational risks are an indivisible 
part of our business activities."
"The focus is therefore on risk min-
imisation."
"With the aid of half-yearly Group-wide self-assess-
ments, in which all relevant corporate operations are actively 
involved, we determine the maturity level of our risk manage-
ment system for operational risks and define action fields for 
improvements."
"The assessment is carried out by evaluating the 
maturity level of the corporate governance, the risk manage-
ment function and the respective risk identification, analysis, 
evaluation, steering, monitoring and reporting."
"The assessment 
of the maturity level enables us, among other things, to prioritise 
operational risks."
"In order to calculate the capital commitment 
in our internal capital model we perform extensive scenario 
analyses and take the findings as a basis for specifying the pa-
rameters for the stochastic model."
"In this context, experts across 
all disciplines establish assumptions for the loss frequency and 
losses in joint workshops."
"In addition, internal loss events and 
near-losses are systematically recorded and examined with an 
eye to possible measures for improving the control system."
"The 
internal data are enhanced with insights gained from external 
events, which either become known through public channels or 
were reported through a loss data consortium of which we are a 
member."
"80  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Regular quarterly risk reporting to the Risk Committee and the 
Executive Board takes place with regard to all operational risks."
"In the context of the reporting, risks are also evaluated on the 
basis of risk indicators."
"We discuss 
below the subcategories of operational risks 
Business continuity risks 
Business continuity risks arise from natural or man-made 
hazards that threaten or disrupt business operations."
"The risk 
also includes the continuity of IT infrastructure and services."
"Our Business Continuity Management (BCM) system reduces 
the risk through preventive measures that are regularly tested."
"A special organisational and operational structure has been set 
up to deal reactively with a crisis event."
"Overall, our focus in BCM is on the following five scenarios: 
 
• Unavailability/loss of staff, e.g."
"as a consequence of a 
pandemic 
• Outage of the local workplace environment 
• Outage of local/central Information Technology, e.g."
"We have de-
fined criteria for managing the risk that result in a high process 
quality."
"Data quality is similarly a very critical success factor, 
especially in risk management, because for example the validity 
of the internal model is largely based on the data provided."
"As 
part of our data quality management, we have defined extensive 
automatic routines that continuously determine data quality in 
central systems."
"Compliance risks 
Compliance risks related to the risk of breaches of standards and 
requirements, non-compliance with which may entail lawsuits 
or official proceedings with not inconsiderable detrimental im-
plications for the business activities of the Hannover Re Group."
"Compliance with regulatory standards, the company’s Code of 
Conduct, tax regulations, data privacy requirements as well as 
the stipulations of anti-trust and competition law have a high 
relevance."
"In conformity with a risk-based approach, sanctions screening 
software is used on the relevant parts of the Hannover Re 
Group’s portfolio as well as on loss advices to filter out individ-
uals who are subject to sanctions."
"Suitable steps are taken if 
such individuals are identified."
"Business partners are also 
screened in this way."
"Responsibilities within the compliance or-
ganisation are regulated and documented Group-wide and in-
terfaces with risk management have been put in place."
"The set 
of tools is rounded off with regular compliance training pro-
grammes and awareness measures."
"Russia is categorised as 
“severe risk” due to the current situation."
"According to the 
Sanctions Guideline, for every transaction relating to “severe 
risk” countries a submission requirement and an in-depth re-
view are mandatory in order to take into account the increased 
scope of sanctions."
"New business with Russian cedants is cur-
rently excluded."
"We report on our compliance management system as part of our 
combined non-financial statement."
"For further information on 
compliance-related topics, including for example lawsuits, con-
tingent liabilities and commitments, please see subsection 
“Lawsuits” and subsection “Contingent liabilities and commit-
ments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Fraud risks 
Fraud risks refer to the risk that results from intentional viola-
tions of laws or rules from own employees and/or from third par-
ties in order to gain an advantage."
"This risk is reduced by the 
internal control system as well as by the audits conducted by 
Group Auditing on a Group-wide and line-independent basis."
"Should an instance of fraud nevertheless occur, established es-
calation processes to involve all relevant functions are in place 
and a risk-specific analysis (e.g."
"forensic investigation) is con-
ducted including determination of appropriate measures."
"Human resources risks 
The generally increasing shortage of qualified specialists also 
poses challenges for the Hannover Re Group."
"In order to reduce 
this risk, we pay particular attention to the qualifications, 
experience and motivation of our employees."
"We encourage 
them through personnel development programmes as well as 
management activities and conduct regular employee surveys."
"The regular collection of key figures on staff turnover rates 
enables us to take targeted control measures in a timely manner."
"Information security risks 
Information security risks arise, inter alia, out of an inadequate 
protection of confidentiality, integrity or availability of informa-
tion, which is stored/processed in Information Technology or 
handled by human beings."
"Cyber attacks and the loss of sensitive information can be asso-
ciated with considerable financial losses and also reputational 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
81 
risks."
"In our highly networked world it is therefore important to 
protect information and defend against cyber attacks."
"With a view to protecting against these risks, Hannover Re has 
implemented an Information Security Management System 
(ISMS) that is closely aligned with international standards and 
harmonised with other management systems such as data pro-
tection or outsourcing management."
"Specific guidelines and 
standards regulate all technical and organisational measures in-
cluding those relating to the confidentiality, integrity and avail-
ability of information assets."
"Consideration is given to all types 
of digital and physical information assets."
"The Executive Board bears overall responsibility for information 
security."
It is supported by the Risk Committee.
"The Information 
Risk & Security Committee (IRSC) is a sub-committee of the Risk 
Committee and is comprised of the Head of Risk Management, 
the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the Head of 
IT."
"The IRSC evaluates and monitors the corresponding risks 
and steers any conflicts of interest in relation to information and 
IT security on a quarterly basis."
"It acts – in common with the risk 
management function and the CRO – independently of any in-
structions."
"The full Executive Board is provided with informa-
tion at least annually by way of an information security report 
and also within the year if necessary."
"The CISO, as the main process owner, is responsible for the 
planning, implementation and ongoing development of the 
ISMS as well as for coordinating the corresponding tasks within 
the Hannover Re Group."
"He is supported by local contacts and 
additionally bears responsibility Group-wide for the definition 
and monitoring of controls."
"The CISO cooperates closely with 
Information Risk Management (IRM), the central Compliance 
function and the Data Protection Officer."
"Both the CISO and the 
other specified functions form part of the second line of defence."
"Furthermore, every single member of staff is responsible for ad-
hering to the relevant security standards."
"To this end, all em-
ployees undergo regular training in information security topics 
as well as awareness-raising, e.g."
through phishing simulations.
"When it comes to a transfer of knowledge in connection with 
cyber risks (cyber resilience), we participate in various cooper-
ative projects undertaken by our industry."
"Outsourcing risks 
Outsourcing risks can result from the outsourcing of functions, 
services and/or organisational units to third parties."
"They also 
include intra-group outsourcings."
"Mandatory rules have been 
put in place to limit this risk; among other things, they stipulate 
that a risk analysis and partner assessment are to be performed 
prior to outsourcing."
"In the context of these analyses a check is 
carried out to determine, inter alia, which specific risks are as-
sociated with the outsourcing and what risk management mea-
sures need to be taken."
"The results of the analyses are subject 
to regular review."
"In selected market niches we transact primary insurance busi-
ness that complements our reinsurance activities."
"In so doing, 
just as on the reinsurance side, we always work together with 
partners from the primary sector – such as insurance brokers 
and underwriting agencies."
"This gives rise to risks associated 
with distribution channels, although these are minimised 
through the careful selection of agencies, mandatory underwrit-
ing guidelines and regular checks."
"The distribution channel risk 
forms an integral part of management of the outsourcing risk 
and of business partners."
"Other risks 
Under other risks we include emerging risks, strategic risks, 
sustainability and reputational risks as well as liquidity risks."
"Management of other risks 
Other risks are managed primarily using qualitative methods 
and on the basis of risk indicators."
"Risk management monitors 
and reduces the other risks through mitigation measures such 
as company-wide working groups and guidelines."
"Regular quar-
terly risk reporting to the Risk Committee and the Executive 
Board takes place with regard to the other risks."
"Risks are also 
evaluated as part of the reporting."
"Emerging risks 
Emerging risks are risks that are in the process of forming or 
may shortly become relevant due to current developments."
"Emerging risks evolve gradually from weak signals to unmistak-
able tendencies."
"They can directly impact our treaty portfolio in 
both property & casualty and life & health reinsurance and influ-
ence our investments."
"A further hallmark is that their risk con-
tent cannot be reliably assessed, especially with respect to our 
treaty portfolio."
"Current developments from emerging risks 
Certain risks are subject to particular dynamics or future claims 
from damages or costs in business operations are to be ex-
pected."
"We were particularly concerned with the following risk 
complexes in the reporting year: 
 
Opioids are drugs that have an opium-like effect and are often 
prescribed after serious injuries and surgical procedures."
"They 
are also administered for severe chronic pain."
"The outbreak of the ""opioid crisis"" in the USA can be traced back 
to the over-prescription of strong opioid painkillers."
"As a result, 
more than 2 million Americans have fallen victim to addiction, 
either to prescription opioids or to heroin."
"82  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
The public debate centres on four substances that are closely 
linked to the current crisis: Hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl 
and heroin."
"In recent years, numerous states, cities and counties 
in the US have filed lawsuits against manufacturers, wholesalers 
and retailers of opioids."
Nearly every state in the U.S.
"is cur-
rently involved in these lawsuits."
"The impact of the opioid epidemic on liability insurance remains 
uncertain."
"The extent to which liability insurance policies may 
be affected and, additionally, the reinsurance coverage offered 
by Hannover Re, if any, has not yet been finalised."
"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of chem-
icals with water-, grease- and dirt-repellent properties."
"Some 
PFAS have been categorised as hazardous."
"Possible health ef-
fects include cancer, reduced fertility, a weakened immune sys-
tem, increased cholesterol levels and/or the risk of obesity and 
developmental delays in children."
"To date, several lawsuits 
against companies that manufacture PFAS and those that use 
PFAS in their products, particularly in the U.S., have been set-
tled and/or are still pending."
"Although potential lawsuits in Eu-
rope are still at an early stage compared to the U.S., litigation 
over alleged PFAS groundwater and drinking water contamina-
tion is on the rise."
"Currently, there is no standardised global reg-
ulation for the definition, handling and restriction of PFAS use, 
but there is increasing regulatory activity on PFAS worldwide."
"Hannover Re is therefore monitoring this risk complex closely 
as it may have a negative financial impact on various lines of 
business."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers opportunities for the automa-
tion of data processing and decision-making processes, among 
other things."
"Risks exist, for example, in relation to incorrect or 
incomprehensible data and decisions."
"It is therefore important 
to establish and continuously adapt rules for the use of AI in the 
company."
"In principle, we expect AI to fundamentally change many as-
pects of human life and production processes in the future."
"This 
will also influence insurance-specific aspects, such as the fre-
quency of diagnoses for certain diseases."
"Furthermore, AI rep-
resents an additional tool for cybercrime, which companies and 
individuals must take into account when protecting themselves 
against attacks."
"Please refer to the subsection ""Major external factors influenc-
ing risk management"" in the risk report for the current state of 
regulation with regard to artificial intelligence."
"Early detection and subsequent evaluation of risks are crucially 
important when it comes to emerging risks."
"For this reason, we 
deploy Hannover Re's internal, interdepartmental and multi-line 
expert working group on ""Emerging Risks & Scientific Affairs"" 
and we ensure its linkage to risk management."
"The analyses per-
formed by this working group are used Group-wide in order to 
initiate any necessary measures."
"The working group is currently 
exploring around 20 risk complexes, some of them megatrends, 
to facilitate the identification and adequate evaluation of not 
only existing but also emerging risks."
"Megatrends are defined 
as developments with a trend cycle of at least 30 years."
"They are 
not presently associated with direct impacts on operations, but 
may potentially evolve in this direction."
"Action on climate change means new or 
refined technologies, such as renewable energies or hydrogen 
concepts and their various possible applications, for which in-
surance coverages are needed."
Another observed trend is urbanisation.
"The steady increase in 
urbanisation means the growth and change of cities."
"Those leav-
ing the countryside and moving to the city are mostly young, 
hence altering both rural and urban age distributions."
"Corre-
lated trends such as the ageing society and new types of mobil-
ity, increasingly against a backdrop of sustainability, are throw-
ing up major questions."
"The significance of these trends and the 
speed of change are compelling the insurance industry to plan 
which role it wants to play in helping to shape the future."
"In this 
context it is important to consider both business opportunities 
and risks."
"Given that all this is affected by climate change, peo-
ple's property – especially when value concentrations form in 
future megacities – will have to be insured against natural perils."
"In a worst-case scenario, this could mean that certain regions 
and risks become uninsurable if adequate urban planning – tak-
ing account of natural hazards – is neglected in the spread of 
large cities around the world."
"Urbanisation not only means new 
buildings, technologies and lifestyles that have to be insured; 
rather, living close together also has implications for people's 
physical and mental well-being, which is relevant to our portfo-
lio of life and health insurance."
"Hannover Re publishes summary position papers on various 
emerging risks which can be accessed on our website."
"In the 
year under review the papers on resistance to antibiotics, dis-
ruption of critical infrastructure, asbestos, advances in medicine 
and the risk posed by megacities, among others, were updated."
"The trends considered include ""Ageing and 
health"", ""Economic instability"", ""Environment and climate""."
"""ESG issues"", ""Changes in the geopolitical landscape"", ""Tech-
nological developments and their influence on society"" as well 
as ""Demographic and social change""."
"New topics added in the 
year under review were ""Energy storage systems"", “Data ethics” 
and ""New insurance competition""."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
83 
The publications are publicly accessible on the CRO Forum web-
site."
"An exploration of the carbon intensity of insured portfolios 
(""Carbon footprinting methodology for underwriting portfolios"") 
written in 2020 is also available there."
"Strategic risks 
Strategic risks derive from a possible imbalance between the 
corporate strategy of the Hannover Re Group and the constantly 
changing general business environment, for example with re-
spect to evolving regulatory requirements."
"Such an imbalance 
might be caused, for example, by incorrect strategic policy de-
cisions, a failure to consistently implement the defined strate-
gies and business plans or an incorrect allocation of resources."
"We therefore regularly review our corporate strategy in a multi-
step procedure and adjust our processes and the resulting 
guidelines as and when required."
"We have defined performance 
criteria and indicators for operational implementation of the 
strategic principles and objectives; these are authoritative when 
it comes to determining fulfilment of the various targets."
"The 
process for the management of strategic risks continues to be 
assessed annually as part of the monitoring of business process 
risks."
"Sustainability and reputation risks 
The handling of sustainability risks has come into increasing fo-
cus in recent years, above all against the backdrop of climate 
change."
"Instead of sustainability risks, reference is often made 
to risks associated with environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) issues."
"We make a fundamental distinction here between risks and im-
pacts to which a company is exposed (outside-in perspective) as 
well as risks and impacts that a company causes through its 
business operations (inside-out perspective)."
"Sustainability risks corresponding to the outside-in perspective 
are financial risks due to the potential financial repercussions of 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues on Han-
nover Re."
"These financial risks encompass market, underwrit-
ing, counterparty default and operational risks and are inte-
grated into the risk management processes for such risks."
"The inside-out perspective refers to situations in which the ac-
tivities of Hannover Re would be harmful to the environment or 
social norms or would reflect a failure of governance."
"Reputation risks refer to the risk that the trust put in our com-
pany by clients, shareholders, employees or the public at large 
may be damaged."
"This risk has the potential to significantly 
jeopardise the business foundation of the Hannover Re Group."
"A good corporate reputation is therefore an indispensable pre-
requisite for our core business as a reinsurer."
"Reputation risks 
may arise out of all business activities conducted by the Han-
nover Re Group."
"Reputational damage may be caused, inter alia, 
by a data mishap that becomes public knowledge or financial 
difficulties on account of an underwriting risk."
"In addition to the 
risk identification methods already described, we use a number 
of different techniques for risk mitigation, such as our defined 
communication channels (e."
"Crisis Communication Guide-
line), a professional approach to corporate communications, 
tried and tested processes for specific crisis scenarios as well as 
our established Code of Conduct."
"Above and beyond the general influence that sustainability risks 
have on a number of other risk categories (outside-in perspec-
tive), reputation risks form the bridge between the outside-in 
and inside-out perspective."
"We see a correlation between repu-
tational and ESG risks (inside-out perspective)."
"Reputation and 
sustainability risks are closely linked, as failure to fulfil societal 
expectations of sustainability can result in a reputation risk."
"Risk 
Management and the departments Group Sustainability & Strat-
egy and Corporate Communications work together closely to 
identify ESG and reputation risks."
"This applies both to the as-
sessment of ESG risks and to the monitoring of media reports, 
the analysis of NGO activities and the dialogue cultivated with 
relevant stakeholder groups."
"Liquidity risks 
The liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable to meet our 
financial obligations when they become due."
"The liquidity risk 
consists of the refinancing risk (necessary cash could not be ob-
tained or could only be obtained at increased costs) and the mar-
ket liquidity risk (financial market transactions could only be com-
pleted at a lower price than expected due to a lack of market liq-
uidity)."
"Above and beyond the foreseeable payments, unexpected and ex-
ceptionally large payments may pose a threat to liquidity."
"In rein-
surance business, however, significant events (major losses) are 
normally paid out after a lead time that can be reliably planned."
"As part of our liquidity management we have nevertheless defined 
asset holdings that have proven to be highly liquid – even in times 
of financial stress such as the 2008 financial crisis."
"The liquid asset reserve stood at EUR 8.6 billion 
(EUR 9.1 billion) as at the balance sheet date."
"In addition, we man-
age the liquidity of the portfolio by checking on each trading day 
the liquidity of the instruments contained therein."
"When reinvest-
ing in fixed-income securities during the reporting period, we in-
creasingly invested in instruments with short-term maturities 
while only slightly reducing the average remaining maturity."
"By 
expanding the holding of short-term securities we further 
strengthened our liquidity base."
"As an additional liquidity man-
agement tool, we have been entering into temporary repurchase 
agreements (repo agreements) since 2019."
"These measures en-
able us to reduce our liquidity risk."

Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Opportunity report 
Speed is one of the qualities used to measure successful adapt-
ability."
"Hannover Re's ambition is to offer quick and effective 
solutions that keep us one step ahead of the competition."
"Han-
nover Re searches systematically for new business opportunities 
in order to generate sustainable growth and strengthen the com-
pany’s profitable development."
"With a view to identifying oppor-
tunities and successfully translating ideas into business, Han-
nover Re adopts a number of closely related approaches in order 
to achieve holistic opportunity and risk management."
"Of signif-
icance here is the interplay without overlaps of the various func-
tions within opportunity and risk management, which is ensured 
by defined interfaces."
"The focus of Hannover Re’s business opportunity management 
is on various market-specific innovations in the Life & Health 
and Property & Casualty reinsurance business groups (see 
“Forecast report” in the outlook)."
"Trends affecting these business groups are systematically iden-
tified and analysed with the support of external sources and 
partners and the needs of our clients are anticipated along the 
entire insurance-related value-added chain."
"Business opportu-
nities that promise access to innovative technologies and en-
hance our appeal in the eyes of customers are specifically pin-
pointed."
"With this in mind, Hannover Re cultivates business-re-
lated partnerships with outside accelerators, incubators, com-
pany builders, start-ups and research institutes in order to boost 
our competitiveness in the insurtech sector and the field of dig-
ital solutions."
"Various competence centres have been set up in 
the Hannover Re Group to evaluate the strategic and technical 
significance of innovative new digital technologies and the goals 
pursued by these innovation units have been put on a strategic 
footing."
"The interplay between these units is based on a dedi-
cated approach that enhances the activities with specific exper-
tise and efficiency."
"In-house accelerator units covering the areas of business (in 
each of the P&C and L&H business groups), technology and 
parametrics explore the specifics of their respective fields and 
maintain a close dialogue with one another."
"The tasks per-
formed by these organisational units include, among others, 
global scaling of existing regional products and solutions, de-
veloping new sector- and customer-specific digital assets as well 
as providing systematic support for insurtechs as they build 
their digital business models."
"An intensive exchange and tar-
geted collaboration with the market departments are crucially 
important here in order to build on existing networks and ex-
pertise."
"In this way, we strive to identify business opportunities 
at an early stage and provide the appropriate customers with 
innovative solutions."
"The growing 
frequency and severity of natural disasters are causing 
considerable social and economic costs."
"The gap be-
tween insured and economic losses is particularly large 
in emerging and developing countries."
"The goal is to effectively reach as 
many people as possible within vulnerable population 
groups."
"By way of example, Hannover Re makes substantial ca-
pacity available to the Natural Disaster Fund (NDF)."
"Through the NDF, as of year-end 2023, more than 
40 million poor and vulnerable people have cumula-
tively already been provided with direct or indirect pro-
tection."
"We further participate in regional risk pools against 
natural perils – such as in Morocco where a significant 
payout to the government occurred in 2023 for the ru-
ral uninsured population following a severe earth-
quake."
"Several other programmes with a bearing on 
reinsurance complement our respective portfolio."
"This working group carries out quali-
tative assessments of emerging risks."
"As a result, however, not 
only are the potential risks explored but also any available busi-
ness opportunities."
"Analyses are compiled here exploring how 
Hannover Re can counter megatrends such as climate change, 
digitalisation or shifting demographics with novel (re)insurance 
products or capital investments."
"In the year under review, for 
example, issues such as “Shifting political landscape”, “Shifting

range of pathogens” and “Microplastics” were analysed by the 
working group."

Cyber insurance 
Cyber attacks on critical systems are becoming in-
creasingly common."
"They can cause considerable fi-
nancial losses and also damage corporate reputations."
"Not only that, they can severely hamper private and 
public life, especially if critical infrastructures are im-
pacted – such as the health, transportation / traffic and 
energy sectors."
"In such instances supply bottlenecks 
with lasting effects as well as major disruptions to pub-
lic safety may ensue."
"In a networked world the reper-
cussions of cyber attacks are intensifying because the 
volume of globally stored data and the extent of system 
dependencies are constantly growing – and in this con-
text it is not only one’s own technical infrastructure 
that needs to be secured."
"On the contrary, the trend 
towards cloud computing is increasingly shifting the 
focus to third-party infrastructures and the associated 
network connection."
"As part of our holistic approach to 
risk and business opportunity management, we are 
also tackling the question of what new insurance prod-
ucts can be developed in order to protect against the 
relevant risks."
"The constant refinement of our systemic 
analyses for the assessment of cyber risks forms the ba-
sis for developing new (re)insurance solutions."
"We aim 
to bring transparency to the customer’s cyber risks and 
we seek to cover the need for risk-mitigating measures 
by offering suitable solutions."
"This process 
is supported by Risk Management at Hannover Re."
"The process 
is always worked through if a contractual commitment is to be 
entered into in a form not previously used by Hannover Re or if 
a new type of risk is to be insured."
"If this is the case, all material 
internal and external influencing factors are examined before-
hand by Risk Management (e."
"implications for the overall risk 
profile or the risk strategy) and evaluated."
"Risk Management en-
sures that before it can be used or sold a new reinsurance prod-
uct must be approved by the Executive Board."
"2 Sentence 6 and Sentence 4 German Com-
mercial Code (HGB); unaudited information)."
"Hannover Re’s objective continues to be to consolidate its position 
as one of the leading, most profitable reinsurance groups operating 
worldwide."
"In aspiring towards this goal, it is particularly important 
to observe and fulfil the principles of good and sustainable corpo-
rate governance."
"The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Hannover Rück SE 
expressly support the suggestions and recommendations of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) and are guided by 
them in their activities."
"Integrity in dealings with business partners, 
staff, shareholders and other stakeholder groups as well as value-
based and transparent enterprise management are key pillars of 
corporate governance."
"The Supervisory Board, Executive Board 
and employees of Hannover Re identify with these principles, which 
thus form part of our corporate self-image."
"It seeks 
to foster the trust of international and national investors, customers, 
employees and the general public in the management and supervi-
sion of German listed companies."
"If recommendations were not acted upon, this is 
to be explained and disclosed as part of the Declaration of Conform-
ity."
"Supplementary to the present declaration, the Declarations of 
Conformity pursuant to § 161 Stock Corporation Act (AktG) regard-
ing compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code for 
recent years are published on our website (https://www.hannover-
re.com/200801/declaration-of-conformity)."
"According to recommendation C.7 of the German Corporate Gover-
nance Code, more than half of the shareholder representatives on 
the Supervisory Board should be independent of the company and 
its Executive Board."
"A member of the Supervisory Board is inde-
pendent of the company and its Executive Board if he or she has no 
personal or business relationship with the company or its Executive 
Board that could give rise to a material conflict of interest that is not 
merely of a temporary nature."
"When assessing the independence of 
its members from the company and the Executive Board, the share-
holder side of the Supervisory Board should also consider whether 
a member has belonged to the Supervisory Board for more than 
twelve years."
"Dr. Pollak has been a member of the Supervisory 
Board since 3 May 2011, which is now twelve years."
"The Supervi-
sory Board does not see any material conflicts of interest arising 
from Ms."
"Pollak's twelve years of Supervisory Board membership 
that directly influence her work on the Supervisory Board."
"However, 
the Supervisory Board comes to the conclusion that being a mem-
ber of the Supervisory Board for many years could in principle give 
rise to conflicts of interest and will regularly review its assessment 
of Dr. Pollak's independence."
"It was pre-
sented to the Annual General Meeting for approval on 5 May 
2021."
"The remuneration system is 
submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval if any 
material changes are made to the remuneration system, and at 
least every four years."
"The remuneration report contains detailed information about 
the amount of remuneration received by the members of the Ex-
ecutive Board."
"It is governed by § 14 of the company's Articles 
of Association, https://www.hannover-re.com/34118/statute-
hannover-ruck-se.pdf."
"The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board is 
balanced overall and commensurate with the responsibility and 
tasks of the Supervisory Board members and the position of the 
company, with consideration also given to the remuneration ar-
rangements of comparable listed companies."
"The remuneration 
arrangements as well as the remuneration system are regularly 
reviewed by the Supervisory Board with an eye to their ade-
quacy, in which regard the advice of external consultants may 
also be sought."
"The Annual General Meeting considers the re-
muneration of the Supervisory Board members at least every 
four years and if changes to the remuneration arrangements are 
proposed."
"The Annual General Meeting can confirm the existing 
system of remuneration for the Supervisory Board or adopt a 
resolution to amend it."
"Complementing our corporate 
strategy, it sets out the rules governing integrity in the behav-
iour of all employees of Hannover Re and is intended to help 
members of staff cope with the ethical and legal challenges that 
they face as part of day-to-day work."
"The rules defined therein 
reflect the high standards that guide our actions worldwide."
"It is 
our belief that integrity in dealings with our stakeholders con-
stitutes the foundation of a successful enterprise."
"Risk monitoring and steering 
The risk management system applicable throughout the entire 
Hannover Re Group is based on the risk strategy, which in turn 
is derived from the corporate strategy."
"A core component is the 
systematic and comprehensive recording of all conceivable risks 
that from the current standpoint could potentially jeopardise the 
company’s profitability and continued existence."
"Further details 
in this regard may be obtained from the risk report contained in 
the present Annual Report."
"Adequacy and effectiveness of the 
internal control system and risk 
management system  
A detailed description of the main elements of the internal 
control system (ICS) and risk management system (RMS) is 
included in the opportunity and risk report."
"compliance-related 
controls as part of continuously conducted compliance 
monitoring procedures, and  
• regular audits conducted by the internal audit unit in re-
lation to the ICS and RMS."
"In connection with the aforementioned extensive measures, no 
facts or circumstances became known to the Executive Board in 
the reporting period that overall would argue against the ade-
quacy and effectiveness of the ICS and RMS."
"Sustainability of  
enterprise management 
The considerable strategic and regulatory significance attached 
to ESG issues was again evident in the year under review."
"The 
associated risks and opportunities go hand-in-hand with in-
creasing expectations placed on the role of corporate gover-
nance and on the management of sustainability risks."
"In this respect, it is envisaged that corporate gover-
nance will assume a prominent role in shaping ESG topics and 
integrate them into enterprise management."
"The Executive Board is responsible for the underlying strate-
gies, the implementation of corresponding structures and pro-
vision of appropriate resources as well as the definition of re-
sponsibilities in the organisational guidelines."
"The Supervisory 
Board is tasked with providing advice and oversight for the Ex-
ecutive Board in its leadership of the company, inter alia with 
an eye to the handling of sustainability risks."
"The wide-ranging 
qualifications, skills and relevant experience of the members of 
both bodies facilitate a nuanced evaluation of the opportunities 
and risks in business operations and enable balanced actions 
and decisions to be taken on this basis."
"The Executive Board is advised by the ESG Management Team, 
which plays a central role in ESG governance."
"This seasoned 
team is comprised of participants from various areas."
"The ESG 
Management Team ensures coordinated dovetailing with the 
Group strategy and serves as the interface to local units as well 
as the central point of contact for fulfilment of ESG-related reg-
ulatory requirements."
"It reports half-yearly to the Executive 
Board."
"More extensive submissions on sustainability issues are 
presented as necessary during the year."
"The competency profile of the Supervisory Board recognises 
""ESG"" as an important topic, with one of its members already 
designated as an ESG expert back in 2022."
"Furthermore, sus-
tainability-related issues were again addressed at the meetings 
of the Finance and Audit Committee and the full Supervisory 
Board in the year under review."
"Compliance 
Hannover Re considers a properly functioning compliance 
structure to be an essential tool for ensuring compliance with 
external rules and regulations as well as requirements imposed 
internally by the company."
"Further details of the compliance 
management system are provided in the combined non-financial 
information statement."
"The results of our compliance activities 
are documented annually in the compliance report, which is 
submitted to the Finance and Audit Committee of the Supervi-
sory Board and the full Supervisory Board; in this regard please 
see the report by the Supervisory Board included in this report."
"Working practice of the Executive Board 
and Supervisory Board 
The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Hannover Rück 
SE work together on a trusting basis to manage and supervise 
the company and the Group as a whole."
"In accordance with § 13 
of the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure of the 
Executive Board, matters of fundamental importance require 
the consent of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board is 
comprised of nine members."
"Six members are elected as share-
holder representatives by the shareholders at the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting."
"The three seats held by employee representatives, 
which are currently allocated to Germany pursuant to Part III."
"The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Exec-
utive Board."
"Since members of the Supervisory Board cannot at 
the same time belong to the Executive Board, a high degree of 
independence in the oversight of the Executive Board is thus 
already ensured by structural means."
"In addition, the Supervi-
sory Board is kept informed on a regular and timely basis of the 
business development, the execution of strategic decisions, ma-
terial risks and planning as well as relevant compliance issues."
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board stays in regular contact 
with the Chairman of the Executive Board in order to discuss 
with him significant business occurrences."
"The composition of 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

the Executive Board (including areas of responsibility) as well 
as of the Supervisory Board and its committees (including pe-
riod of membership) is provided within this report."
"The Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board are intended to 
ensure that a consistent business policy is elaborated and im-
plemented for the company in accordance with its strategic ob-
jectives."
"Within the framework of a consistent business policy, 
the principle of “delegation of responsibility” enjoys special sta-
tus."
"In the interests of shareholders, importance is expressly at-
tached to an organisation that facilitates cost-effective, quick 
and unbureaucratic decision processes."
"Open and trusting co-
operation geared to the interest of the whole is the foundation 
of success."
"In this context, the members of the Executive Board 
bear joint responsibility for the overall management of business."
"Irrespective of their overall responsibility, each member of the 
Executive Board leads their own area of competence at their in-
dividual responsibility within the bounds of the resolutions 
adopted by the Executive Board."
"Currently, at least three of the six share-
holder representatives are independent as defined by the Ger-
man Corporate Governance Code."
"Nominations shall take account of the company’s in-
ternational activities as well as diversity."
"Furthermore, it shall 
be ensured that the proposed person can allocate the expected 
amount of time."
"For their part, each sitting member of the Su-
pervisory Board shall also ensure that they have sufficient time 
to discharge their mandate."
"The Supervisory Board meets at 
least twice each calendar half-year."
"The Supervisory Board’s re-
port provides information about the attendance of individual Su-
pervisory Board members at the meetings."
"No more than two 
former members of the company’s Executive Board may belong 
to the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board decides in individual cases whether ex-
ternal advice should also be sought as a decision-making aid."
"A 
regular self-assessment is intended to survey the general effi-
ciency of its working approach and assure it on a lasting basis."
"Working practice of the committees of 
the Supervisory Board 
In order to efficiently perform its tasks the Supervisory Board 
has formed a number of committees: the Finance and Audit 
Committee, the Standing Committee and the Nomination Com-
mittee."
"The Supervisory Board committees are each comprised 
of three members (further details of the names of the members 
and background information on the individual committee mem-
bers can be found in this report)."
"They prepare matters within 
their scope of competence for discussion and adoption of a res-
olution by the full Supervisory Board."
"Moreover, the committees 
are also assigned their own authority to adopt resolutions."
"The 
number of meetings of the committees in the period under re-
view as well as the attendance of the committee members are 
discussed in greater detail in the report by the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Finance and Audit Committee was made up of Dr. Ursula 
Lipowsky (Chairwoman), Mr. Torsten Leue and Mr. Herbert 
Haas in the year under review; Dr. Lipowsky can certainly be 
considered independent within the meaning of the German Cor-
porate Governance Code."
"Dr. Lipowsky and Mr. Haas are finan-
cial experts pursuant to §100 Para."
"5 Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG), with Dr. Lipowsky having the necessary expertise par-
ticularly in accounting matters and Mr. Haas in particular when 
it comes to the auditing of financial statements."
"The committee 
monitors the accounting process and the effectiveness of the in-
ternal control system, the risk management system and the in-
ternal auditing system."
"It also handles issues relating to compli-
ance and the information system for the Supervisory Board and 
discusses the Quarterly Statements as well as the Half-yearly Fi-
nancial Report prior to their publication."
"It prepares the Super-
visory Board’s examination of the annual financial statement, 
management report and proposal for the appropriation of profit 
as well as of the consolidated financial statement and Group 
management report."
"In addi-
tion, the committee prepares the Supervisory Board’s decision 
on the commissioning of the independent auditor for the finan-
cial statements."
"It considers matters associated with the neces-
sary independence of the auditor, the awarding of the audit 
mandate to the independent auditor, the determination of the 
audit concentrations, the fee agreement and the quality of au-
diting."
"The agendas and minutes of the meetings of the Finance 
and Audit Committee are also made available to the members of 
the Supervisory Board who do not sit on the committee."
"90

"It exercises the 
powers arising out of § 112 Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in lieu 
of the Supervisory Board and – in cooperation with the Execu-
tive Board – ensures that long-term succession planning is in 
place."
"A systematic approach is taken in this regard and a list of 
potential candidates with their associated development periods 
is maintained, regularly updated and discussed by the commit-
tee in light of the diversity targets."
"This routinely constitutes an 
item for reporting and deliberation in the committee meetings 
and it is explored in detail – also in connection with the Execu-
tive Board’s strategic objectives in the area of talent manage-
ment."
"The Nomination Committee – Mr. Torsten Leue (Chairman), Mr. 
Herbert Haas and Dr. Andrea Pollak – is tasked with proposing 
to the Supervisory Board appropriate candidates for the nomi-
nations that it puts forward to the Annual General Meeting for 
election to the Supervisory Board."
"The committee met twice in 
the year under review."

Sentence 1 in conjunction with Para."
"4 German Commercial Code (HGB) 
Five members of the Supervisory Board of Hannover Rück SE 
were women in the year under review."
"A woman chairs the Fi-
nance and Audit Committee and one continues to serve as a 
member of its Nomination Committee."
"The proportion of women 
serving on the Supervisory Board was therefore 56% in 2023."
"This figure is thus above the target of 44% or four women set 
for the proportion of women serving on the Supervisory Board 
of Hannover Rück SE in the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 
2027."
"On the level of the Executive Board, the goal has hitherto been 
to appoint another woman as a member of the company’s Exec-
utive Board by the year 2024."
"In the year under review the target 
for the proportion of women on the Executive Board of Han-
nover Rück SE was set at 29% or two women by 30 June 2027."
"In 2023 two women served on the body, which has altogether 
eight members."
"A target of 25% (corresponding to 26 women) has been set for 
the two levels of senior management below the Executive Board 
in the period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2027."
"Diversity concept – Goals for the 
composition of the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board as well as status of 
implementation (§ 289f Para."
"Due con-
sideration is given to the aspect of diversity when members of 
the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are appointed."
"In 
addition to specialist and personal qualifications (competen-
cies), this aspect encompasses in particular age, gender, inter-
nationality, education and professional career."
"With a view to 
ensuring that the concept of diversity is applied on an ongoing 
basis, an assessment is made in the context of every new ap-
pointment to the Executive Board or Supervisory Board as to 
whether the envisaged appointment is also in keeping with the 
diversity concept."
"In selecting members of the Executive Board the goal is to en-
sure that the members have the skills and experience needed to 
properly perform their tasks."
"The Supervisory Board considers 
diversity in the composition of the Executive Board."
"The age 
limit for the Executive Board is set at 65."
"The members of the 
Executive Board are appointed by the Supervisory Board for a 
term of at most five years."
"Members of the Executive Board are 
initially appointed for no more than three years."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

The composition of the Supervisory Board shall be such that 
overall its members are equipped with the knowledge, abilities 
and specialist experience necessary for proper performance of 
the tasks."
"The make-up of the Supervisory Board shall ensure 
that the Executive Board in an internationally operating, broadly 
positioned reinsurance group receives qualified supervision and 
advice from the Supervisory Board."
"Above and beyond the 
legally required specialist expertise in investing, insurance 
practice and accounting, the topics of internationality, taxation, 
M & A, human resources, risk management, IT/digitalisation, 
compliance and ESG have been taken into account on a volun-
tary basis."
"The competency profile of the Supervisory Board is 
now published in a skills matrix."
"Moreover, special attention is 
to be paid to the integrity, character, commitment, profession-
alism and independence of individuals put forward for election."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory 
Board, for example, members of the Supervisory Board shall en-
sure that they have sufficient time at their disposal for their ac-
tivities and that potential conflicts of interest are avoided."
"With an eye to Hannover Re’s international orientation, it is to 
be ensured that a sufficient number of members with long-
standing international experience belong to the Supervisory 
Board."
"The goal is to at least maintain the currently existing in-
ternational profile."
"On the shareholder side, the Supervisory Board shall include an 
adequate number of members considered to be independent."
"At 
least one independent member must have expertise in account-
ing and in the auditing of financial statements."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board bears responsibility for de-
veloping and implementing the diversity concept for the compo-
sition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and the as-
sociated reporting, or for providing an explanation if no such 
diversity concept is to be pursued."
"Implementation approach and results achieved in the 
financial year  
 
Diversity on the Supervisory Board and Executive Board contin-
ued to be a major focus in the 2023 financial year."
"Since the end 
of the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2019 altogether five 
women have belonged to the Supervisory Board."
"It remains the 
case that female members of the Supervisory Board sit on two 
of the three Supervisory Board committees."
"One woman serves 
on the Finance and Audit Committee, and one is a member of 
the Nomination Committee."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board considers it important that 
an adequate number of Supervisory Board members are inde-
pendent as defined by the German Corporate Governance Code 
(DCGK)."
"In its own assessment, the Supervisory Board currently 
meets the target set by the Code because, after weighing up all 
the criteria, at least three members are independent within the 
meaning of Code Recommendation C.6."
"Dr. Schipporeit simi-
larly largely fulfils the independence criteria according to the 
Code, but in view of the fact that he was first appointed on 3 
May 2007 he has already belonged to the body for longer than 
twelve years."
"As indicated in the declaration pursuant to § 161 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Dr. Pollak continues to be re-
garded as independent despite having been a member for 
twelve years."
"The age diversity on the Executive Board ranged from 53 to 66 
in the 2023 financial year."
"On the Supervisory Board the age 
range was from 50 to 74."
"There were two female members of 
the Executive Board in 2023."
With the appointment of Ms.
"Sharon Ooi, the diversity concept for the Executive Board was 
satisfied and the Executive Board was strengthened in multiple 
ways, most notably in terms of its international experience."
"5 Stock Corporation Act (AktG) (""financial expert"")."

4 Evaluation based on annual self-assessment (2023).
"While inflation is coming down, the more restric-
tive policies adopted by central banks will likely be reflected in 
softer economic growth."
"The OECD expects global GDP to fall 
further to 2.7% in real terms (2023: 2.9%)."
"Along with central 
bank policies, weak global trade and subdued economic confi-
dence will take their toll."
"A soft landing is likely in the advanced 
economies, but by no means guaranteed."
"The relationship be-
tween inflation, the economy and labour markets has changed, 
making it difficult to assess the impacts of tighter monetary pol-
icy."
"Despite successes in the fight against inflation, it is still too 
early to sound the all-clear."
"As in the previous year, global growth is likely to develop un-
evenly."
"According to the OECD, emerging markets should gen-
erally perform better than the advanced economies."
"The pace of 
expansion in Europe is likely to lag behind North America and 
the major Asian economies."
"The US economy has fared better 
than expected and there is a risk that inflation could prove to be 
more stubborn than anticipated."
"The OECD believes that the 
tightening of monetary policy in the eurozone has still to make 
itself fully felt and economic activity could be impaired more 
than expected in 2024."
"Many emerging markets proved to be 
very resilient last year, but countries with structural debt prob-
lems are being closely watched by the financial markets."
"In view of what is already softer global trade, the OECD is rather 
cautious for 2024."
"It believes that not only cyclical but also struc-
tural factors will serve to slow the cross-border integration of 
value chains."
"Growth opportunities, for example through in-
creased trade in services, will not be utilised."
"Greater diversifi-
cation and a shift away from protectionism are needed to bring 
more stability to global value chains."
"In terms of fiscal policy, the pressure on public finances is likely 
to grow in many countries."
"Demographic changes, measures to 
slow climate change and the combination of rising interest pay-
ments and sluggish growth will reduce the scope for fiscal policy 
actions."
"Bold steps are needed to ease this pressure and put 
growth more front and centre in political decision making."
"This 
includes pressing ahead with labour market and pension re-
forms, strengthening competition and using fiscal levers to en-
courage investments that boost productivity."
"In this respect, it is especially im-
portant to evaluate the extent to which increasingly emerging 
geopolitical tensions will fuel tendencies towards deglobalisa-
tion and the formation of blocs."
"Inflation will likely continue to 
be a key factor affecting capital markets in 2024, although levels 
are expected to be lower than in the last two years."
"Particularly 
where inflation is concerned, central bank policy will be a pivotal 
element for the economy and capital markets alike."
"Following 
the about-turn in the previous expansionary policy, central 
banks will again have to manage the difficult balancing act in 
2024 of keeping inflation in check while at the same time still 
allowing sufficient impetus for economic momentum."
"Along with the progressive march of digitalisation and the on-
going development and implementation of artificial intelligence, 
the necessary efforts to bring greater efficiency to the supply of 
energy and raw materials will likely have positive effects on the 
economy."
"On capital markets, a somewhat higher level of inter-
est rates and continued elevated volatility on equity and credit 
markets are to be anticipated in what is a US election year."
"Mar-
kets for alternative and real asset classes should see a stable de-
velopment or modestly downward tendency."
"If medium- and 
long-term interest rates come down over the course of the year, 
however, renewed upward pressure on valuations in these asset 
classes is likely."
"On the consumption side, diminishing catch-up 
effects are anticipated in the United States coupled with further 
restraint in Europe."
"Investment demand in the goods sector will 
probably tend to be muted, whereas in the service sector it 
should develop positively for a limited period."
"As a consequence of the unusual capital market constellations 
seen over the past two years and the prevailing geopolitical ten-
sions, market players find themselves no longer able to take 
their lead consistently from fundamentals."
"Insurance industry 
The market environment for reinsurers remains promising, but 
is subject to increased uncertainty."
"Fitch Ratings raised its as-
sessment of the global reinsurance sector from ""neutral"" to ""im-
proving"" in autumn 2023."
"The rating agency believes that the 
current positive price trends, strong pricing discipline, rising in-
vestment returns and robust demand for reinsurance cover 
should improve the industry's earnings situation."
"Rising reinsur-
ance prices combined with more rigorous underwriting mea-
sures such as stricter conditions for inclusions and exclusions, 
reduced limits and lower total sums insured will also play a part 
here."
"Higher investment income and life reinsurance earnings 
back to pre-pandemic levels are additional factors."
"Nevertheless, market conditions are likely to remain complex."
"Inflation-related uncertainties, the potential implications of 
geopolitical risks, deglobalisation and dynamic developments 
affecting risks such as climate change or cyber business are fac-
tors that are difficult to predict."
"Fitch expects that margins will 
peak in the 2024 underwriting year as short-term price in-
creases continue to outpace cost trends."
"The rating agency also 
expects the reinsurance sector to maintain its very high capital 
adequacy due to prudent risk management and strong earnings 
performance."
"However, improved underwriting margins could 
pique the interest of institutional investors and boost the inflow 
of funds into alternative risk capital."
"The increased use of data and technology is a trend that will 
remain a central theme for the reinsurance industry in 2024."
"Analysing large data sets to support underwriting and claims 
management is nothing new for reinsurers."
"Nevertheless, the 
rapid advances in the development of artificial intelligence will 
likely accelerate the trend in order to optimise processes in 
claims handling, contract design and risk transfer."
"In addition to 
the time-saving drafting of reinsurance contracts, generative AI 
has the potential to support underwriters and actuaries in the 
pricing of reinsurance risks."
"Forecasting models and computer-
aided actuarial analyses have already been used in this area for 
years."
"Generative AI should take these models to the next level 
by delivering more accurate and efficient pricing results."
"On the 
claims side, cedants should be able to utilise generative AI to 
produce more accurate and consistent claims reports."
"This is 
particularly important for excess-of-loss contracts, where indi-
vidual loss reports may be required for certain types of claims."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
95 
Property and casualty reinsurance 
Overview 
The treaty renewals in property and casualty reinsurance as at 
1 January 2024 again passed off successfully."
"Building on the 
already very strong previous year, Hannover Re achieved addi-
tional improvements in prices and conditions and thereby fur-
ther improved the quality of its business."
"The inflation- and risk-
adjusted price increase on the renewed business averaged 
2.3%, with prices in non-proportional reinsurance rising far 
more strongly than in proportional reinsurance."
"Treaties with a premium volume of EUR 9,552 million were up 
for renewal on 1 January 2024, corresponding to 62% of the 
business in traditional property and casualty reinsurance (ex-
cluding facultative reinsurance, ILS business and structured 
reinsurance)."
"Hannover Re renewed a premium volume of EUR 8,671 million, 
while treaties worth EUR 881 million were either cancelled or 
renewed in modified form."
"Including increases of EUR 1,541 
million from new treaties and from changes in prices and treaty 
shares, the total renewed premium volume grew by 6.9% to 
EUR 10,212 million in an attractive market environment."
Prices were generally stable or moved slightly higher.
"As in the 
previous year, Hannover Re expanded its book of non-propor-
tional reinsurance more strongly in the renewals."
"Premium vol-
ume here grew by 10.6% to EUR 3,178 million, while the risk-
adjusted price increase came to 4.4%."
"Proportional reinsurance 
grew by 5.3% to EUR 7,034 million."
"The price increase here 
amounted to 1.3% after risk adjustment."
"We are thoroughly satisfied with the renewal of our retrocession 
covers."
"Based on our long-standing cooperation, we success-
fully renewed our retrocession programme with our retroces-
sionaires and thus covered our requirements according to our 
risk appetite."
Our K-cession met with strong demand.
"We were 
able to renew our non-proportional covers with unchanged pri-
orities and a slight deterioration in conditions on a risk-adjusted 
basis."
"Expectations for the development of individual markets and 
lines in property and casualty reinsurance are described in 
greater detail below."
"Regional Markets 
Europe, Middle East and Africa 
In Continental Europe, we were once again able to achieve sig-
nificantly higher prices and improved conditions across all lines 
of business in the 1 January treaty renewals."
"We further restruc-
tured our portfolio with a view to improving premium quality 
and reduced proportional business in favour of non-proportional 
programmes."
Demand for high-quality reinsurance cover remains strong.
"Market conditions are therefore not expected to soften for the 
time being, and we anticipate stabilisation on a high level over 
the course of the year."
"Hannover Re expects strong year-on-year growth in the primary 
insurance market in Germany in 2024."
"Significant premium 
growth is anticipated in the motor line as well as in the property 
lines in general in the wake of the sharp rise in claims expendi-
ture."
"The widespread flooding in northern Germany at the turn 
of the year once again highlighted the exposure to natural haz-
ards."
"Against the backdrop of the increased frequency of natural 
hazard claims, reinsurance treaties were again reviewed with an 
eye to retentions and prices and adjusted to the new circum-
stances."
"Questions around the implications of climate change 
for the insurability of natural perils risks and the further devel-
opment and implementation of sustainability criteria in the in-
surance industry remain highly relevant."
"Developments relating 
to mobility and the applications of big data and artificial intelli-
gence are also important topics facing the industry."
"In the United Kingdom, Ireland and the London Market we 
achieved price increases in all major reinsurance lines in the 
treaty renewals as at 1 January 2024."
"We expect conditions on 
the original market to remain attractive in 2024."
"Reinsurance business in the Middle East showed a positive 
price trend that was moderate in view of the low exposure to 
natural disasters and a comparatively low frequency of large 
losses in the recent past."
"Geopolitical uncertainties in the region 
have recently led to a significant increase in prices in specific 
segments such as covers for war and terrorism risks."
"We expect 
our premium volume in the Middle East and in our retakaful 
business to deliver moderate growth overall and we plan to con-
tinue selectively expanding our business in 2024 and beyond in 
view of the available growth opportunities."
"96  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
In South Africa, the trend towards better conditions for reinsur-
ers has continued and we expect further growth in 2024, partic-
ularly in non-proportional business written through reinsurance 
brokers at margins which are currently adequate."
"Americas 
Following the improvements in conditions achieved in previous 
years, it was possible to secure additional positive adjustments 
in the treaty negotiations in North America as at 1 January 
2024."
"A disciplined approach was evident among market players 
here, with positive effects on reinsurance prices and conditions."
"Improvements in property lines were considerably more marked 
than in liability lines."
"Although loss payments will probably be 
driven higher by inflation, we expect a clear increase in margins 
for our written portfolio in 2024."
"Following the recent natural catastrophe losses caused by Hur-
ricane Otis, Hannover Re expects a further increase in demand 
for corresponding reinsurance covers in Latin America."
"Simi-
larly, parametric covers continue to attract increasing interest."
"The trend towards improved rates and conditions was sustained 
in the renewals as at 1 January 2024."
"Large parts of the tradi-
tional property and casualty reinsurance portfolio in Latin Amer-
ica are, however, only renewed by Hannover Re later in the year, 
most notably in the 1 July main renewal season."
"All in all, we are 
looking for further improvement in conditions on the reinsur-
ance market against a backdrop of lower capacities for certain 
combinations of countries and perils."
"Asia-Pacific 
Insurance density in the Asia-Pacific region is still lower than in 
more mature markets."
"In the short term we expect to see con-
solidation in the business coupled with a greater focus on prof-
itability."
"Over the medium to long term, we nevertheless con-
tinue to anticipate substantial growth in property and casualty 
reinsurance in the APAC region."
"As far as the pandemic-related losses in accident and health in-
surance are concerned, we do not expect to incur any further 
strains in 2024."
"At the same time, we are seeing a clear tendency towards im-
proved profitability in the market due to corresponding pressure 
exerted by capital providers, regulators and market players."
"It is 
our expectation that the Chinese insurance industry, in particu-
lar, will improve considerably over the coming three to five 
years."
"The major reinsurers have recalibrated their risk models and 
hence their risk assessment and exposures for the coverage of 
typhoon risks in Japan in recent years."
"The increase in prices for 
industrial and fire business already recorded in the year just 
ended looks set to continue."
"It is our expectation that rates and conditions for business in 
Australia and New Zealand will continue to stabilise on a high 
level – on both the insurance and reinsurance markets – follow-
ing the severe natural catastrophe losses of recent years."
"Worldwide Markets 
Structured Reinsurance and Insurance-Linked Securities 
Given a sustained hard market around the world, we expect con-
tinued rising demand at attractive conditions in structured rein-
surance."
"The global capacity shortage appears set to continue 
on a lower level than in the previous year."
"In the area of insurance-linked securities (ILS) we anticipate 
rising demand over the long term."
"Investors are seeking a min-
imal correlation with other financial investments and hence 
greater diversification."
"We are responding to this demand with 
a strong emphasis on service, offering individually tailored so-
lutions for the transfer of property and life reinsurance risks to 
the capital market."
"Over the coming years we expect further 
growth in business volumes not only in collateralised reinsur-
ance but also when it comes to supporting catastrophe bond is-
sues and in the transfer of life reinsurance risks."
"All in all, we 
are looking for our ILS activities to deliver a positive and consis-
tently rising profit contribution."
"The capital market also remains 
a very important element in our own retrocession protection."
"Facultative reinsurance 
In facultative reinsurance we anticipate sustained attractive 
market conditions for the current financial year."
"Along with the 
potential that we continue to identify in Asia, we are focused on 
growth in property and liability business outside the United 
States."
"We also see opportunities in the engineering insurance 
segment."
"A good result is expected for 
2024."
"Aviation and Marine 
It is our expectation that the general aviation and product liabil-
ity segments will continue to show a favourable or stable devel-
opment in aviation primary insurance."
"As far as the airline seg-
ment is concerned, we do not currently anticipate a trend rever-
sal in the short term despite rising reinsurance costs."
"While we expect the positive developments to continue in 2024, 
it can be assumed that they will not be on a par with the previous 
year."
"Based on an adjustment to our Russia-Ukraine exclusion 
in response to the prevailing situation, we will also be able to 
resume business lost in the previous year and thus expand our 
portfolio again in the current positive market phase."
"In doing so, 
we will continue to focus heavily on the profitability of the port-
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
97 
folio and pay particular attention to maintaining the recently 
achieved improvements in contractual conditions for the long 
term."
"The primary insurance market for space business is expected to 
see very significant rate increases due to enormous claims ex-
penditures in 2023."
"Despite this positive market response, we 
shall scale back our reinsurance activities in favour of improving 
the composition of our portfolio."
"Further moderate price adjustments and improvements in rein-
surance conditions are expected in the marine segment for the 
2024 treaty renewals."
"If rates are adequate and the structure is 
appropriate to the risk, we are confident that we will be able to 
build on our good market position and further expand the port-
folio."
"Agricultural Risks 
We expect the quality of our portfolio in agricultural business 
to improve in 2024."
"We will continue to write our business with 
a strict focus on profitability."
"In Brazil, we achieved stable rates 
on a high level in the renewals as at 1 January 2024 and expect 
the trend to continue in the renewals during the year."
"In the 
United States, prices for non-proportional treaties are stable or 
rising."
"We are only prepared to renew proportional business if 
we can achieve improvements in prices and conditions."
"In India, 
we have reduced our exposure due to persistently unattractive 
reinsurance conditions and will continue to write selectively 
over the course of the year."
"A considerable improvement in rein-
surance conditions and an increase in the retentions carried by 
primary insurers are also necessary."
"Life and health reinsurance 
Along with sustained intense competition, we continue to see 
good prospects for robustly capitalised reinsurers such as Han-
nover Re in life and health business in 2024."
"Promising oppor-
tunities should generally open up in all areas due to increased 
customer demand and changing local regulatory requirements."
"In Financial Solutions business it is our assumption that the 
favourable trend on markets that have been the most important 
for our business to date, such as the United States and China, 
will continue."
"We also expect to see global growth in demand in 
this area."
"Turning to Longevity Solutions, it is our expectation that cov-
erage of longevity-related risks will remain important and con-
tinue to generate interest among primary insurers and pension 
funds around the world in corresponding solutions."
"In the area of Mortality and Morbidity Solutions, we anticipate 
sustained brisk demand among our customers."
"Investments 
Given the geopolitical and economic uncertainties, we shall con-
tinue to invest major parts of our asset holdings conservatively."
"In particular, we believe that certain risks to global economic 
growth are not yet adequately reflected in credit spreads and 
equity prices."
"We are nevertheless monitoring markets very 
closely with an eye to entry opportunities commensurate with 
the risks and we shall continue to attach great importance to 
broad diversification."
"By maintaining the most neutral possible 
modified duration relative to the expected maturities of the lia-
bilities, we shall ensure that the interest rate risk remains tightly 
managed."
"The good operating cash flow based on the expected favourable 
development of business should be reflected in an enlarged as-
set portfolio and have a positive effect on investment income."
"The interest rates on short-term investments expected during 
the reporting period in our main currency areas are also bene-
ficial in this respect."
"Despite retreating in the period under re-
view, interest rates in the medium and longer maturity segment 
also remain clearly above the level of previous years, which will 
likely have similarly positive implications."
"Overall, however, the level of returns on high-quality invest-
ments still tends to be rather low."
"We shall therefore continue 
to invest  in products offering attractive credit spreads and in-
crease our positions opportunistically in some cases."
"With this 
in mind, we also intend to moderately expand the portfolio of 
real assets or the financing of such asset classes."
"In so doing, 
we shall maintain a particular focus going forward – as in the 
past – on attractive risk-return profiles against the backdrop of 
the new interest rate landscape."
"We similarly intend to selec-
tively grow our exposure, as appropriate, to the areas of private 
equity and emerging markets."
"If the valuation levels of listed equities experience significant 
corrections and stabilise, we are prepared to moderately in-
crease the portfolio of listed equities."
"In terms of inflation, we expect the measured indices to show 
significantly less momentum than in previous years, leading to 
a lower return from the amortisation of our inflation-linked 
bonds."
"Due to application of the accounting standard IFRS 9, we expect 
the income statement for investments to show increased mar-
ket-driven volatility and somewhat reduced predictability."
"This 
is because the fair value changes of a significantly larger part of 
the investments are recognised directly in profit or loss."
"The con-
tractual service margin (net) is planned to grow by more than 
2% per year on average across the cycle."
"Furthermore, a capital 
adequacy ratio under Solvency II of more than 200% is tar-
geted."
"The increasing earnings anticipated across the strategy cycle 
will support further growth in the ordinary dividend."
"In the years 
2024-2026 the ordinary dividend is expected to increase year-
on-year."
"The ordinary dividend will be supplemented by a spe-
cial dividend provided the capitalisation exceeds the capital re-
quired for future growth."
"Outlook for the 2024 financial year 
In view of the continued positive market climate for reinsurers, 
Hannover Re expects Group net income to grow to at least EUR 
2.1 billion for the 2024 financial year."
"Based on constant ex-
change rates, reinsurance revenue should increase by more 
than 5%, with revenue growth in property and casualty reinsur-
ance outpacing that in life and health reinsurance."
"In property and casualty reinsurance we expect a combined 
ratio of less than 89% for the current financial year thanks to 
the improved market environment."
"In response to the growth in the book of property and casualty 
reinsurance and the further increase in the loss expectancy from 
natural catastrophes, Hannover Re has raised its net large loss 
budget for 2024 to EUR 1.825 billion (EUR 1.725 billion)."
"Thanks to our good rating, our long-standing stable customer 
relationships and our low expense ratio, we should be able to 
generate another good result in property and casualty reinsur-
ance."
"In life and health reinsurance we anticipate a reinsurance ser-
vice result of more than EUR 850 million for the current financial 
year."
"In view of the expected positive cash flow that we generate from 
the technical account and the investments themselves, and as-
suming roughly stable exchange rates and interest rate levels, 
our portfolio of investments should continue to show moderate 
growth."
"The return generated on investments under own man-
agement should reach at least 2.8%."
"As usual, all forward-looking statements regarding future tar-
gets are based on the assumption that there are no unforeseen 
distortions on capital markets and that large loss expenditure 
remains within the budgeted level."

(IFRIC), application of which was mandatory for the year under 
review."
"“Insurance Contracts” requires dis-
closures on the nature and extent of risks stemming from rein-
surance contracts, while IFRS 7.31-42 “Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures” requires similar information on risks from financial 
instruments."
"2 Number 1 German 
Commercial Code (HGB) also contains requirements for insur-
ance undertakings with regard to information on the manage-
ment of underwriting and financial risks that is to be provided 
in the management report."
"The disclosures resulting from these 
requirements are included in the risk report."
"With regard to the 
disclosures required by IFRS 17 and IFRS 7, we would refer in 
particular to our remarks in the subsection “Underwriting risks 
in property and casualty reinsurance / Underwriting risks in life 
and health reinsurance” and the subsection “Market risks” re-
spectively."
"These subsections of the Group management report 
are to be considered an integral part of the notes to the consol-
idated financial statements."
"In order to obtain a comprehensive 
overview of the risk situation to which Hannover Re is exposed, 
it is therefore necessary to consider both the risk report and the 
relevant information in the notes."
"For the sake of better orienta-
tion, we refer the reader accordingly to the corresponding re-
marks in the risk report and the notes."
"The annual financial statements included in the consolidated fi-
nancial statement were for the most part drawn up as at 31 De-
cember."
"Pursuant to IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial State-
ments” there is no requirement to compile interim accounts for 
Group companies with diverging reporting dates because their 
closing dates are no earlier than three months prior to the clos-
ing date for the consolidated financial statement."
"Insofar as no 
interim accounts were drawn up, allowance has been made for 
the effects of significant transactions between the diverging re-
porting dates and the closing date for the consolidated financial 
statement."
"The annual financial statements of all companies were drawn up 
in accordance with standard Group accounting and measure-
ment rules pursuant to IFRS."
"The consolidated financial statement was drawn up in euros 
(EUR); the amounts shown have been rounded to EUR millions."
"Unless otherwise explicitly indicated, amounts in brackets refer 
to the previous year."
"Hannover Re is publishing its consolidated financial statement 
as at 31 December 2023 in accordance with the provisions of 
the German ESEF Implementation Act (ESEF = European Single 
Electronic Format)."
"The present consolidated financial statement was released for 
publication by a resolution of the Executive Board on 13 March 
2024."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
109 
New accounting standards or accounting standards applied for the first time
With effect from 1 January 2023 Hannover Re applied the ac-
counting standards IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” and IFRS 9 
“Financial Instruments” for the first time."
"Both standards were 
initially applied retrospectively in observance of any options or 
transitional arrangements."
"The opening balance sheet in con-
sideration of the principles of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 was drawn up 
as at 1 January 2022."
"IFRS 17 ”Insurance Contracts” replaces the existing transitional 
arrangements of IFRS 4 and establishes a comprehensive ac-
counting framework for the recognition, measurement and dis-
closure of insurance contracts."
"In addition, IFRS 17 requires ex-
tensive new disclosures in the notes."
"Unless otherwise explicitly 
indicated, the term ”insurance” includes reinsurance in the 
following explanatory remarks."
"Before a contract is recognised pursuant to IFRS 17, we check 
whether the contract contains components that are to be sepa-
rated and recognised separately according to the provisions ap-
plicable to them."
"Hannover Re's business largely contains two 
categories of such components: 
• cash flows related to embedded derivatives to be recog-
nised separately under IFRS 9; 
• cash flows related to distinct investment components 
that are similarly to be recognised under IFRS 9."
"The standard introduces three new measurement models, the 
basis being the “general measurement model” (GMM)."
"The 
“variable fee approach” (VFA) is a variant of the general mea-
surement model for insurance contracts with a direct surplus 
participation and is not applicable to reinsurance business."
"The 
“premium allocation approach” (PAA) is a simplified method 
that can be used by insurers and reinsurers when certain criteria 
are met."
"Hannover Re's portfolio contains both contracts that 
qualify for the premium allocation approach and – predomi-
nantly – contracts for which the general measurement model is 
to be applied."
"For operational reasons and in order to achieve 
consistent and comparable presentation and measurement 
within the portfolio of insurance and reinsurance contracts, 
Hannover Re is applying the general measurement model to its 
entire business."
"The general measurement model measures receivables and 
payables from reinsurance business by the fulfilment value plus 
the contractual service margin."
"The fulfilment value constitutes the risk-adjusted present value 
of the rights and obligations from a reinsurance treaty and is 
comprised of the estimates of expected future cash flows, their 
discounting and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial 
risks."
"If the present value of the expected future cash inflows exceeds 
the present value of the expected future cash outflows plus the 
risk adjustment, an expected profit exists that is deferred within 
the contractual service margin (CSM) and spread across the cov-
erage period."
"Initial balance sheet recognition of contracts ex-
pected to be profitable thus has no effect on profit or loss."
"Hannover Re discounts all cash flows using currency-specific, 
risk-free yield curves that are adjusted to reflect the respective 
characteristics of the cash flows and the liquidity of the under-
lying insurance contracts (“bottom-up approach”)."
"The provisions of IFRS 17 open up the option of recognising dis-
counting effects within the non-financial risk adjustment not 
separately in the reinsurance finance result but rather together 
with the release of the risk adjustment within the technical re-
sult."
"This option is exercised in the property and casualty rein-
surance segment."
"As a general principle, insurance and reinsurance contracts are 
grouped together and measured on an aggregated level."
"For this 
purpose, we define as a first step portfolios containing contracts 
with similar risks that are managed together."
"In a second step, 
we split these portfolios into groups of contracts according to 
profitability criteria and annual cohorts."
"Contracts 
issued within a calendar year are combined into annual cohorts."
"Under IFRS 17 there is a requirement to group contracts into 
such annual cohorts."
"In the context of the EU endorsement, 
 
110  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
however, an option to build annual cohorts was granted for cer-
tain types of contracts."
"Hannover Re is not using this EU exemp-
tion."
"The standard must be applied retrospectively unless this is im-
practicable (IFRS 17 C3)."
"In this case, especially if an adequate 
data basis for full retrospective application is not available, it is 
possible to apply either a modified retrospective approach or a 
fair value approach on the level of the group of contracts."
"Using adequately robust information that is available without 
unreasonable effort, the modified retrospective approach is in-
tended to arrive at an overall result that approximates retrospec-
tive application."
"Overall, the balance of the technical OCI 
positions and the investment OCI positions produces the 
OCI from investments not used to cover underwriting lia-
bilities."
"Under the fair value approach, the contractual service margin of 
a group of contracts at the transition date is established as the 
difference between the fair value of this group calculated ac-
cording to IFRS 13 and the corresponding fulfilment value cal-
culated according to IFRS 17."
"Hannover Re is applying each of the aforementioned transition 
arrangements, differentiated according to certain groups of con-
tracts."
"Measured by their net technical liability, the proportion of con-
tracts for which the full retrospective approach was used was 
around 36%."
"The modified retrospective approach and the fair 
value approach were applied to roughly 26% and roughly 38% 
of the portfolio respectively."
"The application of IFRS 17 has a number of implications for the 
structure of the consolidated balance sheet."
"In addition to the 
changed technical items under the general measurement model, 
certain items that are currently reported separately are elimi-
nated and recognised under the reinsurance liabilities in accor-
dance with the general model."
"This is the case, for example, with 
the deferred acquisition costs, the reinsurance recoverables and 
funds withheld."
"Furthermore, the standard fundamentally changes the consoli-
dated statement of income and differentiates between the rein-
surance result, which is composed of the reinsurance revenue 
and reinsurance service expenses, and the reinsurance finance 
income and expenses."
"Gross written premium is no longer disclosed, instead being re-
placed with reinsurance revenue that is defined in such a way 
as to facilitate comparison with the revenue disclosures of other 
sectors."
"Neither savings / investment components nor certain 
ceding commissions can be recognised in the reinsurance rev-
enue."
"Reinsurance finance income and expenses result from discount-
ing effects and financial risks."
"In accordance with the option 
granted by IFRS 17, they can either be recognised entirely as 
profit or loss in the statement of income or in part directly in 
equity."
"This “OCI option” can be exercised on the level of indi-
vidual portfolios and is utilised by Hannover Re for a large part 
of its business."
"There are no material circumstances 
within the Hannover Re Group that meet these criteria."
"Changes in assumptions about future cash flows that do not re-
late to interest rates or financial risks are not recognised directly 
in the statement of income but are instead booked against the 
contractual service margin and hence spread across the remain-
ing coverage period."
"Recognition in profit or loss is only imme-
diate in the case of those groups of reinsurance contracts that 
are expected to be loss-making."
"If this adjustment to the con-
tractual service margin exceeds its carrying amount, a loss com-
ponent is established analogously to the initial recognition of 
groups of contracts that are expected to be loss-making and 
recognised directly in profit or loss."
"Conversely, it may happen 
that a contractual service margin is established in the context of 
subsequent measurement of a group of contracts originally clas-
sified as probably loss-making."
"In property and casualty reinsurance there is an overall decline 
of EUR 743.0 million in the amount of the net technical liability."
"An anticipated significant increase of EUR 2,455.6 million was 
recorded in the technical liabilities in the life and health reinsur-
ance segment."
"This is due primarily to the measurement of port-
folios in the US and Asian markets as well as from the United 
Kingdom."
"The retention of the reserving approach hitherto adopted by 
Hannover Re – insofar as this is possible under IFRS 17 – results 
in the recognition of a loss component for some groups of con-
tracts at the time of initial recognition, although this may even 
out over time and lead to run-off profits."
"Initial mandatory application of the standard was envisaged for 
annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018."
"However, the IASB published “Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying 
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts“ 
in September 2016 and ”Amendments to IFRS 4: Extension of 
the Temporary Exemption from Applying IFRS 9“ in June 2020."
"These amendments extended the temporary deferral of initial 
application of IFRS 9 ”Financial Instruments”“ that had been 
granted to insurers and reinsurers (“deferral approach“) until 1 
January 2023, with the result that IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 could first 
be applied by Hannover Re at the same time."
"In order to be able to take advantage of the temporary deferral, 
it was necessary to demonstrate that Hannover Re's predomi-
nant activity is the issuance of insurance and reinsurance con-
tracts within the scope of IFRS 4."
"Hannover Re reviewed the ap-
plication requirements based on the consolidated financial 
statement as at 31 December 2015 with a positive outcome and 
decided to make use of the option of temporary deferral."
"Since 
the review of the application requirements there has been no 
change in business activity that would have necessitated a re-
evaluation of the predominant activity."
"While the retrospective application of IFRS 17 provides for the 
presentation of comparative information for the 2022 financial 
year, this is not the case with initial application of IFRS 9."
"This option is intended to help entities avoid temporary account-
ing mismatches between financial assets and insurance contract 
liabilities in the 2022 comparative year, thereby improving the 
usefulness of comparative information for users of financial 
statements."
"It allows for an overlay in the classification of finan-
cial assets in the comparative period that is presented on initial 
application of IFRS 17 (”overlay approach“)."
"Hannover Re applied this approach, including the provisions of 
IFRS 9 regarding impairment losses, consistently to all eligible 
financial instruments."
"The classification of financial instruments according to IFRS 9 
is guided, on the one hand, by the cash flow characteristics of 
the financial instruments and, on the other, by the business 
model used to manage the financial instruments."
"In general, the business model “hold“ is no longer appli-
cable to Hannover Re, while EUR 2,799.9 million of the invest-
ments measured according to IAS 39 were still recognised at 
amortised cost prior to the transition date."
"In view of the nature 
of reinsurance business, the bulk of our portfolio of debt instru-
ments is allocated to the business model “hold and sell”."
"A large 
portion of the financial instruments shown in the investments is 
therefore classified in the category ”fair value through other 
comprehensive income”."
"The holding of these financial instru-
ments decreased in the opening balance sheet as at 1 Janu-
ary 2022 to EUR 48,169.2 million (IAS 39: EUR 49,671.8 mil-
lion)."
"The new classification rules introduced by IFRS 9 also result in 
significantly more financial instruments in the investments be-
ing measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"As at 1 January 
2022 Hannover Re recognises financial instruments in an 
amount of EUR 4,944.8 million at fair value through profit or 
 
112  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
loss (IAS 39: EUR 329.5 million)."
"The bulk of this increase was 
attributable to unts in publicly offered funds, private equity in-
vestments and debt instruments that do not pass the SPPI 
(“solely payment of principal and interest”) test due to their cash 
flow characteristics."
"This can lead to increased volatility in re-
sults in future financial years."
"Primarily due to the disclosure of hidden reserves on securities 
previously measured at amortised cost, the transition to recog-
nition of financial instruments under IFRS 9 gives rise to an in-
crease of EUR 312.8 million in the book values of financial in-
struments."
"Reduced by the mitigating effect of deferred taxes, the transition 
to the accounting standards IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 as at 1 Janu-
ary 2022 caused the reported shareholders' equity of Hannover 
Re to decrease by altogether EUR 1,707.2 million."
"The reduc-
tion in the reported shareholders' equity as at 1 January 2022 is 
opposed by the establishment of the contractual service margin 
as the present value of expected future earnings."
"For Hannover 
Re this amounts to EUR 6,144.1 million before tax at the transi-
tion date and is thus far greater than the reduction in the re-
ported shareholders' equity."
"This decrease was attributable in 
particular to measurement in the life and health reinsurance 
segment and was driven principally by the prevailing interest 
rate level at the transition date of 1 January 2022."
"In the course 
of 2022, however, this effect was reversed as interest rates rose, 
with the result that the shareholders' equity of EUR 9,956.9 mil-
lion as at 31 December 2022 is EUR 1,209.2 million higher than 
that reported in the Annual Report 2022 under IAS 39 and 
IFRS 4."
"Along with the changes described in connection with initial ap-
plication of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9, the following amendments to 
existing standards were applicable for the first time in the re-
porting period."
"The amendments 
to IAS 12 introduce a temporary, mandatory exception to ac-
counting for deferred taxes arising from implementation of the 
Pillar Two Model Rules together with certain disclosure require-
ments."
"The temporary exception applies retrospectively in con-
formity with IAS 8 and immediately upon publication, while the 
new disclosure requirements were to be fulfilled effective year-
end 2023."
"Hannover Re has begun preparations for implemen-
tation of the complex Pillar Two rules and has fulfilled the new 
disclosure requirements accordingly."
"With respect to the latter, 
we would refer to our remarks in section 7.5 “Taxes on income”."
"Accounting policies 
3.1."
"Summary of major accounting policies
Classification of contracts: A contract is to be classified as a 
reinsurance contract issued or as a reinsurance contract held 
pursuant to FRS 17 if a significant insurance risk is thereby as-
sumed or transferred."
"These contract types are treated accord-
ing to the same rules, irrespective of whether the contracts were 
issued, acquired in connection with a merger or acquired as part 
of a transfer of contracts that do not constitute business opera-
tions."
"Contracts that may take the legal form of an insurance 
contract but do not transfer any significant insurance risk are 
classified as investment contracts."
"The recognition and mea-
surement of such contracts follows the rules for the recognition 
of financial instruments according to IFRS 9."
"Financial instruments are recognised and derecognised on ac-
quisition or sale at the fulfilment date pursuant to IFRS 9."
"Fi-
nancial assets are split into one of three categories on acquisi-
tion according to their cash flow characteristics and respective 
purpose: (i) amortised cost (AC), (ii) fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) and (iii) fair value through 
profit or loss (FVPL)."
"Financial liabilities are classified either as 
financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss or as 
financial instruments measured at amortised cost."
"For further 
information we would refer to our separate explanatory remarks 
in this section."
"This business model is applied only in 
exceptional cases in the Hannover Re Group."
"Fi-
nancial assets classified in the FVOCI category are measured at 
fair value, with all changes in fair value recognised in OCI allow-
ing for accrued interest and deferred taxes and disclosed in 
shareholders' equity under the other reserves."
"Premiums and 
discounts are spread across the maturity using the effective in-
terest rate method."
"A large part of Hannover Re's investments 
fall under the business model with the objective of collecting 
cash flows and selling, because the investments are predomi-
nantly used to cover underwriting risks and sales are therefore 
influenced by the servicing of these obligations."
"There is an option to designate equity instruments as FVOCI on 
initial recognition, without recycling to profit and loss."
"In this 
case, changes in fair value are recognised directly in OCI and 
not recycled to P&L even on disposal."
"As a general principle, 
Hannover Re exercises this option for equities and unconsoli-
dated participations."
"This includes first and foremost complex structured products, 
units in investment funds and private equity investments as well 
 
114  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
as short-term investments."
"In addition, all derivative assets are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss and, provided they 
have positive fair values, recognised in this category."
"Deriva-
tives with negative fair values are recognised under the other 
liabilities."
"All securities measured at fair value through profit or 
loss are carried at the fair value on the closing date."
"If market 
prices that can be used as fair values are not available, the book 
values of the relevant financial instruments are determined us-
ing recognised measurement methods."
"All unrealised gains or 
losses from measurements of this type are recognised in profit 
or loss just like realised gains and losses and reported in the 
investment income."

"The fair value of a financial instru-
ment corresponds to the amount that Hannover Re would re-
ceive or pay if it were to sell or settle the said financial instru-
ment on the balance sheet date."
"Insofar as market prices are 
listed on markets for financial assets, their bid price is used; fi-
nancial liabilities are valued at ask price."
"In other cases the fair 
values are established on the basis of the market conditions pre-
vailing on the balance sheet date for financial assets with similar 
credit rating, duration and return characteristics or using recog-
nised models of mathematical finance."
"Hannover Re uses a num-
ber of different valuation models for this purpose."
"The details 
are set out in the table above."
"Financial assets for which no pub-
licly available prices or observable market data can be used as 
inputs (financial instruments belonging to fair value hierarchy 
level 3) are for the most part measured on the basis of proven 
valuations drawn up by knowledgeable, independent experts, 
e."
"net asset value, the plausibility of which has previously 
been subjected to systematic review."
"For further information 
please see our explanatory remarks on the fair value hierarchy 
in section 6.1 “Investments”."
"Impairments: The impairment rules set out in IFRS 9 apply to 
all debt instruments recognised at amortised cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income."
"The risk provision for 
such instruments is measured using, among other 
things, the default probabilities for the next 12 months."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
115 
• Stage 2 consists of debt instruments that are not credit-
impaired, but whose credit risk has increased signifi-
cantly since initial recognition."
"The significant increase 
in the credit risk is established primarily on the basis of 
the credit rating specific to the individual instrument or 
using alternative quantitative and qualitative information, 
a credit risk assessment and forward-looking informa-
tion."
"The risk provision is calculated using the default 
probabilities for the entre remaining maturities of the in-
struments."
"• Stage 3 consists of all debt instruments that are classi-
fied as credit-impaired."
"For all three stages, the risk provision to be made and its rever-
sal are determined at the reporting data and individually for 
each specific instrument."
"The resulting expense and income are 
recognised in the statement of income."
"The determination of the risk provision to be made for Stages 1 
and 2 is based on the potential default amount weighted by the 
risk of default."
"The following three parameters are primarily 
considered here: 
• the probability of default (PD), 
• the loss given default (LGD) and 
• the exposure at default (EAD)."
"Year-specific probabilities of default are used for Stage 2 to es-
tablish the ECL for the entire remaining maturities of the assets."
"These input factors are regularly recalibrated to reflect the fore-
cast development of macroeconomic conditions in accordance 
with the requirements of IFRS 9 through the use of region- and 
period-specific point-in-time (PIT) factors."
"If a debt instrument 
is classified as credit-impaired and hence carried in Stage 3, 
measurement of the risk provision is based on the fair value at 
the balance sheet date."
"Upon acquisition, all financial instruments are initially allocated 
to Stage 1."
"In cases where the credit risk has significantly in-
creased, they are transferred to Stage 2."
"Given that allocation to 
a stage is dependent on the rating at the time of acquisition, 
shares in a financial instrument acquired at different times can 
be allocated to both Stage 1 and Stage 2."
"A significant increase 
in the credit risk triggering the transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 
exists if the financial instrument has a current issuer rating in 
the non-investment-grade range and the rating of the instru-
ment has been downgraded at least twice since initial recogni-
tion."
"Hannover Re uses the optional simplification under which 
financial instruments with a low credit risk are not allocated to 
Stage 2 if they still have an investment-grade issuer rating."
"The allocation of financial instruments to Stage 3, on the other 
hand, is made on the basis of the counterparty's default status."
"If a significant increase in the credit risk exists but the financial 
instrument was not classified as credit-impaired, the financial 
instrument in question remains in Stage 2."
"If none of the afore-
mentioned stage transfer criteria applies any longer and the fi-
nancial instrument is not credit-impaired, it is allocated to Stage 
1."
"In the event of credit impairment, it is allocated to Stage 3."
"If 
a previously credit-impaired financial instrument is no longer 
considered to be credit-impaired, it is reclassified to Stage 2 or 
Stage 1 depending on applicability of the stage-specific criteria."
"An overview of the impairments on financial instruments can be 
found in section 6.1 “Investments”."
"Other invested assets: The other invested assets are participat-
ing interests in entities over which we are unable to exercise a 
significant influence or control."
"Subsidiaries that are not consol-
idated for reasons of materiality are also included in this item."
These interests are normally measured at fair value in OCI.
"Investments in associated companies and joint ventures are 
valued at equity on the basis of the proportionate shareholders’ 
equity attributable to the Group."
"Further information is provided 
in section 4.1 “Consolidation principles”."
"Investment property is valued at cost less depreciation and im-
pairment."
"Straight-line depreciation is taken over the expected 
useful life – at most 50 years."
"Under the impairment test the 
market value of investment property (recoverable amount) is de-
termined using accepted valuation methods, compared with the 
book value and, where necessary, impairments are recognised."
Maintenance costs and repairs are expensed.
"Value-enhancing 
expenditures are capitalised if they extend the useful life."
Cash and cash equivalents are carried at face value.
"Cash col-
lateral that we have received for the hedging of positive fair val-
ues of derivatives is shown under other liabilities."
"Repurchase agreements (repo transactions): fully collater-
alised, term repurchase agreements (repos) are entered into as 
a supplementary liquidity management tool."
"In this context the 
Group sells securities and at the same time commits to repur-
chase them at a later date for an agreed price."
"Given that the 
material risks and opportunities associated with the financial in-
struments remain within the Group, we continue to recognise 
these assets."
"116  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Reinsurance recoverables on technical reserves: shares of our 
retrocessionaires in the technical reserves are calculated ac-
cording to the contractual conditions on the basis of the gross 
technical reserves."
"An appropriate impairment is taken to allow 
for objective substantial indications of credit risks that are based 
on an event after initial recognition and suggest impairment, in-
sofar as this can be reliably measured."
"For further information 
please refer to the subsection ""Retrocession contracts"" in this 
section."
"Intangible assets: in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combi-
nations” goodwill is not amortised; instead, impairments may be 
taken after an annual impairment test or as indicated."
"For the 
purposes of the impairment test, goodwill is to be allocated pur-
suant to IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets” to so-called “cash gen-
erating units” (CGUs)."
"Each CGU to which goodwill is allocated 
should represent the lowest level on which goodwill is moni-
tored for internal management purposes and may not be larger 
than a segment."
"Following allocation of the goodwill it is neces-
sary to determine for each CGU the recoverable amount, defined 
as the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to 
sell."
"For impaired goodwill the recoverable amount is to be 
stated."
"The recoverable amount is to be compared with the book 
value of the CGU including goodwill."
"When the latter exceeds 
the recoverable amount, an impairment expense is to be recog-
nised."
"For detailed information on the impairment method used 
and the goodwill recognised as at the balance sheet date, please 
see section 6.2 “Goodwill”."
"Purchased and proprietary software is recognised at acquisition 
cost less depreciation."
"Intangible assets are regularly tested for 
impairment and an impairment loss is recognised where neces-
sary."
"The other intangible assets include separately identifiable intan-
gible assets in connection with business combinations, such as 
customer base or contractual / legal rights."
"De-
ferred tax assets and liabilities are not established if they arise 
out of assets or liabilities, the book value of which upon first-
time recognition diverges from their initial tax base."
"Deferred tax assets are also recognised on tax loss carry-for-
wards and tax credits."
"Insofar as the deferred taxes refer to 
items carried directly in equity, the resulting deferred taxes are 
also recognised directly in equity."
"Value adjustments are taken 
on deferred tax assets as soon as realisation of the receivable no 
longer appears likely."
"Deferred taxes are measured according to 
the tax regulations specific to the country concerned that are 
applicable or have been adopted as at the closing date."
"Deferred tax assets may only be netted with deferred tax liabili-
ties if an enforceable right exists to net actual tax refund claims 
with actual taxes owing."
"A precondition here is that the deferred 
tax assets and deferred tax liabilities refer to income taxes that 
are levied by the same revenue authority either for (i) the same 
taxable entity or for (ii) different taxable entities."
"Own-use real estate: the portfolio of own-use real estate is mea-
sured at cost less straight-line depreciation over a useful life of 
no more than 50 years."
"The fair values are determined for com-
parative purposes using the discounted cash flow method."
"Right-of-use assets from lease contracts are measured at 
amortised cost in the amount of the initial measurement of the 
lease liability, adjusted for prepaid lease payments, lease incen-
tives received, initial direct costs incurred and probable restora-
tion costs (cf."
"here our comments on lease liabilities in the sub-
section ""Financing liabilities"")."
"Right-of-use assets are amor-
tised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contract."
Other assets are accounted for at amortised cost.
"In the recognition of the corresponding technical reserves a fun-
damental distinction is made between a pre-claims phase (lia-
bility for remaining coverage; LRC) and a claims phase after oc-
currence of the insured event (liability for incurred claims; LIC)."
"Fulfilment value – cash flows: Components of the cash flows to 
be included are, among others, premium payments, payments 
to cedants, costs for acquisition and management of the con-
tracts as well as for settlement of incurred claims."
"In this con-
text, the cash flows included in the measurement model at each 
balance sheet date always constitute Hannover Re's current es-
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
117 
timate and expectation in connection with the fulfilment of obli-
gations."
"Time value of money – discounting: Hannover Re discounts all 
cash flows with currency-specific, risk-free yield curves that are 
adjusted to reflect the respective characteristics of the cash 
flows and the liquidity of the underlying insurance contracts 
(bottom-up approach)."
"The illiquidity premium used is based on 
risk-adjusted spreads of corporate and government bonds."
"• All characteristics of an insurance contract (or a group of 
insurance contracts) can be fully described and mea-
sured through the characteristics of its resulting cash 
flows."
"• The illiquidity premiums are estimated on the basis of 
liquidity premiums for financial assets observable on the 
market that are adjusted to reflect the illiquidity charac-
teristics of the cash flows on the liabilities side."
"The illiq-
uidity premiums used in this context are based on risk-
adjusted spreads of corporate and government bonds."
"Hannover Re uses a “pricing margin approach” to de-
termine the risk adjustment and regularly reviews the risk ad-
justment to ensure that it is always consistent with the compen-
sation required to carry the risk."
"The approach refers to the fact 
that the question of the necessary compensation for the uncer-
tainty of the cash flows is already answered in connection with 
the premium calculation."
"The loadings on the cash flows deter-
mined here form the risk adjustment pursuant to IFRS 17."
"Ap-
plying this approach and allowing for risk diversification among 
the companies belonging to the Hannover Re Group, the confi-
dence level for our technical reserves at the balance sheet date 
is 83.1% (83.2%)."
"Contractual service margin (CSM): The contractual service 
margin defers a profit expected at the time of acquisition and 
spreads it according to provision of the service across the cov-
erage period."
"Specifically, this means: 
• If the present value of the expected cash inflows exceeds 
the present value of the expected cash outflows plus the 
risk adjustment, an expected profit exists that we recog-
nise in the contractual service margin."
"Initial balance 
sheet recognition of contracts expected to be profitable 
thus has no effect on profit or loss."
"• Subsequent measurement of the contractual service mar-
gin reflects the rendering of a service in the form of in-
surance contract service."
"The insurance contract service 
consists of the benefit paid in case of occurrence of the 
insured event and the policyholder's participation in in-
come generated on the capital market through invest-
ment of paid insurance premiums."
"An amount is released 
from the CSM to profit or loss in the corresponding re-
porting periods as a service fee for rendering of this ser-
vice and recognised in the statement of income as part of 
the insurance revenue."
"So-called “coverage units“ are 
used to measure this service in a reporting period."
"• These coverage units are based on the quantities of ben-
efits provided at the end of the reporting period relative 
to those expected to be provided over the entire contract 
duration in order to determine the service rendered for 
the period."
"We select the coverage units for each insur-
ance transaction in such a way that they optimally reflect 
the service provided in each case."
"General measurement model – subsequent measurement: 
The book value of a group of insurance contracts at each closing 
date is the sum of the liability for remaining coverage (LRC) and 
the liability for incurred claims (LIC)."
"• The liability for remaining coverage consists of the fulfil-
ment value relating to future payments allocated to the 
group of contracts at this time as well as the CSM for the 
group at the closing date."
"• The liability for incurred claims consists of the fulfilment 
value for incurred claims plus expenditures not yet paid, 
including claims already incurred but not yet reported."
"Hannover Re 
splits the insurance finance income and expenses between P&L 
and OCI."
"Systematic allocation is ensured through use of the dis-
count rate on initial recognition."
"This means that the year-end re-
sults are not influenced by the treatment of accounting-related 
estimates made in earlier interim financial statements."
"These are recognised through adjustment of the CSM for 
as long as the CSM is available."
"Retrocession contracts: The accounting policies described 
above are also applied as a general principle to reinsurance con-
tracts held."
"Retroceded business is additionally subject to the 
special recognition and measurement principles described be-
low."
"On each balance sheet date Hannover Re estimates the future 
cash flows and their discounting based on current assumptions."
"The assumptions are consistent with the assumptions chosen for 
measurement of the underlying issued reinsurance contracts."
"The risk adjustment for non-financial risk with respect to busi-
ness retroceded is determined as the part of the risks effectively 
transferred to the retrocessionaire."
"In this regard, Hannover Re 
always strives for the greatest possible consistency with the de-
termination of the risk adjustment for non-financial risks for the 
underlying gross business."
"In contrast to the recognition of issued reinsurance contracts, 
the contractual service margin for ceded reinsurance contracts 
can be positive or negative."
"In the case of prospective retrocession contracts, both a net 
profit and net costs are to be deferred on acquisition of the retro-
cession across the coverage period."
"Changes in fulfilment values 
are offset against the contractual service margin, insofar as 
these changes relate to future services."
"If, however, the changes 
in estimates are attributable to measurement adjustments to the 
underlying contracts recognised in profit or loss, we recognise 
their effect on the measurement of the ceded reinsurance con-
tracts directly in profit or loss."
"This facilitates consistent map-
ping of the gross business with the ceded insurance contracts."
"The contractual service margin is spread across the remaining 
duration of the coverage period in the context of subsequent 
measurement on the basis of coverage units."
"In contrast, in the case of retroactive retrocession contracts re-
lating to insured events that occurred prior to acquisition of the 
retrocession, the net costs from acquisition of the retrocession 
are expensed in profit or loss."
"Expected net profits, on the other 
hand, are spread across the run-off period of the underlying 
contracts in a contractual service margin by selecting appropri-
ate coverage units."
"Loss-recovery component: Hannover Re establishes a loss-re-
covery component if a loss is reported für ceded gross business 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
119 
on account of onerous contracts."
"The loss component to be ex-
pensed for the gross business is thereby opposed with a loss-
recovery component recognised in income proportionate to the 
expected relief."
"In this way, allowance is also made in the bal-
ance sheet for an effective retrocession and as a result only a 
non-reinsured loss from the gross business remains in profit and 
loss in the respective period."
"Reversals of the loss-recovery com-
ponent cause the contractual service margin to be adjusted, pro-
vided these reversals do not involve changes in the fulfilment 
values of the group of ceded reinsurance contracts."
"In the con-
text of subsequent measurement, the loss-recovery component 
is adjusted for changes in the loss component of the underlying 
reinsurance contracts."
"All in all, the loss-recovery component is 
of minor importance in Hannover Re's book of business."
"Derecognition and contract modification: Contracts are dere-
cognised when they are extinguished or their terms and condi-
tion are changed in such a way as to fundamentally impact the 
economic characteristics of the contractual properties."
"If this is 
not the case, the contract modification results in a change in the 
estimated fulfilment values."
"Investment components: The investment component of an in-
surance contract is defined as the amount that an entity must 
repay to the policyholder even if the insured event does not oc-
cur."
"Investment components are not included in the reinsurance 
revenue or in the insurance service expenses, but rather are 
recognised in accordance with IFRS 9."
"Investment components 
include, for example, the inflows and outflows of savings ele-
ments in life primary insurance and certain commissions paid to 
cedants."
"Provisions for pensions are established in accordance with 
IAS 19 “Employee Benefits” using the projected unit credit 
method."
"They are calculated according to actuarial principles 
and are based upon the commitments made by the Hannover Re 
Group for retirement, disability and widows’ benefits."
"The 
amount of the commitments is determined according to length 
of service and salary level."
"The pension plans are defined bene-
fit plans."
"The basis of the valuation is the estimated future in-
crease in the rate of compensation of the pension beneficiaries."
"The benefit entitlements are discounted by applying the capital 
market rate for highest-rated securities."
"All changes in valua-
tion, especially actuarial gains and losses, are captured imme-
diately in cumulative other comprehensive income."
"Service cost 
and interest cost are recognised in the statement of income."
"Re-
turns on plan assets are determined using the same interest rate 
as that used in the calculation of the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation."
"Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed when 
the beneficiary of the commitment has performed the work that 
entitles them to such contributions."
"Under the balance sheet item Other liabilities, we recognise not 
only the sundry non-technical provisions but also minority inter-
ests in partnerships."
"Direct minority interests in partnerships, 
i."
"liabilities to holders of minority shares in partnerships aris-
ing out of a long-term capital commitment which are puttable 
by the holder of the interest, are recognised as debt pursuant to 
IAS 32 and measured at amortised cost."
"Sundry non-technical provisions are established according to 
a realistic estimate of the amount required and shown under the 
balance sheet item “Other liabilities”."
"Allocation to such provi-
sions is conditional upon the Group currently having a legal or 
actual obligation that results from a past event and in respect of 
which utilisation is probable and the amount can be reliably es-
timated."
"Restructuring provisions are recognised if a detailed formal 
plan for restructuring measures exists and steps to implement it 
have already begun or if key details of the restructuring have 
been published."
"The provisions cover only expenditures arising 
directly as a consequence of restructuring that are not con-
nected with the company’s regular activities."
"Partial retirement obligations are carried at present value ac-
cording to actuarial principles."
"During the phase when the em-
ployee is still working a provision is set aside to cover the liabil-
ity amounting to the working hours not yet compensated."
"Top-
up payments are accumulated in instalments until the end of the 
work phase."
"In periods when the employee is remunerated ac-
cording to the partial retirement arrangements without perform-
ing any work, the provision is released."
"Share-based payments: The share-based payment models ex-
isting within the Hannover Re Group are remuneration plans 
with cash settlement."
"In accordance with the requirements of 
IFRS 2 “Share-based Payments”, the services rendered by the 
eligible beneficiaries and the resulting liability are to be recog-
nised at the fair value of the liability and expensed over the vest-
ing period."
"Until settlement of the liability the fair value of the 
liability is remeasured at each closing date and at the settlement 
date."
"All changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss for 
the period."
"Financing liabilities consist of liabilities from lease contracts 
and above all long-term debt and notes payable."
"In some in-
stances these involve subordinated liabilities that can only be 
satisfied after the claims of other creditors in the event of liqui-
dation or bankruptcy."
"Both long-term debt and notes payable 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method."
"The transaction costs as well as premiums / discounts 
 
120  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
arising in connection with the issuance of bonds are amortised 
and recognised together with the nominal interest as financing 
costs."
"Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present 
value of essentially all lease payments that are not variable or 
dependent on an index or (interest) rate."
"The discount factor 
used is the implicit interest rate of the lease contract or the 
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate."
"Financial liabilities including long-term debt and notes 
payable, insofar as they do not involve liabilities from derivatives 
and the financial obligations from investment contracts mea-
sured at fair value through profit or loss, are carried at amortised 
cost."
"The amortised cost is determined from the historic cost 
after allowance for amounts repayable, the amortisation of pre-
miums and discounts recognised in profit and loss in accor-
dance with the effective interest rate method and any impair-
ment losses and reversal of impairment losses."
"Hannover Re 
measures liabilities from derivatives at fair value."
"Interest accre-
tion on these financial liabilities is shown under the financing 
costs."
"Shareholders' equity: the items “common shares” and “addi-
tional paid-in capital” are comprised of the amounts paid in by 
the shareholders of Hannover Rück SE on its shares."
"In addition 
to the statutory reserves of Hannover Rück SE and the alloca-
tions from net income, the retained earnings consist of rein-
vested profits generated by the Hannover Re Group companies 
in previous periods."
"What is more, in the event of a retrospective 
change of accounting policies, the adjustment for previous pe-
riods is recognised in the opening balance sheet value of the 
retained earnings and comparable items of the earliest reported 
period."
"Unrealised gains and losses from the fair value measure-
ment of financial instruments measured at fair value through 
OCI are carried in cumulative other comprehensive income un-
der unrealised gains and losses on investments."
"Translation dif-
ferences resulting from the currency translation of separate fi-
nancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are similarly recog-
nised in OCI under cumulative foreign currency translation ad-
justments."
"Non-controlling interests are shares in the equity of affiliated 
companies not held by companies belonging to the Group."
"IAS 1 
“Presentation of Financial Statements” requires that non-con-
trolling interests be recognised separately within Group share-
holders’ equity."
"The non-controlling interest in profit or loss is 
shown separately following the net income."
"Further information 
is provided in section 6.9 “Non-controlling interests“."
"Disclosures about financial instruments: IFRS 7 “Financial In-
struments: Disclosures” requires more extensive disclosures ac-
cording to classes of financial instruments."
"In this context, the 
term “class” refers to the classification of financial instruments 
according to their risk characteristics."
"A minimum distinction is 
required here between measurement at amortised cost or at fair 
value."
"A more extensive or divergent distinction should, how-
ever, be geared to the purpose of the corresponding disclosures 
in the notes."
"Rather, 
guided by the underlying business model of reinsurance, the 
disclosures are made on the basis of the facts and circumstances 
existing in the financial year and in light of the principle of ma-
teriality."
"Currency translation: financial statements of Group sub-
sidiaries were drawn up in the currencies corresponding to the 
economic environment in which each subsidiary primarily oper-
ates."
These currencies are referred to as functional currencies.
"The euro is the reporting currency in which the consolidated 
financial statement is prepared."
"Transactions in foreign currencies reported in Group compa-
nies’ individual financial statements are converted into the func-
tional currency at the transaction rate."
"In accordance with 
IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” the 
recognition of exchange differences on translation is guided by 
the nature of the underlying balance sheet item."
"Exchange dif-
ferences from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities 
are recognised directly in the statement of income."
"Currency 
translation differences from the translation of non-monetary as-
sets measured at fair value through the statement of income are 
recognised as profit or loss from fair value changes."
"Exchange 
differences from non-monetary items – such as equity securities 
– recognised at fair value through OCI are initially recognised 
outside income in a separate item of shareholders’ equity and 
only realised in profit or loss when such non-monetary items are 
settled."
"The method of currency translation is also relevant for groups 
of reinsurance contracts (GIC) formed pursuant to IFRS 17 for 
recognition and measurement purposes that contain contracts 
in different currencies."
"The conversion 
of foreign currency items in the balance sheets of the individual 
companies and the transfer of these items to the consolidated 
financial statement are effected at the mean rates of exchange 
on the balance sheet date."
"In accordance with IAS, differences 
from the currency translation of financial statements of foreign 
Group companies must be recognised in the consolidated finan-
cial statement as a separate item in shareholders’ equity."
"Currency translation differences resulting from long-term loans 
or lendings without specified maturity between Group compa-
nies are similarly recognised outside the statement of income in 
a separate component of shareholders’ equity."
"In this context, the reinsurance 
revenue of the reporting period represents the sum of the 
changes in the LRC resulting from the rendering of services in 
this period for which the Hannover Re Group expects a consid-
eration."
"• CSM release, measured by the coverage units provided."
"• Other amounts, including experience-based adjustments 
to premium received for services in the current or in past 
periods."
"No insurance revenue is recognised in the amount of the invest-
ment components because this involves those parts of the pre-
mium that are always paid back to the cedant, irrespective of 
whether or not the insured event occurs."
"At Hannover Re, this 
particularly includes certain commissions paid to cedants."
"The 
reduction of the revenue by the amount of the investment com-
ponents has no influence on the reinsurance service result be-
cause the insurance service expenses are also correspondingly 
reduced."
"Reinsurance service result: The reinsurance service expenses 
include, in particular, the incurred claims (excluding repay-
ments of investment components) as well as the management 
and acquisition expenses."
"The acquisition expenses are allo-
cated systematically to the respective periods of the coverage 
duration and recognised in the same amount as reinsurance rev-
enue and as reinsurance service expenses."
"Within the reinsur-
ance service result, the profit components from contracts retro-
ceded are shown as separate items distinct from the gross rein-
surance revenue and gross reinsurance service expenses from 
issued business."
"In the reinsurance finance result, the reinsurance finance in-
come and expenses include the effects from the discounting of 
the present value of net cash flows, the risk adjustment for non-
financial risks and the contractual service margin."
"We recognise 
the effects of changes in interest rates, on the other hand, 
 
122  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
largely outside profit and loss in the OCI within shareholders' 
equity."
"In our consolidated statement of income we present the 
net reinsurance finance result both before and after currency 
effects."
"We first present the reinsurance finance result in accor-
dance with IFRS 17 including currency effects."
"In order to clar-
ify the matching currency coverage of the technical liabilities by 
investments, the currency effects are subsequently eliminated 
from the reinsurance finance result pursuant to IFRS 17 and 
shown separately in the net currency result."
"Revenue from contracts with customers is realised when con-
trol of the promised goods or services is transferred to the cus-
tomer."
"The amount of revenue realised corresponds to the con-
sideration that Hannover Re expects to receive in return for the 
transfer of goods or services to the customer."
"Under its con-
tracts that fall within the scope of application of IFRS 15 Han-
nover Re generally acts as a principal, because it normally con-
trols the services or goods before transferring them to the cus-
tomer."
"Taxes: the taxes are comprised of the actual tax load on corpo-
rate profits of the Group companies, to which the applicable lo-
cal tax rates are applied, as well as changes in deferred tax as-
sets and liabilities."
"Income and expenses arising out of interest 
or penalties payable to the revenue authorities are shown under 
other income / expenses."
"Further information on deferred taxes is provided in 
our remarks on deferred tax assets and liabilities."
"Components of an entity that can be clearly distinguished 
from the rest of the entity for operational and accounting pur-
poses and were classified as sold or for sale are recognised as 
discontinued operations."
"Measurement is at the lower of book 
value and fair value less costs to sell."
"Depreciation or amortisa-
tion is not taken on non-current assets as long as they are clas-
sified as held for sale."
"Impairment losses on fair value less costs 
to sell are recognised in profit or loss; a gain for any subsequent 
increase in fair value less costs to sell leads to the realisation of 
profit up to the amount of the cumulative impairment."
"If the im-
pairment loss to be taken on a disposal group exceeds the book 
value of the corresponding non-current assets, the need to es-
tablish a provision within the meaning of IAS 37 “Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” is reviewed."
"Risks connected with the impacts of climate change are of great 
significance to a reinsurance company's business model."
"The 
estimation of occurrence probabilities and loss amounts for cli-
mate-related storms, floods or droughts is a major integral com-
ponent of our risk management system."
"It exerts a considerable 
influence on our underwriting policy for catastrophe-exposed 
risks and requires appropriate risk capital to be kept available."
"Along with the influence of these physical risks, the measure-
ment of our investment portfolio is also subject to transition 
risks as a consequence of climate change."
"Transition risks refer 
to those risks connected with the effects of climate change that 
result from the shift towards a low-carbon economy."
"This tran-
sition is substantially initiated and supported by political regu-
latory policies."
"Insofar as such regulatory measures negatively 
affect, for example, issuers of shares or corporate bonds in our 
asset portfolio, there are corresponding implications for the 
measurement of these instruments."
"Estimation uncertainties also arose in the reporting period in 
connection with the conflict in Ukraine."
"We conducted probabil-
ity-weighted scenario analyses for all relevant lines of business, 
taking into consideration the market insights available to us at 
the present moment in time and using them to determine our 
reserves on the basis of our own estimates."
"The affected lines at 
the balance sheet date primarily encompass political violence 
and other property covers, political risk, marine and aviation."
"Our expenditure for this loss complex increased minimally in 
the year under review compared to the previous year."
"The range 
of potential loss scenarios nevertheless remains considerable 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
123 
and can result in significantly higher loss payments at a later 
point in time in the event of adverse developments not currently 
anticipated or unfavourable court decisions."
"In particular, legal 
uncertainties continue to surround the status of leased aircraft 
still in Russia."
"Business with Russian cedants has been discon-
tinued in conformity with existing sanctions regulations."
"The conflict in Ukraine and its impacts had implications for 
worldwide commodity and energy prices and hence also for in-
flation rates."
"Inflation is factored into our reserving process at 
least on the basis of average inflation rates in past years."
"Fur-
thermore, premium calculations make allowance for realistic in-
flation assumptions and additional provisions are established in 
the reserving for individual underwriting years, thereby also en-
abling us to offset inflationary trends to some extent."
"In addition, 
a substantial part of the business is protected against adverse 
inflation effects by index clauses."
"Hannover Re's investment 
portfolio contains inflation-linked bonds which protect against 
some of the negative effects of inflation."
"A scenario analysis was 
carried out to ensure that adequate allowance is made for infla-
tion in the technical reserves."
"The various scenarios for a future 
inflation trend were compared with historically observed infla-
tion to estimate a possible impact on the technical reserves."
"Sce-
narios involving more protracted higher inflation are among 
those considered."
"Currently, it is our expectation that inflation 
rates will be above the targets set by central banks."
"Depend-
ing on the assessment of whether they transfer a significant in-
surance risk, contracts are classified either as reinsurance or in-
vestment contracts."
"An appropriate aggregation level must be 
found because it is necessary to differentiate between contract 
portfolios by separating groups of contracts that are onerous 
upon initial recognition from those that do not have a significant 
probability of subsequently becoming onerous."
"In addition, as-
sumptions are made and estimation uncertainties exist regard-
ing the measurement of reinsurance and retrocession contracts."
"In measuring such contracts, the measurement method is to be 
defined that is used for estimating the risk adjustments for non-
financial risks and the quantity of services to be rendered under 
a contract."
"Supplementary or complete estimates of the corresponding 
profit and loss items, assets and liabilities including relevant 
retrocessions are made where ceding company accounts with 
substantial premium income are missing."
"Missing ceding com-
pany accounts with a low premium volume are included in the 
following year."
"In order to measure the ultimate liability in property and casu-
alty reinsurance the expected ultimate loss ratios are calculated 
for all lines."
"Actuarial methods such as the “chain ladder” 
method provide the starting point for these calculations."
"The re-
alistically estimated future settlement amount is recognised in 
the balance sheet."
"The development until completion of the run-
off is projected on the basis of statistical triangles from the orig-
inal notifications of ceding companies."
"The more recent under-
writing years in actuarial projections are of course subject to 
greater uncertainty, although this can be considerably reduced 
with the aid of a variety of additional information on improve-
ments in the rates and conditions of the business written and on 
loss trends."
"The amounts arrived at as the difference between the projected 
ultimate losses and the reported losses are set aside either in 
the IBNR reserve for losses that have been incurred but are not 
yet known or have still to be reported or in the liability for re-
maining coverage."
"In applying statistical methods, separate consideration is given 
to large losses."
"By analysing a broad range of observable infor-
mation it is possible to classify losses as major individual loss 
events."
"Measurement of the obligations existing in this connec-
tion is carried out using a separate process, which is based 
largely on contract-specific estimates."
"We would further refer to our explanatory remarks 
on the technical reserves in section 3.1 “Summary of major 
accounting policies” and section 6.4 “Technical assets and lia-
bilities”."
"In life and health reinsurance, too, the calculation of reserves 
and assets is crucially dependent on actuarial projections of the 
covered business."
"Modelling is based on policy data or so-called 
model points are defined according to the type of business cov-
ered."
"The main distinguishing criteria include, among others, 
the age, sex and (non-)smoker status of the insured, tariff, policy 
period, period of premium payment and amount of insurance."
"The portfolio development is simulated for each policy or each 
model point, in which regard the key input parameters are either 
predefined by the tariff (e."
"allowance for costs, amount of pre-
mium, actuarial interest rate) or need to be estimated (e."
"mor-
tality or disability rates, lapse rates)."
"These assumptions are 
heavily dependent on country-specific parameters, type of rein-
surance and other framework conditions of the reinsurance 
treaty."
"Superimposition gives rise to a projection of the future 
cash flows of the reinsurance treaty, which incorporates inter 
 
124  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
alia assumptions concerning the portfolio composition and the 
commencement of covered policies within the year."
"Such as-
sumptions are defined at the inception of a reinsurance treaty 
and subsequently adjusted to the actual development."
"In this 
context we would refer the reader to our comments on technical 
assets and provisions in section 3.1 ”Summary of major ac-
counting policies”."
"In determining the carrying amounts of certain financial assets 
it is sometimes necessary to make assumptions in order to 
calculate fair values and determine the risk provisioning for 
expected credit losses."
"In this regard we would refer the reader 
to our comments on financial instruments measured at fair value 
through profit or loss and on impairments in section 3.1 
“Summary of major accounting policies” as well as on 
investment property in section 6.1 “Investments”."
"Group com-
panies are consolidated from the point in time when Hannover 
Re gains control over them."
"All of these criteria must be 
met."
"Other circumstances may also give rise to control, for ex-
ample the existence of a principal-agent relationship."
"In this 
case a party outside the Group with decision-making powers 
(agent) acts for Hannover Re, but does not control the company 
since it merely exercises decision-making powers that have 
been delegated by Hannover Re (principal)."
"These principles are 
also applied to structured entities, on which further information 
is provided in section 4.2 “Consolidated companies and com-
plete list of shareholdings”."
"Group companies are consolidated 
until the Hannover Re Group loses control over them."
"If invest-
ments in subsidiaries are retained and a loss of control exists, 
measurement effects recognised for these subsidiaries in the 
other reserves in conformity with IFRS 10 are entirely released 
to profit or loss rather than merely pro rata in the amount of the 
interests disposed of."
"The accounting policies of Group compa-
nies are adjusted, where necessary, in order to ensure consis-
tent application of the Hannover Re Group’s accounting policies."
The capital consolidation is based on the acquisition method.
"Under 
IFRS 3 goodwill is not amortised, but instead impairment is 
taken where necessary on the basis of annual impairment tests."
"Immaterial and negative goodwill are recognised in the state-
ment of income in the year of their occurrence."
"Costs associated 
with acquisition are expensed."
"Under this method, we measure investments in 
associated companies and joint ventures with the proportion of 
the equity attributable to the Group."
"In accordance with the eq-
uity method of accounting required by IAS 28 ”Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures”, the goodwill attributable to as-
sociated companies and joint ventures is recognised together 
the carrying amount of the investments in associated companies 
and joint ventures."
"The share of the year-end result of an asso-
ciated company or joint venture relating to the Group is included 
in the investment income and recognised separately in the con-
solidated statement of income."
"The equity and result are taken 
from the last available financial statement of the associated com-
pany or joint venture."
"A significant influence is presumed to exist if a company belong-
ing to the Hannover Re Group directly or indirectly holds at least 
20% – but no more than 50% – of the voting rights."
"We also 
derive evidence of significant influence over an associated com-
pany from representation on a governing body of such entity, 
participation in its policy-making processes – e."
"with respect 
to dividends or other distributions –, the existence of material 
inter-company transactions, the possibility of interchanging 
managerial personnel or the provision of key technical informa-
tion for the entity."
"Further particulars on companies consoli-
dated using the equity method of accounting are provided in the 
subsection “Associated companies and joint ventures” in sec-
tion 6.1 “Investments”."
"Only subsidiaries which are of minor importance – both individ-
ually and as a whole – for the net assets, financial position and 
results of operations of the Hannover Re Group are exempted 
from consolidation."
"Hannover Re assesses whether a subsidiary 
 
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
125 
is of minor importance on the basis of the company’s total assets 
and net income relative to the corresponding values for the 
Group as a whole on average over the last three years."
"For this 
reason, 14 (13) companies at home and abroad were not consol-
idated in the year under review."
"A further 3 (3) individual com-
panies were not included at equity in the consolidated financial 
statement for the same reason."
"The business object of these al-
together 17 (16) companies is for the most part the rendering of 
services for reinsurance companies within the Group."
"Consolidation of business transactions within the Group
Receivables and liabilities between the companies included in 
the consolidated financial statement were offset against each 
other."
"Profits and expenses from business transactions within 
the Group were also eliminated."
"Transactions between a dis-
posal group and the continuing operations of the Group were 
similarly eliminated in accordance with IFRS 10."
"Information on the non-controlling interests in shareholders’ 
equity and profit or loss as well as on the major non-controlling 
interests is provided in section 6.9 “Non-controlling interests”."
"On the balance sheet date there were no significant restrictions 
on access to or the use of Group assets due to protective rights 
in favour of non-controlling interests."
"The sale or transfer of shares of E+S Rückversicherung AG takes 
place by way of an endorsement and is permissible only with the 
approval of the company’s Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board enjoys the right to grant or deny ap-
proval unconditionally, without being obliged to state reasons in 
the event of denial."
"National provisions of company law or requirements of supervi-
sory law may in certain countries limit the ability of the Han-
nover Re Group to transfer assets between companies belonging 
to the Group."
"These limitations result principally from local min-
imum capital and solvency requirements as well as to a lesser 
extent from foreign exchange restrictions."

"Consolidation of structured entities
Business relations with structured entities are to be examined 
in accordance with IFRS 10 with an eye to their implications for 
consolidation."
"In the context of their operational activities some 
companies belonging to the Hannover Re Group enter into busi-
ness relations with structured entities that are to be analysed 
and accounted for according to these new provisions."
"With regard to 
the criteria for control please see also section 4.1 “Consolidation 
principles”."
"Consolidation decisions are reviewed as 
necessary and at least once a year."
"The list of all consolidated 
structured entities forms part of the list of shareholdings."
"132  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
Consolidated structured entities 
The following structured entities were consolidated as at the 
balance sheet date: 
 
• Kaith Re Ltd., Hamilton, Bermuda 
• Kubera Insurance (SAC) Ltd, Hamilton, Bermuda 
• LI RE, Hamilton, Bermuda 
 
Kaith Re Ltd."
"is a so-called segregated accounts company (SAC), 
the sole object of which is the securitisation of reinsurance risks 
in the form of investment products."
"Under this transformation a 
complete underwriting risk transfer always takes place to the 
investor in question."
"In a SAC further segregated accounts exist 
under a general account; it is in these segregated accounts, 
which for liability purposes are entirely separate from one an-
other and from the general account, that the aforementioned se-
curitisations take place for the investors."
"Kubera Insurance (SAC) Ltd is similarly a segregated accounts 
company, the object of which is to establish segregated ac-
counts that are made available to non-Group companies for 
structured finance transactions."
"Pursuant to IFRS 10 we consider the general account and the 
segregated accounts to be separate units to which the principles 
of so-called “silo accounting” are applied."
"In accordance with 
this concept, Hannover Re is required to consolidate the general 
account of Kaith Re Ltd."
"and Kubera Insurance (SAC) Ltd and is 
contractually responsible for the fees due to external service 
providers that are to be covered from the general account’s own 
funds."
"Each individual segregated account is to be examined 
separately with an eye to a consolidation requirement and con-
solidated according to the particular contractual arrangements 
in each case."
"LI RE is a segregated account of Kaith Re Ltd., the purpose of 
which – as with all segregated accounts under Kaith Re Ltd."
"– is 
the securitisation of underwriting risks."
"In contrast to the other 
segregated accounts, the sole investor and hence the risk carrier 
of LI RE is the Hannover Re Group through its subsidiary Leine 
Investment SICAV-SIF, Luxembourg."
"As at the balance sheet date Hannover Re had not rendered any 
financial or other support for a consolidated structured entity."
"Investing activities and investments in catastrophe bonds (ILS)
Within the scope of its investment activities Hannover Re par-
ticipates inter alia in numerous structured entities."
"These are 
predominantly special purpose entities in the form of funds, 
which for their part transact certain types of equity and debt 
capital investments."
"These investments encompass private eq-
uity funds, fixed income funds, collateralised debt obligations, 
real estate funds, index funds and other public funds."
"The vol-
ume of these transactions is derived from the book values of the 
respective investments and amounted to EUR 3,124.2 million 
(EUR 2,729.6 million) as at the balance sheet date."
"The maxi-
mum risk of loss corresponds to the book values."
"Hannover Re participates through its subsidiary Leine Invest-
ment SICAV-SIF, Luxembourg, in a number of structured enti-
ties that issue catastrophe bonds for the securitisation of catas-
trophe risks by investing in such bonds."
"Leine Investment Gen-
eral Partner S.à.r.l."
"is the managing partner of the asset man-
agement company Leine Investment SICAV-SIF, the business 
object of which is to build, hold and manage a portfolio of insur-
ance-linked securities (catastrophe bonds) – including for third-
party investors outside the Group."
"The volume of these transac-
tions is derived from the book values of the respective invest-
ments and amounted to EUR 157.4 million (EUR 125.5 million) 
as at the balance sheet date."
"The maximum risk of loss corre-
sponds to the book values."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
133 
Retrocession and securitisation of reinsurance risks  
The securitisation of reinsurance risks takes place largely 
through the use of structured entities."
"By way of its “K” transactions Hannover Re has raised under-
writing capacity for catastrophe risks on the capital market."
"The 
“K Cession”, which was placed with investors in North and 
South America, Europe and Asia, involves a quota share cession 
on worldwide natural catastrophe business as well as aviation 
and marine risks."
"Of the total volume of the “K Cession”, a large 
part equivalent to EUR 646.8 million (EUR 370.0 million) was 
securitised via structured entities as at the balance sheet date."
"The transaction has an indefinite term and can be cancelled an-
nually by the investors."
Segregated accounts of Kaith Re Ltd.
"are 
used for transformer purposes for part of this transaction."
"Han-
nover Re also uses further segregated accounts of Kaith Re Ltd."
"and other structured entities outside the Group for various retro-
cessions of both its traditional and ILS covers, which in each 
case are passed on to institutional investors in securitised form."
"The volume of these transactions is measured by the ceded ex-
posure limit of the underlying retrocession agreements and 
amounted 
to 
altogether 
EUR 6,789.5 million 
EUR (5,988.9 million) as at the balance sheet date."
"The struc-
tured entities are in all cases fully funded by contractually de-
fined investments in the form of cash and equivalent liquid as-
sets."
"Given that the entire exposure limit of the structured enti-
ties is therefore wholly collateralised in each case, there is no 
risk of loss for Hannover Re."
"The purpose of such 
transactions is to directly transfer clients’ business."
"The volume 
of the transactions is derived from the ceded exposure limit of 
the underlying retrocession agreements and amounted to 
EUR 6,278.0 million (EUR 6,182.7 million) as at the balance 
sheet date."
"Part of the ceded exposure limit is funded and 
collateralised by contractually defined investments in the form  
of cash and equivalent liquid assets; a further part remains 
uncollateralised or is collateralised by less liquid assets."
"The 
maximum risk of loss from the uncollateralised exposure limit 
amounted to EUR 1,851.2 million (EUR 1,864.8 million) as at 
the balance sheet date."
"This does not, however, correspond to 
the economic risk of loss, which is established using recognised 
actuarial methods."
"The expected loss on a modelled basis in a 
worst-case scenario of 10,000 years amounts to at most 
EUR 42.8 million (EUR 43.7 million)."
"As at the balance sheet date Hannover Re had not rendered any 
financial or other support for an unconsolidated structured en-
tity."
"Hannover Re does not intend to render financial or other 
support for one or more of such entities without being contrac-
tually required to do so."
"Kubera Insurance (SAC) Ltd established a segregated account 
that gathered investor capital by means of issued bonds and was 
made available to an Australian intermediary of insurance busi-
ness under a swap agreement for the financing of the latter’s 
business."
"Repayment of the bonds is contingent on the develop-
ment of the intermediary’s business."
"Hannover Re is an investor 
in this bond through one of its subsidiaries along with other ex-
ternal parties."
"The segregated account can be used flexibly for 
additional rounds of financing."
"Hannover Re is not the owner of 
the segregated account."
"With regard to commitments and obligations that we do not 
consider to be support, particularly outstanding capital 
commitments from special investments, please see our remarks 
in section 9.7 “Contingent liabilities and commitments”."
"Major acquisitions and new formations 
No major acquisitions occurred in the 2023 financial year."
"Major disposals and retirements 
No major disposals occurred in the 2023 financial year."

"With regard to the object of 
business operations within the two segments please see our ex-
planatory remarks on Hannover Re’s business model in the man-
agement report."
"The report on economic position contains re-
marks on the economic environment in which the Group oper-
ates."
"The “Consolidation” column includes not only the elimination of 
cross-segment transactions but also, more significantly, compa-
nies whose business operations cannot be unambiguously allo-
cated to property and casualty reinsurance or life and health 
reinsurance."
"These are principally the service and financing 
companies belonging to the Group."
"During the financial year no material changes occurred in the 
organisational structure that could have influenced the compo-
sition of the segments."
"Since the performance indicators used 
to steer the segments correspond to the system according to 
which the consolidated financial statement is prepared, a sepa-
rate reconciliation of the segment results with the Group result 
is not provided."
"There is no cross-segment gross reinsurance revenue between 
the segments of property & casualty reinsurance and life & 
health reinsurance."
"To this extent, the reinsurance revenue 
shown involves exclusively amounts from business with external 
third parties."

"Notes on the individual items of the balance sheet

"Investments
Investments are classified and measured in accordance with 
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”."
"Hannover Re classifies 
investments according to the categories at fair value through 
OCI and at fair value through profit or loss, while measurement 
at amortised cost is applied only in exceptional cases."
"The 
allocation and measurement of investments is guided by the 
respective investment intent (business model) and the type of 
cash flows."
"The investments also include investment property, investments 
in associated companies and joint ventures as well as other in-
vested assets."
"Real estate and investments held by disposal 
groups for which an intention to sell exists in accordance with 
IFRS 5 are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
if appropriate facts and circumstances apply."
"The following table shows the regional origin of the 
investments."
"Variable-rate bonds (so-called “floaters”) are shown under the 
maturities due in one year and constitute an interest-related, 
within-the-year reinvestment risk."

"Hannover Re recognised in this category as at the balance sheet 
date primarily debt instruments and investment funds that do 
not meet the SPPI (“solely paymernt of principal and interest”) 
test due to the characteristics of their cash flows."
"Analysis of the fair value changes in the portfolio of fixed-
income securities at fair value through profit or loss indicated 
that, just as in the previous year, no fair value changes were 
attributable to a changed credit risk."
"We additionally use an 
internal rating method to back up this analysis."
"Our internal 
rating system is based on the corresponding credit ratings of 
securities assigned by the agencies Standard & Poor’s and 
Moody’s and in each case reflects the lowest of the available 
ratings."

Associated companies and joint ventures 
 
Investments in material joint ventures 
On 22 December 2022 Hannover Rück SE (roughly 41.3%) and 
E+S Rückversicherung AG (roughly 8.7%) together purchased 
50% of the shares in MR Beteiligungen 23."
"GmbH, a wholly ow-
ned subsidiary of Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft

"The joint venture was subsequently re-
named Joint HR MR Private Equity GmbH."
"Through the share 
purchase Hannover Rück SE and E+S Rückversicherung AG to-
gether with Münchener Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG ac-
quired joint control of the entity as defined by IFRS 11.16."
"The 
capital shares correspond to the distribution of voting rights."
"The purpose of the joint venture is, in particular, to acquire, hold 
and manage participations in private equity firms."
"After the contribution of shares in subsidiaries to the joint ven-
ture as at 31 December 2022, the equity book value as at the 
balance sheet date was around EUR 1.9 billion."
"Consolidated 
business figures for the 2023 financial year are shown below, 
giving rise to an unchanged equity book value of EUR 1.9 bil-
lion."

"KG, Hannover, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Hannover Rück SE, holds 20% of the common shares in Mon-
ument Insurance Group Limited, Hamilton, Bermuda (MIGL)."
"The participation is identical to the share of voting rights held 
and – with a seat on the Board of Directors – establishes a sig-
nificant influence over MIGL."
"In addition, a subsidiary of MIGL 
has issued non-voting, non-callable preference shares in which 
FUNIS – after the issuance of further preference shares to an 
investor – held an interest of 15.2% (previous year: 24.4%) di-
rectly and indirectly through MIGL as at the end of the financial 
year."
"The interest amounts to 13.7% after elimination of the in-
ternally held preference shares."
"MIGL is a life insurance group that specialises in acquiring and 
operating life insurance portfolios and companies in Europe, 
primarily those in run-off."
"Measurement at equity is based on 
the consolidated financial statement drawn up by the company 
as at 30 September in accordance with UK GAAP, which is rec-
onciled to IFRS and restated if significant transactions or other 
events occur."
"No discontinued operations existed in the year under review 
among the companies measured at equity."
"Insofar as there are 
commitments from contingent liabilities of associated compa-
nies and joint ventures, the Hannover Re Group shares in such 
commitments in proportion to its respective shareholding."
"Pub-
lic price listings are not available for companies valued at equity."
"The net book value of associated companies and joint ventures 
includes 
goodwill 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
EUR 11.8 million 
(EUR 12.2 million)."
"For further details please see section 4 
“Consolidation”."
"Real estate
Real estate is divided into real estate for own use and investment 
property."
Own-use real estate is recognised under other assets.
"The investment property in the portfolio which is used to gener-
ate income is shown under the investments."
"Income and ex-
penses from rental agreements are included in the investment 
income."
"Real estate is valued at cost of acquisition less depreciation with 
useful lives of at most 50 years as well as impairments in the 
event of permanent impairment."
"The fair value of investment property excluding capitalised 
right-of-use 
assets 
amounted 
to 
EUR 2,995.0 million 
(EUR 2,833.3 million) as at the balance sheet date."
"In terms of diversification across various real estate sectors, the 
focus is on office buildings (61%), complemented by logistics 
properties (21%) and retail (14%)."
"In geographical terms, ex-
posures are spread across the United States (38%), Europe (ex-
cluding Germany; 20%) as well as Germany (21%) and Asia 
(21%)."
"Changes in this item are attributable to investment activities at 
the relevant real estate companies belonging to the Hannover 
Re Group."
"The real estate in the investment portfolio is normally subject to 
internal and external valuation by an appraiser as at the balance 
sheet date."
"The two analyses do not differ from one another in 
the methodology used, which means that the findings are com-
parable at all times and on a continuous basis."
"Generally speak-
ing, the fair value of the real estate is determined using the dis-
counted cash flow (DCF) method, with rental income capitalised 
in consideration of the associated management costs."
"The valu-
ation result is also influenced by increases and reductions based 
on specific property circumstances (upkeep, vacancies, rent di-
vergences from the market level, etc.)."
"The evaluation of inter-
national real estate also draws primarily on the discounted cash 
flow method."
"The main feature of this method is the present 
value estimation of projected annual free cash flows."
"Real estate which is held for sale as defined by IFRS 5 is recog-
nised separately in the consolidated balance sheet if appropriate 
facts and circumstances apply."
"Intentions to sell are substanti-
ated by individual real estate market conditions and specific 
property circumstances, taking into consideration current and 
future opportunity / risk profiles."
"In the year under review no 
properties were reclassified to assets held for sale."
"In addition, we held indirect real estate / infrastructure invest-
ments measured at fair values in an amount of EUR 1,043.8 mil-
lion (EUR 945.5 million) in the year under review, which are 
recognised in the item “Financial investments – at fair value 
through profit or loss”."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
153 
Other invested assets 
The other invested assets consisted largely of participating in-
terests measured at fair value in an amount of EUR  963.0 mil-
lion (EUR 813.5 million), the amortised cost of which amounted 
to EUR 613.9 million (EUR 538.1 million)."
"The differences be-
tween the carrying amounts and the amortised costs were 
recognised 
as 
unrealised 
gains 
of 
EUR 368.9 million 
(EUR 286.5 million) and unrealised losses of EUR 19.8 million 
(EUR 11.1 million) under cumulative other comprehensive in-
come."
"Short-term investments 
This item comprises investments with a maturity of up to one 
year at the time of investment."
"This includes overnight and time 
deposits as well as shares in investment funds that invest in such 
securities."
"Fair value hierarchy
For the purposes of the disclosure requirements pursuant to 
IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement”, financial assets and liabili-
ties are to be assigned to a three-level fair value hierarchy."
"The fair value hierarchy, which reflects characteristics of the 
price data and inputs used for measurement purposes, is struc-
tured as follows: 
 
• Level 1: Assets or liabilities measured at (unadjusted) 
prices quoted directly in active and liquid markets."
"• Level 2: Assets or liabilities which are measured using 
observable market data and are not allocable to level 1."
"Measurement is based, in particular, on prices for com-
parable assets and liabilities that are traded on active 
markets, prices on markets that are not considered active 
as well as inputs derived from such prices or market 
data."
"• Level 3: Assets or liabilities that cannot be measured or 
can only be partially measured using observable market 
inputs."
"The measurement of such instruments draws 
principally on valuation models and methods."
"If input factors from different levels are used to measure a finan-
cial instrument, the level of the lowest input factor material to 
measurement is determinative."
"The operational units responsible for coordinating and docu-
menting measurement are organisationally separate from the 
operational units that enter into investment risks."
"All relevant 
valuation processes and valuation methods are documented."
"Decisions on fundamental valuation issues are taken by a valua-
tion committee that meets monthly."
"In the financial year just ended, as in the previous year, no in-
vestments were allocable to another level of the fair value hier-
archy."
"154  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
The following table shows the breakdown of financial assets and 
liabilities recognised at fair value into the three-level fair value 
hierarchy."
"Of the finan-
cial assets included in level 3 with fair values of altogether 
EUR 3,610.4 million (EUR 3,225.7 million) as at the balance 
sheet date, Hannover Re measures financial assets with a vol-
ume of EUR 1,744.4 million (EUR 1,530.3 million) using the net 
asset value method."
"These items consist principally of shares in 
private equity and real estate funds."
"Assuming that the present 
values of the assets and liabilities contained in the funds would 
be 10% lower than used for measurement as at the balance 
sheet date, the fair values for these items would amount to 
EUR 1,570.0 million."
"The remaining financial assets included in 
level

of 
EUR 1,866.0 million 
(EUR 1,695.4 million) relate to financial instruments, the valua-
tion of which is based inter alia on technical parameters."
"Deriv-
ative financial instruments in connection with the reinsurance 
business were recognised under the financial liabilities included 
in level 3 in the year under review."
"Their performance is depen-
dent upon lapse rates within an underlying primary insurance 
portfolio."
"The application of alternative inputs and assumptions 
has no material effect on the consolidated financial statement."
"Goodwill
In accordance with IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” amortisa-
tion is not taken on goodwill."
"Goodwill was subject to an impair-
ment test."
"For the purposes of the impairment test, the goodwill was allo-
cated to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that represent the 
lowest level on which goodwill is monitored for internal man-
agement purposes."
"In the instances of goodwill recognised as at 
the balance sheet date, the CGUs are the respective legal enti-
ties."
"The recoverable amount is established on the basis of the 
value in use, which is calculated using the discounted cash flow 
method."
"In this context, the detailed planning phase draws on 
the planning calculations of the CGUs / companies covering the 
next five years."
"These planning calculations represent the out-
come of a detailed planning process in which all responsible 
members of management are involved and where allowance is 
made for the latest market developments affecting the relevant 
entity (in relation to the sector and the economy as a whole)."
"The subsequent perpetuity phase is guided by the profit margins 
and revenue growth rates that management believes can be sus-
tainably generated."
"The capitalisation rate is based on the Cap-
ital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as well as growth rates that are 
considered realistic in light of the specific market environment."
"The risk-free basic interest rate is determined, where possible, 
using corresponding yield curve data from the respective na-
tional banks."
"If this data cannot be obtained or can only be ob-
tained with a disproportionately high effort, reference is made 
to the yields of the respective 30-year government bonds."
"Both 
the yield curves and the government bonds reflect the current 
interest rate trend on financial markets."
"The selection of the 
market risk premium is guided by the ranges currently recom-
mended by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW)."
"The beta factor is calculated for Hannover Rück SE on the basis 
of publicly accessible capital market data."
"The foreign exchange 
rates used for currency translation correspond to the situation 
on the balance sheet date."
"In this context, 
individual parameters were changed within appropriate bands 
that can be expected in light of the current market situations 
and developments."
"It was established that where changes were 
made to parameters in areas that could reasonably occur, the 
values in use were above the corresponding book values."
"We 
would also refer to our basic remarks in section 3.1 “Summary 
of major accounting policies”."
"The sundry assets consist primarily of accounts receivable of 
EUR 963.2 million (EUR 579.2 million) that were not allocated 
to underwriting items."
"Insurance for pension commitments  
In the past Hannover Rück SE took out insurance covers for pen-
sion commitments."
"The commitments involve, firstly, deferred 
annuities with regular premium payment under a group insur-
ance policy and, secondly, the funding of direct commitments 
from deferred compensation for lump-sum payments in the 
event of death or on reaching retirement age."
"The insurance 
covers were carried as a separate asset at fair value in an amount 
of EUR 107.5 million (EUR 103.2 million)."
"With regard to the leased assets contained in this table we would 
refer to section 9.8 “Leases”."
"Of the addi-
tions, an amount of EUR 13.5 million (EUR 4.8 million) is attrib-
utable to purchased software."
"Among other things, the amor-
tised cost of the intangible assets identified in connection with 
the acquisition of Argenta Holdings Limited in an amount of 
EUR 75.7 million (EUR 75.5 million) is also recognised under 
other intangible assets."
"Credit risks may result from other financial assets that were not 
overdue or adjusted as at the balance sheet date."
"In this regard, 
the reader is referred in general to our comments on the credit 
risk within the risk report."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
161 
6.4."
"Technical assets and liabilities
The reinsurance recoverables on the liability for incurred claims 
and the liability for remaining coverage are based on the con-
tractual arrangements of the underlying reinsurance treaties."
"We would additionally refer to the explanatory remarks in the 
risk report regarding the type and scope of risks arising out of 
insurance contracts."
"In order to show the net technical liabilities remaining in the 
retention, the following table presents a summary comparison 
of the gross liabilities with the corresponding reinsurance re-
coverables, which are shown as assets in the balance sheet."
"Addi-
tional IBNR reserves are established for losses that have already 
been incurred but not yet reported."
"The movement in the liabil-
ity for remaining coverage is shown in the following tables."
"The 
presentation differentiates in each case between reinsurance 
contracts issued and held."
"Separate disclosure of the measurement components would be 
required for such portfolios on initial recognition."
"Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023

Maturities of the technical cash flows  
IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts” requires information which 
helps to clarify the amount and timing of cash flows expected 
from reinsurance contracts."
"In the following tables we have 
shown these cash flows broken down by the expected remaining 
times to maturity."
"As part of the maturity analysis, we have dif-
ferentiated between the cash flows of reinsurance contracts is-
sued and those of reinsurance contracts held."
"For further expla-
nation of the recognition and measurement of the liabilities, 
please see section 3.1 “Summary of major accounting policies”."
"The li-
ability for remaining coverage had an average maturity of 19.4 
years (20.5 years) – or 19.6 years (20.7 years) on a net basis."
"The average maturity of the liabilities is determined using actu-
arial projections of the expected future payments."
"A payment 
pattern is calculated for each homogenous category of our port-
folio – making allowance for the business sector, geographical 
considerations, contract type and type of reinsurance – and ap-
plied to the outstanding liabilities for each underwriting year 
and run-off status."

please see section 3.1 “Summary of major accounting policies”."
"Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations
Pension commitments are given in accordance with the relevant 
version of the pension plan as amended."
"The 1968 pension plan 
provides for retirement, disability, widows’ and orphans’ bene-
fits."
"The pension entitlement is dependent on length of service; 
entitlements under the statutory pension insurance scheme are 
taken into account."
"The pension plan was closed to new partici-
pants with effect from 31 January 1981."
"On 1 April 1993 (1 June 1993 in the case of senior executives) 
the 1993 pension plan came into effect."
"This pension plan pro-
vides for retirement, disability and surviving dependants’ bene-
fits."
"The scheme is based upon annual determination of the pen-
sion contributions, which are calculated according to the pen-
sionable employment income and the company’s performance."
"The pension plan was closed to new participants with effect 
from 31 March 1999."
"Insurance coverage has been taken out for both the aforemen-
tioned pension plans."
"From 1997 onwards it has been possible to obtain pension com-
mitments through deferred compensation."
"The employee-
funded commitments included in the provisions for accrued 
pension rights are protected by an insurance contract with HDI 
Lebensversicherung AG, Cologne."
"As at 1 July 2000 the 2000 pension plan came into force for the 
entire Group."
"Under this plan, new employees included in the 
group of beneficiaries are granted an indirect commitment from 
HDI Unterstützungskasse e."
"This pension plan provides for 
retirement, disability and surviving dependants’ benefits."
"The 
provident fund takes out insurance coverage with HDI 
Lebensversicherung AG that maps the entire spectrum of bene-
fits (matching coverage)."
"These pension commitments are con-
sidered to be contribution-based pension benefits under Ger-
man employment law, and for economic purposes the pension 
scheme is classified as a defined benefit plan."
"The relevant as-
sets of the provident fund are recognised as plan assets."
"Employees also have the option to accumulate additional, insur-
ance-type retirement provision by way of deferred compensa-
tion."
Pension provisions are not recognised in this regard.
"In addition to these pension plans, senior executives and mem-
bers of the Executive Board, in particular, enjoy individual com-
mitments as well as commitments given under the benefits plan 
of the Bochumer Verband."
"The commitments to employees in Germany predominantly 
comprise benefit obligations financed by the Group companies."
"The provisions for pensions in Germany and abroad were calcu-
lated on the basis of uniform standards according to prevailing 
economic circumstances."
"Provisions for pensions are established in accordance with ac-
tuarial principles and are based upon the commitments made by 
the Hannover Re Group for retirement, disability and widows’ 
benefits."
"The Heubeck “2018 G standard tables”, enhanced as 
in the previous year according to the observable risk experience 
in the portfolio."
"were used as the biometric actuarial basis for 
pension commitments in Germany."
"The amount of the commit-
ments is determined according to length of service and salary 
level."
"Disablement entails the risk that the assumed number of retire-
ments from the subportfolio of eligible beneficiaries on grounds 
of disability does not correspond to the actual experience and 
for this reason increased benefit obligations have to be met."
"The pension progression entails the risk that the anticipated de-
velopment of the consumer price index factored into the trend 
assumptions was too low and that increased benefit obligations 
arise on account of pension indexation required by law."
"The rate of compensation increase entails the risk that the in-
creases in pensionable salaries factored into the trend assump-
tions on a parallel basis do not adequately reflect the actual de-
velopments."
"Measures to reduce these risks consist of pension insurance 
taken out for virtually all pension commitments (for new addi-
tions defined contribution plans with matching insurance cover-
age) as well as enhanced biometric actuarial bases."
"The assump-
tions for the pension progression and for the expected rate of 
compensation increase and career trend are regularly reviewed 
and if necessary adjusted with an eye to current expectations 
for the inflation trend."
"No unusual risks or risk concentrations 
can be identified."
"The plan assets are attributable in an amount of 
EUR 4.8 million (EUR 17.0 million) to assets with quoted market 
prices."
"In the current financial year Hannover Re anticipates contribu-
tion payments of EUR  5.8 million under the plans set out above."
"The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation 
is 15.1 (15.2) years."
"The underlying mortality tables 
were adjusted by reducing the mortalities by 10% in order to 
determine the longevity risk."
"Extending the lifespans in this way 
would have produced a EUR  7.2 million (EUR 6.6 million) 
higher pension commitment at the end of the financial year."
"Defined contribution plans  
In addition to the defined benefit plans, some Group companies 
have defined contribution plans that are based on length of ser-
vice and the employee’s income or level of contributions."
"The 
expense recognised for these obligations in the financial year in 
accordance 
with 
IAS 19 
“Employee 
Benefits” 
was 
EUR  28.5 million (EUR 25.3 million)."
"Of the expense for de-
fined contribution plans, an amount of EUR 14.3 million 
(EUR 12.4 million) relates to state pension schemes, thereof 
EUR 11.3 million (EUR 10.2 million) to contributions to the 
statutory pension insurance scheme in Germany."
"180

6.6."
"We enter into term repurchase agreements (repos) as a supple-
mentary liquidity management tool."
"The asset portfolios ex-
changed in this context are fully collateralised."
"As at the balance 
sheet date the liabilities from repos recognised in the sundry 
liabilities amounted to EUR 365.8 million (EUR 250.1 million)."
"In addition, cash collateral received in connection with the mar-
ket performance of derivatives was recognised in the sundry li-
abilities in an amount of EUR 83.8 million (EUR 92.1 million)."
"The sundry liabilities further include accounts payable of 
EUR 1,605.3 million (EUR 1,411.7 million) that were not allo-
cated to underwriting items."

to 3-month EURIBOR +325 basis points."
"The EUR 500.0 million subordinated bond issued by Hannover 
Finance (Luxembourg) S."
"in 2012 was called and redeemed 
in the year under review at the first scheduled call date of 30 
June 2023."
"Altogether, six (seven) bonds were recognised as at the balance 
sheet date with an amortised cost of EUR 3,976.8 million 
(EUR 4,472.0 million)."
"If such price information 
was not available, fair value was determined on the basis of the 
recognised effective interest rate method or estimated using 
other financial assets with similar rating, duration and return 
characteristics."
"Under the effective interest rate method, the 
current market interest rate levels in the relevant fixed interest 
periods are always taken as a basis."
"The 
change in shareholders’ equity comprises not only the net in-
come deriving from the statement of income but also the 
changes in the value of asset and liability items not recognised 
in the statement of income."
"The common shares (share capital of Hannover Rück SE) 
amount to EUR 120,597,134.00."
"They are divided into 
120,597,134 voting and dividend-bearing registered ordinary 
shares in the form of no-par-value shares."
"The shares are paid 
in full."
"Each share carries an equal voting right and an equal 
dividend entitlement."
"Conditional capital of up to EUR 24.1 million (EUR 24.1 million)

cesses for managing capital."
"A major strategic objective of Han-
nover Re is sustainable protection of our capital."

"Han-
nover Re uses intrinsic value creation (IVC) as a central tool of 
 
186  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
value-based management."
"As part of this methodology, we are 
guided by the principles of economical allocation of equity and 
efficient use of debt as an equity substitute in order to achieve 
an attractive weighted cost of capital."
"The concept and the ob-
jectives and principles according to which we manage our cap-
ital are described in greater detail in our comments on value-
based management in the management report (subsection 
""Management system"")."
"The further disclosures on capital man-
agement arising out of IAS 1.134 – 136 are provided in the “Fi-
nancial position and net assets” subsection of the management 
report, to which the reader is referred."
"This includes both a pre-
sentation of our capital management policies and processes and 
a summary of the diverse external capital requirements to which 
we are subject (cf."
"subsections ""Analysis of the capital struc-
ture"", ""Group shareholders' equity"" and ""Financing and Group 
debt"")."
"The Solvency II regulatory framework, in particular, 
gives rise to capital requirements and consequences for capital 
management, which we discuss more closely in the risk report."
"Treasury shares  
IAS 1 requires separate disclosure of treasury shares in share-
holders’ equity."
"As part of this year’s employee share option 
plan Hannover Rück SE acquired altogether 18,714 (26,927) 
treasury shares during the second quarter of 2023 on the legal 
basis of § 71 Para."
"2 Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and 
delivered them to eligible employees at preferential conditions."
These shares are blocked until 31 May 2027.
"This transaction 
resulted in an expense of EUR 0.7 million (EUR 1.6 million), 
which was recognised under personnel expenditure, as well as 
a negligible change in retained earnings recognised in equity."
"The company was no longer in possession of treasury shares as 
at the balance sheet date."
"Non-controlling interests 
Non-controlling interests in the shareholders’ equity of sub-
sidiaries are reported separately within Group shareholders’ eq-
uity in accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial State-
ments”."
"They amounted to EUR 892.7 million (EUR 897.2 mil-
lion) as at the balance sheet date."
"Non-controlling interests in partnerships are reported in accor-
dance with IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation” under 
long-term liabilities."
"The non-controlling interest in profit or 
loss, which forms part of net income and is shown separately 
after net income as a “thereof” note, amounted to EUR  2.8 mil-
lion (EUR 117.5 million) in the year under review."
"Notes on the individual items of the statement of income 
7.1."
"Reinsurance revenue
The following tables show the breakdown of the gross reinsur-
ance revenue into geographical origin and categories."
"This can be attributed largely to a few issuers of fixed-
income securities from the Chinese real estate sector still re-
maining in our portfolio."
"We carried fixed-income instruments 
with a total fair value of EUR 122.9 million in Stage 3 of our risk 
provisioning model as at the balance sheet date."
"Impairments 
for investments not covered by the stage model for expected 
credit losses were incurred on directly held real estate invest-
ments in an amount of EUR 79.1 million (EUR 18.2 million)."
"We 
took into consideration increased pressure on market values 
here by recognising in the balance sheet reductions in the value 
of a number of directly held properties, especially in the US of-
fice real estate market."
"The portfolio did not contain any overdue, unadjusted invest-
ments as at the balance sheet date."
"In the case 
of the fixed-income securities at fair value through profit or loss 
designated in this category and the other financial assets, which 
include the technical derivatives, income and expenses from 
changes in fair value are also recognised."
"Making allowance for the other investment expenses of 
EUR 175.9 million (EUR 165.5 million), net income from invest-
ments of altogether EUR 1,588.2 million (EUR 965.4 million) 
was recognised in the year under review."
"Insurance finance income and expenses
In the following table we compare the reinsurance finance result 
with the investment return."
"Both earnings components include 
income and expenses from currency translation and the 
amounts recognised directly in OCI."
"The reinsurance finance re-
sult is comprised primarily of the effects from interest accretion 
and changes in the discounting assumptions and other financial 
measurement assumptions relating to our technical provisions."
"The other expenses include, among other things, 
amortisation expenses that led to a charge to the result before 
tax of EUR 3.0 million (EUR 7.7 million)."
"Of this, an amount of 
EUR 4.5 million was attributable in the previous year to value 
adjustments for the goodwill of a South African subsidiary."
"The other income includes revenues from contracts with 
customers set out below in accordance with IFRS 15."
"With 
regard to the fundamental approach adopted for application of 
IFRS 15 we would refer to the remarks in section 3.1 “Summary 
of major accounting policies”."
"Of this 
amount, EUR 60.3 million (EUR 43.0 million) is attributable to 
brokerage commissions earned by Group-internal insurance 
companies and insurance intermediaries."
"Further revenues of EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.8 million) were 
generated in this revenue category."
"An amount of EUR 82.1 million (EUR 79.8 million) was realised 
over time in the current financial year in connection with other 
insurance-related services."
"This involves revenues from administrative services amounting 
to EUR 29.6 million (EUR 30.3 million) that were generated on 
the Lloyd’s markets in the United Kingdom and in the Asia-Pa-
cific region."
"The transaction prices are essentially calculated ac-
cording to the underlying general fee scales as well as a per-
centage share of the gross premium."
"The revenues from the ad-
ministrative services described here are largely earned over a 
period of three to four years and realised pro rata temporis in 
accordance with the contractual term."
"In addition, other revenues known as “binder fees” were earned 
from administrative activities on the South African market in an 
amount of EUR 14.2 million (EUR 17.4 million)."
"The transaction 
 
192  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
price is calculated from a percentage rate in relation to the gross 
premium of the underlying insurance contracts."
"Binding fees 
are earned over a period of time."
"On the German market revenues of EUR 15.4 million 
(EUR 11.9 million) were generated."
"These relate in large part to 
transfers of use for IT."
"The underlying transaction prices are de-
rived from the contractually agreed contract prices and are re-
alised pro rata temporis as the customer makes use of the IT."
"On the North American market revenues of EUR 7.4 million 
(EUR 3.9 million) were earned from the assumption of adminis-
trative tasks."
"The performance obligation is considered to have 
been fulfilled when the company has rendered the contractually 
agreed services."
"Further revenues as defined by IFRS 15 were 
generated from the transfer of use of application software used 
for the underwriting of insurance risks."
"These amounted to 
EUR 5.0 million (EUR 7.5 million) in the year under review and 
are deemed to be earned over a period of time when the cus-
tomer makes use of the software."
"In both cases the transaction 
price is derived from the contractually agreed contract prices."
"An amount of EUR 7.8 million (EUR 5.9 million) was earned on 
the UK and Swedish markets from the performance of manage-
ment services."
"The performance obligation is considered to have 
been fulfilled when the administrative activities specified in the 
contract were carried out."
"The transaction prices in this regard 
are measured essentially by the underlying general fee scales."
"Further revenues of EUR 2.7 million (EUR 2.9 million) were 
generated in this revenue category."
"In addition, revenues of EUR 6.4 million (EUR 7.4 million) were 
realised at a point in time in the year under review from other 
insurance-related services."
"In this context revenues of EUR 5.9 million (EUR 6.9 million) 
were realised on the South African market which are connected 
with commission-based business but cannot be characterised as 
commissions."
"The transaction price is arrived at as a percentage 
of the underlying gross premium share."
"The performance obli-
gation is deemed to be fulfilled at a point in time upon issuance 
of the insurance certificate for the end customer."
"An amount of EUR 0.5 million (EUR 0.5 million) was also earned 
on the North American market from the performance of admin-
istrative activities."
"The transaction price corresponds to the 
agreed contract price."
"The performance obligation is deemed to 
be satisfied when the administrative activities specified in the 
contract were carried out."
"Taxes on income
Actual taxes on income at the domestic companies, comparable 
actual taxes on income at foreign subsidiaries as well as de-
ferred taxes in accordance with IAS 12 “Income Taxes” are 
recognised under this item."
"The reader is referred to the remarks in section 3.1 “Summary 
of major accounting policies” regarding the basic approach to 
the recognition and measurement of deferred taxes."
"An unchanged tax rate of 32.63% was used to calculate the de-
ferred taxes of the major domestic companies."
"It is arrived at 
from the corporate income tax rate of 15.0%, the German soli-
darity surcharge of 5.5% and a trade earnings tax rate of 
16.8%."
"This therefore gives rise to a Group tax rate (rounded) 
of 32.7% (32.7%)."
"The deferred taxes at the companies abroad 
were calculated using the applicable country-specific tax rates."
"Tax-relevant bookings on the Group level are made using the 
Group tax rate unless they refer specifically to individual com-
panies."
"Deferred tax liabilities on profit distributions of significant affil-
iated companies are established in the year when they are re-
ceived."
"Deferred taxes re-
sulting from a single transaction and with respect to which the 
corresponding temporary valuation differences are simultane-
ously reversed were already netted on recognition."
"The 
following table presents a reconciliation of the expected ex-
pense for income taxes with the actual expense for income taxes 
reported in the statement of income."
"The pre-tax result is multi-
plied by the Group tax rate in order to calculate the Group’s ex-
pected expense for income taxes."
"Despite a higher pre-tax profit, this devel-
opment was driven largely by deferred tax income resulting 
from implementation of a corporate tax regime in Bermuda."
"The 
effective tax rate in the financial year was 1.4% (36.9%)."
"Availability of non-capitalised loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences 
Unused 
tax 
loss 
carry-forwards 
of 
EUR 757.3 million 
(EUR 1,291.0 million) existed as at the balance sheet date."
"Of 
existing tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differ-
ences, EUR 1,580.6 million (EUR 482.3 million) was not capi-
talised in consideration of local tax rates because their realisa-
tion is not sufficiently certain."
"The assets-side unadjusted deferred taxes on loss carry-for-
wards amounting to EUR 80.7 million (EUR 228.5 million) will 
probably be realised in an amount of EUR 26.5 million 
(EUR 80.5 million) within one year and in an amount of 
EUR 54.2 million (EUR 148.0 million) in subsequent years."
"In the year under review the actual taxes on income were re-
duced by EUR 0.2 million (EUR 2.2 million) because loss carry-
forward were used for which no deferred tax assets were estab-
lished."
"Excess deferred tax assets are recognised with respect to losses 
in the year under review or in the previous year only to the ex-
tent that, based on strong evidence, it is likely that the company 
concerned will generate sufficiently positive taxable results in 
the future."
"This evidence was provided for deferred tax assets of 
EUR 158.8 million (EUR 284.1 million)."
"The di-
rective on implementation of these rules in the EU was adopted 
in December 2022."
"EU Member States were then required to 
transpose the directive into national law by the end of 2023."
"In 
Germany, the directive was transposed into national law on 21 
December 2023 by the Minimum Taxation Directive Implemen-
tation Act (MinBestRL-UmsG)."
"The provisions of this Act are to 
be applied to financial years beginning on or after 31 December 
2023."
"In addition, 136 countries within and outside the EU have 
committed to implement the minimum taxation rules in their re-
spective national law."
"The Hannover Re Group, as a subgroup of the HDI Group, falls 
within the scope of application of the minimum taxation rules 
and is currently working intensively on preparations for appli-
cation of the provisions in the coming reporting year."
"Appropri-
ate organisational and technical steps are currently being taken 
or are in the pipeline to ensure compliance with the legal re-
quirements."
"Given that the legal provisions had not yet entered into force at 
the reporting date, there is no actual income tax burden for the 
Group in the year under review."
"Under the global minimum taxation rules, the HDI Group will in 
future be required to pay a supplementary tax for the difference 
between the effective rate of taxation per (tax) jurisdiction and 
the minimum tax rate of 15%."
"The HDI 
Group, which is represented by entities relevant to the minimum 
taxation rules in altogether 44 jurisdictions, is currently in the 
process of assessing the implications of the Minimum Taxation 
Directive Implementation Act following entry into force of the 
legislation."
"The analysis revealed that 31 jurisdic-
tions currently have an effective tax rate of more than 15%, cov-
ering a share of around 75% of the pre-tax profit/loss disclosed 
in the country-by-country reporting for 2022."
"This contrasts pri-
marily with the jurisdictions of Ireland, Bermuda and Bahrain, 
which have an effective tax rate of less than 15% based on the 
country-by-country reporting for 2022."
"The most significant ma-
terial implications are expected for Bermuda and Ireland in the 
future."
"At this point in time, it is not possible to quantify the 
impacts on account of recently completed amendments to na-
tional tax legislation in these jurisdictions and the resulting 
complex implications for the minimum tax rules."
"In view of the complexity around application of the legislation 
and calculation of the effective tax rate under the minimum tax-
ation rules, it is not yet possible to estimate the quantitative ef-
fects of the adopted legislation in sufficiently concrete terms."
"In 
principle, the application of minimum taxation may have impli-
cations even for companies with an effective tax rate of more 
than 15%."

"Derivative financial instruments and financial guarantees 
Derivatives are financial instruments, the fair value of which is 
derived from an underlying trading instrument such as equities, 
bonds, indices or currencies."
"We use derivative financial instru-
ments in order to hedge parts of our portfolio against interest 
rate and market price risks, optimise returns or realise inten-
tions to buy / sell."
"In this context we take special care to limit the 
risks, select first-class counterparties and adhere strictly to the 
standards defined by investment guidelines."
"The fair values of the derivative financial instruments were de-
termined on the basis of the market information available at the 
balance sheet date."
"Please see section 3.1 “Summary of major 
accounting policies” with regard to the measurement models 
used."
"Hannover Re’s portfolio contained derivative financial instru-
ments as at the balance sheet date in the form of forward ex-
change transactions taken out to hedge currency risks."
"These 
transactions gave rise to recognition of other liabilities in an 
amount of EUR 56.8 million (EUR 60.1 million) and financial as-
sets at fair value through profit or loss in an amount of 
EUR 92.1 million (EUR 98.4 million)."
"The decrease in equity from hedging instruments recognised in 
OCI pursuant to IFRS 9 in an amount of EUR 1.3 million (in-
crease of EUR 6.0 million recognised in OCI) derived from the 
forward exchange transactions taken out to hedge currency 
risks from long-term investments in foreign operations."
"These 
hedging instruments resulted in the recognition of other liabili-
ties of EUR 1.1 million (financial assets at fair value through 
profit or loss of EUR 6.1 million)."
"Inflation swaps are taken out in the form of cash flow hedges to 
minimise the inflation risk associated with payments under a 
morbidity loss reserve portfolio."
"These serve primarily to hedge 
volatility in reinsurance payments due."
"The structuring is such 
that separate inflation swaps are taken out for the loss payments 
incurred in each year."
"These financial instruments result in dis-
closure of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in 
an amount of EUR 4.3 million (EUR 2.1 million)."
"The hedge 
gave rise to an increase in equity from hedging instruments 
recognised 
in 
OCI 
in 
an 
amount 
of 
EUR 2.1 million 
(EUR 2.1 million)."
"In order to hedge the risk of share price changes in connection 
with the stock appreciation rights granted under the share 
award plan, Hannover Re has taken out hedges since 2014 in 
the form of so-called equity swaps."
"The fair value of these in-
struments was recognised in an amount of EUR 2.2 million 
(EUR  7.5 million) under other assets as at the balance sheet 
date."
"The hedge gave rise to an increase in equity from hedging 
instruments recognised in OCI in an amount of EUR  2.0 million 
(EUR 2.0 million)."
"Hannover Re enters into derivative transactions on the basis of 
standardised master agreements that contain global netting 
agreements."
"The netting agreements set out below normally do 
not meet the criteria for netting in the balance sheet, since Han-
nover Re has no legal right whatsoever at the present moment 
in time to netting of the recognised amounts."
"The right to net-
ting can, as a matter of principle, only be enforced upon occur-
rence of certain future defined events."
"Collateral furnished or 
received is recognised per counterparty up to at most the 
amount of the respective net liability or net asset."
"These accounting regulations require that certain deriva-
tives embedded in reinsurance contracts be separated from the 
underlying insurance contract (“host contract”), reported sepa-
rately at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 “Financial Instru-
ments” and recognised under investments."
"Fluctuations in the 
fair value of the derivative components are to be recognised 
through profit and loss in subsequent periods."
"The payment obligations result from con-
tractually defined events and relate to the development of an un-
derlying group of primary insurance contracts with statutory re-
serving requirements."
"The contracts are to be categorised and 
recognised as stand-alone credit derivatives pursuant to IFRS 9."
"These derivative financial instruments were carried in equity on 
initial recognition."
Please see section 6.3 “Other assets”.
"The 
fair 
value 
of 
these 
instruments 
was 
EUR 16.0 million 
(EUR 21.2 million) on the balance sheet date and was recog-
nised under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss."
"The change in value in subsequent periods is dependent upon 
the risk experience and led to an improvement in the result of 
EUR 38.8 million EUR (42.2 million) in the financial year."
"The portfolio contains a hedge against an extreme increase in 
mortality that protects the Hannover Re Group against a rise in 
mortality rates, for example due to pandemics, natural catastro-
phes or terrorist attacks."
"The risk swap is indexed against a 
weighted combination of US, UK and Australian population 
mortality."
"Payment under the cover is triggered proportionately 
between 110% and 120% of the mortality index."
"The derivative 
was recognised with a negative fair value of EUR 1.8 million 
(positive fair value of EUR 126.2 million) under other liabilities."
"The change in the fair value of the derivative gave rise to income 
of EUR 13.5 million (87.0 million) in the course of the year."
"In the area of life and health reinsurance a reinsurance treaty 
with a financing component was also written in the past under 
which the amount and timing of the return flows are dependent 
on lapse rates within an underlying primary insurance portfolio."
"Altogether, these arrangements gave rise to an improve-
ment in the result of EUR 11.4 million (deterioration in the result 
of EUR (4.3 million) in the year under review."
"At the end of the 2017 financial year an index-linked cover was 
written for longevity risks."
"The resulting derivative was recog-
nised as at the balance sheet date with a positive fair value of 
EUR 7.1 million (EUR (5.6 million) under financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"The change in the fair value of the 
derivative gave rise to income of EUR 4.4 million (EUR 3.8 mil-
lion) in the course of the year."
"In the 2022 financial year a cover containing a financing com-
ponent was taken out for biometric risks in life and health rein-
surance."
"IFRS 9 requires that an embedded derivative be sepa-
rated from this arrangement."
"The derivative resulted in recogni-
tion of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in an 
amount of EUR 12.7 million (EUR 69.8 million) in the year un-
der review."
"The change in the fair value of this derivative gave 
rise to income of EUR 4.3 million (EUR 0.1 million) over the 
course of the year."
"Improvements in the result amounting to EUR 72.4 million 
(EUR 133.1 million) as well as charges to the result of 
EUR 0.0 million (EUR 4.3 million) were recognised in the year 
under review from all separately measured derivatives in con-
nection with the technical account."
"Financial guarantees 
Structured transactions were entered into in the life and health 
reinsurance business group in order to finance statutory re-
serves (so-called Triple-X or AXXX reserves) of US ceding com-
panies."
"In each case such structures necessitated the involve-
ment of a special purpose entity."
"The special purpose entities 
carry extreme mortality risks securitised by the cedants above a 
contractually defined retention and transfer these risks by way 
of a fixed / floating swap to a member company of the Hannover 
Re Group."
"The total amount of the contractually agreed capaci-
ties of the transactions is equivalent to EUR 794.5 million 
(EUR 1,290.9 million); an amount equivalent to EUR 735.2 mil-
lion (EUR 1,095.6 million) had been taken up as at the balance 
sheet date."
"The variable payments to the special purpose entities 
that are guaranteed by the Hannover Re Group cover their pay-
ment obligations."
"Under some of the transactions the payments 
resulting from the swaps in the event of a claim are reimbursed 
by the parent companies of the cedants by way of compensation 
agreements."
"In this case the reimbursement claims from the 
compensation agreements are to be capitalised separately from 
and up to the amount of the provision."
"Under IFRS 9 these transactions are to be recognised at fair 
value as financial guarantees."
"To this end Hannover Re uses the 
net method, according to which the present value of the agreed 
fixed swap premiums is netted with the present value of the 
guarantee commitment."
"The fair value on initial recognition 
therefore amounted to zero."
"The higher of the fair value and the 
amount carried as a provision on the liabilities side pursuant to 
IAS 37 is recognised at the point in time when utilisation is con-
sidered probable."
"This was not the case as at the balance sheet 
date."
"Related party disclosures

group entities of a common parent, associated entities and joint 
ventures, legal entities under the influence of key management 
personnel and the key management personnel of the entity it-

to participate in the protection covers on the retention of Group 
cedants and share in the protection afforded by them."
"In certain 
circumstances Hannover Rück SE and E+S Rückversicherung 
AG are obliged to assume unplaced shares of the reinsurance of 
Group cedants from Talanx Reinsurance Broker GmbH or Ta-
lanx AG."
"The Hannover Re Group provides reinsurance protection for the 
HDI Group."

"Remuneration and shareholdings of the members of the governing bodies of the parent company
The remuneration of the active members of the Executive Board 
of Hannover Re amounted to altogether EUR 11.4 million 
(EUR 9.7 million)."
"In the event of 100% target attainment, the 
remuneration of the Executive Board consists of a 40% short-
term fixed component and a 60% variable component."
"Each 
member of the Executive Board receives a contractual commit-
ment to customary target remuneration which is aligned with 
their scope of responsibility and their expertise and experience 
of relevance to the position."
"The long-term incentive is paid out 
at the end of the four-year performance period in the 2028 fi-
nancial year."
"With effect from 1 January 2021 the variable component of the 
Executive Board remuneration is split into a short-term incen-
tive (40%) and a long-term incentive (60%) (HR performance 
share awards)."
"For a detailed explanation of the long-term in-
centive (LTI) we would refer to section 9.3 “Share-based pay-
ment”."
"The short-term incentive (STI) is geared to Hannover 
Re's commercial success in the respective financial year."
"The 
basis for payment under the STI is the contractually defined STI 
target amount, which is based on overall target attainment of 
100%."
"The overall target attainment (including the individual 
premium or deduction) can range from 0% to 200%."
"The 
amount paid out under the STI is thus limited to 200% of the 
target amount."
"In addition to the return on equity as a financial 
performance criterion, an individual premium or deduction is 
also determinative for the STI."
"The latter encompasses both fi-
nancial and non-financial performance criteria, particularly in-
cluding sustainability targets."
"The amount of the premium or de-
duction, which can range from -25 percentage points to +25 per-
centage points, is determined by the Supervisory Board at its 
reasonable discretion."
"The criteria and key performance indica-
tors used to establish the individual premium or deduction are 
defined by the Supervisory Board in advance for the coming fi-
nancial year and communicated to the members of the Execu-
tive Board."
"The STI for the 2023 financial year amounts to 
EUR 4.8 million (EUR 3.5 million)."
"The fixed remuneration is granted in three components, namely 
fixed remuneration, fringe benefits and retirement provision."
"The fixed remuneration is aligned with the scope of duties and 
the professional experience of the individual member of the Ex-
ecutive Board."
"In addition, each member of the Executive Board 
receives certain, non-performance-based fringe benefits in the 
customary scope, for example a company car and insurance 
coverage."
"These amounted to EUR 0.2 million (EUR 0.1 mil-
lion)."
"The benefits after termination of the employment relationship 
for the most part consist of a defined contribution retirement 
plan."
"Altogether, a pension expense for the active members of

"Share-based payment
Since 2011 Hannover Re has had a share-based payment plan 
with cash settlement (Share Award Plan)."
"The Executive Board of Hannover Re decided to adopt a Share 
Award Plan for certain management levels at Hannover Re as 
well with effect from the 2012 financial year."
"The Share Award 
Plan for the Executive Board was modified and expanded with 
effect from the 2021 financial year (“performance shares”) by a 
resolution of the Annual General Meeting."
"The Share Award Plan replaced the cancelled Stock Apprecia-
tion Rights Plan."
"The share awards do not establish any claim 
against Hannover Re to the delivery of stock, but merely to pay-
ment of a cash amount in accordance with the conditions set out 
below."
"Share awards were granted separately for the first time for the 
2011 financial year and then for each financial year (allocation 
year) thereafter."
"The first payout of share awards took place in 
the 2016 financial year for those share awards that had been 
allocated in the 2011 financial year to the eligible members of 
the Executive Board."
"In the 2017 financial year the first payout 
was also made to the participating senior executives."
"The total number of share awards granted is based on the value 
per share of Hannover Rück SE."
"The value per share is estab-
lished according to the unweighted arithmetic mean of the Xetra 
 
236  
Hannover Re | Annual Report 2023 
closing prices of the Hannover Re share."
"In the conditions ap-
plicable to members of the Executive Board a period of 15 trad-
ing days before to 15 trading days after the meeting of the Su-
pervisory Board that approves the consolidated financial state-
ment for the financial year just ended is envisaged for the cal-
culation."
"For senior executives a period of 20 trading days be-
fore to ten trading days after the meeting of the Supervisory 
Board that approves the consolidated financial statement for the 
financial year just ended has been agreed."
"The prices calculated 
in this way also determine the payout value of the share awards 
that have become payable."
"The total number of share awards 
granted is established by dividing the amount available for the 
granting of share awards to the respective eligible recipients by 
the value per share, rounded up to the next full share."
"For mem-
bers of the Executive Board 60% and for senior executives 40% 
or 35% – depending on management level – of the defined vari-
able remuneration shall be granted in the form of share awards."
"Since the 2021 financial year the calculation of share awards for 
the Executive Board has been based on the target amount, 
which – depending on the entrepreneurial and personal target 
achievement – produces an allocation value that is at most 
200% of the target amount."
"The share awards are granted automatically without any re-
quirement for a declaration."
"Following expiry of a vesting period 
of four years the value of one Hannover Re share calculated at 
the disbursement date is paid out for each share award."
"This 
value is calculated according to the provisions of the preceding 
paragraph."
"The amount paid out for the performance shares is 
additionally influenced by the development of the Total Share-
holder Return (TSR)."
"The TSR captures the share price perfor-
mance as well as the dividends during the vesting period."
"The eligible recipient shall be paid an amount that corresponds 
to the sum total of the values of the share awards calculated at 
the disbursement date for which the vesting period of four years 
has expired."
"The amount is to be paid in the month after expiry 
of the determinative period for calculating the value per share 
according to the preceding paragraphs."
"In addition, upon payment of the value of the share awards, a 
sum shall be paid out in the amount of the dividend insofar as 
dividends were distributed to shareholders."
"The amount of the 
dividend is the sum total of all dividends per share paid out dur-

share awards due for disbursement to the eligible recipient at 
the disbursement date."
"In the event of early disbursement of the 
share awards, the value of the dividends shall only be paid out 
for the period until occurrence of the event that triggers early 
disbursement."
"No pro rata allowance shall be made for divi-
dends that have not yet been distributed."
"In the event of death the 
claims arising out of the already granted and / or still to be 
granted share awards pass to the heirs."
"Any entitlement to the granting of share awards after leaving the 
company is excluded."
"This shall not apply with respect to claims 
to variable remuneration acquired (pro rata) in the last year of 
service of the eligible recipient in the event of exit from the com-
pany on account of non-reappointment, occurrence of the pen-
sionable event or death."
"The Share Award Plan of Hannover Rück SE gives rise to the 
amounts shown in the following table."
"The allocation of the financial year recognised in the expendi-
tures on personnel totalled altogether EUR 20.2 million 
(EUR 14.8 million)."
"This consists of the expense for share 
awards of the 2023 financial year as well as the dividend claim 
and the additionally earned portion of the share awards granted 
in earlier financial years."
"The value of the share awards finally 
granted is also influenced by movements in the share price."
"The 
sum total of the dividends included in the expenditures on per-
sonnel for earlier financial years amounted to EUR 1.4 million 
(EUR 1.3 million)."
"The distributed dividend is recognised, with 
no allowance made for expected dividend payments."
"Dividend 
claims are recognised in the discounted amounts."
"The 51,393 (51,165) share awards of the se-
nior executives for the 2018 financial year were paid out in 2023 
with a value of EUR 177.58 (159.54) each plus the dividend en-
titlement of EUR 21.00 (20.25)."
"The release of the provision for 
share awards granted in 2018 derives from the difference be-
tween the share price at the last balance sheet date, i.e."
"EUR 
185.50, and the price for payment of the share awards from 
March 2023, i.e."

Staff
The average number of staff at the companies included in the 
consolidated financial statement of the Hannover Re Group dur-

"Neither in the year under review nor in the previous reporting 
period were there any dilutive effects."

the issued shares was, as in the previous year, slightly lower 
than the value of the shares in circulation on the balance sheet

"In the context of the employee share option plan Hannover 
Re acquires treasury shares and sells them at a later date to eli-

"The earnings per share could potentially be diluted in future 
through the issue of shares or subscription rights from the au-

"Dividend per share  
A dividend of EUR 723.6 million (EUR 693.4 million) was paid 
in the year under review for the 2022 financial year."
"It will be proposed to the Annual General Meeting on 6 May 
2024 that a dividend of EUR 6.00 and a special dividend of 
EUR 1.20 per share should be paid for the 2023 financial year."
This corresponds to a total distribution of EUR 868.3 million.
"The dividend proposal does not form part of this consolidated 
financial statement."
"Lawsuits
Member companies of the Hannover Re Group are involved in 
judicial and supervisory procedures as well as in arbitration pro-
ceedings as part of the conduct of insurance and reinsurance 
business."
"The provision established in 
each case covers the expense that can be expected in our as-
sessment as at the balance sheet date."
"Neither the outcome nor the duration of pending procedures 
can be definitively foreseen at the time when provisions are es-
tablished."
"This is also true of procedures for which no provisions 
were established."
"Insofar as a commitment exists under such 
procedures as at the balance sheet date that may possibly but 
will probably not result in a loss, the Hannover Re Group esti-
mates this potential loss – where practicable – and reports a con-
tingent liability."
"For estimation purposes Hannover Re takes into 
account a number of factors."
"These include, among others, the 
nature of the claim, the status of the procedure concerned, de-
cision of courts and arbitration bodies, prior settlement discus-
sions, experience from comparable cases as well as expert opin-
ions and the assessments of legal advisers and other experts."
"If 
a provision has been established for a particular procedure, a 
contingent liability is not recognised."
"The other lawsuits concluded and still pending in the year under 
review and as at the balance sheet date were not material for the 
Hannover Re Group either individually or combined."
"Further-
more, there were no contingent liabilities from lawsuits to report 
as at the balance sheet date."

December 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal

section of our auditor’s report."

management report does not cover the content of those 
parts of the group management report listed in the “Other 
Information” section of our auditor’s report."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that 
our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal 
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 
HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014, referred to 
subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) in compliance with 
German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
[Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed 
the audit of the consolidated financial statements in 
supplementary compliance with the International Standards on 
Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements, 
principles and standards are further described in the “Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of 
our auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities 
in accordance with the requirements of European law and 
German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled 
our other German professional responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 
10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we 
have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 
(1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit 
evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated 
financial statements and on the group management report."
"These matters were addressed in 
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements 
as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not 
provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"Of these investments, financial assets totalling € 55,536.2 
million are measured at fair value, of which in turn fair 
values of € 3,610.4 million are calculated using valuation 
models or based on third-party value indicators."
"These 
investments in particular relate to unlisted securities, asset 
backed securities, other structured and illiquid bonds and 
investments in private equity."
"Of the investments reported in the consolidated financial 
statements, financial assets in the amount of € 50,619.1 
million are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income."
"Forward-
looking macroeconomic forecasts are also included in the 
model valuation to take account of impairments for expected 
credit losses."
"Model-measured investments are subject to an increased 
measurement risk due to the reduced objectivity and the 
underlying judgements, estimates and assumptions made by 
the executive directors."
"(b) As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the controls for the valuation of model-
measured investments and investments measured on the 
basis of third-party indicators."
"In addition, we assessed, 
among other things, the integrity of the underlying data and 
the process for determining the assumptions, estimates and 
forward-looking information used in the valuation."
"With the support of our internal valuation specialists, we 
also assessed the appropriateness of the methods applied by 
the executive directors to determine the fair values and the 
parameters used."
"We compared the methods and 
assumptions used to calculate valuation adjustments in the 
financial year with recognised practices and industry 
standards and examined the extent to which they are 
suitable for proper accounting."
"To assess the inclusion of 
forward-looking information in the model-based calculation 
of impairment for expected credit losses, we involved 
internal specialists with particular expertise in the field of 
credit risk modelling."
"We also evaluated the disclosures on 
valuation methods and judgements contained in the notes to 
the consolidated financial statements."
"(c) The Group’s disclosures on the measurement of investments 
are contained in Notes 6.1 to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"The liability for incurred claims represent the Group’s 
expectation of future payments for known and unknown 
claims and benefits as well as the associated expenses."
"The 
Group uses various methods to estimate these obligations."
"In addition, the measurement of this liability requires a high 
degree of judgement by the executive directors of the Group 
regarding the assumptions to be made, such as the impact 
of changing inflation rates, loss developments and 
regulatory changes."
"In addition, there is a significant 
judgement of the executive directors regarding the 
determination of the discount rate for calculatingthe 
liability."
"In particular, product lines with a low claims 
frequency, high individual claims or long claims settlement 
periods are usually subject to increased estimation 
uncertainties."
"The liability for remaining coverage represent the present 
value of the future cash flows estimated by the Group."
"The 
measurement is based on complex actuarial methods 
(hereinafter referred to as the “measurement methods”) on 
the basis of comprehensive processes for determining 
assumptions about future developments of the insurance 
portfolios to be valued."
"Within the measurement of the 
liabilities, the present values of the estimated future cash 
flows in particular are affected by possible material 
uncertainties."
"This uncertainty stems in particular from the 
risk of chance, change and error associated with the 
estimation of the present value of cash flows and the 
methods and financial and non-financial assumptions used 
for this purpose."
"In particular, the assumptions in 
connection 
with 
interest 
rates, 
investment 
income, 
mortality, disability, longevity, costs and policyholder 
behaviour have a significant impact on the measurement."
"The general measurement model (GMM) is used to measure 
liabilities from insurance contracts."
"Against this background and due to the complexity of 
determining the underlying assumptions and estimates 
made by the executive directors, the measurement of these 
liabilities was of particular significance in the context of our 
audit."
"(b) As part of our audit, we assessed the appropriateness of 
selected controls of the Group for selecting the valuation 
methods applied as well as for determining assumptions and 
making estimates for the measurement of certain liabilities 
from insurance contracts issued."
"With the involvement of our internal valuation specialists, 
we have compared the valuation methods and key 
assumptions with generally recognised actuarial methods 
and industry standards and examined to what extent these 
are suitable for measuring the liabilities."
"Our audit also included an evaluation of the appropriateness 
and integrity of the data and assumptions, including the 
assessment of the executive directors regarding the impact 
of changing inflation rates, used in the valuation and a 
reconstruction 
of 
the 
claims 
settlement 
process."
"Furthermore, we recalculated the amount of the liability for 
selected lines of product, in particular lines of product with 
large 
liability 
amounts 
or 
increased 
estimation 
uncertainties."
"For these lines of product, we compared the 
amounts calculated by us with the values determined by the 
Group for the liabilites and evaluated any differences."
"We 
also examined whether any adjustments to estimates in the 
loss 
reserves 
were 
adequately 
documented 
and 
substantiated."
"A further focus was the assessment of the 
cash flows used by the IT systems used as well as the 
appropriate derivation and use of assumptions for the 
measurement of selected liabilities."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy 
ourselves that the methods, estimates and assumptions used 
by the executive directors are appropriate overall for 
measuring the technical liabilities in property and casualty 
insurance."
"(c) The company's disclosures on the measurement of certain 
liabilities from insurance contracts in property, casualty and 
life insurance are contained in Notes 6.4 to the consolidated 
financial statements."

Other Information
The executive directors are responsible for the other 
information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and 
on the group management report do not cover the other 
information, and consequently we do not express an audit 
opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there 
is a material misstatement of this other information, we are 
required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in this 
regard."

compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, 
liabilities, financial 
position, 
and 
financial 
performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the 
responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial 
reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless 
there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease 
operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
financial reporting process for the preparation of the 
consolidated financial statements and of the group management 
report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or 
error and are considered material if, individually or in the 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
consolidated financial statements and this group management 
report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional 
skepticism throughout the audit."
"The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting 
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as 
fraud 
may 
involve 
collusion, 
forgery, 
intentional 
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal 
controls."
"• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
by the executive directors and the reasonableness of 
estimates made by the executive directors and related 
disclosures."
"If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in the consolidated financial statements and in the group 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions 
are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of 
our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a 
going concern."
"• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities 
within the Group to express audit opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
"We re-
main solely responsible for our audit opinions."
"• Evaluate the consistency of the group management report 
with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity 
with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it 
provides."
"• Perform audit procedures on the prospective information 
presented by the executive directors in the group 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant 
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for 
the prospective information, and evaluate the proper 
derivation of the prospective information from these 
assumptions."
"We do not express a separate audit opinion 
on the prospective information and on the assumptions 
used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk 
that future events will differ materially from the 
prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing 
of the audit and significant audit findings, including any 
significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or 
regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."

Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance

engagement."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with 
International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 
(Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or  
Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB."

less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and 
accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The 
selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional 
judgement of the assurance practitioner."
"Due to the 
immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted 
differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, 
accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to 
uncertainties."
"We do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources 
of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the  
Combined Non-financial Statement.."
"Restriction of Use 
We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement 
was conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the report 
is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the 
assurance engagement."
"Consequently, it may not be suitable for 
any other purpose than the aforementioned."
"Accordingly, the 
report is not intended to be used by third parties for making 
(financial) decisions based on it."
"Our responsibility is to the 
Company."
We do not accept any responsibility to third parties.
