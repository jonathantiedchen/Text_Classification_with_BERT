"As in 2022, the past year was marked 
by volatile energy costs, high inflation rates, and ongoing conflicts across the globe."
"We certainly felt the effects not only in the economy, but also in our everyday lives."
"Nevertheless, in our 150th anniversary year, we have once again shown at Heidelberg 
Materials that we can deal with major changes and crises."
"I am proud of our teams 
around the world, who have remained firmly focused on our targets during a chal-
lenging year."
"Despite declining demand for our building materials, we closed the 
2023 financial year with a record result."
"We improved revenue by 4% on a like-for-like 
basis to €21.2 billion and increased our result from current operations by 29% to 
€3.0 ­
billion."
"This 
means that around 80% of our revenue already falls under the Heidelberg Materials 
brand, and we continue to drive the transformation towards sustainability and digi-
talisation in our industry – for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders, our 
­
employees, and society."
"Strong market presence for our sustainable product portfolio
We measure our success primarily, but not exclusively, in financial key figures."
"We 
succeeded in reducing our specific net CO2 emissions by an additional 3% in the 2023 
financial year."
"We offer our customers a wide range of carbon-reduced and circular 
products."
"Over a third of our revenue is already generated with sustainable products, 
and we aim to increase this to 50% by 2030."
"We show that it is possible to make 
economy and ecology integrated parts of a successful business model."
"To reinforce this claim, we recently launched evoBuild®, our first global brand with 
a focus on sustainability."
"For the evoBuild product range, we apply internationally 
harmonised and stringent criteria for sustainable building materials."
"In this way, 
we are intentionally setting new standards in the building materials industry."
"We have also taken the next big step with evoZero®, the world’s first carbon captured 
net-zero cement."
"evoZero achieves its net-zero footprint through the application of 
carbon capture and storage technology at our Norwegian plant in Brevik, without 
compensation from credits generated outside our value chain."
"With evoZero, we are 
offering the industry’s most innovative, globally unique product to our customers, 
enabling them to drive cutting-edge, environmentally friendly construction projects."
"The carbon capture attributes are transparent and traceable by harnessing the 
­
power of blockchain technology."
"Major steps towards net zero
In the past financial year, we consistently expanded our pioneering role in the de­
carbonisation of our industry and achieved key milestones with our carbon capture, 
utilisation, and storage (CCUS) projects."
"Construction of the world’s first industrial-­
scale carbon capture facility in a cement plant is progressing at a rapid pace."
"The 
mechanical completion of our Brevik plant is on track and scheduled for the end 
of this year."
"For example, we were able to secure the support of the EU Innova-
tion Fund for the development of an innovative CCS value chain in our home market."
"As part of the GeZero project, we intend to build Germany’s first inland cement plant 
with an industrial-scale carbon capture facility in Geseke in North Rhine-Westphalia."
The project will also include a solution for CO2 transport and storage.
"Furthermore, 
we have received a funding commitment from the EU Innovation Fund for our inno-
vative large-scale ANRAV CCUS project in Bulgaria."
"The ANRAV.beta pilot unit is al-
ready under construction."
"It will be a key proof of concept for CCUS in Eastern Europe 
and show the scalability of the innovative OxyCal capture technology."
"In cooperation with Linde, we have initiated the construction of the world’s first 
large-scale carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) facility in a cement plant."
"Co-funded 
by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, the CO2 
capture and liquefaction plant in Lengfurt, Bavaria, is scheduled for completion in 
2025."
"The captured CO2 from cement production will then be reused as a valuable 
raw material for the food and chemical industries."
There is also a lot going on in North America.
"With the opening of our state-of-the-art 
cement plant in Mitchell, Indiana, we will substantially increase local production levels 
while significantly reducing CO2 emissions and energy consumption for Heidelberg 
Materials North America."
"In addition, we have signed a Memorandum of Understand-
ing with the Government of Canada in support of our project to develop the cement 
industry’s first full-scale carbon capture and storage ­
facility worldwide."
"The new 
­
facility is part of our Edmonton plant in the Canadian province of Alberta."
"It is sched-
uled to go into operation by the end of 2026 and will capture more than 1 million 
tonnes of CO2 annually."
We are also driving decarbonisation with concrete measures in emerging countries.
"It should not be underestimated that we have developed tailor-made reduction road-
maps for each location."
"In Ghana, for example, we are piloting innovative calcined 
clay technology, which will go into operation later this year."
"Using calcined clay as 
clinker substitute is an important measure to reduce the carbon footprint of cement 
and concrete."
"This is especially attractive for countries in Western Africa without 
significant limestone deposits."
"With The SEFA Group, Inc., we 
have acquired the largest US recycler of fly ash recovered from landfill sites."
"By in-
creasing the use of fly ash, a by-product of energy generation, we are reducing the 
CO2 intensity of our products, such as composite cements."
"Thanks to further acqui-
sitions, including Green Drop Rock Products and RMS Gravel Inc."
"(both in the USA) 
as well as RWG Holding GmbH and SER Group (both in Germany), we are further 
expanding our presence in core markets while strengthening our range of circular 
materials."
"The construction of the largest 3D-printed building in Europe to date was a special 
highlight for us last year."
"Our 100% recyclable high-tech concrete developed specif-
ically for 3D printing was used in this pioneering project in Heidelberg."
"This allowed 
us to demonstrate in an impressive way how sustainability and digitalisation go hand 
in hand and that quick, effective, and resource-efficient 3D concrete printing can be 
an important future technology for sustainable construction."
"Shareholders benefit from our success
We continue to pursue a progressive dividend policy."
"We will therefore propose to the 
Annual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend of €3.00 per share."
"The shares 
from the buyback programme that was completed in October have now all been 
cancelled."
"We spent around €1 billion on dividends and share buybacks in the past 
financial year."
We will continue to focus on shareholder return in 2024.
"We are launching an even 
larger share buyback programme with a volume of up to €1.2 billion and a term end-
ing late 2026 at the latest."
"I am very pleased that you, our shareholders, can once 
more participate to a large extent in our success."
"Dear shareholders, customers, suppliers and business partners, employee represent-
atives, and employees: only a few companies get to celebrate their 150th anniversa-
ry."
"We are very proud that our building materials have been leaving their mark on 
numerous structures around the world since 1873."
"Today, more than ever, based 
on 150 years of progress, innovation, and expertise, we are committed to actively 
building and shaping a more sustainable future for generations to come."
"In our en-
trepreneurial activity, we follow the United Nations Global Compact and its ten prin-
ciples relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and corruption 
prevention."
"Special thanks go to you, our shareholders, for your trust in our company and the 
path we have taken together."
"As a strong, internationally established company, we 
are ideally positioned to tackle the important milestones and challenges that lie ahead 
in 2024."
"What’s more, we want to make a global difference in our large ­
industry – in 
terms of financial success, sustainability, and digitalisation."
"Both revenue and result from current operations 
rose significantly."
"Heidelberg Materials is the first company in the building materials industry to apply 
internationally harmonised and stringent criteria for sustainable products, thereby 
setting new sustainability standards as a front runner."
"With the launch of the first 
net-zero cement based on carbon capture and storage (CCS), the company is break-
ing new ground in the use of this technology."
"Its portfolio of global CCUS initiatives 
has expanded to include a CCUS project in Germany, which has been selected for 
funding from the EU Innovation Fund."
"By reorganising responsibilities on the Managing Board, Heidelberg Materials is 
strengthening the basis for its continued successful development."
"The Supervisory 
Board accompanies the Managing Board on this path into the future."
"The Supervisory Board re-
viewed, discussed, and analysed the Managing Board’s 
reports in detail."
"The Managing Board agreed on the 
Group’s strategy with the Supervisory Board."
"Devia-
tions of the actual business development from the 
plans were explained in detail by the Managing Board."
"The Supervisory Board was directly involved at an ear-
ly stage in all decisions of fundamental importance to 
the Group."
"A catalogue drawn up by the Supervisory 
Board, which is reviewed regularly and adjusted as 
­
necessary, outlines transactions and measures of fun-
damental importance that require the consent of the 
Super­
visory Board."
"In the reporting year, the Supervi-
sory Board took decisions on the transactions and 
measures submitted by the Managing Board that re-
quired its approval, having first reviewed them and dis-
cussed them with the Managing Board."
"In particular, 
investment projects and financing matters requiring 
authorisation were explained in detail by the Managing 
Board and discussed before decisions were made."
"With regard to the accounting-related 
internal control system and the early risk detection sys-
tem, the Supervisory Board also had this confirmed by 
the auditor."
"Furthermore, it has satisfied itself of the 
effectiveness of the compliance management system, 
which guarantees Group-wide compliance with the law, 
legality, and internal guidelines."
"In the relevant meet-
ings, the responsible line managers of the Group below 
Managing Board level were available together with 
members of the Managing Board to provide informa-
tion to the Audit Committee and to answer questions."
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board as well as the 
Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Audit Commit-
tee also discussed topics relating to the audit in detail 
with the auditor outside the scheduled meetings and 
without the participation of the Managing Board."
"In 
addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was 
in regular and ad-hoc contact with the Chairman of the 
Managing Board outside the scheduled meetings."
"During the reporting year, the Chairman of the Super-
visory Board was also prepared to receive and consid-
er suggestions from investors on topics specific to the 
Supervisory Board."
"In March 2024, the Chairman of 
the Super­
visory Board expanded this exchange in part 
together with the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and held talks with investors as part of a governance 
roadshow."
"In the physical and virtual meetings with 
inter­
national shareholders from London, Frankfurt, and 
the USA, governance-specific topics were discussed, in 
particular the tasks, work, and composition of the 
Super­
visory Board as well as the remuneration system 
of the Managing Board."
"Overall, the Supervisory Board continuously and thor-
oughly monitored the work of the Managing Board and 
provided it with advice, particularly with regard to the 
company’s management, strategic alignment and 
­
implementation, and development."
"In doing so, it as-
sessed the Managing Board’s management of the 
company in terms of its lawfulness, propriety, expedi-
ency, and operating efficiency."
"The Managing Board 
and Supervisory Board worked together in a spirit of 
mutual trust for the benefit of the company and main-
tained an open and intensive dialogue."
"During the reporting year, the plenary session of the 
Supervisory Board convened at six ordinary meetings 
(30 January, 22 March, 11 May, 10 and 11 September, 
13 November) and two extraordinary meetings (24 July 
and 3 October)."
"The number and format of Supervisory 
Board meetings and committee meetings in the report-
ing year are shown in the following overview."
"The average participation rate at all the com-
mittee meetings held in the reporting year was 99.06%."
"Separate preliminary meetings of the employee repre-
sentatives were held in connection with the Super­
visory 
Board meetings."
"In the reporting year, the members of 
the Managing Board generally attended the meetings 
of the Supervisory Board, although the Supervisory 
Board also met regularly and on an ad hoc basis with-
out the Managing Board to discuss certain agenda 
items and topics."
"In the reporting year, the Supervisory Board and 
its committees also dealt with the Managing Board’s 
regular reports on the business development and with 
corporate governance issues."
"For the first time, the 
Super­
visory Board compiled a qualification matrix on 
the status of implementation of the fulfilment of the 
profile of skills for the Supervisory Board on the basis 
of a self-assessment by the individual Super­
visory 
Board members."
"The Supervisory Board was also in-
volved in the change of name from Heidelberg­
Cement 
AG to Heidelberg Materials AG."
"As part of the strategy discussion, the Supervisory 
Board also looked into the issue of recycling and exam-
ined the role of alternative fuels in the decarbonisation 
roadmap."
"By doing so, the Supervisory Board is focus-
ing even more strongly on the topic of sustainability in 
its monitoring and advisory activities."
"At several meetings, the Supervisory Board also dis-
cussed with the Managing Board the major invest-
ments, divestments, and portfolio optimisations that 
affect the strategic targets of Heidelberg Materials 
and could lead to an improvement of the balance sheet 
structure."
"The continuation of the share buyback pro-
gramme with the third tranche of up to €300 million (all 
three tranches totalling €1 billion) and the cancellation 
of treasury shares from the second tranche were also 
subjects of this year’s Supervisory Board discussions."
"In addition, refinancing plans, the agreement of a new 
innovation and development-linked credit line, restruc-
turing in the United Kingdom, and discussions about 
the company’s health and safety programme were all 
on the Supervisory Board’s agenda."
"In the reporting 
year, the Supervisory Board additionally discussed the 
practical application of artificial intelligence in the 
company and related investments."
"The Supervisory Board’s work also focused on the 2023 
annual bonus plan prepared by the Personnel Commit-
tee, the long-term bonus plan for 2023 to 2025/26, 
matters relating to the Managing Board, and the future 
composition of the Managing Board."
"Following the 
­
expiry of his reappointment by the Supervisory Board 
as a member of the Managing Board until 31 December 
2023, Ernest Jelito retired at the end of the reporting 
year."
"The Western and Southern Europe and the 
majority of Northern and Eastern Europe-­
Central Asia 
were combined to form the Group area Europe."
"Mr Mor-
rish assumed responsibility for this newly established 
Group area as of January 2024."
"Mr Gurdal, who was 
already in charge of the Group Area Africa-­
Eastern 
Mediterranean Basin, took on additional responsibili-
ties for the countries Kazakhstan and Russia as of Jan-
uary 2024."
"The region has been renamed Africa and 
Mediterranean-Western Asia (AMWA)."
"Chief Financial 
Officer René Aldach assumed additional responsibility 
for Australia with effect from January 2024."
"In March 
2023, the Supervisory Board also appointed Axel Con-
rads as a new member of the Managing Board from 
1 February 2024 to 31 January 2027."
"Mr Conrads has 
assumed the new role of Chief Technical Officer."
"He is 
responsible for all three global technical Competence 
Centers: Cement (CCC), Aggregates & Asphalt (CCA), 
and Readymix (CCR)."
"In September 2023, the Supervi-
sory Board also appointed Roberto Callieri to be a new 
member of the Managing Board from 1 January 2024 
to 31 December 2026."
"Mr Callieri has taken on respon-
sibility for Asia within the Group area Asia-Pacific."
"He 
succeeds Kevin Gluskie, whose term on the Managing 
Board expired as scheduled at the end of January 
2024."
"Finally, the Supervisory Board adjusted the remunera-
tion system for the members of the Supervisory Board 
in the reporting year by including the Sustainability and 
Innovation Committee in the remuneration."
"With the 
support of the Personnel Committee, the Supervisory 
Board also developed an adjusted 2024+ Managing 
Board remuneration system, which will enter into force 
retroactively from 1 January 2024, subject to approval 
by the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"In the reporting year, the Audit Committee engaged 
extensively with the further development of the com-
pany’s corporate governance, risk management, and 
internal control system, including the effectiveness of 
the compliance management system."
"The Audit Com-
mittee dealt regularly and intensively with compliance 
issues in particular."
"The Director Group Legal & Com-
pliance regularly reported to the committee on his ac-
tivities and on the status of the compliance manage-
ment system and its further development."
"He was also 
in direct contact with the Chairman of the Audit Com-
mittee in the reporting year."
"In this context, it defined the points of focus for 
the 2023 audit."
"During the reporting year, the Audit Committee amend-
ed its guidelines on the approval process for non-audit 
services by the auditor."
"It also monitored the develop-
ment of the non-audit services by the auditor and re-
ceived reports from the Managing Board on the nature

and scope of the non-audit services performed by the 
auditor."
"To refinance the bonds maturing in the 2024 financial 
year, the company successfully issued sustainability-­
linked bonds with a total issue volume of €1.5 billion for 
the first time in the 2023 financial year."
"Heidelberg 
Materials is ideally prepared to secure financing for its 
business transactions in the short, medium, and long 
term with its existing debt instruments."
"The Super­
visory 
Board acknowledged that the maturity profile of the 
liabilities shows its usual balanced structure."
"In the reporting year, the Audit Committee also fo-
cused on the topic of IT security."
"Furthermore, it looked 
at the use of inventory management systems in the in-
dividual countries and received reports on the status of 
the standardisation of the inventory management sys-
tem, including the status of the migration to S/4 Hana."
The Chairman of the Audit Committee is Mr Luka Mucic.
"Mr  Mucic, like Audit Committee member Mr  Ludwig 
Merckle, is regarded as a financial expert pursuant to 
section 100(5) of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(Aktiengesetz, AktG)."
"The Supervisory Board is of the 
opinion that both Mr Mucic and Mr Merckle have exper-
tise in the areas of accounting and auditing, including 
sustainability reporting and the auditing thereof."
"For 
more information, see the Corporate Governance 
statement chapter."
"During the reporting year, the Personnel Committee 
also dealt intensively with new appointments and re­
appointments to the Managing Board as well as inter-
national secondments of members of the Managing 
Board and prepared the decisions of the Supervisory 
Board in this regard."
"It discussed the conclusion of an 
external consultancy agreement between the company 
and a former member of the Managing Board."
"In addi-
tion, the Personnel Committee developed an adjusted 
2024+ Managing Board remuneration system and sub-
mitted it to the Supervisory Board for a decision."
"Final-
ly, the Personnel Committee assured itself that all 
members of the Managing Board have carried out the 
required individual investment in Heidelberg Materials 
shares as part of the Managing Board remuneration 
system."
"The Sustainability and Innovation Committee fo-
cused intensively on the Sustainability Commitments 
2030 and on the company’s plan to reduce specific 
CO2 emissions."
"One focus of the committee’s discus-
sions was on strengthening circularity and recycling, as 
well as carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) 
technologies."
"In addition, the Sustainability and Inno-
vation Committee discussed the technical background 
and potential areas of application as well as company 
projects in the field of 3D printing."
"Due to the resignation of Professor Dr Marion Weissen-
berger-Eibl from the Supervisory Board effective at the 
end of the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the Nomina-
tion Committee had already discussed the succession 
in the 2023 financial year."
"To this end, the committee 
drew up a profile of requirements for the successor 
based on the profile of skills and the objectives for the 
composition of the Supervisory Board before searching 
for suitable candidates."
"The Mediation Committee, formed in accordance 
with section 27(3) of the German Codetermination Law 
(­
MitbestG), did not need to meet in the reporting year."
"The results of the committees’ meetings were reported 
at the subsequent plenary sessions."
"In one case during the reporting year, a conflict of in-
terest arose involving a member of the Supervisory 
Board, as a result of which the Supervisory Board 
member did not participate in the Supervisory Board’s 
deliberations or voting."
"There were no consulting or 
other contracts for services or work between any 
member of the Supervisory Board and the company in 
the 2023 reporting year."
"In the reporting period, there were no transactions with 
related parties requiring disclosure within the meaning 
of sections 111a(1)(2) and 111b(1) of the AktG."
"Every two years, the Supervisory Board carries out a 
regular self-assessment of the effectiveness of the 
work of the Supervisory Board and its committees, as 
required by the German Corporate Governance Code."
"The last such self-assessment took place in autumn 
2023."
"To avoid repetition, details are included in the 
Corporate Governance statement chapter."

Among other things, the Supervisory Board has dis-
cussed the nomination of Dr Bernd Scheifele as a mem-
ber of the Supervisory Board and his planned re-­
election as Chairman of the Supervisory Board."
"In this 
context, the Supervisory Board – subsequent to its 
related discussions following the 2022 Annual General 
Meeting – also looked in detail at Dr Scheifele’s narrow 
election victory at the 2022 Annual General Meeting 
and examined the possible reasons for this."
"In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, the reason for 
the tight result was not due to Dr Scheifele as an indi-
vidual."
"The Supervisory Board has carefully and critically 
­
examined these shareholder concerns regarding 
Dr Scheifele’s former role as Chairman of the Managing 
Board."
"The Supervisory Board has come to the conclu-
sion that the benefits to the company clearly outweigh 
the concerns raised and that Dr Scheifele remains the 
most suitable candidate for the position of Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board."
"This view also appears to 
be shared by the vast majority of shareholders based 
on the convincingly strong approval of Dr Scheifele’s 
actions by the 2023 Annual General Meeting."
"– Dr Scheifele also played a key role in advising the 
Managing Board with regard to disciplined capital 
allocation."
"– At the same time, the Supervisory Board under 
Dr Scheifele’s chairmanship succeeded in further de-
veloping the company’s governance structure and 
the internal work of the Supervisory Board and align-
ing both with future issues."
"In the reporting year, for 
example, the Supervisory Board approved an adjust-
ed 2024+ Managing Board remuneration system that 
focuses on sustainability issues and reorganised the 
composition of the Managing Board to reflect the 
­
issues of the future."
"– When Dr  Scheifele was elected to the Supervisory 
Board in 2022, he already complied with the two-
year cooling-off period from his position on the 
­
Managing Board as recommended by the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
"– Nor does the Supervisory Board see any risk of an 
imbalance on the Supervisory Board."
"The other 
shareholder representatives are independent and 
generally recognised, prominent figures with relevant 
expertise and many years of industry experience and 
contribute extensively to the work of the Supervisory 
Board."
"– Furthermore, Dr Scheifele does not chair any Super-
visory Board committees."
"At least 50% of the share-
holder representatives on all committees are in­
dependent."
"According to the assessment of the 
shareholder representatives on the Supervisory 
Board, all shareholder representatives can currently 
be regarded as independent within the meaning of 
the German Corporate Governance Code."
"– There are no other former members of the Managing 
Board on the Supervisory Board."
"Dr  Scheifele has also taken the concerns of some 
shareholders regarding the number of his external 
mandates seriously."
"He has informed the Supervisory 
Board that he will resign from his positions as Chairman 
of the Supervisory Board of Verlagsgruppe Georg von 
Holtzbrinck GmbH as of the end of 24 April 2024 and 
as a member of the Supervisory Board of Springer 
­
Nature AG & Co."
"KGaA as of the end of 23 April 2024, 
before Heidelberg Materials AG’s Annual General Meet-
ing."
"As a result, the Supervisory Board is convinced 
that Dr Scheifele will have sufficient time for his man-
date at Heidelberg Materials AG."
"Based on the recommendation of its Nomination Com-
mittee, the Supervisory Board will thus propose to the 
Annual General Meeting that Dr Scheifele be re-elected 
to the Supervisory Board as a shareholder representa-
tive."
"There is still no intention for Dr Scheifele to chair a 
committee."
"In order to fulfil the Supervisory Board’s self-imposed 
requirement of majority independence, Professor 
Dr Marion Weissenberger-Eibl will no longer be availa-
ble as a candidate for the Supervisory Board at the 
2024 Annual General Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board 
will propose to the Annual General Meeting that 
Mr Gunnar Groebler be elected as her successor."
"Corporate Governance
The declaration of compliance in the reporting year 
was submitted by the Managing Board on 13 January 
2023 and by the Supervisory Board on 30 January 
2023."
"The declaration of compliance for the current 
­
financial year was submitted by the Managing Board 
on 19 January 2024 and by the Supervisory Board on 
30 January 2024."
"The complete text can be found in 
the Declaration of compliance section pursuant to 
section 161 of the AktG in the Corporate Governance 
statement chapter."
"The current declaration of compli-
ance is made permanently available on the company’s 
website."
"Regarding its own composi-
tion, it implements the diversity targets stated in the 
Code and the profile of skills for the Supervisory Board 
adopted on 23 March 2022."
"Detailed information on 
this topic can be found in the Corporate Governance 
statement chapter."
"In March 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to set 
the target figure for the proportion of women on the 
Managing Board to at least one woman for the period 
from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025."
"With Dr Nicola Kimm 
as a member of the Managing Board since 1 September 
2021, this target was achieved ahead of schedule."
"The 
Supervisory Board also welcomes and supports the 
Managing Board’s target of further increasing the pro-
portion of women in management positions in the first 
and second leadership levels below the Managing 
Board."
"For details, please refer to the  Corporate Gov-
ernance statement chapter."
"With regard to the remuneration for the members of 
the Managing Board for the 2023 financial year, specif-
ics are included in the Remuneration report chapter 
to avoid repetition."
"A description of the adjusted ver-
sion of the Managing Board remuneration system, ap-
plicable from 1 January 2021, can also be found here."
"Having been commissioned to do so by the company’s 
Supervisory Board, the auditor also carried out the vol-
untary audit of the correctness of the content of the 
2023 remuneration report and issued an unqualified 
audit opinion."
"The Supervisory Board examined the re-
muneration report in detail in the presence of the audi-
tor and approved the report together with the Manag-
ing Board."
"The 2023 remuneration report will be 
submitted to the 2024 Annual General Meeting for ap-
proval and will be available on the company’s website 
for ten years."
"On 13 November 2023, the Supervisory Board adopted 
a revised 2024+ Managing Board remuneration sys-
tem, which it will submit to the 2024 Annual General 
Meeting for approval."
"The members of the Supervisory Board are themselves 
responsible for obtaining the training required for their 
tasks and are supported by the company in this re-
spect."
"The company also offers specific training ses-
sions – sometimes with external support – for members 
of the Supervisory Board, most recently in November 
2023."
"These training courses cover topics that are par-
ticularly relevant to the company and the work of the 
Supervisory Board – for example, with regard to legal 
changes, the selection of suitable investment projects, 
and, most recently, sustainability within the company."
"In addition, the Managing Board reports on corporate 
governance at Heidelberg Materials also on behalf of 
the Supervisory Board in the Corporate Governance

"The an-
nual financial statements of Heidelberg Materials AG, 
the consolidated financial statements as at 31 Decem-

gagement on the non-financial statement (sections 
289b and 315b of the HGB) contained in the combined 
management report on behalf of the Supervisory 
Board."
"In this respect, the Supervisory Board exercised 
the legal right to commission an external review of the 
content of the non-financial statement."

statements together with the reading copies of the 
­
auditors’ reports were sent in advance to the members 
of the Supervisory Board."
"At first, the Audit Committee 
dealt intensively with the financial statements docu-

tee had the auditor report on the effectiveness of the 
internal control and early risk identification system in 
relation to accounting, whereby the auditor stated that 
he had not found any significant weaknesses in this re-
gard."
"Against this background and after its own con-
sideration, the Audit Committee determined that the 
internal control system, the internal audit system, and 
the risk management system, including the early risk 
identification system, meet the requirements to be 
placed on them."
"The Supervisory Board shares the 
opinion of the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of 
these systems."
"Then, the Supervisory Board discussed

the Audit Committee and the results of its own audit 
correspond fully to the results of the auditor."

the final results of this audit, the Supervisory Board 
also raised no objections."

We are aware that tax revenues are an important cor-
nerstone for financing government investments and 
expenditure and therefore also for social cohesion in

is essential that we comply with tax laws and regula-
tions and pay taxes in the countries where we are ac-
tive and generate profits."

basis for the implementation of our sustainable busi-
ness activities."
"It is closely linked to our Group strategy

ues, which set out the values and standards that guide 
our actions with respect to taxation."

strategies for informing and involving our stakeholders."
"In order to successfully implement these strategies at 
the respective locations, we support the corresponding 
projects with numerous communication measures and 
participation formats."
"Relations with local stakeholders
Our quarries and plants are often situated near cities 
and communities."
"We are in regular contact with the 
respective local communities, government agencies, 
and local organisations and inform them about our ac-
tivities and planned projects at the locations at an ear-
ly stage."
"Plant or site management teams are general-
ly responsible for such stakeholder relationships."
"Along 
with personal discussions, we use a variety of other 
means of communication to keep local people and or-
ganisations informed and enter into dialogue with 
them – ranging from traditional newsletters and guide-
lines to social media and a variety of public participa-
tion concepts."
"We aim to reconcile the interests of the company with 
those of the local communities."
"The concerns of our 
local stakeholders vary from location to location."
"In 
general, they range from simple visit enquiries and ap-
peals for us to support projects and sports, cultural, 
and educational institutions, all the way through to in-
formation requests."
"Stakeholders also raise reserva-
tions regarding imminent modernisation and expansion 
measures."
"In the course of our business activities, 
there may also be occasional controversies in the vicin-
ity of our locations relating to such topics as emissions, 
(increased) truck traffic, or noise."
"We respond prompt-
ly to complaints and focus on providing information in 
order to address uncertainties and misgivings."
"We also 
involve local stakeholders at an early stage when plan-
ning investment projects, such as by setting up contact 
offices and holding information and discussion events."
"We use community engagement plans to structure our 
dialogue with local stakeholders."
"Further information 
on how we involve local communities can be found in 
the Social responsibility chapter."
"Stakeholder dialogue at a national and 
international level
Heidelberg Materials is involved in a large number of 
associations and cross-sectoral initiatives that repre-
sent their members’ interests vis-à-vis governments, 
businesses, and the public."
"This engagement also pro-
motes an exchange with other companies and organi-
sations regarding current issues."
"An important case in 
point is the question of how the industrial transforma-
tion to net zero can be successfully implemented and 
accelerated in combination with ambitious environ-
mental protection measures."
"We are also rep-
resented in the respective international and European 
umbrella organisations, either through our member-
ships in various national associations or as direct 
members."
"Through numer-
ous talks, events, presentations, and panel discussions 
in 2023, we were thus able to demonstrate in person 
once again how Heidelberg Materials, as one of the 
world’s leading building materials companies, can make 
an active contribution to solving current challenges."
"In particular, we advocate for a coherent and support-
ive framework for the decarbonisation of the industrial 
sector."
"We believe that, in addition to ambitious carbon 
pricing, this also encompasses the expansion of renew-
able energies under economically viable conditions and 
improved access to alternative fuels, including waste-
based biomass."
"We support the implementation of re-
liable frameworks for CCUS and the associated devel-
opment of infrastructure for the transport and storage 
of CO2."
"We also call for solutions to support a closed-
loop circular economy, such as the targeted processing 
and reuse of construction and demolition waste."
"In 
order to create a market for low-emission products, we 
are in favour of creating green lead markets and devel-
oping the necessary internationally compatible stand-
ards."
"We also stress the importance of state funding, 
which large-scale CCUS projects in particular require 
during a transition period, as many projects are not yet 
economically viable at this stage of the transformation."
"We have established structures and policies to ensure 
that our positions are consistent with those of the in-
dustry associations in which we are involved."
"In par-
ticular, we want to guarantee that the positions and 
actions of industry associations are in line with interna-
tional and European climate protection agreements 
and the targets set out in our Sustainability Commit-
ments 2030."
"We therefore publish an annual ­
Climate 
Advocacy and Association Review."
"Our lobbying 
­
activities represent the positions that Heidelberg 
Materials takes in public."
"Dialogue with non-governmental organi-
sations
We value and maintain dialogue with non-governmen-
tal organisations (NGOs)."
"As a company, we believe 
that this contributes to good decision-making on both 
sides in a complex world."
"As a matter of principle, we respond in a transparent 
manner to all requests from NGOs and interest groups."
"We take critical questions as opportunities to inform 
people about our sustainability activities and enter into 
dialogue."

"The analysis helps us to identify issues and develop-
ments that are important for our business success, or 
could prove to be important in future, and to assess our 
impact on the environment and society."
"In the 2023 financial year, we carried out an internal 
validation of the material topics identified in 2022."
"As 
part of this process, the Sustainability Reporting Steer-
ing Committee and other relevant departments exam-
ined four key validation questions."
"The Steering Com-
mittee, consisting of the Sustainability, Finance, and 
Digitalisation departments, was established in 2022 
and serves as a decision-making body for all issues 
relating to sustainability reporting."
"The validation 
questions cover, for example, the effects of acquisi-
tions that could lead to the expansion of business acti­
vities or the impact of significant changes at key sup-
pliers or in the supply chain."
"The answers to these 
questions did not reveal any significant changes or 
findings that would have made it necessary to adjust 
the material topics."
"The Steering Committee has thus 
reconfirmed the material topics for 2023."

Note: The questions were answered on a scale from 0 (no impact) to 5 (very strong impact)."
The topics are listed in alphabetical order.
"The ESG 
coordinators in our Group countries were also involved."
"The methodology employed in the analysis follows the 
general principle of double materiality."
"This approach 
incorporates both the impact of sustainability topics 
on business relevance and the impact of entrepreneur-
ial activity on the environment and society."
"The 12 material sustain-
ability topics are highlighted in the diagram on page 35."
"Investing in a more sustainable future
With the aim of achieving the targets set out in our 
Sustainability 
Commitments 
2030, 
we 
invested 
€539 million in property, plant and equipment in the 
2023 financial year to improve our sustainability per-
formance."
"The focus is on our strategically important 
topics, such as the circular economy and reducing CO2 
emissions (see section Investments)."
"Challenges like climate change and resource limitations mean that the pro-
duction and use of heavy building materials must evolve."
"At Heidelberg Materials, we 
are transforming our business to address these challenges and placing social con-
siderations at the core of what we do alongside sustainable corporate governance 
and environmental responsibility."
"Our Sustainability Commitments 2030 support our vision to build a more sustain-
able future."
"They embrace the following topic areas: Net Zero, Circular & Resilient, 
Safe & Inclusive, and Nature Positive."
We drive the decarbonisation of our sector and provide low-carbon products.
We drive circularity to reduce and reuse materials and natural resources.
"We place the health and wellbeing of employees, communities, and suppliers 
at the core of our business operations."
"
We contribute to a nature positive world through our industry-leading biodiver-
sity programme and sustainable water management."
We continuously monitor the achievement of our sustainability commitments.

"At the beginning of 2023, the Science Based 
Targets initiative (SBTi) validated Heidelberg Materials’ 
2030 CO2 reduction targets in accordance with its 
1.5 °C roadmap for the cement industry."
"Our commit-
ments to the SBTi are consistent with our stated target 
to reduce specific net CO2 emissions to 400  kg per 
tonne of cementitious material by 2030."
"We are also working hard to achieve net zero by 2050 
at the latest."
"In doing so, we are taking the entire value 
chain into account, from raw materials to reuse."
"We 
submitted our net-zero target to SBTi for validation in 
February 2024."
"To underscore the strategic relevance of our climate 
protection targets, the reduction of Heidelberg 
Materials’ CO2 emissions has been anchored in the re-
muneration of the Managing Board and the majority of 
bonus-eligible employees worldwide."
"Focus on CO2 reduction and circularity
Our reduction strategy is based on solid measures at 
plant and product levels, the implementation of which 
is well underway."
"In the cement industry, however, we 
are faced with the challenge that around two thirds of 
direct emissions come from the calcination of lime-
stone into cement clinker during the burning process in 
the cement kiln."
"These process emissions have been 
unavoidable up to now."
"Where conventional solutions 
fail, we rely on innovation and key technologies, such 
as the capture of CO2 from the production process."
Concrete is essential for the infrastructure of the future.
"It is durable, fully recyclable, and produced locally."
"­
Given its resistance to extreme weather events such as 
floods and severe storms, it plays an important role in 
mitigating climate change."
"Since concrete is also inex-
pensive to manufacture, it can provide even emerging 
countries with a solid infrastructure at a reasonable 
cost."
"Nevertheless, the production of cement, the “binder” in 
concrete, is very CO2-intensive."
"Therefore, the building 
materials industry is one of the biggest producers of 
carbon dioxide emissions."
"As a technology leader, we 
are playing a pioneering role in the decarbonisation of 
our industry and doing our part to limit the rise in 
worldwide temperature to below 1.5 °C."
"However, during the global stocktake at the 28th UN 
Climate Change Conference in December 2023, it was 
noted that the current trajectory of emission reduction 
pathways is not on track to meet the targets of the 
Paris Agreement."
"Therefore, further action will be need-
ed to keep the 1.5 °C target within reach and tackle the 
climate crisis."
"Reducing our own CO2 emissions is our biggest lever in 
the fight against climate change."
"At Heidelberg Materials, we laid the foundations 
at an early stage with our pioneering Brevik CCS pro-
ject."
"The world’s first industrial-scale carbon capture 
facility at a cement plant is currently under construc-
tion in Brevik, Norway."
"Once it is operational, we will be able to offer our 
customers in Europe the world’s first carbon cap-
tured net-zero cement, which we launched under the 
new evoZero® brand at the end of 2023."
evoZero will be available in two versions.
"evoZero 
Carbon Captured Brevik will be delivered directly 
from Brevik, achieving its net-zero carbon footprint 
over its entire life cycle."
"Customers from other Euro-
pean countries can opt for evoZero Carbon Cap-
tured, which will be delivered from nearby plants, with 
the CO2 savings realised in Brevik being taken into 
­
account."
"evoZero Carbon Captured features a 
­
net-zero carbon footprint upon delivery."
"The carbon capture attributes are transparent and 
traceable."
"Using blockchain technology, we ensure 
that each tonne of captured CO2 is only accounted for 
once."
"When purchasing evoZero, a precisely verifia-
ble amount of CO2 savings is assigned to the prod-
uct."
"Based on well-established principles such as 
mass-balancing and book-and-­
claim, the carbon 
capture and emission ac­
coun­
ting methodology has 
been reviewed by a third-party verifier."
"Since CCS technology does not change the chemi-
cal composition and performance of the cement, 
evoZero is suitable for all kinds of applications."
"We 
will therefore be able to offer our entire local ­
cement 
portfolio as evoZero."
"www.evozero.com
We are optimising the product mix, making process 
improvements such as maximising the use of alterna-
tive fuels and switching to electricity from renewable 
energy sources, and investing in plant efficiency."
"Innovative carbon capture, utilisation, and storage 
(CCUS) technologies are a key component of our cli-
mate strategy."
"With Heidelberg Materials’ already 
launched CCUS projects alone, we aim to cut our car-
bon emissions by 10  million tonnes cumulatively by 
2030."
"Through our investments towards a circular economy, 
we will also make a decisive contribution to the long-
term reduction of CO2 emissions."
"Among other things, 
we are working intensively on innovative processes for 
the specific processing of concrete parts, their recar-
bonisation, and their reuse in concrete as a building ma-
terial."
"In addition to our own production operations, we also 
consider the supply chain when it comes to reducing 
our CO2 emissions (see chapter Responsible procure-
ment)."
"By joining the First Movers Coalition, we are 
also recognising our responsibility as a purchaser of 
green products and services."

"Grant agreements with the EU Innovation 
Fund were successfully concluded in 2023 for two 
Heidelberg Materials CCUS projects."
"The EU Innovation Fund focuses on flagship projects 
with European added value that lead to significant 
emission reductions."
"In January 2023, a grant 
agreement was signed in Brussels for Heidelberg 
Materials’ innovative ANRAV CCUS project, which 
aims to not only decarbonise our company in Bul-
garia, but also provide opportunities for the whole 
region."
"In 2023, we also signed the GeZero funding 
agreement for the establishment of an innovative 
CCS value chain at the Geseke location in Germany."
"In both cases, the funding complements significant 
own investments by Heidelberg Materials."
"The successful conclusion of both funding agree-
ments demonstrates the relevance of the projects 
for the decarbonisation of our sector, and the trust 
that European authorities place in our approach."
"Once initiatives such as ANRAV and GeZero start

"3
 
Scope 3: All other indirect emissions from a company’s

company."
"At Heidelberg Materials, these are: pur-
chased materials and fuels (purchased clinker, raw ma-
terials, cement constituents, cement), upstream and 
downstream transportation (by truck, rail, vessel), use 
of sold products and investments."
"Gross emissions are all direct GHG emissions ex-
cluding the emissions from pure biomass and the 
biogenic carbon content of mixed fuels and minus 
the emissions from on-site power production."
"Net emissions equal gross emissions minus 
emissions from alternative fossil fuels and 
non-biogenic content of mixed fuels and minus 
emissions for external heat transfer."
"Heidelberg Materials 
has been analysing climate-related opportunities and 
risks for many years, including in the context of Task 
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
reporting."
"In this process, we differentiate between the 
physical impacts of climate change and the impacts 
resulting from the transformation of the economy to-
wards a low-carbon model (transition risks)."
"We use 
climate scenarios for this purpose."
"Climate scenarios are models or representations of fu-
ture climatic developments based on various assump-
tions and parameters."
"They are used to investigate 
possible developments of the climate system and to 
predict their impacts on the environment, society, and 
the economy."
"Climate scenarios facilitate a better un-
derstanding of the risks and opportunities of climate 
change and make it possible to plan policy decisions as 
well as adaptation and mitigation strategies."
"They pro-
vide insights into possible changes in temperature and 
precipitation, sea level rise, extreme weather events, 
and other climate-related trends that are critical when 
it comes to planning and developing strategies to man-
age climate change."
"Climate scenarios have been steadily refined by climate 
scientists in recent decades."
"As a result, Heidelberg 
Materials switched from Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCP) scenarios to Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways (SSP) scenarios in 2023."
"SSP scenarios focus 
on global social, demographic, and economic changes."
"SSP1 is based on achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C 
target, SSP2 is a moderate scenario, and SSP5 is a sce-
nario based on the continued use of fossil fuels."
"Physical risks
Physical climate risks are divided into acute and chron-
ic risks."
"While acute risks arise from extreme weather 
events, for example, chronic risks develop gradually, 
such as the rise in average temperatures."
"There are significant geographical variations in climate 
risks within the Group countries."
"The impact of extreme 
weather scenarios, such as floods or droughts, can 
lead to damage to our production sites, interrupt the 
supply to our customers, or have adverse effects on 
the supply of upstream products to our operating units."
"Based on the SSP scenarios, we analysed our global 
exposure to material climate risks and assessed them 
over different time periods using a third-party tool."
"Based on the proportion of assets that are particularly 
exposed to the respective risks, we have classified the 
risks as low, medium, and high."
"Missing dots in the 
graph indicate that no specific assessment is available."
"Precipitation stress and heat stress are thus among the 
principal chronic climate risks, while flooding is the 
most significant acute risk."
"For the period up to 2030, 
the picture remains largely unchanged, but the risk ex-
posure to drought increases significantly."
"In terms of 
drought stress, for example, there are significant differ-
ences between the moderate SSP2 scenario and the 
SSP5 scenario, which is based on the continued use of 
fossil fuels."
"The modelling for SSP5 indicates that our 
risk exposure would double."
"Similar developments 
would also be forecast for other chronic climate risks 
such as heat stress and precipitation stress."
"According 
to the scenarios, our locations in Asia and Africa in par-
ticular would suffer from drought and heat if green-
house gas concentrations increase, while more north-
erly regions, such as North America and Europe, would 
be more severely affected by precipitation stress."
"If we analyse the periods up to 2040 and 2050 for 
acute risks such as tropical cyclones and river flooding, 
these remain largely stable."
"While the former occur 
naturally in Africa, Asia, and Australia in particular, the 
risk of flooding tends to affect the northern hemi-
sphere."
"The relative stability of the acute risks also re-
veals that the effects of climate change are already 
impacting us today."
"Heat stress can 
have a serious impact on the health of employees."
"Risk 
mitigation measures are therefore already being taken, 
such as reorganising shifts to minimise heat stress and 
giving employees training on risks and how to cope 
with heat."
"The overview of our locations in the graph is 
an abstract representation."
"Transition risks
Transition risks comprise the impacts arising from the 
transition – or lack of transition – to a more climate-­
friendly economy and society."
"These risks are divided 
into different categories, such as policy and legal, mar-
ket, and reputational risks."
"The magnitude and nature 
of the risks for Heidelberg Materials also depend on 
future developments and can be analysed using the 
above-mentioned SSP scenarios, as described below."
"The scenarios and assessments described do not rep-
resent conclusive findings for Heidelberg Materials."
"The 
scenario analysis is based on current assumptions 
that may or may not materialise."
"The scenarios may be 
influenced by additional factors that go beyond the as-
sumptions taken into consideration."
"Many of the fac-
tors listed are already actively managed by Heidelberg 
Materials in order to strengthen the company’s resil-
ience."
"These include our efforts to increase resource 
efficiency and investments in circularity, the use of re-
newable energies, and, in particular, our projects for 
carbon capture, utilisation, and storage."
"You can find 
out more about our contribution to combatting climate 
change in the ­
chapters Building a net-zero future, 
Building a ­
circular & resilient future, and Our CCUS 
project portfolio."
"Management of the global 
commons slowly improves, education and health investments 
accelerate the demographic transition, and the emphasis on 
economic growth shifts towards a broader emphasis on human 
well-being."
"Consumption is increasingly oriented towards low 
material and energy consumption."
"Greenhouse gas emissions 
will decrease radically by 2030 and then decline significantly by 
the end of the 21st century."
"Internationally coordinated adapta-
tion mechanisms exist to balance the diverse global impacts on 
individual regions."
"Description: The trend to date (based on 2022) continues into 
the future."
"Development and income growth proceed unevenly, 
with some countries making relatively good progress while oth-
ers fall short of expectations."
"Greenhouse gas emissions peak 
around 2040 and will be halved by the end of the 21st century."
"The lack of international cooperation means that there is no ef-
fective mechanism for managing loss and damage caused by the 
effects of climate change."
"Countries can only protect themselves 
from potentially existential risks by supporting each other."
"Glob-
al population growth is moderate and levels off in the second 
half of the century."
"Description: Social and economic development is based on the 
increased exploitation of fossil fuel resources with the adoption 
of energy-intensive lifestyles worldwide."
"There is little accept-
ance of renewable energies."
"The global economy grows rapidly, 
and population growth also peaks."
"This leads to a sharp increase 
in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and the 
rise will continue until the end of the 21st century."
"The climatic 
changes are very severe."
"An effective mechanism for managing 
climate-related risks beyond the limits of adaptation enables 
many countries to (at least partially) implement the necessary 
and often transformative adaptation measures."
"Internationally 
coordinated compensation mechanisms exist for loss and dam-
age caused by climate change for which proactive adaptation 
measures are no longer effective."
"Impact: Under the SSP1 climate scenario, Heidelberg Materials 
would be confronted with a changing business environment char-
acterised by tighter regulations such as stricter controls on CO2, 
a focus on sustainability, and changing consumer preferences."
"To be successful in this scenario, Heidelberg Materials needs to 
invest in sustainable technologies such as CCUS."
"The use of re-
sources must be optimised across the Group, and the Group’s 
own emissions must be reduced as quickly as possible."
"Products 
and services need to be adapted with a view to sustainability 
and circularity in order to meet the demands of a more inclusive 
and environmentally aware market."
"If this adaptation process is 
successful, the Group stands to gain a competitive advantage, 
including access to new and emerging markets."
"At the same 
time, its vulnerability to future price increases for fossil fuels and 
carbon allowances will decrease, which also has the potential to 
reduce operating costs."
"In addition, Heidelberg Materials should 
further strengthen its reputation with regard to sustainability 
and social responsibility through credible measures."
"Impact: The SSP2 climate scenario anticipates a future of slow 
progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 
environmental degradation, and income inequality."
"The compa-
ny’s resilience will need to be further strengthened in the face of 
these significant challenges."
"The scenario requires Heidelberg 
Materials to navigate a challenging social and competitive en-
vironment characterised by evolving regulations, resource scar-
city, and changing market demand for sustainable products."
"Changing political conditions may lead to increased operating 
costs and even the shutdown of plants."
"Resource efficiency, on 
the other hand, has the potential to reduce operating costs."
"Increased revenue from access to new and emerging markets 
are offset by lost revenue due to falling demand for conventional 
products."
"Adaptation and innovation in terms of CO2 reduction 
and circularity, for example, will be key to Heidelberg Materials’ 
survival and ability to unlock competitive advantages."
"Impact: The SSP5 climate scenario’s impacts on Heidelberg 
Materials include risks to business operations due to extreme 
weather events and changing weather patterns."
"Changing polit-
ical conditions may lead to increased operating costs and even 
the shutdown of plants."
"Lower resource efficiency also contrib-
utes to higher operating costs."
"Furthermore, the company is 
highly vulnerable to price increases for fossil fuels and carbon 
allowances."
"Acting sustainably and investing in the resilience of 
its locations would help to mitigate these risks and ensure the 
long-term profitability of the company."
"The scenario would thus 
require Heidelberg Materials to adapt to a changing regulatory 
and market landscape and bring its own products and services 
in line with sustainability criteria."
"This will require corresponding 
investments, but will be necessary in order to continue to gain 
acceptance among customers and investors and potentially 
bring about broader systemic changes."

"Circularity
Circularity is the 
compatibility of a

material flow (e."
"­
materials or products) 
with the principle of 
circular economy."
"Concrete is fully recyclable – which means 
our industry can have a big impact."
"Through resource 
efficiency, co-processing of waste products, and con-
crete recycling, we want to contribute to a functioning 
circular economy."
"Heidelberg Materials is strengthening circularity along 
the entire value chain."
"We also see the increasing im-
portance of resource efficiency and closed material 
cycles as an opportunity to develop new business mod-
els and drive sales of sustainable products."
"Through 
our subsidiaries, we are already active in the recycling 
business in several countries and are working on the 
targeted processing of concrete components, as well 
as their recarbonation and reuse in concrete as a build-
ing material."
"As part of this, we are investigating the 
use and reuse of all rock fractions that are produced in 
the recycling process."
"By 2030, we want to offer circular alternatives for 50% 
of our concrete products."
"This will allow us to conserve 
virgin resources and meet our customers’ increasing 
demand for sustainable building materials in the future."
"Building material recovery and concrete recycling will 
make a significant contribution here and are crucial to 
us achieving our sustainability targets."
"Using recycled materials to conserve 
resources
Demolition concrete is still partly disposed of at landfill 
sites today or is often used in road construction for 
compaction or as a frost protection layer."
"This does 
not do justice to the building material’s value-adding 
potential or its complex, energy-intensive production 
process."
More can be achieved through recycling.
"On the one hand, this saves primary raw materials such 
as sand and gravel, which are used as aggregates in 
the production of concrete."
"And on the other hand, the 
fine materials obtained when breaking up and sorting 
waste concrete can be separated off as so-called 
­
cement paste (recycled concrete paste, RCP), carbona­
ted, and then returned to cement production as an 
­
alternative cementitious raw or filler material."
"The Heidelberg Materials team in North America works 
closely with our customer Rainier Asphalt in Redmond, 
Washington."
"Rainier is one of only a few companies in 
the region that favour concrete deliveries in volumet-
ric vehicles."
"Volumetric trucks allow concrete to be 
mixed and poured directly at the construction site in 
the quantities actually required, which means that no 
concrete waste is produced."
"As a pioneer in the local market, Rainier also carries 
out concrete work and deliveries using 100% recycled 
aggregates – produced by Heidelberg Materials."
"Ini-
tial trials have shown that the concrete produced us-
ing recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) precisely ful-
fils the performance requirements and specifications 
demanded by the work in question."
"The cooperation 
between the two partners is therefore making a two-
fold contribution to the circular economy."
"Concrete recycling
A twofold contribution to the 
­
circular economy
Recovery of all concrete components
Heidelberg Materials is working intensively on innova-
tive methods for processing, reprocessing, and return-
ing demolition concrete to the construction cycle as a 
valuable material."
"The opportunities afforded by inno-
vation in this area are great."
"In line with the European 
Union’s circular economy targets, Heidelberg Materials 
is also involved in projects researching the reuse and 
recarbonation of recycled building materials."
"For example, 
paving stones can be produced that absorb an in-
creased amount of CO2 from the environment."
"As part of the innovative ReConcrete-360° process 
concept, waste concrete is crushed and sorted almost 
homogeneously into its components to obtain not only 
sand and gravel but also hardened cement paste."
"The 
latter can be reused as a valuable low-carbon raw ma-
terial in clinker and cement production, replacing nat-
ural limestone as a raw material – in support of circu-
larity."
"In addition, the hardened cement paste can 
absorb and permanently bind CO2, thus acting as a 
carbon sink."
"With ReConcrete-360°, we have been able 
to show on a pilot scale that concrete can be fully re-
cycled without loss of quality through selective pro-
cessing of its individual components."
"This innovative 
concept, which received the German Innovation Award 
for Climate and Environment in 2022, is now being used 
on a large scale at our plant in Poland."

We are also examining the use of recycled material in 
connection with 3D printing."
"New formulations that use 
recycled aggregates are currently being investigated in 
our Research and Development department."
"Alternative fuels 
Many by-products from other industries serve as valu-
able raw materials for Heidelberg Materials."
"We use 
these resources as alternatives to finite natural raw 
materials and fossil fuels in the production of cement."
"In this way, we are helping to conserve resources and 
solve the problems associated with waste disposal 
faced by municipalities and industrial companies near 
our plants."
"At the same time, these efforts are also re-
ducing our CO2 emissions."
"We want to increase the pro-
portion of alternative fuels in our fuel mix to 45% by 
2030."
"In 2023, the figure was 29.9%."
"The waste-based 
biomass used, which accounted for around 13% of the 
fuel mix in 2023, makes a special contribution here, as 
it is considered climate-neutral under European legis-
lation."
"By 2030, we intend to raise this figure to 20%."
"Alternative fuels are generally waste that either cannot 
be recycled in full and would therefore be uneconomical 
to recycle or can only be incinerated for energy recov-
ery to ensure safe disposal."
"In this scenario, co-pro-
cessing in clinker kilns for thermal energy recovery of-
fers a practical alternative, as it not only uses the 
waste’s calorific value but also embeds its mineral 
components into the clinker as raw material."
"The waste 
is co-processed without any residue in a burning pro-
cess that meets the same strict emission standards as 
those set for waste incineration plants."
"About 90% of 
our cement plants have environmental management 
systems."
"As such, they are subject to regular internal 
and external audits, which cover toxic emissions and 
hazardous substances as well as waste."
"
 
Non-financial statement
Reuse in cement plants has proved to be a safe means 
of recovery, particularly for various types of hazardous 
waste."
"The high temperatures of over 1,450 °C and the 
long incineration period in the kilns ensure that all 
harmful components are completely destroyed."
"This 
has been confirmed by measurements taken by inde-
pendent state-certified institutes."
"Waste
Active waste management and the associated reduc-
tion of environmental pollution are two core objectives 
of a circular economy."
"Our main focus in waste man-
agement is on minimising production waste and reus-
ing by-products from the production process in expe-
dient ways."
"For example, kiln dust that is a by-product 
of clinker production is generally reused as an alterna-
tive raw material in the production of certain types of 
cement."
"This dust has to be removed from the kiln sys-
tems at several facilities in order to prevent disruptions 
to proper kiln operations."
"In some exceptional cases, 
the locally produced cement type portfolio prevents us 
from fully recycling the dust."
"A second possibility for us 
is to use the kiln dust as a raw material for the produc-
tion of special concretes."
"If no other option is available, 
it can be deposited in underground landfill sites in a 
controlled process."
"The local operating permit at each 
plant specifies the allowable amount of process-relat-
ed waste products and how they are to be used."
"Our R & D department regularly checks the by-products 
arising from production for their suitability for various 
applications, either in our own operations – as cemen-
titious material, for example – or in the processes of 
industry partners."
"Excess concrete is also generally reused in our plants: 
either as fresh concrete or cured in the form of building 
elements, which are then used, for example, to secure 
construction sites."
"If concrete cannot be reused fresh, 
it is still possible to crush the completely recyclable 
concrete and return it to the production cycle."
"With dig-
ital solutions such as our OnSite app, we also support 
our customers in demand planning and ordering to 
avoid overproduction in the first place."

We work intensively to develop and produce innovative, 
environmentally and socially responsible products that 
meet the highest quality standards over their entire life 
cycle."
"Through resource efficiency, co-processing of 
waste products, and concrete recycling, we want to 
contribute to a circular economy."
"We aim to generate half of our Group revenue from 
sustainable products by 2030 1)."
"This includes products 
that stand out by making a special contribution to cir-
cularity and the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"1)	 Revenue that we allocate here to our sustainable products is not aligned with 
the definitions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"Strong local, sustainable, and low-carbon 
product portfolio
At the end of 2023, we launched our evoZero® product 
brand for the world’s first carbon captured net-zero ce-
ment (see section evoZero)."
"Under another newly cre-
ated product brand, evoBuild®, we are applying inter-
nationally harmonised and stringent criteria to our 
sustainable products."
"The evoBuild classification is 
based on our sustainability strategy and significantly 
increases transparency towards customers and stake-
holders."
"evoBuild products will be available in all busi-
ness lines and will be either low-carbon (cement and 
concrete), circular (concrete, aggregates), or both."
"Concretes with improved carbon footprints
To improve the carbon footprint of our concrete prod-
ucts based on Portland cement, we use what are known 
as additives."
"These are alternative materials such as 
blast furnace slag and fly ash that are produced during 
the manufacture of pig iron or when electricity is gen-
erated from coal in steel mills and coal-fired power 
plants."
"They serve as source materials for composite 
cements, in which Portland cement clinker is partially 
replaced."
"We can also reduce the footprint of our prod-
ucts by using finely ground limestone in our cement and 
by creating new capacities to produce calcined clay for 
partial clinker substitution."
"Plants for the production of 
calcined clays are under construction in France and 
Ghana, and the suitability of further locations is being 
examined."
"In addition, we have been working for sev-
eral years on the development of alternative binders 
with the aim of enabling the use of alternatives to con-
ventional clinker in certain applications."
"Concrete containing recycled aggregates 
We offer concrete solutions containing varying propor-
tions of recycled aggregates in all Group countries."
This translates to threshold values of ≤ 552 kg CO2/t for cementitious material and ≤ 5.5 kg CO2/m³/MPa for ready-mixed concrete.

When 3D printing with concrete, a concrete printer 
builds up the material layer by layer."
"The printer only 
applies the material where it is actually needed."
"This 
means that overlapping areas, which occur repeat-
edly on ordinary construction sites, can be avoided – 
and up to 70% less material is required for the fin-
ished building."
"In spring 2023, a truly high-tech material developed 
specifically for printing buildings by our R&D teams 
was used in the construction of Europe’s largest 
3D-printed building to date, located in Heidelberg."
"Between 31 March and 17 July 2023, it took only 
around 170  printing hours to create Heidelberg-­
based KRAUSGRUPPE’s Wavehouse building, desig­
ned to house a data centre."
"Heidelberg Materials supplied exactly 333 tonnes of 
3D-printing concrete for the project."
"The mineral 
material contains a binder that is 100% recyclable 
and reduces CO2 emissions by around 55% com-
pared with a pure Portland cement."
"The product 
therefore also contributes to our target of offering 
circular alternatives for half of our concrete prod-
ucts worldwide by 2030."
"The 3D-printing concrete was used as early as 2020 
in Germany’s first 3D-printed residential buildings, 
located in Beckum and Wallenhausen."
"Since then, it 
has been further developed and its carbon footprint 
reduced even further."
"To ensure that the building 
material is produced locally and available flexibly, a 
production site has been set up in Germany over the 
past two years."
"Innovative building materials

fore such products can be introduced (see chapter 
Circular economy)."
"Innovative solutions using less material
Other innovative solutions reduce the amount of 
­
material needed, such as through precision engineering 
and the targeted use of material, or through the safe 
and cost-efficient renovation of infrastructure."
"Ultra- 
high-performance concretes (UHPCs), for example, are 
characterised by very high compressive strengths."
"That means they can be used to build concrete struc-
tures that are remarkable for their economical use of 
materials as well as their reduced weight and slim con-
struction."
"The use of UHPCs in building renovation also 
avoids CO2 that would otherwise be generated when 
the structure is demolished and rebuilt."
"3D concrete 
printing is highly resource efficient: because the ma­
terial is very precisely put only where it is actually need-
ed, less concrete is needed overall for this type of con-
struction."
"Over its life cycle, a build-
ing’s energy and carbon footprint can also be signifi-
cantly improved by using lightweight concrete as a fully 
recyclable insulation material or by implementing mo­
dern climate concepts using concrete."
"That is because

Safe & Inclusive – Building a safe and inclusive future
Diversity as a factor for success
As a leading global company, we are paving the way 
not only for a sustainable industry, but also for person-
al success stories."
"We foster an environment in which 
mutual trust, respect, and appreciation are coupled 
with space for creativity, pioneering spirit, and dedica-
tion."
"We are proud of the international composition of 
our staff from more than 50 countries who work at our 
locations and headquarters."
"Their diversity underpins 
the worldwide success of Heidelberg Materials."
"Employee satisfaction and empowerment is a central 
pillar of the actions we take as a company."
"Therefore, 
in addition to fair remuneration and flexible working 
models, we also count strengthening diversity, cohe-
sion, and individual qualification opportunities among 
our HR management principles."
"Respectful behaviour 
among co-workers, employee development, and a 
commitment to a lived feedback culture are essential 
for us."
"To help our employees reach their full potential, we ac-
tively promote the development of an inclusive culture 
at all levels of our organisation."
"Clearly signposted 
contact partners are available in the HR and Compli-
ance departments, the works council, and NOW (Net-
work of Women) to assist with any questions relating 
to discrimination."
"Employees can approach the rele-
vant people in confidence at any time, and they will 
follow up any reported incidents promptly and rigor-
ously."
"Employees can also use the anonymous report-
ing platform SpeakUp for this purpose."
"As signatories to the Diversity Charter, we have been 
publicly expressing our respect for diversity since 2013."
"Our annual, internal Diversity Week celebrates cultural 
diversity and active inclusion at Heidelberg Materials 
and aims to further strengthen our focus on diversity."
"Women in leadership positions
As a further step on the path to greater equality, 
Heidelberg Materials aims for women to hold 25% of 
leadership positions worldwide by 2030."
"The target for 
Germany is 27% in the first and second leadership lev-
els by 2027."
"To further increase the proportion of female profes-
sionals, we focus on the targeted recruitment, promo-
tion, and retention of women at all levels of the hierar-
chy."
"This includes identifying and actively promoting 
junior female staff, both via internal programmes and 
through cross-company mentoring in cooperation with 
other companies from the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan 
region."
"Our efforts are supported by ­
awareness-raising 
measures relating to equity within the company, as 
well as targeted mentoring and sponsorship by the 
Managing Board and senior management."
"The global Network of Women (NOW), which was 
founded in 2011, also ensures more internal networking 
and promotion."
"In addition to professional develop-
ment, the principal aim is to increase awareness 
throughout the company of the changing demands on 
working and living environments."
"Within the framework 
of Allies of NOW, male employees are also actively 
­
involved in promoting gender equality a Heidelberg 
Materials."
"Improving work-life balance 
In order to take societal changes into account, we en-
courage a good work-life balance through flexible 
working time models and mobile forms of work."
"At 
Heidelberg Materials, careers and alternative working 
models are not mutually exclusive."
"Job sharing, for ex-
ample, is one way of balancing the challenges of a 
management position with family life."
"With our interna-
tional workforce in mind, we also made it possible for 
our employees to work remotely in other European 
countries in 2023."
"We are currently evaluating the ex-
tent to which this will be possible on a permanent basis."
"Because of the small size of our locations, cooperation 
with external networks has proven beneficial, for ex-
ample in terms of children’s day care and holiday pro-
grammes or caring for family members."
"Employees 
benefit from having easy access to a professional and 
flexible network at reasonable costs."
"As part of our FIT 
for FAMILY initiative, we have also entered into coop-
eration with day-care centres for the location in 
Heidelberg, Germany."
"These arrangements mean we 
have our own quota of childcare places available to 
our employees."
"In Germany, we have created a matching 
model of contributions from the employer and the em-
ployees within the framework of the pension scheme."
"In countries without statutory retirement or health in-
surance, we support our employees at least in line with 
local practices."

"In this context, we offer numer-
ous health management and preventive care measures 
adapted to regional requirements, ranging from com-
munal sporting activities to vaccination programmes."
"Sports groups, courses, and our own gym at our head-
quarters support mental and physical health."
"Heidelberg Materials also provides flexible, bureaucra-
cy-free support for all employees facing professional 
or personal challenges as part of its Employee Assis-
tance Programme."
"External coaches, psychological 
support, and crisis intervention experts are available 
free of charge and on a confidential basis in the event 
of mental, financial, or legal problems."
"To ensure sustainable and flexible mobility for our em-
ployees, we also subsidise offers such as the 
Deutschlandticket, a monthly subscription ticket for 
public transport, and the JobRad bike leasing pro-
gramme."
"In this way, we help our employees to travel 
with zero emissions and at low cost in their everyday 
lives."
"Through trainee programmes, dual apprenticeship and 
study partnerships, specialist and managerial develop-
ment, and professional training, we make targeted in-
vestments to enable our employees to gain the best 
possible qualifications."
"By offering the option of inter-
national work assignments, we can also hold our own 
in the global labour market."
"Remuneration policy and working time 
regulation 
The remuneration systems at Heidelberg Materials are 
based on performance and results in accordance with 
the market standards for internationally operating 
companies in our sector."
"Alongside fixed remuneration 
governed by a collective agreement or an individual 
work contract, our employees receive variable remu-
neration elements based on their individual perfor-
mance and on corporate success."
"CO2 reduction is also 
anchored in our global remuneration systems: the full 
variable remuneration can only be achieved if both the 
financial targets and the sustainability target are met."
"This regulation applies to all members of the Managing 
Board and to the majority of bonus-eligible employees 
worldwide (see Renumeration report chapter)."
"We consciously aim to achieve a high variable element 
as part of the total remuneration of our managers in 
order to directly reflect the connection between per-
sonal performance and corporate success."
"Collective 
regulations apply to more than half of the Group’s em-
ployees."
"The employees in our foreign subsidiaries ben-
efit from attractive remuneration systems that cor­
respond to the respective local market conditions."
"Our working time regulations comply with the legal re-
quirements in effect at our respective locations."
"We 
promote adherence to these regulations by means of 
our whistle-blower system SpeakUp, which employees 
can use to individually report possible violations (pas-
sive monitoring)."
"To enable flexible working time op-
tions, we offer models such as flexitime, working time 
accounts, part-time work, and leaves of absence, for 
example in the form of a sabbatical, to our employees 
in many countries."
"Older employees also have the op-
tion of switching to partial retirement."

Employment and co-determination 
Employee co-determination has always been of great 
importance to us."
"Statutory, collective bargaining, and 
company regulations are implemented jointly in close 
cooperation with employee representatives."
"These rep-
resentatives are involved in numerous committees and 
are informed at an early stage about operational 
changes."
"The regulations on notification periods vary 
around the world."
"We comply with the rules in force at 
local level."
"In the event of a reorganisation or job cuts, 
we work in close consultation to achieve a socially 
­
responsible solution and, for example, initially examine 
the possibility of transferring employees within the 
Group."
"If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the indi-
vidual impact through retraining, early-retirement 
schemes, outplacement, and compensation pay-
ments."
"Human resources development
Talent management
Recognising talent, developing qualified and motivated 
employees, and retaining them in competition with oth-
er companies are at the core of our Group-wide per-
sonnel policy."
"Strategic apprenticeships and employee 
training as well as new career paths have a key role to 
play."
"A systematic assessment of performance and potential 
that is standardised across the Group forms the basis 
for strategic personnel development and successor 
planning."
"With these challenges in mind, and in line with the 
Sustainability Commitments 2030, the FAIR pro-
gramme was launched in 2021."
"FAIR stands for 
“fairness, awareness, inclusion, respect.” The em-
ployee networks for women and LGBT+ people also 
fall under the umbrella of this initiative."
"A dedicated 
FAIR committee puts together a varied annual pro-
gramme, makes recommendations to manage-
ment, and works with external partners, to increase 
the attractiveness of Heidelberg Materials as an 
employer for people with disabilities, for example."
"In 2023, the FAIR agenda in the UK included training 
for first responders in the field of mental health, in-
formation on men’s and women’s health, awareness 
training for managers and executives, and partici-
pation in Pride events."

"This dialogue also helps to fill 
key positions worldwide with top-class candidates from 
within the business."
"Education
For Heidelberg Materials, forward-looking HR manage-
ment means consistently investing in training."
"With an 
apprentice retention rate of 68% in Germany, steady 
growth of qualified young talent is guaranteed."
"As part 
of the training programme, interdisciplinary compe-
tences are indispensable in addition to technical skills 
for faultless professional processes."
"A complete edu-
cational offering is ensured through additional training 
covering professional use of programmes for virtual 
communication and cooperation, how to deal with new 
working and living situations on a personal level, and 
topics of mental health and resilience."
"As a manufacturing Group, occupational safety is al-
ways a key element of our training and career develop-
ment programmes."
"In addition, we focus our efforts on 
specialist training and the training of our managers."
"Our training programmes in virtually every work area 
are characterised by practical and business-oriented 
learning and enable our employees to develop their 
skills in the best possible way."
"Its objective is to develop core compe-
tencies and deliver knowledge that is applied to drive 
business performance and operational excellence."
"­
Process simulators and web-based learning program­
mes, including the multilingual Cement Manufacturing 
Curriculum, on which more than 3,000 employees are 
enrolled, are regularly used to supplement our class-
room courses."
"Strengthening digital competences
The expansion of digital competences and the further 
digitalisation of personnel processes and systems are 
essential."
"With the global rollout of our new Workday 
HR system in 2021, we have taken a major step forward 
in this regard."
"With more self-service options, data 
transparency, and many new functionalities for man-
agers and employees, we now cover the core proces­
ses of learning, recruitment, remuneration, and talent 
management digitally."
"By using external training data-
bases, we also significantly expanded our e-learning 
offerings on various digitalisation topics in the past 
year."
"When it comes to using virtual communication 
and collaboration tools, we offer both in-house and ex-
ternally provided training and certification programmes 
(Microsoft certification tracks)."
"Successor planning 
To secure and develop the next generation of manag-
ers, we are focusing worldwide on increasing our re-
cruitment of university graduates and expanding cor-
responding advancement programmes."
"Among other 
things, we offer extensive, international trainee pro-
grammes focusing on technology, sales, finance, HR, 
and procurement, as well as interdisciplinary posts."
"Through a special programme, we also equip highly 
qualified engineers in the cement business for the next 
step in their careers."
"The participants undergo individ-
ually tailored training programmes that allow them to 
gain the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience."
"Spending time at cement plants in different countries is 
a key element of the programme’s success."
"Since 2013, Heidelberg Materials has been awarded the 
trainee seal of the German initiative for career-enhanc-
ing and fair trainee programmes each year."
"As holders 
of the Fair Company seal, we have also made a volun-
tary commitment to providing fair and attractive work-
ing conditions for trainees and young professionals."
Our declared aim is zero harm.
"With effective preventive measures, we intend to re-
duce the risk of accidents, incidents, and ill health."
"The health and well-being of our employees, our con-
tractors, and the people in our local communities are 
at the heart of our actions."
"We believe that ­
work-related 
accidents, occupational diseases, and ill health are 
generally preventable and that providing a safe work-
ing environment is important for maintaining good 
health and well-being at Heidelberg Materials."
"Our 
principles for protecting our own employees as well as 
those of companies contracted by us, and those of 
third parties, are specified in our Group policy on occu-
pational health and safety."
"It is also important for us 
to have a good working relationship with the employee 
representatives, and this is also laid down in the Group 
policy."
They represent over 97% of our employees.
"Occupational safety at our locations
We work hard to minimise and prevent risks for our em-
ployees, customers, suppliers, and other third parties."
"To this end, we carry out regular risk assessments at 
our locations so that we can evaluate risks and take 
appropriate protective measures."
"Based on the results 
of these risk assessments, we have introduced and 
continuously updated various Group-wide safety 
standards in recent years in order to address activities 
with particularly high risks."
"These standards are trans-
lated into local measures at our locations."
"As part of 
workplace inspections, we check compliance with these 
internal standards as well as with other legally mandat-
ed external requirements."
"Any shortcomings are identi-
fied and actions put in place to quickly rectify any issues."
"All our measures give due consideration not only to our 
own employees but also to the employees of external 
companies."
"They work for us in areas such as produc-
tion, maintenance and repair, transport, other services, 
and consulting."
"Safety in relation to transport is another key concern, 
as traffic accidents have unfortunately repeatedly led 
to uninvolved third parties sustaining injuries or even 
losing their lives."
"We address this issue in training 
courses for our own drivers and those who drive on our 
behalf."
"The driver training courses aim to raise drivers’ 
safety awareness so that they can identify and reduce 
potential risks at an early stage."
"This training in defen-
sive driving is not only theory-based; it is also increas-
ingly delivered using driving simulators, at driving safe-
ty centres, or through supervised driving."
"In addition, 
we are making greater use of technical aids."
"As well as 
fitting vehicles with various assistance systems and us-
ing such systems, examples of this approach also in-
clude checking the roadworthiness of third-party vehi-
cles before loading."
"Improving mental health
In addition to the measures outlined above for the pre-
vention of accidents and standard occupational dis-
eases, Heidelberg Materials recognises the importance 
of good mental health and resilience in our workforce."
"We offer employee assistance schemes and awareness 
programmes for our managers and train mental health 
first-aiders."
"The aim of the measures is to dispel preju-
dices and encourage those affected to talk about their 
problems and seek help."
"In recognition of the sensitiv-
ity of the topic and to make it easier for those affected 
to access appropriate services, many of our ­
subsidiaries 
offer external support programmes that provide help 
anonymously and free of charge."
"Countries in which 
such programmes are available include Germany, the 
UK, Belgium, Canada, the USA, and Australia."

As a global Group with a strong regional business focus, 
we operate at many locations worldwide."
"Our produc-
tion and quarrying sites are generally designed for a 
service life of several decades."
"To maintain acceptance 
of our business activities at the sites over these long 
periods, we are active in the communities close to our 
plants and fulfil our corporate social responsibility 
(CSR)."
"We create jobs and promote local economic de-
velopment with our wages, investment, procurement, 
and taxes, particularly in economically weak regions."
"Social engagement at our locations 
We have made a commitment to social responsibility in 
our Code of Business Conduct."
"At our locations, we 
strive for a constructive, trusting, and neighbourly rela­
tionship with local residents."
"We support the social and 
economic development of our neighbouring communi-
ties and foster ongoing, transparent communication 
with all relevant stakeholders."
"We aim to work with local 
partners to create added value both for our Group and 
for the local community."
"People in the communities 
where we operate also expect us to contribute to the 
areas surrounding our production sites by regularly 
providing information about our business activities and 
through our commitment to local social, economic, and 
environmental development."
"As management tasks, social responsibility and a com-
mitment to good relationships with our stakeholders – 
particularly at our production sites – are integral to our 
CSR strategy."
"The national management team, together 
with the national CSR manager, is responsible for social 
engagement in each country."
"Funding decisions for in-
dividual countries are made by the national manage-
ment teams within their budgetary framework."
"Together 
with the ESG coordinators, they are also responsible 
for analysing local needs and for selecting, implement-
ing, and monitoring appropriate projects."
"Involving local communities
We involve local communities in our business activities 
through various dialogue formats as well as community 
engagement plans."
"Among other things, these strate-
gies include long-term partnerships with non-govern-
mental and non-profit organisations."
"In addition, we 
keep the local communities and stakeholders informed 
via newsletters or at open days."
"We aim to develop community engagement plans for 
100% of our sites by 2030."
"In addition, all employees 
are offered one day per year of paid leave for voluntary 
community work."
"We have also defined clear evaluation criteria to ensure 
that our activities are both transparent and effective."
"We support projects, initiatives, and organisations that 
are active at our locations or to which we have a direct 
link."
"We attach great importance to ensuring that the 
guidelines and principles of these organisations align 
with our own corporate philosophy."
"Focus of our engagement 
Our CSR activities are focused on the following areas:
	
– Culture: We promote inclusive cultural initiatives for 
all age groups in our local communities."
"– Environment: We support initiatives that promote en-
vironmental protection and strengthen the diversity 
of nature at our locations."
"– Infrastructure: We provide practical help in the con-
struction of buildings and infrastructure by making 
products, financial means, and expertise available."
"– Education: In this area, we are guided by the specific 
needs of our locations."
"We foster potential and en-
courage initiatives such as education partnerships."
"In the 2023 financial year, Heidelberg Materials was 
particularly active on health and safety matters."
"For 
example, as part of our CSR activities in India, our local 
country organisation ran a health camp in the Panchayat 
community, providing medical care to 224 people."
"In 
particular, women, children, and the elderly were sup-
ported with check-ups and free medicines."

"A small team undertook a multi-day fundrais-
ing hike to the organisation’s office in Chiswick, collect-
ing donations for a children’s hospice from several 
Heidelberg Materials locations along the route."
"In Bulgaria, our subsidiary Devnya Cement once again 
took part in a campaign to renew the road markings on 
pedestrian crossings in the city of Devnya."
"To create a 
safer street environment, especially for children, zebra 
stripes near a school and at busy junctions were given 
a fresh coat of paint."
"Local acceptance of our plants is one of our core 
concerns."
"At many locations, we have been cultivat-
ing good, cooperative relationships with the people 
in our neighbourhood for decades."
"To make it easy 
for members of the public to learn more about our 
production, our innovation projects, and our commit-
ment to sustainability and occupational safety, our 
Italian subsidiary held a total of eight “open doors” 
events at various cement and concrete plants 
in 2023."
"One of the events took place in October at Heidelberg 
Materials’ cement plant in Isola delle Femmine, Sicily."
"Around 1,000 people – among them employees and 
Stakeholder dialogue
“Open doors” at our locations

former employees and their families, school classes, 
local residents, customers, and suppliers – accept-
ed the invitation."
"We 
are investing in our own facilities for the generation 
of green electricity and entering into long-term 
power purchase agreements (PPAs) to secure the 
supply of electricity from renewable energies."
"We 
are also implementing energy efficiency measures 
to reduce electricity consumption and generating 
electricity from waste heat."
"In 2023, Heidelberg Materials signed further long-
term PPAs to source renewable electricity and com-
missioned its own solar plants in Thailand and Togo."
"In Belgium, we were able to cover 12% of the annu-
al energy demand of our cement plant in the Port of 
Ghent with wind energy for the first time in 2023."
"A wind turbine was installed on the plant premises 
there as part of a PPA with the company Luminus."
"The plans also took into account the need to protect 
the sensitive biodiversity in the port area."
"In spring 
2023, a camera system was added to the installa-
tion, which analyses how birds react to the wind 
turbine and enables the turbines to be switched off
 
for hours at a time in order to protect these animals."
"Heidelberg 
Materials 
currently 
has 
more 
than 
120,000  suppliers and business partners from more 
than 50 countries."
"Owing to the complexity of global 
networks and the predominantly local business rela-
tionships (about 90% of all expenditure worldwide1)), it 
is extremely important for Heidelberg Materials to en-
sure that information is exchanged reliably at all levels 
of their supply chain."
"We 
take 
a 
transparent, 
sustainable, 
and 
­
forward-looking 
approach to our procurement of products and services 
by going beyond the legal requirements for our busi-
ness activity."
"In addition to economic criteria, we take 
social, ethical, and environmental factors into account 
when selecting and evaluating our suppliers."
"Most im-
portantly, human, labour, and environmental rights are 
also non-negotiable for us when forming and maintain-
ing business relationships."
"1)	 The value is based on an analysis in the countries that use our central SAP 
system and relates to 58% of the annual procurement volume."
"We proactively communicate this message in 
various ways, including at meetings with suppliers and 
through initiatives such as virtual supplier days on the 
topic of sustainability."
"We motivate our suppliers to be 
transparent about their CO2 emissions, actively reduce 
their carbon footprint, and have their reduction targets 
validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)."
"As part of our responsible procurement initiative, we 
have also launched a global risk assessment pro-
gramme for our supply chain."
"Its aim is to identify sus-
tainability challenges before they become problems."
"IntegrityNext and Avetta are global programme pro-
viders with extensive experience in monitoring corpo-
rate safety, skills, and social responsibility."
"They help us 
to audit and assess our suppliers in relation to our sus-
tainable supply chain standards."
"We are also implementing numerous other measures in 
the area of responsible procurement:
	
– Our SpeakUp compliance hotline can be used by in-
ternal and external stakeholders to report any illegal 
activities or violations of internationally applicable 
conventions."
"– Together with our partners, we are driving forward 
innovative projects and initiatives aimed at reducing 
CO2 emissions (e."
"through the joint construction 
of carbon capture facilities in clinker and cement 
production and in cooperation with construction 
machinery manufacturers with regard to the elec-
trification of transport systems) in order to address 
climate change."
"– In our cooperation with suppliers, we follow a zero- 
tolerance policy."
"This means that we end the con-
tractual relationship if violations are not remedied 
by appropriate measures."

Nature Positive – Building a nature positive future
Our target: nature positive
The extraction of raw materials has an impact on na-
ture, changing landscapes and natural habitats."
"­
Responsible land management is therefore an essential 
element of the Heidelberg Materials sustainability 
strategy."
"We are committed to working towards the 
Global Goal for Nature, contributing to a nature posi-
tive future."
"“Nature positive” means stopping and reversing biodi-
versity loss in order to ensure a global net gain for the 
planet and see it on the road to recovery."
"In simple 
terms, there should be more nature by 2030 compared 
with 2020."
"Companies such as Heidelberg Materials 
can play their part in halting and reversing biodiversity 
loss by addressing their own impact on nature and im-
plementing measures that achieve positive results for 
nature and outweigh their negative contributions."
"Biodiversity management at our locations
As a business reliant on the extraction of raw materials, 
we acknowledge our impact and accompanying social 
responsibility."
"Our quarry development activities – sus-
tainable extraction methods, reclamation/restoration, 
and intensive cooperation with nature conservation 
groups – take account of nature."
"For many years, we 
have been committed to protecting and preserving na-
tive animal and plant species."
"At the core of our strategy is a deep understanding of 
our footprint, where negative impacts may occur, and 
how we can positively contribute to countering biodi-
versity loss."
"Working across five continents, we strive 
to understand the environments in which our sites are 
located and the species with which they interact across 
the whole quarry life cycle, so that we can set out key 
actions."
"Numerous scientific studies demonstrate that active 
quarries can be extremely valuable to nature."
"They of-
fer a wide variety of habitats, including undisturbed 
biotopes that are rarely found in today’s developed 
landscapes, which support many endangered and/or 
protected species, such as the sand martin, the yellow- 
bellied toad, the eagle owl, or the Eurasian otter."
"And 
they are not just home to larger animals."
"Our quarries 
also provide habitats for a range of pollinators includ-
ing a number of butterflies, solitary bees, and other 
threatened insects."
"For this purpose, it is important to 
protect spontaneously created natural areas within ac-
tive quarries in addition to integrating biodiversity fea-
tures into post-extraction reclamation plans."
"Post-extraction reclamation also offers significant op-
portunities to create critical habitat types that support 
numerous flora and fauna and has the potential to in-
crease the ecological value of sites and their surround-
ings."
"To build on the positive impact our biodiversity 
management and reclamation efforts can deliver, we 
work closely with nature conservation organisations, 
­
local authorities, and neighbouring communities to make 
an important contribution to restoring biodiversity."

To truly move from biodiversity loss to gain, a concert-
ed effort is needed by everyone, working together at 
landscape scale."
"Nature knows no boundaries, and this 
needs to be reflected in collaborative actions."
"Partner 
organisations assist us in understanding and minimis-
ing our impact on the environment, helping to promote 
biodiversity at our quarries and in their surroundings."
"Since 2011, we have greatly benefited from working 
with the largest global nature conservation partnership 
organisation, BirdLife International."
"BirdLife Interna-
tional and its national partner organisations help us 
maximise the role our extraction sites can play for bio-
diversity by imparting knowledge, sharing best prac-
tice, and working on the ground with our operational 
staff to engage and empower them."

Nature Positive – Biodiversity
Quarry Life Award
As a unique initiative in the building materials industry, 
the Quarry Life Award is an integral part of the 
Heidelberg Materials sustainability strategy."
"The re-
search and education competition supports our ap-
proach to innovative biodiversity management, pro-
motes research, and engages stakeholders around the 
world."
"Researchers, university students, and non-gov-
ernmental organisations as well as members of our lo-
cal communities are invited to develop and – provided 
they qualify to participate in the competition – imple-
ment ideas for biodiversity-related projects at our 
company’s quarries worldwide."
"Heidelberg Materials uses the award-winning projects 
as a basis for developing best practices for quarry 
management, which are then rolled out globally."
"In this 
way, we want to promote the evaluation of the quar-
ries’ ecological value and support the development of 
new methods that benefit scientists, government au-
thorities, and our company as well as nature."
"After a successful competition round of the fifth edition 
of the Quarry Life Award back in 2022, 2023 saw the 
implementation of a select number of projects."
"Pro-
jects ranged from establishing best practices for spe-
cific amphibians and reptiles to better understanding 
topsoil storage management."
"Education and commu-
nity engagement were also featured (see chapter So-
cial responsibility)."
"More than 40 biodiversity projects have been initi-
ated worldwide since the start of our cooperation 
with BirdLife."
"During 2023, a new project was initi-
ated in one of our sand and aggregates pits in co-
operation with the Czech Society of Ornithology, 
BirdLife’s partner in Czechia."
"A study investigated 
the role that mining sites can play as alternative 
habitats for insects that are potentially endangered 
due to landscape changes."
"The project comple-
ments our measures to improve biodiversity man-
agement at our quarries."
"We also focus on helping to inform and educate the 
general public about the importance of biodiversity 
and its impending loss."
"In 2023, through its part-
nership with BirdLife International, Heidelberg 
Materials supported a West African initiative taking 
part in BirdLife’s Spring Alive campaign."
"In addition 
to promoting scientific interest in migratory birds, 
the project trained teachers to collect geospatial 
data."
"This means they can observe birds with their 
students and document their findings ­
professionally 
as a contribution to citizen science."
"Heidelberg Materials 
recognises the importance of efficient water manage-
ment and conservation, which is why it has a globally 
applicable Water Policy."
"We use water in various ways, from washing gravel and 
sand to cooling and cleaning transport vehicles."
"It is 
also one of the source materials used in concrete man-
ufacturing and becomes part of the building material in 
the production process."
"We obtain some of the water 
we use from the public water supply, but the majority 
comes from our own approved well systems or from 
rivers and lakes."
"The use of rainwater and recycled water 
in cleaning and production processes is also becoming 
increasingly important."
"Some of the water – the water 
used for cooling, for instance – evaporates and is re-
leased into the atmosphere."
"The cleaning water that 
accumulates when transport vehicles are washed is 
fully recycled."
"We dispose of the domestic wastewater 
accruing at our company buildings via the municipal 
wastewater systems."
"Heidelberg Materials has committed itself to minimis-
ing the impact of its activities on the limited natural 
resource of water to the greatest possible extent."
"We 
comply with stringent environmental regulations to en-
sure that our raw material quarrying does not endan-
ger local bodies of surface water or groundwater re-
sources."
"All direct withdrawals are heavily regulated 
and closely monitored by governments worldwide."
"The 
local operating permit at each plant specifies the al-
lowable amounts of water extraction and recirculation."
"We systematically identify and classify potential water 
pollutants."
"We also carry out stakeholder analyses and 
risk assessments as part of our water management 
plans."
"Water quality is tested, usually in external labo-
ratories, by taking regular water samples."
"In addition, 
there are on-site measures aimed at monitoring the 
water temperature, for example."
"These measures com-
ply with local permit requirements and regulations as 
well as global reporting obligations."
"We want to conserve water and minimise negative im-
pacts through measures aimed at saving water and 
using it efficiently."
"This objective can be achieved by 
using rainwater, taking advantage of reuse and recy-
cling technologies, or working with local communities 
on water-related projects."
"We acknowledge that ac-
cess to clean water and sanitation is a human right and 
have implemented the World Business Council for Sus-
tainable Development’s WASH Pledge for access to 
safe water, sanitation, and hygiene at all production 
sites."
"Sustainable water management
Responsible use of water is also part of our Sustain­
ability Commitments 2030."
"We want to introduce wa-
ter management plans and water recycling systems at 
100% of our locations in regions affected by water 
scarcity by 2030."
"To this end, we have systematically 
categorised our plants using the World Resources Insti-
tute’s Aqueduct tool."
"We use a water reporting system 
based on the GCCA guidelines at all of our company’s 
cement plants."
"We work continuously to reduce our 
consumption of fresh water, for example, by switching 
to closed cooling circuits and recycling systems."
"We 
have also started to introduce measurement systems 
and key figures on water reporting in our aggregates 
and ready-mixed concrete business lines."
"As a result of climate change, environmental risks are 
arising more and more frequently  – including those 
connected with water."
"While working to reduce our con-
sumption of fresh water worldwide, we take local con-
ditions into account in the implementation of specific 
water management measures."
"The particular condi-
tions in each region in terms of factors such as climate, 
water resources, population growth, and economic de-
velopment influence the availability and use of water."
"We therefore rely on individual approaches tailored to 
the respective locations in order to reduce water con-
sumption as far as is economically and technically pos-
sible."
"We take a local approach to facilitate participa-

tion and involve key stakeholders such as communities, 
businesses, and governments in the development and 
implementation of water reduction initiatives."
"This en-
ables better matching of targets and measures to local 
conditions."
"Our plant-specific water management 
plans help us to identify and address water-related 
risks at an early stage."
"As at the end of the 2023 finan-
cial year, 58% of our aggregates sites in areas suffering 
from water scarcity had implemented water recycling 
systems, while in the cement business line, this figure 
had already reached 83%."
"Because we are facing a water surplus in other regions 
of the world, where we need to pump off large quanti-
ties of water in order to operate our quarries, it does 
not make sense to define a general global reduction 
target for the Group based on quantified water with-
drawal rates."
"After the first Group countries developed 
and introduced water management plans as part of a 
pilot project in 2022, the 2023 water target was rolled 
out to all locations worldwide."
"Priority is given to re-
gions affected by water scarcity, water stress, and oth-
er physical risks associated with water."
"The majority of 
our production sites worldwide already have water re-
cycling systems."
"In order to guarantee efficient water 
use and reduce the demand for fresh water in the long 
term, it is our intention that all Heidelberg Materials 
plants will use water recycling systems by 2030."
"As an expression of Heidelberg Materials’ commit-
ment to sustainability, we reinforced our integrated 
approach regarding water and biodiversity in 2023."
"By using nature-based solutions, we are already in-
corporating the protection of biodiversity and water-
bodies into many of our projects."
"Our Swedish subsidiary operates a large quarry in 
Löten, which supplies the concrete industry in Stock-
holm with aggregates."
"The quarry has the necessary 
infrastructure to treat material from the construction 
of the Stockholm bypass, scheduled for completion 
by 2030."
"A total of 4.5 million tonnes of blasted rock, 
which is contaminated with nitrogen as a result of the 
blasting process, is being produced there during 
tunnel construction."
"A wetland is being created on the quarry site to 
­
purify the rock and the nitrogen-rich wastewater 
produced by the purification process."
"Various 
plants such as water lilies, reeds, and bulrushes are 
expected to thrive in three small lakes."
"Wetlands 
can reduce nitrogen in a natural and environmental-
ly friendly way while also increasing biodiversity."
"Their water is also vital to birds, amphibians, lizards, 
and other reptiles, especially when wetlands are 
surrounded by a large agricultural area."
"The change became legally 
effective on 16 May 2023 upon registration of this res-

"Fundamentals 
of the Group
Business model
For more than 150 years, Heidelberg Materials has of-
fered a broad range of building materials, applications, 
and services."
"Our core activities are the production 
and distribution of cement, aggregates, ready-mixed 
concrete, and asphalt."
"Heidelberg Materials also trades 
goods by sea worldwide, in particular cement and 
clinker, secondary cementitious materials, and solid 
and alternative fuels."
"Heidelberg Materials is one of the world’s largest inte-
grated manufacturers of building materials in terms of 
revenue and operates on five continents."
"Our products 
are used, among other applications, for the construc-
tion of houses, traffic routes, infrastructure, as well as 
commercial and industrial facilities, thus meeting the 
demands of a growing world population for housing, 
mobility, and economic development."
"On the journey 
towards carbon neutrality and a circular economy in 
the building materials industry, we are working on sus-
tainable, intelligent building materials and solutions for 
the future."
"We are opening up new opportunities for our 
customers through digitalisation."
"Heidelberg Materials’ fully integrated business model 
encompasses the entire value chain, from the extrac-
tion of raw materials to further processing into cement 
through to the end product concrete and its recycling, 
as well as their sales and distribution to customers."
"Operating activities are supported by central compe-
tence centers for technology as well as by shared ser-
vice centers in the regions and individual countries."
"Products
Our core products cement, aggregates, ready-mixed 
concrete, and asphalt are homogeneous bulk goods."
"Their product characteristics are mostly standardised 
in order to ensure the required stability, reliability, and 
processability in the application."
"Cements are classified according to their early and fi-
nal strength as well as their composition."
"In addition to 
cements that consist of almost 100% clinker, there are 
so-called composite cements, in which a portion of the 
clinker is replaced by alternative raw materials, such as 
fly ash, ground slag, or limestone."
"Cement is used as a 
binder mainly in concrete production."
"Aggregates (sand, gravel, and crushed rock) are clas-
sified according to their particle size and texture."
"They 
are the main component in the production of concrete 
and asphalt but are also used as base courses in the 
construction of infrastructure, such as roads."
"To some 
extent, aggregates are also obtained from recycled 
products."
"Concrete is a mixture of aggregates (about 80%), 
­
cement (about 12%), and water."
"Concrete is usually 
­
delivered to the construction site by ready-mix trucks 
and is poured locally into forms."
"Moreover, concrete 
is  also used for the production of precast concrete 
parts, such as stairs, ceiling elements, or structural 
components."
"Asphalt is a mixture of aggregates (about 95%) and 
bitumen and is generally used as a top layer in road 
construction."
"Locations and sales markets
Due to the heavy weight of cement, aggregates, and 
concrete in proportion to their price, production and 
further processing usually take place in close proximity 
to the sales markets."
"The cement transportation radius 
by road does not normally exceed 200 km."
"The delivery 
radius for aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and 
­
asphalt by road is generally less than 100 km."
"Con­
sequently, we have local production sites in around 
50 countries in which we offer building materials."
"We operate around 130 cement plants (plus a further 
16 as part of joint ventures), just under 600 quarries 
and aggregates pits (thereof 32 locations of joint ven-
tures), as well as around 1,310 ready-mixed concrete 
production sites (plus a further 254 as part of joint ven-
tures) worldwide."
"In total, the Group employs 50,997 people (based on 
full-time equivalents) at around 2,500 locations on five 
continents."
"There are additionally around 330 produc-
tion sites belonging to joint ventures."
"In the past finan-
cial year, we sold or closed around 40 locations as part 
of our portfolio optimisation."
"Our global 
trading activities, especially the trading of cement, 
clinker, secondary cementitious materials, and solid 
and alternative fuels are pooled together in the sixth 
Group area, Group Services."
"As a result, the Group area Western and 
Southern Europe and the majority of Northern and 
Eastern Europe-Central Asia have been combined since 
1 January 2024 to form the Group area Europe."
"Mem-
ber of the Managing Board Jon Morrish, previously re-
sponsible for Western and Southern Europe, has since 
assumed responsibility for this newly created Group 
area."
"Hakan Gurdal, who was previously in charge of 
the Group area Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin, 
has also been responsible for Kazakhstan and Russia 
since January 2024."
"Since then, the Group area has 
been called Africa-Mediterra­
nean-Western Asia."
"Since January 2024, Roberto Callieri, previously Gen-
eral Manager Italy, has taken on responsibility for Asia 
in the Asia-Pacific Group area as a new member of the 
Managing Board."
"He succeeded Kevin Gluskie, whose 
term ended on 31 January 2024."
"Chief Financial Officer 
René Aldach has also assumed responsibility for Aus-
tralia in this Group area since January 2024."
"Within these geographical Group areas, our activities 
are divided into four business lines."
"The cement and 
aggregates business lines comprise the essential raw 
materials that are required for the manufacture of the 
downstream products ready-mixed concrete and as-
phalt, which are combined in our third business line."
"The 
fourth business line, service-joint ventures-other, pri-
marily covers the activities of our joint ventures."
"Since 
then, he has been responsible for all three global tech-
nical Competence Centers: Cement (CCC), Aggregates 
& Asphalt (CCA), and Readymix (CCR)."
"As a leading building materials manufacturer, 
we see it as our responsibility to play a pioneering role 
in transforming our industry to meet current and future 
needs."
"We want to make a substantial contribution to 
sustainable construction and carbon neutrality and 
­
assume social and environmental responsibility."
"Climate protection is an integral part of the Group 
strategy."
"The production of cement generates a large 
amount of CO2 due to the chemical processes involved 
in burning clinker and the high temperatures this re-
quires."
"Therefore, we are making greater use of alter-
native raw materials and fuels to reduce CO2 emissions."
"We also optimise our production processes to increase 
energy efficiency."
"To reduce the consumption of prima-
ry raw materials, we are committed to circularity and 
strengthening the circular economy."
"At product level, 
our focus is on the broad introduction of low-carbon 
cements and concretes, the use of recycled materials, 
and the application of new technologies such as 3D 
concrete printing."
"In addition, we are continuously 
working to expand our portfolio of carbon capture, uti-
lisation, and storage (CCUS) projects."
"CCUS is a key 
technology for the complete decarbonisation of ce-
ment production."
Heidelberg Materials is a manufacturing company.
"With effective pre-
ventive measures, we intend to minimise the risk of ac-
cidents and injuries as well as the risk of work-related 
illness."
"Occupational health and safety is a cornerstone 
of our corporate culture and work processes."
"Heidelberg Materials is committed to responsible cor-
porate governance and pursues a zero-tolerance ­
policy 
in the event of corruption and antitrust violations."
"Re-
spect for human rights as well as ensuring diversity, 
equity, and inclusion are core values of our company."
"For further information, see the Non-financial state-
ment chapter."
"Strategy
Material to build our future
With its building materials and solutions, Heidelberg 
Materials has been contributing to global progress for 
more than 150 years."
"The purpose adopted in 2020, 
“Material to build our future,” reinforces our intention to 
develop and produce innovative (building) materials for 
the future and to play a material role going forward."
"The purpose and four culture principles are integral to 
our Group strategy."
"Strategic framework
The top priority of our strategy and all our entrepre-
neurial activity is to sustainably increase the enterprise 
value while limiting the impact of our business activities 
on the environment and society."
"Cement, aggregates, and concrete form the core of 
our business activities."
"In a market with largely stand-
ardised building materials, customer focus and service 
quality are crucial in order to successfully market our 
products and solutions."
"By further developing our 
product and customer portfolio, we are striving for 
profitable growth in line with our sustainability targets."
"In particular, we rely on the market knowledge and 
­
entrepreneurial spirit of our local management."
"The basis and prerequisite for business excellence is a 
culture of continuous improvement."
"We compare per-
formance both internally and in relation to competitors 
in order to identify improvement potential."
"To complement and transform our existing 
core business, our strategy is based on two key corner-
stones: sustainability and digitalisation."
"Sustainability 
We see closing the loop in terms of carbon emissions 
and material streams as an opportunity to establish 
new products and solutions on the market and open up 
new areas of business."
"Our target is to generate 50% 
of our revenue through sustainable products3) and 
solutions (including carbon-reduced and circular) by 
2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions4) by 2050 at 
the latest (see Sustainable products and solutions 
­
section)."
"To 
achieve this, however, the existing techniques and 
measures alone are not sufficient."
"We are therefore 
­
intensively researching and testing new technologies 
aimed at avoiding the emission of CO2 and closing 
the carbon loop."
"A particular focus of this work is on 
­
carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) (see 
­
Research and development section)."
"4)	 According to SBTi definition
with circular economy principles."
"The aim is to conserve 
primary resources and make greater use of secondary 
resources, namely demolition concrete, as recycled 
materials."
"Heidelberg Materials is already active in the 
recycling business in several countries and is working 
on the targeted processing of recycled concrete com-
ponents, as well as their recarbonation and reuse in 
building materials."
"With the acquisitions of RWG, SER 
Group, and The SEFA Group in 2023, among other 
steps, Heidelberg Materials is strengthening its range 
of circular materials to meet the increasing demand for 
sustainable building materials."
"Digitalisation
Digitalisation – including digital products and applica-
tions – plays a crucial role throughout our entire value 
chain, from raw materials mining, production, and 
logistics to the interface with our customers."
"Heidelberg 
Materials has set itself the target of becoming the 
leading tech company in the building materials sector."
"We aim to use digital solutions to contribute to compa-
ny growth and increase efficiency in production and 
administration."
"Our digital transformation strategy is 
centred on the three digital pillars HConnect, ­
HProduce, 
and HService."
"The implementation of our strategy and the achieve-
ment of our targets are supported by measures in the 
areas of people and organisation, corporate portfolio, 
and capital allocation."
"People and organisation
Heidelberg Materials pursues an integrated manage-
ment approach, the success of which is based on a 
balance between local operational responsibility, 
Group-wide standards, and global leadership."
"The achievement of essential corporate targets is en-
shrined in individual target agreements at all manage-
ment levels and is reviewed regularly."
"At Managing 
Board level, global business functions are allocated 
clearly to the individual members."
"Separate Managing 
Board responsibilities have been established for the 
strategic transformation topics of sustainability and 
digitalisation since 2021."
"An area of particular importance to us as a manufac-
turing company is occupational safety and the protec-
tion of our employees’ health."
"We see the international 
composition of our workforce as a decisive factor for 
the global success of Heidelberg Materials."
"The aim is 
to create a high-performance and sustainable organi-
sation throughout the Group."

Corporate portfolio
We see our diversified country portfolio, consisting of 
developed and growth markets, as a strength."
"Through 
active portfolio management, we aim to further simpli-
fy our country portfolio and prioritise the strongest 
market positions."
"We have defined financial and non- 
financial criteria according to which all our markets are 
assessed."
"This includes divestments of activities in 
markets that do not meet these criteria in the medium 
term."
"We will expand our activities in countries that 
meet these criteria."
"Selective acquisitions in existing 
markets must meet high result and return expectations 
as well as sustainability criteria."
"We will continue our 
vertical integration along the entire value chain in the 
countries in which we are achieving strong synergy 
­
effects and are able to strengthen and expand our 
market positions."
"In addition, we will maintain and con-
tinuously expand our portfolio investments in the trans-
formative areas of sustainability and digitalisation."
"Capital allocation
Our entrepreneurial activity is accompanied by a con-
sistent allocation of capital."
"With net investments of 
€1.1 billion per year, we have reached the required level 
of investment to operate our production sites efficient-
ly and to meet market requirements."
"We make investments with a focus on improving our 
margins and meeting our sustainability targets."
"Invest-
ments with a focus on sustainability or digital are gain-
ing in importance."
"We are continually developing our 
corporate portfolio, with divestments helping to finance 
complementary acquisitions."
"Thanks to a progressive dividend policy, our share­
holders benefit from our corporate success."
"We also 
create sustainable value for our shareholders by re­
ducing net debt."
"Share buybacks complement the cap-
ital allo­
cation mix and underscore the focus on share-
holder return."
"Value creation
To measure our business success and create sustain­
able value, we have defined key performance indica-
tors relevant for management."
"These include the result 
from current operations (RCO), the return on invested 
capital (ROIC), and the specific net CO2 emissions."
"We 
also use revenue development, the RCOBD margin, and 
the leverage ratio as supporting information."
"More information on the 
key performance indicators and targets relevant for 
management can be found in the following section."
"Management system and indicators
Components and functionality  
of the management system
We employ a value-oriented management system in 
order to evaluate and meet our strategic targets."
"In the context of annual planning, the Managing Board 
first defines a top-down budget on the basis of macro-
economic data, external market data, an internal as-
sessment of market conditions, and cost targets."
"From 
this, expected values are derived for all key targets at 
country and Group level, which are used as the basis of 
detailed planning for the individual operating units 
down to plant level and to agree targets with local 
management."
"The operational subplans created by the 
operating units are then consolidated centrally to cre-
ate the Group-wide plan."
"The management and control of the company during 
the year are carried out using a comprehensive system 
of standardised reports on the Group’s assets, finan-
cial, and earnings position."
"The indicators used for 
this purpose are determined and presented uniformly 
throughout the Group."
"A report on the cash in- and 
outflow is prepared weekly, for example."
"Reports on 
the financial and earnings position, investments, pro-
duction, and technology are prepared monthly."
"The internal quarterly reporting includes extensive de-
tailed reports on the assets, financial, and earnings 
position, cash flow for cash flow control, and taxes."
"Adjusted free cash flow is one of the target figures for 
the country management."
"It is defined as the sum of 
free cash flow and all investments and divestments."
Intra-Group payments are offset in the calculation.
"At 
the quarterly management meetings, the Managing 
Board and country and region managers discuss busi-
ness developments, including target achievement, the 
outlook for the relevant year, and any measures that 
need to be taken."
"These are based, among other 
things, on the quarterly forecasts of the country organ-
isations."
"Investments in expansion are 
assessed from a business perspective primarily on the 
basis of the repayment period in years, ROIC (return on 
invested capital), the impact on earnings, and CO2 
emissions."
"For this purpose, a discounted cash flow 
model and simulated calculations are produced that 
show the impact of an investment on the consolidated 
income statement, statement of cash flows, balance 
sheet, and tax position over a period of ten years."
"With our permanent investment grade credit rating, we 
aim to ensure that a high level of financial stability is 
maintained."
"The valuation of the Group’s financial 
strength is based on the leverage ratio, i.e."
"the ratio 
of net debt to result from current operations before 
­
depreciation and amortisation."
"In the medium term, 
we have set the target range for the leverage ratio at 
1.5x to 2.0x."
"The focus is on a consistent allocation of capital, allow-
ing investments only if neither the achievement of the 
target leverage ratio nor the dividend payments are 
jeopardised."
"The Man-
aging Board uses these KPIs to derive strategy and 
investment decisions."
"As an important short-term indicator of the company’s 
earnings strength and success, the RCO is determined, 
analysed, and forecast in detail for all operating units."
"It is therefore particularly suitable for assessing the 
company’s economic development over time."
"The fore-
cast target value is calculated on the basis of the pre-
vailing economic conditions and the Group’s financial 
situation."
"The return on invested capital and thus internal value 
creation is expressed by ROIC."
"It is defined as the ratio 
of the result from current operations less the adjusted 
current tax expense to the average invested capital 
(average of the opening and closing balance sheets of 
the financial year)."
"The adjusted current tax expense is 
calculated by applying an adjusted effective tax rate to 
the result of current operations."
"More information on 
the calculation of ROIC can be found in the Capital 
efficiency section."
"The medium-term target is to 
achieve a ROIC above 10%."
"ROIC is also taken into 
­
account as a variable remuneration element in the 
long-term bonus of the Managing Board and top man-
agement."
"The financial and assets positions of the op-
erating units are monitored in the short term primarily 
via the amount of working capital and investments."
"The strategic target of reducing our ecological foot-
print across the Group is at the forefront of all opera-
tional processes."
"By 2030, we want to lower our spe-
cific net CO2 emissions to a target value of 400 kg of 
CO2 per tonne of cementitious material."
"This is the 
most ambitious reduction target in the industry."
"A CO2 
component links the remuneration of the Managing 
Board and the majority of the bonus-eligible employ-
ees to the reduction of our CO2 emissions."
"For the cal-
culation of specific net CO2 emissions as defined by the 
Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), both 
process-related and fuel-dependent emissions are 
­
taken into account."
"In accordance with the GCCA guide-
lines, all alternative fuels are considered carbon-neutral."

Leading indicators
­
Heidelberg Materials’ core business is in homogeneous 
bulk goods that are generally ordered at short notice."
"Suppliers of such products are usually interchangeable 
from a customer standpoint."
"Moreover, the volume of 
construction activity – and thus volumes of building 
materials – are dependent on local weather conditions 
in the respective markets."
"Given these circumstances, 
no reliable leading indicators are definable for business 
forecasting."
"However, some selected statistical data 
and industry association forecasts can be utilised to 
gauge the approximate business development at coun-
try level."
"In mature markets, for instance, figures on 
building permits or infrastructure budgets serve as im-
portant sources of information."
"In the growth markets 
of emerging countries, data on population growth and 
GDP growth forecasts are frequently used indicators."
"Reducing the proportion 
of clinker in cement is the most important lever when 
it comes to minimising CO2 emissions, and it helps to 
conserve natural raw materials."
"– 	
Development of new technologies for CO2 reduction: 
We are implementing projects for carbon capture, 
utilisation, and storage (CCUS), which are essential 
tools to help our sector achieve net-zero emissions."
"We are also raising the proportion of biomass fuels, 
exploring the use of hydrogen, and increasing the 
electrification of our processes."
"– 	
Circular economy for concrete: We are working on 
innovative recycling technologies that allow demoli-
tion concrete to be fully reused in fresh concrete."
"We 
are also developing processes to incorporate CO2 
into our products by carbonating recycled hardened 
cement paste so that building materials can be used 
to store CO2."
"– 	
Innovative concrete systems: The main priority is the 
development and improvement of binders and con-
cretes with optimised properties and innovative func-
tionalities, such as 3D printing or repair systems to 
reduce the amount of material used."
"– 	
Development of advanced automation solutions: 
With the help of artificial intelligence, we are looking 
for solutions to reduce energy consumption, keep our 
equipment in perfect condition, and maintain con-
sistent product quality in our operations."
"The CCC supports our cement plants in all technical 
matters, from securing raw materials and improving 
production and maintenance to process control and 
quality assurance."
"The CCC also coordinates all strate-
gic projects in the cement business line, from feasibility 
studies to commissioning."
"The CCC supports Heidelberg Materials’ digitalisation 
efforts by continuously increasing the number of 
­
remote-­
controlled facilities and the use of Expert 
­
Systems across the Group."
"Expert Systems are com-
puter programmes that use rules to mimic human 
decision-­
making."
"By working with our plant teams, we 
now have more than 250 Expert Systems in place  – 
­
almost twice as many as three years ago."
"As a result, 
mills and kilns can operate largely without human inter-
vention, increasing material throughput and making 
energy savings of up to 5%."
"Similarly, the CCA supports the aggregates and as-
phalt business lines across the Group with programmes 
for continuous improvement and performance man-
agement."
"Its tasks also include the planning and imple-
mentation of projects as well as digitalisation and 
auto­
mation."
"Furthermore, the CCA offers training to 
provide employees with additional skills."
"The CCR, a comparable organisation for the ready-
mixed concrete business line, focuses on the continu-
ous optimisation of raw materials and logistics costs 
and on maximising revenue by offering our customers 
innovative solutions."
"Combined management report

R&D expenses and employees
Our research and development activities are key driv-
ers of innovation."
"This includes central innovation hubs 
focused on the development of new technologies, im-
proved processes, and breakthrough digital technolo-
gies, as well as the local optimisation of products and 
applications for an elevated customer experience."
"Total expenditure on R&D amounted to €129.4 million in 
the reporting year (previous year: 110.3), correspond-
ing to 0.6% of Group revenue (previous year: 0.5)."
"In 
2023, capitalised development costs totalled €34.1 mil-
lion (previous year: 7.2)."
"On a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis, 686 employees 
(previous year: 654) were part of R&D in the 2023 
­
financial year."
"Research cooperation
Cooperation with institutes and universities at both a 
Cooperation with institutes and universities at a local 
and global level complements our own R&D and inno-
vation activities."
"At a global level, we refer in particular 
to our participation in the Innovandi research network."
"The network includes cement and admixture compa-
nies as well as more than 40 leading international uni-
versities, which all work together to carry out funda-
mental research."
"In terms of product development, we prefer bilateral 
cooperation with individual universities in order to com-
plement our know-how."
"In some cases, cooperative pro-
jects with universities are supported by public funding."
"In particular, 
work is being carried out to predict important quality 
parameters for production, such as cement strength."
"The intention is to help the on-site workforce to ensure 
stable and optimal production and thus reduce the 
ecological footprint."
"Another example is the “Planner” 
digital solution, which has already been introduced in 
more than 60 plants to support production planning 
and maximise operating activities at times when elec-
tricity costs are lower, also determined by the avail­
ability of renewable energies (e.g."
"Root cause failure analysis (RCFA) is an advanced dig-
ital solution introduced at the end of 2022 and now 
employed by over 70 plants with a constant utilisation 
rate averaging 150 active monthly users."
"It has signifi-
cantly facilitated systematic problem-solving process-
es."
"Not only does this tool make analysis documenta-
tion easier, it also promotes effective knowledge 
sharing between our plants."
"The installation of wired 
and wireless sensors on critical equipment in more than 
ten plants is expected to lead to a noticeable reduction 
in maintenance costs and production downtime."
"Use of alternative energies
To reduce Heidelberg Materials’ carbon footprint and 
increase the use of alternative fuels, we initiated the 
Alternative Fuel Master Plan in 2018."
"In the 2023 finan-
cial year, the alternative fuel rate – the proportion of 
alternative fuels in the fuel mix – was around 30% (pre-
vious year: 29)."
"Information on progress in the use of 
alternative fuels in the reporting year is available in the 
Non-financial statement chapter."
"Use of alternative raw materials
One of the most important ways of reducing CO2 emis-
sions in cement manufacturing is to use alternative raw 
materials that are generated as by-products or waste 
in other industries."
"A very large share of these alterna-
tive raw materials comes from the metal processing 
industry."
"Moreover, coal-fired power plants supply ash 
as well as synthetic gypsum."
"By using these materials 
and thus avoiding waste, we actively promote the cir-
cular economy."
"The systematic assessment of the suit-
ability of all materials used ensures the best and most 
consistent product characteristics."
"Cements with lower proportions of clinker
We have made further progress in the development of 
cements containing less clinker and have reduced CO2 
emissions."
"In several countries, the proportion of blast 
furnace slag, fly ash, and limestone in cement has been 
increased, thus reducing the clinker content."
"We are 
also evaluating the use of alternative cement compo-
nents, such as natural pozzolans or calcined clays, for 
various locations."
"Clinker ratio – the proportion of clink-
er in cement – was around 70% in the 2023 financial 
year (previous year: 72)."
"At our plant in Lixhe, Belgium, a new vertical mill for 
grinding pure limestone went into operation before the 
end of 2023."
"This will enable us to launch low-clinker 
cement types on the market in Belgium and the Nether­
lands, in which limestone is used as the main ingredient 
rather than as a filler."
"Combined management report
Fundamentals of the Group
Heidelberg Materials 2023

At our plant in Rezzato, Italy, we are currently modify-
ing an unused mill to grind pure limestone."
"This will 
­
allow us to increase our market share of limestone 
­
cements and reduce the proportion of clinker."
"A new 
vertical mill is currently being installed in Radotín 
(Czechia) that will enable different cementitious ma­
terials (slag, pozzolan, or limestone) to be ground 
­
separately in order to reduce the proportion of CEM-I 
­
cements."
"At our plant in Górażdże, Poland, we are in-
stalling a roller press that will allow us to grind lime-
stone separately, thus allowing the plant to compen-
sate for the expected reduction in slag and fly ash 
availability."
"Thanks to the new installation, we will be 
able to introduce new cement types containing a high-
er proportion of limestone."
"In the EU-funded MatCHMaker project, we are optimis-
ing the use of multi-component cements in concrete, 
including alternative components like calcined clay and 
recycled hardened cement paste."
"Methods such as 
machine learning and micromechanical modelling gen-
erate the necessary information about the mechanical 
properties and durability of the concretes, enabling 
their targeted optimisation."
"Incorporation of CO2 into concrete
Concrete binds CO2 from the air throughout its entire 
service life."
"As a result of this natural carbonation, 
some of the CO2 emitted in the production of the basic 
material cement is already reabsorbed over the prod-
uct life cycle of concrete."
"Accelerating this natural pro-
cess is the focus of the C2inCO2 research project in 
collaboration with industry partners and universities, 
which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of 
­
Education and Research."
"This enforced recarbonation 
of recycled concrete fines not only mineralises CO2 to 
form limestone, but also produces a pozzolanic ma­
terial that can replace clinker."
"This concept was suc-
cessfully proven at industrial scale in 2023 by produc-
ing paving blocks."
"The objective of the EU-funded Carbon4Minerals pro-
ject is to use CO2 from industrial flue gases to repro-
cess existing and future waste materials, which offers 
considerable potential to produce innovative, low-­
carbon binders and building materials."
"A total of eight 
industrial pilot installations are being built and operat-
ed along the entire value chain from carbon capture to 
the production of low-carbon cements and building 
ma­
terials."
"This cross-sectoral innovation could reduce 
­
European carbon emissions by up to 46 million tonnes 
per year, equivalent to 10% of the emissions of the pro-
cessing industry in the EU."
"Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage
The world’s first industrial-scale carbon capture plant 
has been under construction at the Brevik cement 
plant in Norway since 2021."
"This facility will use amine 
­
technology to capture 400,000 tonnes or 50% of the 
plant’s emissions annually."
"We anticipate mechanical 
completion of the CCS plant in Brevik at the end of 
2024."
"The aim of the project is to demonstrate that 
carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is a 
­
viable, safe, and cost-effective technology."
"On the basis of the know-how developed in Brevik, sev-
eral feasibility studies are currently being conducted 
for CCUS projects in further cement plants."
"In particu-
lar, the feasibility studies have reached an advanced 
stage at the cement plants in Padeswood, United King-
dom, and Slite, Sweden."
"There, amine technology will 
be used to capture and store up to 95% of the cement 
plants’ CO2 emissions."
"At our cement plant in Edmonton, Canada, we are de-
veloping North America’s first industrial-scale carbon 
capture and storage plant for the cement industry."
"A 
memorandum of understanding has been signed with 
Enbridge Inc."
"for the captured CO2, which will be trans-
ported via a pipeline and permanently stored."
"A de-
tailed front-end engineering design (FEED) study will be 
carried out before the final investment decision is 
made."
"Subject to the granting of carbon sequestration 
rights and regulatory approvals, the project could go 
into operation as early as 2026."
"Another major CCUS project at our cement plant in 
Mitchell, Indiana, will capture 95% of the CO2 emissions 
from the modernised production facility and store 
them in a nearby onshore reservoir in the Illinois Basin."
"In the first step, the US Department of Energy ap-
proved funding for the feasibility study in 2022."
"As part 
of this study, seismic analyses were carried out in 2023 
to identify suitable storage areas."
"In 2022, the ANRAV CCUS project was selected for 
funding within the framework of the EU Innovation 
Fund."
"ANRAV will be the first project in Eastern Europe 
to span the entire CCUS value chain, connecting car-
bon capture facilities at the cement plant near Varna, 
Bulgaria, with offshore storage sites in the Black Sea 
via a pipeline system."
"To support the ANRAV project, a 
pilot unit is currently being installed."
"It will be a key 
proof of concept to demonstrate the scalability of the 
new OxyCal capture technology."
"Construction of the 
pilot unit is expected to take just a few months, with 
the subsequent demonstration phase scheduled to last 
12 to 24 months."
"Combined management report

Another method of carbon capture uses oxyfuel tech-
nology."
"Together with three other European cement 
manufacturers, Heidelberg Materials has started to 
build an oxyfuel pilot kiln line in Mergelstetten, Ger­
many, to test the new process and prepare for the con-
struction of an industrial-scale installation using the 
knowledge gained."
"The pilot plant is expected to go 
into operation in 2025."
"Building on the knowledge gained from the Mergel­
stetten project, Heidelberg Materials’ GeZero project in 
Geseke, Germany, will be supported by the EU Innova-
tion Fund."
"This facility, equipped with oxyfuel technol-
ogy, is scheduled to go into operation in 2029."
"Once 
captured, the CO2 will be transported to a distribution 
hub in Wilhelmshaven and from there by ship/pipeline 
to offshore storage sites in the North Sea."
"In Belgium, Heidelberg Materials intends to equip the 
Antoing plant with an innovative hybrid carbon capture 
unit."
"Once operational, the Anthemis project will reduce 
CO2 emissions from the Antoing plant by more than 
97%, equivalent to approximately 800,000 tonnes of 
captured CO2 per year."
"Following the successful completion of the LEILAC1 
(Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement) project, 
the summary of the FEED study for LEILAC2 was 
­
published in October 2023, detailing the engineering 
aspects of the planned transfer to industrial scale."
"Heidelberg Materials is working with the Australian 
technology company Calix and a European consortium 
to build a demonstration plant."
"The new and improved 
design is intended to support cost-effective decarbon-
isation, scalable solutions for cement plant carbon 
capture, and a targeted capture rate of 100,000 tonnes 
per year."
"Following the discontinuation of clinker pro-
duction at the Hanover, Germany, site, the project orig-
inally planned for this location is now to be realised at 
the Ennigerloh, Germany, cement plant."
"Heidelberg Materials continues to work on optimising 
the technology to convert CO2 into microalgae for the 
manufacture of a high-quality ingredient for fish food 
and other animal feed."
"We are producing 25 tonnes of 
dried microalgae annually on a 0.5 ha area at our 
­
Moroccan cement plant in Safi and launched the first 
product on the market in 2023."
"Depending on demand, 
we aim to gradually expand capacity."
"Innovative concretes
Digitalisation and automation in the construction in-
dustry are also supported by the development of new 
building technologies, such as 3D printing with con-
crete."
"Our i.tech® 3D building material solution, special-
ly developed for 3D printing, was used in pilot applica-
tions as early as 2020."
"By using low-carbon constituents 
(cement replacement materials) in i.tech® 3D, the 
amount of Portland cement can be reduced by up to 
70%, achieving correspondingly large CO2 savings."
"In 
addition, it has been demonstrated that, through opti-
mised design and targeted material application, the 3D 
printing construction process can reduce material con-
sumption by up to 75%, thus further reducing carbon 
emissions."
"In 2023, three commercial projects were 
realised, including the largest 3D-printed concrete 
building in Europe to date: the IT Server Hotel in 
Heidelberg."
"The decline in 
demand in private residential construction, which was 
massive in some cases, could not be offset by a solid 
development in industrial commercial construction and 
infrastructure projects."
"In the 2023 financial year, our 
volumes therefore declined to varying degrees in all 
business lines."
"However, price adjustments in all Group areas more 
than compensated for this decline in volumes and led 
to revenue growth of 4.4% – excluding scope and cur-
rency effects."
"Thanks to lower energy costs and active 
cost management, we were able to achieve a strong 
increase in the result from current operations (RCO) on 
a like-for-like basis by 29.5%."
"Earnings per share attributable to the Heidelberg 
Materials AG shareholders increased accordingly by 
€1.98 to €10.43."
"ROIC exceeded the 10% threshold for the first time 
and was 10.3% in the reporting year."
"As part of our CO2 roadmap, we were able to reduce 
specific net CO2 emissions by a further 3% to 534 kg/t 
of cementitious material."
"With a focus on shareholder return, Heidelberg Materials 
announced a new share buyback programme in Febru-
ary 2024 with a total volume of up to €1.2 billion and 
a term no later than the end of 2026."
"The Managing 
Board and Supervisory Board will propose to the 
­
An­
nual General Meeting the distribution of a dividend 
of €3.00."
"The Managing Board considers Heidelberg Materials’ 
operational and financial development in the 2023 
­
financial year to be very good."
"Economic environment
General economic conditions
Although growth was only moderate at a forecast 3.1%, 
the global economy performed better than expected 
over the course of 2023, despite the persistently high 
inflation and tight monetary policy."
"In many countries, 
energy prices remained at a high level as a result of the 
Russia-Ukraine war."
"Further geopolitical tensions, such 
as the conflict in the Middle East, have put additional 
strain on the global economy."
"In Europe, economic development slowed significantly 
under the influence of high inflation and persistently 
high interest rates."
"In its January 2024 forecast for the 
eurozone, which sees most countries experience little 
more than stagnation, the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) anticipates a small increase in GDP of 0.5% in 
2023."
"In France and Italy, growth is expected to be 
0.8% and 0.7% respectively."
"In Sweden and Germany, 
gross domestic product is expected to have fallen by 
0.7% and 0.3%, respectively in 2023."
"In the United 
Kingdom, too, the IMF forecasts a weak increase in 
GDP of 0.5%."
"In the USA, despite high inflation and rising interest 
rates, the economy recorded slight growth in 2023, 
driven by private consumer spending and growth in 
commercial construction investments – supported by 
extensive government funding."
"According to the IMF, 
the US economy is expected to have grown by 2.5% 
overall in 2023."
"For Canada, the IMF anticipates growth 
of 1.1%."
"In China, economic momentum has picked up again 
with expected growth of 5.2% compared with the pre-
vious year, but remains low by historical standards due 
to structural problems, particularly in the construction 
sector."
"The economies of India and Indonesia expand-
ed strongly last year, with an anticipated growth of 
6.7% and 5,0 % respectively."
"The IMF expects an in-
crease of 1.8% in Australia’s GDP."
"With anticipated growth of 3.3%, emerging countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa are expected to have developed 
more weakly than in the previous year, partly due to the 
relatively slow momentum in China."
"Together with pop-
ulation growth and gross domestic product per capita, 
economic growth is one of the most important indica-
tors for measuring the development of construction 
activity in emerging countries."
"The average value of the euro rose in 2023, in particular 
against the US dollar, the Australian dollar, the Cana-
dian dollar, the British pound, the Indonesian rupiah, 
and the Moroccan dirham."
"Meanwhile, the value of the 
euro fell against the Polish złoty and the Czech koruna."
"Due in partly to mild weather in many countries in the 
northern hemisphere and the resulting reduction in en-
ergy consumption, market prices for energy in general 
and therefore costs in most countries fell on average in 
the 2023 financial year compared with 2022."
"However, 
they remained above the level seen before the Russia- 
Ukraine war."
"As the pro-
duction and marketing of building materials is localised 
and only represents a small percentage of global trade, 
we focus on the countries and regions that are relevant 
to us instead of taking a global view."
"Details of the 
­
development in the individual countries can be found in 
the Business trend in the Group areas ­
section."
"In the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), compa-
nies are allocated a proportion of their emission allow-
ances at no cost, according to industry-specific bench-
marks, as long as they are affected by the risk of 
production being shifted abroad (carbon leakage)."
"Every company is required to submit sufficient emission 
allowances to cover its total emissions for the preced-
ing financial year by a compliance deadline in Septem-
ber."
"In the EU ETS, if a company does not have enough 
emission allowances by the compliance deadline for 
production reasons, it must purchase allowances – or 
face heavy penalties."
"All of Heidelberg Materials’ 
­
cement production facilities in Europe fall within the 
EU ETS."
"Although the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM) will not officially start until 2026, we have been 
required to collect data on imported products, such as 
cement and clinker, since the fourth quarter of 2023."
"The average price of carbon allowances in the 2023 
financial year was around €80, slightly below the 
2022 value."
"Development of volumes 
In 2023, high worldwide inflation rates, increased 
­
financing costs, and persistently high energy and raw 
material prices significantly impaired construction 
­
activity and thus demand for our building materials."
"­
Volumes developed differently in the individual Group 
­
ar­
eas."
"The decline in demand in private residential con-
struction, which was massive in some cases, could not 
be offset by a solid development in industrial commer-
cial construction and infrastructure projects."
"As a re-
sult, our volumes declined to varying degrees in all 
business lines in the 2023 financial year."
"Overall, the Group’s cement and clinker deliveries were 
noticeably below the previous year’s level, with varia-
tions in performance in the individual Group areas."
"The 
greatest decreases in volumes were seen in the West-
ern and Southern Europe Group area and in Africa- 
Eastern Mediterranean Basin."
"A moderate increase was 
recorded in our deliveries in Asia-Pacific."
Deliveries of aggregates also saw a moderate decline.
"While volumes increased slightly in the Africa-Eastern 
Mediterranean Basin Group area, they decreased slight-
ly in North America and Asia-Pacific, significantly in 
Western and Southern Europe, and noticeably in North-
ern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia."
"Deliveries of ready-mixed concrete fell in all Group 
­
areas, in some cases significantly, with the highest 
­
decreases in volumes recorded in Europe and North 
America."
Asphalt deliveries declined slightly across the Group.
"The significant drop in volumes in North America and a 
strong downward trend in the Africa-Eastern Mediter-
ranean Basin Group area could not be fully offset by a 
significant increase in volumes in Asia-Pacific."
"For a detailed description of the regional develop-
ment of volumes, we refer to the Business trend in 
the Group areas section."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the increase amounted to 4.4%."
"In particular, price adjustments in all Group areas con-
tributed to the revenue growth."
"Changes to the scope 
of consolidation had a positive impact of €130 mil-
lion, while currency effects had a negative impact of 
€937 million on revenue."
"Sustainable products account-
ed for 39.5% of revenue in the cement business line."
"In the reporting year, material costs fell by 8.9% to 
€8,160 million (previous year: 8,961)."
"This decline is 
largely due to lower energy costs."
"Excluding scope and 
currency effects, material costs declined by 4.5%."
"The 
material cost ratio decreased to 38.5% (previous 
year: 42.5)."
"Other operating expenses fell slightly to 
€6,269 million (previous year: 6,360)."
"Currency and 
scope effects had a negative impact, leading to an 
­
increase of 2.1%."
"Other operating income fell by 10.0% 
to €562 million (previous year: 624)."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the decline amounted to 9.9%."
"Due to salary increases and bonuses, personnel costs 
rose by 6.2% to €3,415 million (previous year: 3,217)."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, the rise amount-
ed to 8.1%."
"At €234 million (previous year: 262), the 
­
result from equity accounted investments (REI) was 
10.7% below the previous year’s level."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the result was up 8.3% on the 
previous year’s figure."
"This was due in particular to 
earnings increases in Australia and Turkey."
"The result from current operations before depreciation 
and amortisation (RCOBD) rose significantly by 13.9% 
to €4,258 million (previous year: 3,739)."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the RCOBD was up 19.2% on the 
previous year’s level."
"The increase in earnings was at-
tributable to active cost and price management as well 
as lower energy costs."
"The RCOBD margin was 20.1% 
(previous year: 17.7)."
"The result from current operations 
(RCO) rose sharply by 22.1% to €3,022 million (previous 
year: 2,476)."
"Changes to the scope of consolidation 
had a negative impact of €23 million on the RCO and 
currency effects had a negative impact of €123 million."
"On a like-for-like basis, the RCO was 29.5% above the 
previous year’s level."
"The additional ordinary result amounted to €1 million 
(previous year: –193)."
"The additional ordinary expenses 
amounted to €164 million and included impairments of 
at equity accounted investments and of other intan-
gible assets and property, plant and equipment of 
€70 million, rebranding expenses of €20 million, and re­
structuring expenses of €19 million."
"In the previous year, 
the result was especially impacted by impairments on 
­
non-current assets of €166 million."
"Earnings before in-
terest and ­
taxes (EBIT) rose sharply by €741 million to 
€3,023 million (previous year: 2,282)."
"Overall, the financial result fell by €109 million to 
€–174 mil­
lion (previous year: –65)."
"The interest result 
declined by €13 million to €–132 million (previous year: 
–119)."
"The exchange rate result improved by €74 million 
to €–25 million (previous year: –99), due in particular to 
lower foreign exchange losses in Egypt recognised in 
profit or loss."
"The other financial result fell by €164 mil-
lion to €–23 million (previous year: 140)."
"€119 million of 
the decrease was attributable to a positive effect in the 
previous year due to higher interest rates for discount-
ing provisions."
"Profit before tax from continuing oper-
ations rose by €632 million to €2,849 million (previous 
year: 2,217)."

At €659 million (previous year: 485), expenses for 
­
income taxes were €174 million above the previous 
year’s  value."
"The rise is primarily due to improved 
­
profit before tax."
"Net loss from discontinued operations amounted to 
€–104 million (previous year: –9) and includes income 
and expenses incurred in connection with discontinued 
operations of the Hanson Group in previous years and 
that result from provisions for damages and environ-
mental obligations."
"Profit for the financial year increased to €2,087 million 
(previous year: 1,723)."
"The profit relating to non-con-
trolling interests amounted to €158 million (previous 
year: 126)."
"The profit for the financial year attributable 
to the shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG rose by

"Earnings per share attributable to Heidelberg Materials 
AG shareholders increased by €1.98 to €10.43 (previous 
year: 8.45)."
"Excluding the additional ordinary result, 
adjusted profit for the financial year rose by 7.7% to 
€1,928 million (previous year: 1,790)."
"Adjusted earnings 
per share increased accordingly by €0.95 to €10.42 
(previous year: 9.47)."
"The Managing Board and Supervisory Board will pro-
pose to the Annual General Meeting the distribution of 
a dividend of €3.00 (previous year: 2.60) per share."
"Business trend in the Group areas
Western and Southern Europe
Heidelberg Materials operates production sites in sev-
en countries in the Western and Southern Europe Group 
area."
"In these markets, we manufacture cement, ag-
gregates, and ready-mixed concrete, and are active in 
construction waste and demolition concrete recycling."
"In addition, we produce asphalt in the United Kingdom 
and precast concrete and concrete products in Germany."
"Heidelberg Materials focused on its core markets in the 
2023 financial year and expanded its recycling busi-
ness in Germany with two acquisitions: RWG Holding 
GmbH and SER Group."
"In Spain, we completed the final 
step in the realignment of our activities towards north-
ern Spain with the divestment of our business activities 
in Madrid."
"In France, the logistics business Tratel was 
sold with effect from 1 January 2024."
"The disposal of 
the transport business puts a stronger focus on the key 
activities of Heidelberg Materials France and is part of 
the ongoing portfolio optimisation, which concentrates 
on the core business in promising market positions."
"The IMF (January 2024 and October 2023) forecasts 
moderate GDP growth for all countries in 2023, with the 
economy growing by 0.5% in the United Kingdom, 0.7% 
in Italy, 1.0% in Belgium, 0.8% and 0.6% respectively in 
France and the Netherlands, and declining by 0.3% in 
Germany."
"However, construction activity in 2023 is ex-
pected to have been weak in almost all countries of the 
Group area."
"Euroconstruct’s November 2023 forecast 
anticipates declines in construction activity in 2023 
ranging from 0.3% in Belgium to 2.3% in Germany, while 
it is expected to have increased by 0.6% in the Nether-
lands and 2.8% in Spain."
"Cement business line
In 2023, the Western and Southern Europe Group ar-
ea’s cement and clinker volumes decreased significant-
ly, with all countries experiencing a slowdown."
"To compensate inflation, all countries were able to in-
crease their prices significantly, which more than offset 
the volume decreases."
"As a result, revenue of the ce-
ment business line in the Western and Southern Europe 
Group area rose by 1.4% to €3,432 million (previous 
year: 3,385)."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, the 
rise amounted to 3.2%."
"Significant progress was made in modernising our ce-
ment plants in France, with Bussac being commissioned 
and Airvault under construction."
"The raw meal silo and 
the foundations for all the key building sections and 
structures have been completed."
"Furthermore, essen-
tial machinery has been delivered and the assembly of 
plant components has begun."
"In northern Germany, we 
continued to work on optimising our locations and 
modernising our plants."
"All countries made progress in 
reducing their carbon footprint."
"In 2023, we made significant progress with our CCUS 
projects."
"In Germany, the GeZero CCS project in Ge­
seke was selected for the EU Innovation Fund."
"Together 
with Linde, Heidelberg Materials is implementing a pilot 
project for the use of CO2 as a raw material for the 
food and chemical industries."
"As part of this, the first 
large-scale CCU facility is being built at the Lengfurt 
cement plant in Germany."
"Combined management report

The CCS project in Padeswood, United Kingdom, qual-
ified for funding from the UK Department for Energy 
Security and Net Zero in March 2023, and detailed 
planning has begun."
"Numerous other projects are at an advanced stage 
of  development (see Research and development 
chapter)."
"Aggregates business line
The Group area’s deliveries of aggregates also de-
creased in line with construction demand."
"While vol-
umes decreased significantly in Germany, Italy, Bel-
gium, and France, the decline was only slight in the 
United Kingdom."
"As a result of the positive price development in all coun-
tries, at €1,398 million (previous year: 1,383), revenue in 
the aggregates business line was 1.1% above the previ-
ous year."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, the rise 
amounted to 2.1%."
"Ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line
Volumes of ready-mixed concrete dropped significant-
ly in the reporting year."
"The decrease was more pro-
nounced in the Netherlands – impacted by the legisla-
tion on nitrogen emissions – followed by Germany."
"With 
single-digit decreases in volumes, volumes developed 
better in the United Kingdom and France."
"Asphalt activities in the Group area are limited to the 
United Kingdom, where asphalt volumes reduced slight-
ly compared with the previous year due to weaker con-
struction activity."
"At €2,372 million (previous year: 2,376), revenue of the 
ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line was at the 
previous year’s level (–0.2%)."
"Excluding currency ef-
fects, revenue increased by 0.5%."
"Service-joint ventures-other business line 
The service-joint ventures-other business line includes 
the precast concrete parts and concrete products op-
erating lines in Germany as well as the newly acquired 
recycling business."
"Due to the first-time consolidation of the recycling 
business, revenue of the business line increased to 
€490 million (previous year: 406) and was thus 20.6% 
above the previous year."
"Excluding scope and currency 
effects, the rise amounted to 1.2%."
"Revenue and results
The price increases to offset cost inflation led to a 
slight increase in revenue and a strong increase in re-
sults in the Western and Southern Europe Group area, 
despite lower volumes."
"Revenue of the Western and Southern Europe Group 
area rose by 2.0% to €6,437 million (previous year: 
6,308)."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, the rise 
amounted to 2.1%."
"The result from current operations before depreciation 
and amortisation (RCOBD) rose by 33.5% to €1,212 mil-
lion (previous year: 908)."
"The result from current oper-
ations (RCO) increased by 57.1% to €864 million (previ-
ous year: 550)."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, 
the RCOBD and RCO increased by 34.1% and 59.2%, 
respectively."
"In many of these countries, we produce cement as well 
as aggregates and ready-mixed concrete, and in some 
we also manufacture concrete products."
"In line with the IMF’s October forecast for 2023, the 
economies in the countries of the Group area largely 
developed positively."
"In Kazakhstan, Greece, and Nor-
way, economic output is estimated to have increased 
by 4.6%, 2.5%, and 2.3%, respectively."
"GDP growth of 
2.2% is forecast for Romania and 1.7% for Bulgaria and 
Denmark each, while growth in Poland and Czechia is 
virtually stagnant (+0.6% and +0.2% respectively)."
"In 
Sweden and Estonia, economic output is expected to 
decline by 0.7% and 2.3% respectively."
"Construction activity in some countries of the Northern 
and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area devel-
oped negatively in 2023, according to Euroconstruct’s 
November forecast."
"The construction industry in Swe-
den is expected to have shrunk by 10.6% and was par-
ticularly negatively affected by residential construc-
tion."
"In Norway, too, the 2.8% slowdown in construction 
activity is the result of the sharp decline in residential 
construction."
"Growth of 2.2% is forecast for the Polish 
construction industry, which is expected to have been 
driven by civil engineering and building construction."
A slight decline of 1.8% is anticipated in Czechia.
"As part of our portfolio optimisation, we completed 
the  disposal of our 45% participation in Georgia in 
April 2023."
"The joint venture comprised two cement 
plants, fourteen ready-mixed concrete plants, and two 
aggregates plants."
"Cement business line
The cement and clinker volumes of the Northern and 
Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area declined sig-
nificantly in most countries."
"The main reason for this 
development was the slowdown in construction activi-
ty."
"In Romania, Greece, and Bulgaria, on the other 
hand, we were able to increase our deliveries."
"Price in-
creases were successfully implemented in all countries."
"Revenue of the cement business line rose by 6.5% to 
€2,058 million (previous year: 1,933)."
"Excluding curren-
cy effects, the rise amounted to 12.0%."
"Over the course of 2023, we continued to make pro-
gress with our CCUS projects."
"In Brevik, Norway, we 
anticipate mechanical completion of the world’s first 
industrial-scale carbon capture plant in the cement in-
dustry by the end of 2024."
"In the third quarter of 2023, 
the absorber, in which CO2 will be separated from the 
flue gas flow, was installed."
"The tanks for temporary 
storage of the CO2 prior to transport have also al-
ready been constructed."
"In January 2023, Heidelberg 
Materials signed a grant agreement with the EU Inno-
vation Fund for the CCUS project in Devnya, Bulgaria."
"Construction of a pilot plant began in October 2023 
(see Research and development chapter)."
"Aggregates business line
The main markets in the aggregates business line are 
in Northern Europe as well as in Czechia and Poland."
"Deliveries of aggregates decreased noticeably in 2023, 
mainly due to delays in major building projects, with 
varying developments in the Group countries."
"While 
­
Romania, Czechia, and Poland recorded significant 
­
declines in volumes, volumes in Sweden increased mod-
erately."
"By contrast, the cross-border Mibau Group, 
which has by far the largest volumes in the Group area, 
recorded a slight decline in volumes."
"Price increases 
were successfully implemented in most countries."
"Revenue in the aggregates business line increased by 
5.5% to €679 million (previous year: 644)."
"Excluding 
currency effects, the rise amounted to 6.0%."
"Ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line
The main markets in the ready-mixed concrete busi-
ness line are in Northern and Eastern Europe."
"We are 
not active in the asphalt business in this Group area."
"Ready-mixed concrete deliveries in the Group area 
­
decreased significantly in 2023, mainly due to the 
­
substantial decline in residential construction."
"Price in-
creases were successfully implemented in all countries."
"Revenue in the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business 
line fell by 4.3% to €684 million (previous year: 715)."
"­
Excluding currency effects, the decline amounted to 
only 1.5%."
"Service-joint ventures-other business line
This business line includes the concrete products of 
Nordic Precast Group, which is active in Denmark, Es-
tonia, Norway, and Sweden, as well as our cement joint 
ventures in Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"In many 
countries, we also operate joint ventures, particularly 
in the ready-mixed concrete business."
"Combined management report
2023 economic ­
report 
Heidelberg Materials 2023
92
The cement volumes of our joint venture in Bosnia-­
Herzegovina rose significantly, whereas the volumes of 
our joint venture in Hungary declined significantly."
"The 
positive development in Bosnia-Herzegovina benefited 
from the continuation of construction work on existing 
major infrastructure projects, increased residential and 
commercial construction, and the start of new signif­
icant infrastructure projects."
"Hungary, on the other 
hand, recorded a decline in both GDP and the con-
struction sector in general."
"Revenue of the service-joint ventures-other business 
line, which was generated almost exclusively by Nordic 
Precast Group, fell by 14.1% to €476 million (previous 
year: 554)."
"Excluding currency effects, the decline 
amounted to 7.3%."
"Revenue of our joint ventures is not 
included here, as these are accounted for at equity."
"At €3,617 million (previous year: 3,600), revenue of the 
Northern and Eastern Europe-Central Asia Group area 
was at the previous year’s level (+0.5%)."
"Excluding cur-
rency effects, the rise was 5.0%."
"At €787 million (previous year: 730), the result from cur-
rent operations before depreciation and amortisation 
(RCOBD) was 7.9% above the previous year’s figure."
"The result from current operations (RCO) rose by 12.2% 
to €599 million (previous year: 534)."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the RCOBD and RCO were re-
spectively 15.0% and 20.7% below the previous year’s 
value."
"In addition, concrete pipes are manufac-
tured in Canada."
"In May 2023, as part of our strategy to strengthen our 
portfolio of secondary cementitious materials (SCMs), 
we acquired The SEFA Group, the largest US recycler 
of harvested fly ash for use in concrete products."
"The 
SEFA Group includes five business units, five utility 
partners, 20 locations, and more than 500 employees, 
supplying quality fly ash to more than 800 concrete 
plants in 13 US states."
"The reuse of fly ash from energy 
generation in alternative products such as composite 
cements significantly strengthens circularity within 
Heidelberg Materials’ value chain in North America."
"We also expanded our aggregates market presence in 
2023 with several bolt-on acquisitions."
"In April 2023, 
Heidelberg Materials acquired RMS Gravel Inc., a 
­
manufacturer of sand and gravel products located 
in the Central New York market."
"In September 2023, 
Heidelberg Materials acquired the aggregates business 
of Green Drop Rock Products in Canada."
"Green Drop 
Rock Products manufactures aggregates at its plant in 
Cochrane, Alberta, and supplies the market in the Cal-
gary Metropolitan Region."
"In its January 2024 forecast, the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF) predicts an increase in the USA’s gross 
domestic product in 2023 of 2.5% compared with an 
increase of 1.9% in the previous year."
"For Canada, the IMF predicts (January forecast) an in-
crease of 1.1% in gross domestic product for 2023, 
compared with an increase of 3.8% in 2022."
"Cement business line
Cement and clinker volumes of our plants were moder-
ately below the previous year."
Volumes in the Midwest region declined slightly in 2023.
"While volumes in the Southeast region increased with 
strong construction activity, the Northeast and North-
west regions recorded a moderate decline in sales vol-
umes due to slower market activity."
"Significant price increases in all regions more than off-
set the decrease in sales volumes."
"As a result, revenue 
of the cement business line increased by 11.3% in 2023 
to €2,196 million (previous year: 1,974)."
"On a like-for-like 
basis, excluding scope and currency effects, revenue of 
the cement business line increased by 11.0%."
"Heidelberg Materials entered into a partnership with 
the Canadian government in April 2023 for the con-
struction of the world’s first net-zero facility for full-
scale carbon capture and storage in the cement in­
dustry in Edmonton."
"The plant is scheduled to go into 
operation in 2026."
"In June 2023, we celebrated the opening of the mod-
ernised cement plant in Mitchell, Indiana, the second- 
largest cement plant in the North America Group area."
"The state-of-the-art plant will significantly reduce 
CO2 emissions and energy consumption for Heidelberg 
Materials North America (see Research and develop-
ment chapter)."
"The expansion of our slag cement plant 
and terminal in Cape Canaveral, Florida, was complet-
ed in May 2023."
"This is another milestone in our Group 
strategy to grow our portfolio of sustainable products, 
technologies, and customer-focused solutions on the 
path to net zero."
"Aggregates business line
In the USA and Canada, Heidelberg Materials has a net-
work of production sites for sand, gravel, and hard rock."
"Total volumes declined slightly compared with the pre-
vious year."
"In 2023, we recorded volume increases in 
many core markets, with slight growth recorded in the 
Midwest and Southeast regions."
"The increases were 
particularly driven by the impact of large highway infra-
structure and large-scale production facility projects."
"Volumes in the Southwest region remained stable 
as heightened construction activity levels continued, 
where­
as volumes declined significantly in the North-
west and Northeast regions."
"Significant price increases 
were implemented successfully in all market regions of 
the USA and Canada."
"Revenue in the aggregates business line increased by 
5.6% to €2,098 million (previous year: 1,987)."
"On a like-
for-like basis, revenue of the aggregates business line 
was 8.9% above the previous year’s value."
"Ready-mixed concrete and asphalt business 
lines
Ready-mixed concrete volumes declined significantly in 
2023 as a result of lower activity in key vertically in­
tegrated markets in the Northwest region."
"Significant 
price increases were implemented successfully in all 
market regions of the USA and Canada."
Asphalt volumes decreased significantly.
"The North-
west and Northeast regions both recorded decreases 
in volumes as activity in core vertically integrated mar-
kets slowed."
"Revenue of the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business 
line decreased by 1.7% to €1,141 million (previous year: 
1,161)."
"Excluding scope and currency effects, revenue 
reduced by 2.1%."
"Service-joint ventures-other business line
This business line includes the concrete pipes operat-
ing line in the Northwest region and other associated 
­
activities, as well as our joint venture Texas Lehigh Ce-
ment Company LP, headquartered in Austin, Texas."
"The 
company, in which we hold a 50% share, operates a 
cement plant in Buda, Texas; its sales volumes de-
creased slightly compared with the previous year."
"Revenue in the business line, which was mainly gener-
ated by the concrete pipes operating line, increased 
by 1.5% to €336 million (previous year: 331)."
"Excluding 
scope and currency effects, revenue increased by 
4.4%."
"Revenue of our joint ventures is not included here, 
as these are accounted for at equity."

creased by 6.4% to €5,219 million (previous year: 4,907)."
"On a like-for-like basis, excluding scope and currency 
effects, revenue was up 8.1% on the previous year."
"The result from current operations before depreciation 
and amortisation (RCOBD) rose significantly by 15.0% 
to €1,181 million (previous year: 1,028)."
"The result from 
current operations (RCO) increased by 22.2% to 
€856 million (previous year: 700)."
"Excluding scope and 
currency effects, RCOBD and RCO increased by 17.5% 
and 26.3%, respectively."
"In Indonesia, the business is vertically integrated in 
­
cement, aggregates, and ready-mixed concrete."
"In In-
dia, Bangladesh, and Brunei, we operate solely in the 
cement business line."
"In Malaysia and Australia, we are 
active in aggregates, ready-mixed concrete, and as-
phalt, with recycled building materials for civil engin­
eering and infrastructure projects also being supplied 
in Australia."
"The Thailand business consists of ready-
mixed concrete in addition to cement."
"We are also rep-
resented via a cement joint venture in Australia, two 
cement joint ventures in mainland China, and two joint 
ventures for ready-mixed concrete and aggregates in 
Hong Kong."
"To strengthen its presence in Indonesia, Heidelberg 
Materials acquired 100% of the shares in the cement 
company PT Semen Grobogan through its subsidiary 
Indocement in November 2023."
"PT Semen Grobogan 
operates an integrated cement plant in Central Java 
that has a capacity of 1.8 million tonnes of clinker, 
2.5 million tonnes of cement, and more than 50 years’ 
worth of limestone reserves."
"In its October 2023 forecast, the IMF anticipated eco-
nomic growth in the Asia and Pacific region of 4.6%, 
compared with 3.9% in the previous year."
"The economy 
in the Asia-Pacific region remains on track and is ex-
pected to contribute about two-thirds of global eco-
nomic growth in 2023, despite the challenges posed by 
the shift of global demand from goods to services and 
the tightening of monetary policy."
"Weak economic re-
covery in China also had an impact on trading partners 
in the region."
"The pandemic-related economic slow-
down in 2022 and the worsening crisis in the property 
sector have weakened consumer confidence in China, 
with GDP growth of 5.0% anticipated in 2023."
"Growth 
in India is expected to remain relatively robust in 2023 
at 6.3%."
"In Indonesia, the IMF anticipates a decline in 
the growth rate to 5.0% as a result of lower capital 
expenditure."
"For Malaysia and Thailand, the IMF fore-
casts growth of 4.0% and 2.7%, respectively."
"High in-
flation and interest rates are expected to push Austra­
lia’s growth rate down from 3.7% in the previous year to 
1.8% in 2023."
"Cement business line
Cement and clinker volumes in the Asia-Pacific Group 
area recorded moderate growth in 2023."
"In Indonesia, accelerated infrastructure expansion was 
an important driver of development in the construc-
tion sector in 2023."
"The increase in the infrastructure 
budget and the construction activity in Kalimantan, 
where the new capital is to be built, led to a significant 
rise in demand for bulk cement."
"The commercial and 
residential construction segments remain under pres-
sure due to oversupply and interest rate hikes."
"The completion of various alternative 
fuel feed systems in the production facilities has helped 
to further increase the use of alternative fuels and 
­
reduce specific CO2 emissions."
"In India, ongoing infrastructure expansion and urbani-
sation across the country continue to act as the back-
bone of the robust construction industry."
"Our cement 
and clinker deliveries increased moderately, as massive 
excess capacities persist in our core markets."
"The com-
missioning of a waste heat recovery system at our plant 
in South India and lower energy costs overall contrib-
uted to the improvement in profitability."
"In Thailand, delays in the formation of a new govern-
ment and in major infrastructure projects have ad-
versely affected market demand."
"The cement sales 
volumes of our plants declined noticeably."
"Despite 
challenging market demand, margins were improved 
through better pricing and greater production efficien-
cy."
"The completion of a 20 MW solar farm has made a 
positive contribution to lowering electricity costs and 
reducing CO2 emissions."
"The use of alternative fuels 
has been further expanded."
"In Bangladesh, persistently high inflation, currency de-
valuation, and high fuel costs led to a significant in-
crease in material costs, leading to a slowdown in 
­
construction activity."
"Our cement deliveries declined 
slightly, but we were able to increase sales prices."
"Supported by investment from the private sector, Bru-
nei’s construction industry recorded a slight recovery."
"The cement sales volumes of our grinding plant in-
creased slightly."
"Revenue of the cement business line rose slightly by 
0.8% to €1,978 million (previous year: 1,961)."
"Excluding 
scope and currency effects, the rise amounted to 6.7%."

In 2023, our aggregates deliveries decreased slightly 
overall."
"In Australia, high inflation and high interest rates, as 
well as labour shortages and supply chain problems, 
led to a moderate decline in our aggregates volumes."
Sales prices were above the previous year’s level.
"In 
Malaysia, our deliveries increased slightly as construc-
tion activity steadily recovered despite labour shortag-
es and supply chain problems."
"Aggregates volumes in 
Indonesia grew significantly."

ing currency effects, revenue increased by 6.7%."
"Ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line
Volumes of ready-mixed concrete fell slightly com-
pared with the previous year."
"While our deliveries in Australia declined moderately 
due to the slowdown in construction activity, Malaysia 
and Thailand achieved noticeable and significant vol-
ume growth respectively as a result of economic recov-
ery and investments from the private sector."
"In Indo-
nesia, volumes of ready-mixed concrete were at the 
previous year’s level."
"Asphalt volumes increased significantly compared with 
the previous year."
"In Malaysia, our deliveries benefited 
from the recovery of the construction industry, and in 
Australia, from the sustained brisk demand."
"Revenue of the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt busi-
ness line grew by 3.1% to €1,338 million (previous year: 
1,298)."
"Excluding currency effects, the increase amount-
ed to 10.2%."
"Volumes of our joint ventures in China were adversely 
affected by the property sector crisis and the weak 
economy."

Revenue and results
Revenue of the Asia-Pacific Group area rose by 2.0% to 
€3,705 million (previous year: 3,633)."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the rise amounted to 8.5%."
"The result from current operations before depreciation 
and amortisation (RCOBD) increased by 7.6% com-
pared with the previous year to €643 million (previous 
year: 598)."
"The result from current operations (RCO) 
rose by 14.0% to €399 million (previous year: 350)."
"Ex-
cluding scope and currency effects, the RCOBD in-
creased by 13.8% and the RCO by 20.6%."
"We 
mainly manufacture cement in the eight countries 
south of the Sahara: Benin, Burkina Faso, the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Liberia, Mozam-
bique, Tanzania, and Togo."
"In South Africa, we have a 
stake in a grinding plant through a joint venture."
"We are 
one of the four biggest cement producers in all coun-
tries except South Africa."
"In North Africa, we are active 
in the cement and ready-mixed concrete business in 
Morocco and Egypt, as well as in the aggregates busi-
ness in Morocco."
"In the Eastern Mediterranean Basin, 
we have a presence in Israel and Turkey."
"In Israel, we 
mainly produce aggregates and ready-mixed con-
crete, and operate a cement import terminal as a sep-
arate line of business."
"Our joint venture Akçansa in 
Turkey is one of the country’s largest cement manufac-
turers and also runs ready-mixed concrete and aggre-
gates operations."
"As part of our portfolio optimisation, we sold our sub-
sidiary Gacem Company Limited in the Gambia."
"We 
operated a cement terminal in the Gambia."
"According to the October 2023 forecast by the IMF, 
economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to 
have slowed to 3.3% in 2023, but remains above the 
global average."
"Strong population growth, urbanisa-
tion, and ongoing negotiations over free trade agree-
ments were among the main drivers of growth."
"On the 
other hand, the decline in international demand, higher 
global interest rates, and continued pressure on ex-
change rates had a negative impact."
"In our largest 
markets, growth rates of 1.2% in Ghana, 5.2% in Tanza-
nia, and 5.4% in Togo are anticipated."
"For the remain-
ing countries, growth expectations range between 
4.4% for Burkina Faso and 7.0% for Mozambique."
"In 
South Africa, growth is expected to be 0.9%."
"Demand for building materials in the countries south of 
the Sahara weakened further in 2023 compared with 
the previous year."
"Ghana’s 
economy in particular is under pressure due to current 
hyperinflation."
"A key indicator is the rising per capita 
consumption of cement, which is still significantly lower 
in the Sub-Saharan countries than in more developed 
or industrialised countries."
"Our production sites, which 
are primarily located close to urban centres, are well 
positioned to serve the growing demand for building 
materials."
"According to the IMF’s October fore-
cast, gross domestic product is estimated to have in-
creased by 2.4% in 2023."
"Pursuant to the IMF’s January 
forecast, Egypt is expected to have achieved econom-
ic growth of 3.8% despite a volatile economic situation."
"Economic growth in Turkey has slowed further and is 
expected to reach 4.0% in 2023 according to the IMF’s 
January forecast."
"This growth is offset by hyperinfla-
tion and a weak local currency."
"In December 2023, Israel’s central bank lowered its 
forecast for economic growth in 2023 from 3% to 2% 
due to the decline in demand in the region."
"Cement business line
The cement and clinker volumes of the Africa-Eastern 
Mediterranean Basin Group area declined noticeably 
in the reporting year."
"In most countries south of the Sahara, cement and 
clinker deliveries fell significantly in 2023."
"The excep-
tions are Benin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
and Mozambique, where significant increases in vol-
umes have been recorded."
"In Morocco, cement and clinker deliveries recovered in 
2023 after a weak previous year and were moderately 
above the previous year’s level."
"In Egypt, our volumes 
declined moderately due to reduced demand from 
large national infrastructure projects."
"In addition, we further expanded our cement activities 
in some of the fast-growing countries."
"One focus of our 
investments was on improving fuel flexibility and alter-
native fuel usage in some core markets and on optimis-
ing clinker use in order to put ourselves in the best 
­
position for future market growth and sustainable com-
petition."
"In 2023, we worked on expanding our product 
portfolio in our core markets."
"Our project for the pro-
duction of calcined clay with our partner CBI Ghana is 
on schedule."

corded a significant increase compared with the previ-
ous year."

"Excluding scope and currency effects, rev-
enue increased by 3.2%."
"Service-joint ventures-other business line
The business line also includes our Turkish joint venture 
Akçansa."
"Cement and clinker volumes of our joint ven-
ture Akçansa were slightly below the previous year’s 
level."
"Revenue of the business line, which was only generated 
by a few non-core activities, fell by 26.3% to €36 million 
(previous year: 49)."
"Excluding currency effects, the  de-
cline amounted to 7.8%."
"Revenue of our joint venture 
Akçansa is not included here, as this is accounted for 
at equity."
"Revenue and results
Revenue of the Africa-Eastern Mediterranean Basin 
Group area decreased by 12.0% to €1,856 million (pre-
vious year: 2,108)."

and amortisation (RCOBD) rose by 2.2% to €474 million 
(previous year: 464)."
"At €370 million (previous year: 
355), the result from current operations (RCO) was 
4.2% above the previous year’s level."
"Excluding scope 
and currency effects, the RCOBD and RCO increased 
by 17.1% and 21.0%, respectively."
"The latter is 
one of the world’s largest trading companies for the 
international procurement, transport, and sale of ce-
ment, clinker, and secondary cementitious materials as 
well as for solid and alternative fuels via sea routes, 
both across the Group and for third-party customers."
"Volumes and revenue are roughly equally split between 
Group and third-party customers."
"Heidelberg Materials 
Trading optimises the utilisation of our production 
world­
wide by balancing supply and demand for cement 
and clinker."
"Heidelberg Materials Trading operates a network of 
­
offices around the globe and supports its customers 
locally."
"The company manages deliveries to custom-
ers  in Europe and Africa from its headquarters in 
Heidelberg, Germany."
"It supports customers in North, 
Central, and South America from its location in Miami, 
Florida, USA."
"In Asia, in addition to the main location in 
Singapore, Heidelberg Materials Trading is also repre-
sented in Dubai."
"Shipping logistics are provided from 
Istanbul and Dubai."
"In the reporting year, Heidelberg Materials Trading’s 
trade volume fell moderately due to the ongoing tense 
global economic situation."
"In the reporting year, 
Heidelberg Materials Trading supplied customers in 
more than 70 importing countries with more than 
1,000 shipments from over 35 exporting countries."
"The 
majority of the deliveries went to Africa, Europe, and 
the Americas."
"Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Spain 
were among the main export countries."
"Revenue and results
Revenue of the Group Services business unit fell sharp-
ly, by 29.3% in comparison with the previous year, to 
€1,260 million (previous year: 1,783), primarily because 
of decreased material prices and freight rates."
"The result from current operations before depreciation 
and amortisation was €31 million (previous year: 35), 
9.2% lower than in the previous year."
"The result from 
current operations also decreased by 9.2% to €31 mil-
lion (previous year: 34)."
"Both results were primarily 
­
impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations be-
tween the US dollar and the euro."
"Changes in working capital improved 
strongly by €600 million compared with the previous 
year to €–205 million (previous year: –805)."
"This is due 
in particular to the significantly lower increase in inven-
tories compared with the previous year."
"In the previous 
year, inventories had risen sharply as a result of energy 
and raw material prices."
"The reduction in factoring pro-
grammes in the reporting year increased working cap-
ital by €131 million."
"The previous year saw a reduction 
in working capital of €142 million due to an increase in 
factoring programmes."
"Higher net interest payments 
and tax payments had a negative impact on cash flow 
from operating activities."
"Interest received decreased 
by €114 million to €159 million (previous year: 273), 
mainly as a result of lower proceeds from interest rate 
swaps."
"Interest paid increased by €110 million to 
€322 million (previous year: 212), in particular due to 
higher interest payments for interest rate swaps and 
bonds."
"Income taxes paid rose by €162 million to 
€522 million (previous year: 360), primarily owing to the 
positive development of results."
"Cash outflow from investing activities  remained stable 
in the reporting year at €1,480 million, compared with 
€1,482 million in the previous year."
"Cash-relevant invest-
ments increased slightly by €39 million to €1,850 mil­
lion 
(previous year: 1,811)."
"Through continued investment 
discipline, payments for the acquisition of property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets less sub­
sidies received were reduced by €24 million compared 
with the previous year to €1,235 million (previous year: 
1,260)."
"In the previous year, the payments resulted mainly 
from business combinations in the United Kingdom and 
North America."
"Investments in financial assets, asso-
ciates, and joint ventures amounting to €200 million 
(previous year: 488) primarily relate to the acquisition 
and granting of loans totalling €151 million."
"Payments 
in the previous year related to the acquisition of a 
non-controlling interest in Command Alkon at €326 mil-
lion, the indirect acquisition of 50% of the shares in CBI

and optimising our capacities amounted to €1,059 mil-
lion (previous year: 1,289), and €791 million (previous

"Regarding the cash-relevant divestments of €370 mil-
lion (previous year: 329), proceeds of €208 million 
(­
previous year: 39) related to the disposal of financial 
­
assets, joint ventures, and associates."
"Proceeds pri-
marily resulted from the disposals of the joint venture 
in Georgia and the Chaney Group in the USA."
"Proceeds 
from the disposal of subsidiaries and other business 
units less the cash and cash equivalents disposed of 
amounted to €27 million in the reporting year (previous 
year: 145) and largely resulted from the sale of the 
business in the Madrid region of Spain."
"Proceeds in the 
previous year mainly concerned divestments in Greece 
and Spain."
"Proceeds from the sale of intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment in the reporting

Indonesia, through the acquisition of own shares."
"The cash inflow arising from the net proceeds from and

"As at 31 December 2023, none of the 
commercial papers issued by Heidelberg Materials AG 
remained outstanding."
"The share buyback programme announced on 9 Au-
gust 2021 was completed with the third tranche on 
30 October 2023."
"In the third tranche, a total of 
4,117,499 shares were repurchased for €297.6 million 
and held as treasury shares."
"In September 2023, the 
Managing Board resolved to cancel all shares acquired 
within the second tranche with a reduction in the sub-
scribed capital."
"On 21 February 2024, all repurchased 
shares of the third tranche were also cancelled (see 
also Note 9.7)."
"The term of the sustainability-linked syndicated cred-
it  facility of €2 billion was extended by one year in 
March 2023 in accordance with the terms of the agree-
ment."
"On 6 April, a third sustainability indicator was 
specified for determining the credit margin."
"In addition 
to the previous performance indicators – specific net 
CO2 emissions per tonne of cementitious material and 
alternative fuel rate – lost time injury frequency rate  is 
now also used as an indicator."
"The target achievement 
of these KPIs has an impact on the credit margin."
"The 
credit facility essentially serves as liquidity back-up 
and can be used for cash drawdowns in an amount of 
€1,699 million as well as for letters of credit and guar-
antees in an amount of €301 million."
"As at 31 Decem-
ber, only €171 million had been drawn down."
"The free 
credit line thus amounted to €1,829 million at the end 
of 2023."

Factoring and reverse factoring programmes are also 
used."
"The financing volume of the factoring pro-
grammes amounted to €722 million (previous year: 
864) as at the reporting date."
"As at the reporting date, 
there were trade payables of €342 million (previous 
year: 399) under reverse factoring programmes, which 
are settled by external payment service providers."
"These instruments do not lead to a significant concen-
tration of liquidity risk."
"Heidelberg Materials has free 
credit lines and liquidity, so that no liquidity risks can 
arise if these instruments are discontinued."
"Overall, it is ensured that, as at the reporting date, all 
Group companies have sufficient headroom for cash 
drawdowns as well as for letters of credit and guaran-
tees to enable them to finance operational business 
and investments."
"Heidelberg Materials has a long-term financing struc-
ture and a well-balanced debt maturity profile."
"Debt maturity profile as at 31 December 2023 1) in €m
1) Excluding reconciliation adjustments of liabilities of €–112.7 million (accrued transaction costs, issue prices, and fair value adjustments) as well as derivative liabilities 
of €194.9 million."
"Excluding also  
puttable minorities with a total amount of €79.3 million; excluding financial lease  
liabilities."
"The outlook for our credit rating remains 
on stable."
"We raised our 
original outlook from the Annual Report 2022 several 
times during the year."
"The RCO developed in line with 
the outlook from the Quarterly Statement January to 
September 2023, which was adjusted in the past finan-
cial year."
"As a result of the better than originally expected devel-
opment of the RCO, ROIC improved accordingly."
"We 
also raised its outlook in the Quarterly Statement 
­
January to September 2023."
"At 10.3%, ROIC was in line 
with the adjusted outlook."
"As per the 2023 outlook, we succeeded in slightly re-
ducing our specific net CO2 emissions by 3% to 534 kg 
per tonne of cementitious material."
"This 
corres­
ponds to approximately 2.21% of the company’s 
subscribed share capital before cancellation and 
­
capital reduction."
"The Supervisory Board approved 
the  cancellation on 21 February 2024."
"Following the 
cancellation of the shares and the capital reduction, 
the subscribed share capital of Heidelberg Materials 
AG amounts to €546,204,360 and is divided into 
182.068.120 no-par value shares, each representing 
a notional amount of €3.00 of the subscribed share 
capital."
"On 21 February 2024, the Managing Board decided, 
with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to launch 
a new share buyback programme with a total volume 
of up to €1.2 billion (excluding incidental acquisition 
costs) which is expected to be completed by the end of 
2026 at the latest."
"It is planned to carry out the share 
buyback in three tranches."
"The first tranche shall start 
in the second quarter after the 2024 Annual General 
Meeting of Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The share buyback 
will be carried out via the stock exchange."
"Statements on ­
Heidelberg Materials AG
In addition to the Group management reporting, the 
parent company’s development is described below."
"In 
contrast to the consolidated financial statements, the 
annual financial statements of Heidelberg Materials AG 
are prepared in accordance with German commercial 
law."
"As the parent company, Heidelberg Materials AG plays 
the leading role in the Group."
"It is also operationally 
active in Germany in the cement business line with 
­
eleven cement and grinding plants."
"The results of 
Heidelberg Materials AG are significantly influenced by 
its directly and indirectly held subsidiaries and partici-
pations."
"Regarding financing, Heidelberg Materials AG 
plays the key role within the Group."
"The outlook for the 
Group also applies to Heidelberg Materials AG."
"Devia-
tions are described below."
"Earnings position
Due to price adjustments, revenue in the cement busi-
ness line increased by €4 million to €777 million (previ-
ous year: 773), despite lower sales volumes."
"Overall, revenue of Heidelberg 
Materials AG increased by €19 million to €1,044 million 
(previous year: 1,025)."
"Compared with the 2022 financial year, the material 
costs decreased by €55 million to €386 million (previ-
ous year: 441)."
"This was primarily due to the lower sales 
volumes in the 2023 financial year and lower energy 
costs."
"Personnel costs rose by €18 million to €305 mil-
lion (previous year: 287), mainly due to annual wage 
and salary adjustments."
"Overall, operating result in-
creased by €1 million to €44 million (previous year: 43)."
"Income from profit transfer agreements of €992 million 
(previous year: 14) was exclusively attributable to 
Heidelberg Materials International Holding GmbH, 
whose profit in the current year was mainly influenced 
by dividends of its subsidiaries in the amount of 
€850 million."
"Income from investments decreased to 
€12 million (previous year: 130) due to lower dividends 
from subsidiaries."
"The main amount in 2022 came from 
a dividend of €80 million from Heidelberg Materials 
­
Beton DE GmbH."
"Combined management report
2023 economic report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 108
Other interest and similar income decreased by 
€66 million to €282 million (previous year: 348), and 
this was mainly due to lower income from interest rate 
swaps."
"An increase in the fair value of the participation 
in Akçansa Çimento Sanayi ve Ticaret A.Ş., Turkey, re-
sulted in a write-up on financial assets totalling 
€143 million."
"The increase in interest and similar ex-
penses of €350 million to €602 million (previous year: 
252) is due to the higher interest rate level for bonds 
and loans from intra-Group financing activities and the 
raising of new loans."
"The impairment on financial as-
sets in the financial year included €15 million on the 
loan from Heidelberg Materials Suez Cement S.A.E., 
Egypt, as this is no longer expected to be fully recover-
able."
"As part of the Group-wide financing and liquidity man-
agement measures, currency positions arise that are 
hedged by means of external foreign exchange trans-
actions, which are appropriate in terms of maturities 
and amounts."
"As these hedging transactions do not, as 
a rule, relate to any valuation units, currency and inter-
est gains or currency and interest losses may arise."
"In 
accordance with the imparity principle, provisions for 
risks arising from hedging transactions were recog-
nised at the end of the year to the extent of the nega-
tive market values of the currency swaps of €5 million 
(previous year: €79)."
"In the reporting year, currency 
expenses and income almost balanced each other out."
The result fell to €2 million (previous year: 32).
"In the 
previous year, the effect was largely influenced by the 
performance of the US dollar."
"Profit for the 2023 financial year totalled €806 million 
(previous year: 257), mainly due to higher income 
from profit transfer agreements."
"Balance sheet profit 
amounted to €536 million (previous year: 494)."
"Balance sheet
The balance sheet total increased by €2.0 billion com-
pared with the previous year to €27.8 billion (previous 
year: 25.8)."
"Total fixed assets rose by €1.6 billion to 
€24.8 billion (previous year: 23.2)."
"This was mainly due 
to the intra-Group acquisition of PT Indocement Tung-
gal Prakarsa Tbk, Indonesia, in the amount of €1.2 bil-
lion and a loan granted to Heidelberg Materials France 
S.A.S., France, in the amount of €0.2 billion."
"The in-
crease in current assets of €0.4 billion to €3.0 billion 
(previous year: 2.6) results from a higher bank balance, 
which is due to fixed-term deposits of €1.8 billion and 
reduced receivables from subsidiaries of €1.4 billion."
"Receivables decreased due to the intra-Group acquisi-
tion of PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa Tbk, Indonesia."
"On the equity and liabilities side, equity remained at 
the previous year’s level of €11.3 billion due to the divi-
dend distribution of €0.5 billion and expenses connect-
ed with the share buyback programme of €0.3 billion, 
which was offset by a profit for the financial year of 
€0.8 billion."
"At €0.9 billion (previous year: 0.9), provi-
sions remained at the previous year’s level."
"Liabilities 
increased by €2.1 billion to €15.7 billion (previous year: 
13.6)."
"This was mainly due to the increase in liabilities to 
subsidiaries of €1.5 billion to €12.9 billion (previous 
year: 11.4) as a result of intra-Group financial transac-
tions, including intra-Group dividend payments, and 
the issue of a bond in the amount of €0.8 billion in Jan-
uary 2023."
"As a result, the operating result remained 
at the previous year’s level, while our forecast for 2022 
assumed a slight decline in operating result in 2023."
"Anticipated earnings
For 2024, we anticipate a slight decline in cement rev-
enue, which can only be partially offset by moderately 
falling energy costs."
"Fixed and variable expenses 
are  also expected to fall moderately."
"We expect to 
see a moderate increase in revenue from intra-Group 
­
services."
"We therefore anticipate that the operating 
result for 2024 will be slightly below the 2023 level."

Statements pursuant 
to sections 289a and 
315a of the German 
Commercial Code 
(HGB)
On 31 December 2023, the subscribed share capital of 
Heidelberg Materials AG amounted to €558,556,857."
"It 
is divided into 186,185,619 no-par value bearer shares, 
each with a pro rata amount of €3."
"Each share carries 
one vote at the Annual General Meeting."
"All shares car-
ry the same rights and obligations; there are no differ-
ent classes of shares."
"The Managing Board knows of no 
restrictions concerning voting rights or the transfer of 
shares."
"No bearer of shares has been 
granted special rights giving power of control."
"The company’s Managing Board is appointed and 
­
discharged by the Supervisory Board."
"The Articles of 
Association may be amended by the Annual General 
Meeting with a simple majority of the share capital rep-
resented at the time of voting, except where a greater 
majority is required by law."
"Amendments affecting only 
the wording of the Articles of Association may be made 
by the Supervisory Board."
"Under the Authorised Capital 2020, the 
share capital may be increased by up to a total of 
€178,500,000 by issuing new no-par value bearer 
shares on one or more occasions until 3 June 2025."
"The 
shareholders must be granted subscription rights."
"As at 31 De­
cember 2023, the Authorised Capital 2020 had not 
been used."
"Conditional share capital
In addition, the conditional share capital described be-
low existed as at 31 December 2023."
"The share capital 
was conditionally increased by a further amount of up 
to €115,800,000, divided into up to 38,600,000 new 
no-par value bearer shares (Conditional Capital 2023)."
"The conditional capital increase serves to back the is-
suance of option or conversion rights, or option or con-
version obligations on Heidelberg Materials AG shares."
"The conditional capital increase is only carried out in-
sofar as the Managing Board issues warrant or con-
vertible bonds until 10 May 2028 under the authorisa-
tion of the Annual General Meeting from 11 May 2023 
and the bearers of option or conversion rights make 
use of their rights."
"Warrant or convertible bonds may 
also be issued with option or conversion obligations."
"The shareholders generally have a subscription right to 
newly issued warrant or convertible bonds."
"The author-
isation governs specific cases in which the Managing 
Board may exclude the subscription right of sharehold-
ers to warrant or convertible bonds."
"As at 31 Decem-
ber 2023, the authorisation to issue warrant or con-
vertible bonds forming the basis of the Conditional 
Capital 2023 had not been used."
"Acquisition of treasury shares
Furthermore, the authorisation to acquire treasury 
shares described below existed as at 31 Decem-
ber 2023."
"The authorisation may 
not be used for the purpose of trading in treasury 
shares."
"At no time may more than 10% of the respec-
tive share capital be attributable to the acquired treas-
ury shares combined with other shares that the com-
pany has already acquired and still possesses."
"The 
shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by 
way of a public purchase offer or by means of a public 
call for the submission of offers to sell or by issuing 
rights to sell shares to the shareholders."
"The Managing Board is authorised to 
cancel the acquired treasury shares with the consent 
of the Supervisory Board without further resolution of 
the Annual General Meeting."
"The shares may also be 
cancelled without a capital reduction by adjusting the 
proportional amount of the remaining no-par value 
shares in the company’s subscribed share capital."
"In 
both cases, the Managing Board is authorised to adjust 
the number of no-par value shares in the Articles of 
Association."
"Shareholders’ subscription rights can be 
excluded in certain cases."
"In 2023, the company made 
partial use of the authorisation in the period from 
28 July to 30 October and held 4,117,499 treasury 
shares as at 31 December 2023, corresponding to 
2.21% of the share capital."
"Details on the treasury 
shares acquired in the 2023 financial year are given in 
Note 9.7."
"On 21 February 2024, all treasury shares 
from the third tranche were cancelled with reduction in

gent on a change of control resulting from a takeover 
bid and a summary of the effects thereof are provided 
in the table, pursuant to sections 289a(1)(8) and 315a(1)

"Please note that we are disregarding 
agreements whose potential consequences for the 
company fall below the thresholds of €50 million in a 
singular instance or €100 million in the case of several 
similar agreements, as they will not regularly affect the 
decision of a potential bidder."
"These change of control 
clauses are standard for this industry and type of 
transaction and have not been agreed with the inten-
tion of hindering any takeover bids."
"2)	
No drawings as at 31 December 2023 yet."
"3)	
Of this figure, €55 million was outstanding as at 31 December 2023."
"The Early Put Re-
demption Amount means 101% of the nominal amount 
plus accrued and unpaid interest up to (but not includ-
ing) the repayment date defined in the bond terms."
"Service agreements of members of the Managing 
Board of Heidelberg Materials AG who were appointed 
for the first time before the publication of the version 
of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) of 
16 December 2019 are governed by the version of the 
GCGC of 7 February 2017."
"In accordance with the lat-
ter, a commitment to benefits in the event of the early 
termination of the Managing Board membership as a 
result of a change of control is limited to 150% of the 
severance pay cap."
"The contracts of René Aldach, Roberto Cal-
lieri (appointed since 1 January 2024), Axel Conrads 
(appointed since 1 February 2024), Dr Nicola Kimm, 
and Dennis Lentz therefore do not contain change of 
control clauses."
"There are no compensation agree-
ments of the company with members of the Managing 
Board or with employees in the case of a takeover bid."
"The other details required pursuant to section 289a 
and section 315a of the HGB relate to circumstances 
that do not exist at Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The compa-
ny has decided to integrate it into the management 
report."
"All statements on basic procedure as well as on 
targets, and commitments, responsibility and organi-
sation, policies, processes, measures, and progress 
refer to the Group and, where not shown separately, 
also to the parent company Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The contents of the non-financial statement were not 
audited in the context of the audit of the annual finan-
cial statements and the consolidated financial state-
ments but were subject to an external voluntary audit 
with limited assurance in accordance with ISAE 3000 
(Revised)."
"Use of frameworks
The material topics were determined in 2022 in accord-
ance with the principles of double materiality, taking 
into account the then draft European Sustainability 
­
Reporting Standards (ESRS), 1) and their validity was 
confirmed for this reporting period."
"A materiality anal-
ysis in full compliance with the final ESRS requirements 
1)	 ESRS 1 – General requirements (as at November 2022)
will be submitted for mandatory initial application with 
the 2024 sustainability statement."
"Relationships with the financial statements
Information on amounts in the consolidated financial 
statements that are related to the matters addressed 
in the Non-financial statement are explained in detail 
in Note 9.13."
"In connection with the preservation of biodiversity in 
our quarries, there are provisions for reclamation ob­
ligations, which relate to obligations to backfill and 
­
restore raw material quarrying sites."
"Miscellaneous other provisions exist in particular for 
other litigation risks, for the obligation to return emis-
sion rights, and for compensation obligations to em-
ployees arising from occupational accidents."
"Materiality analysis
In this reporting period, we determined the topics that 
are relevant for Heidelberg Materials by validating the 
results of the previous year’s comprehensive material-
ity analysis."
"The materiality analysis was carried out 
in 2022 with the involvement of internal and external 
stakeholder groups."
"2)	 GRI 3-3 – Management of material topics 2021
As part of this year’s internal validation, the Sustain­
ability Reporting Steering Committee and other rele-
vant departments examined key validation questions."
"The Steering Committee, consisting of the Sustainabil-
ity, Finance, and Digitalisation departments, was es-
tablished in 2022 and serves as a decision-making 
body for all issues relating to sustainability reporting."
"The validation questions include, for example, the ef-
fects of acquisitions or significant changes affecting 
key suppliers."
"The answers to these questions did not 
reveal any significant changes or findings that would 
have made it necessary to adjust the material topics."
"As the corporate body authorised to make decisions, 
the Steering Committee subsequently confirmed the 
material topics for 2023."
"The methodology employed in the analysis follows the 
general principle of double materiality."
"Double mater­
iality incorporates the impact of sustainability topics 
on business relevance and the impact of entrepreneur-
ial activity on the environment and society."
"An online survey and workshops were used to involve 
the following significant stakeholders: shareholders, 
employees, investors, customers, suppliers, manage-
ment, and representatives of associations."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 113
The material topics were derived from the results."
"These were assigned to the non-financial aspects as 
follows:
	
– Environmental matters: climate, energy, and emis-
sions; biodiversity; sustainable products and solu-
tions; circular economy."
"– Employee-related matters: employees, diversity, eq-
uity, and inclusion; occupational health and safety."
"– Compliance: respect for human rights as well as anti- 
corruption and bribery matters."
"Due to its cross-aspect nature, the topic of “respon­
sible procurement” is summarised in a preceding chap-
ter."
"The chapter on environmental matters also in-
cludes information on the six environmental objectives 
pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, in 
compliance with Delegated Regulation 2021/2178."
"Identification of risks
Heidelberg Materials’ risk structure is diversified be-
cause of the decentralised structure of the Group, with 
around 3,000 locations in around 50 countries and the 
largely local supplier framework."
"This also applies to 
climate risks in accordance with the definitions of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), which are linked to the Group’s own business 
activity, business relationships, products, or services."
"Climate risks are reported in the Risk and opportunity 
report."
"Further aspects and recommendations of the 
TCFD on climate reporting are covered in the Addition-
al information chapter."
"Heidelberg Materials has not 
identified any significant non-financial risks connected 
with its own business activity, business relationships, 
products, or services that are highly likely to have a 
serious negative impact on the above-mentioned 
non-financial aspects and own business development."
"Procurement management
Procurement at ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials
Our category leader organisation facilitates the pro-
curement of important commodity groups at Group 
level."
"We bundle process-critical goods and services, 
usually with high volumes, into procurement categories 
in order to obtain better terms and conditions from our 
suppliers."
"The tasks of the category leaders within the 
Group include conducting price negotiations, conclud-
ing framework agreements, supplier management, and 
observing current market and price developments."
"The second component of procurement management 
is the local purchasing at our production sites."
"The local 
purchasing departments also obtain goods and ser-
vices directly via the Group framework agreements."
"In 
this way, we combine the advantages of central and 
local procurement."
"In the reporting year, Heidelberg Materials procured 
goods and services with a total value of €14,122 million."
This corresponds to 66.7% of total revenue.
"Our plants collaborate closely with local suppliers and 
service providers."
"We invest around 90% of our pro-
curement volume in the areas immediately surrounding 
our plants or within the respective country (this value is 
based on an analysis in the countries that use our cen-
tral SAP system and relates to 58% of the annual glob-
al procurement volume)."
"Responsible procurement
­
Ensuring compliance with sustainability standards in the 
supply chain is a key concern for Heidelberg Materials."
"To this end, the supplier base is systematically ana-
lysed for ESG (environmental, social, and governance) 
risks."
"Suppliers are assigned to a risk cat­
egory in line 
with a risk assessment based on countries of origin and 
procurement categories."
"Depending on the category, 
different measures are agreed with suppliers to identify 
and mitigate risks."
"Group-wide procurement guidelines provide clear in-
structions regarding our supplier relations and pro-
curement activities."
"The most important tool used for 
this purpose is our Supplier Code of Conduct, which 
we communicate to our global and local suppliers so 
that they accept the principles defined in the Code 
and ­
follow the guidelines."
"The Code incorporates key 
­
principles of the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) and the requirements of the German Supply 
Chain Due ­
Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichten­
gesetz, LkSG)."
"The defined standards are monitored with the help of 
our partners Avetta and IntegrityNext."
"On behalf of 
Heidelberg Materials, the two partners collect informa-
tion about suppliers in relation to ESG criteria such as 
respect for human rights, environmental standards, 
and compliance and actively review this information as 
necessary."
"In this way, Heidelberg Materials strives to 
Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 114
ensure fair, responsible, and secure procurement pro-
cesses as well as good cooperation along its entire 
supply chain."
"In addition to our focus on human rights, our vision for 
a sustainable supply chain also means that we call 
upon our suppliers to commit to reducing greenhouse 
gases."
"We proactively communicate this message in 
various ways, including at meetings with suppliers and 
through targeted events such as virtual supplier days 
on the topic of sustainability."
"These ambitions, which 
extend beyond the Supplier Code of Conduct, are also 
published on the Heidelberg Materials website."
"The topic of responsible procurement is the responsib­
ility of the Group Procurement department, which re-
ports to the Chief Financial Officer."
"These activi-
ties are brought together in the Responsible Procure-
ment initiative."
"Progress with respect to responsible procurement is 
made transparent with the help of the Supplier Sustain-
ability Performance Rate figure."
"This figure provides 
information on the percentage of Heidelberg Materials’ 
spend with critical suppliers who have received a green 
ESG rating from our partner IntegrityNext."
"Heidelberg 
Materials defines critical suppliers as global suppliers 
that are crucial for our core business and/or able to 
influence the performance of our supply chains and 
­
locations."
"The classification and evaluation of critical 
suppliers is regularly initiated by the category leaders."
"After reviewing the necessary data, the Responsible 
Procurement team invites critical suppliers to be as-
sessed by our partner IntegrityNext."
"Suppliers are 
evaluated on the basis of criteria covering human 
rights, compliance, environmental protection, occupa-
tional safety, and responsibility in the supply chain."
"A 
supplier can only receive a green ESG rating if it offers 
full transparency in answering extensive ESG questions 
and if the assessment by our partner IntegrityNext 
does not reveal any significant risks in the above-men-
tioned topic areas."
"Our aim is to achieve a Supplier 
Sustainability Performance Rate of at least 80% by 
2030."
"In 2023, the figure was 53%."
"Management of sustainability risks  
among suppliers
In addition to assessing critical global suppliers, the 
Responsible Procurement initiative also includes a reg-
ular review of local suppliers to identify sustainability 
risks."
"Insights gained through this review are also used 
to analyse risks in accordance with the German LkSG."
"There are two main steps in this process: (1) identify lo-
cal suppliers with potential risks and (2) increase trans-
parency by means of questionnaires on ESG topics."
"(1) 
Local suppliers with potential ESG risks are identified 
on the basis of available information on country, 
procurement category, and revenue."
"(2) 
Questionnaires on ESG topics for local suppliers 
with potential ESG risks are the foundation of our 
as­
sess­
ments."
"For reasons of consistency, we use 
the same questionnaires from our partners Integrity­
Next and Avetta to assess these local suppliers as 
we do to assess critical suppliers."
"The questions 
they contain are based on the principles of the UN 
Global Compact and the fundamentals of the Ger-
man LkSG."
"We expect our suppliers to meet both 
global and local requirements concerning human 
rights and environmental regulations, and we verify 
this where necessary."
"In the event that a supplier does not comply with our 
sustainability standards, we will endeavour to work 
closely with the supplier to remedy the shortcomings 
and provide support in drawing up and implement-
ing  improvement plans."
"If corrective actions fail, 
Heidelberg Materials reserves the right to terminate 
the contractual relationship as a last resort."
"Information about supplier risks, sustainability assess-
ments by our partners IntegrityNext and Avetta, and 
corrective actions taken is presented transparently in 
our Group-wide SAP Ariba supplier management sys-
tem, where it can be used as a basis for procurement 
decisions."
"All suppliers who register on the platform 
commit themselves to comply with our Supplier Code 
of Conduct."
"In addition, the system supports the Pro-
curement department by issuing notifications about 
negative reporting in connection with suppliers working 
for us, for example in the event of compliance prob-
lems."

Sustainability priorities in our supply chain
Sustainability in the supply chain is important to 
Heidelberg Materials."
"In our work to minimise risks, we 
focus on areas such as environmental protection, 
­
occupational health and safety, compliance, and 
­
human rights."
"Environmental protection
­
Heidelberg Materials requires its suppliers to comply 
with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to en-
vironmental standards."
"For example, suppliers must 
systematically control their environmental impacts 
with regard to emissions, energy, water, waste, and 
bio­
diversity and avoid, minimise, or compensate for 
any such impacts."
"This includes environmental impacts 
that affect access to food, drinking water, sanitation, 
or health."
"In addition, suppliers are expected to com-
mit to implementing appropriate environmental meas-
ures and to continuously improving their environmental 
performance, among other things, via the Supplier 
Code of Conduct."
"Suppliers are asked to promote the environmentally 
friendly production of their goods and provision of their 
services."
"We require suppliers to comply with all appli-
cable local, national, and international laws relating to 
land, water, and resources and to adhere to the appro-
priate standards when handling mercury, persistent 
organic pollutants, and hazardous waste, among other 
things."
"We set ourselves clear targets for reducing environ-
mental impacts in the supply chain."
"For example, we 
have pledged to reduce the absolute Scope 3 CO2 
emissions from purchased goods and services 3) in the 
supply chain by 25% by 2030 compared with 2020."
"3)	 Related to purchased cement and clinker
Occupational health and safety
We expect our service providers to ensure they offer 
safe and healthy working conditions that meet or ex-
ceed the applicable occupational health and safety 
standards."
"Suppliers are required to implement and 
continuously improve appropriate measures and pro-
cedures and to provide safety equipment."
"This is doc-
umented in our Supplier Code of Conduct and also in-
cludes, at a minimum, compliance with the laws and 
regulations in force in the respective country as well 
as proof of the necessary permissions, licences, and 
­
authorisations."
"In addition, as part of our Group policy 
on occupational health and safety, we have defined 
a set of cardinal rules that are mandatory for all em-
ployees and contractors (see Occupational health 
and safety section)."
"Compliance and human rights
Our SpeakUp compliance hotline provides a way to re-
port any illegal activities or violations of international-
ly applicable conventions."
"The commitment to human 
rights aspects in the business context, such as the pro-
hibition of child and forced labour, fair and safe work 
conditions, freedom of association, and a ban on dis-
crimination, is a central selection criterion for suppliers."
"These principles are embedded, among other things, in 
our Supplier Code of Conduct, which is a fundamental 
part of our framework agreements."
"When contracts 
are concluded, an agreement is made with suppliers 
regarding the continuous monitoring of human rights 
risks through regular communications, audits, and 
training."
"This enables us to verify the effectiveness of 
preventive and, if necessary, mitigation measures de-
signed to protect human rights at suppliers."
"Further-
more, agreement to our Supplier Code of Conduct is a 
prerequisite for participating in tenders on our online 
tender platform (see Compliance section)."
"Environmental responsibility 
Climate, energy, and emissions
The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming 
to 1.5°C compared with pre-industrial levels."
"Since a 
consensus was reached at the 26th UN Climate Change 
Conference at the end of 2021, the focus is now on 
implementation."
"To achieve the target, greenhouse gas 
emissions need to be significantly reduced over the 
coming years."
"In some regions of the world, including 
the EU, there are emissions trading systems for this 
purpose."
"A cap is placed on the total volume of speci­
fic 
greenhouse gas emissions and steadily reduced over 
time."
"At the 28th UN Climate Change Conference in De-
cember 2023, a global stocktake of countries’ progress 
on their emission reduction commitments was carried 
out for the first time."
"More and more countries and 
­
regions are setting targets to reach net zero."
"Low-­
emission solutions are becoming more competitive in 
all sectors of the economy."
"However, during the global 
stocktake, it was noted that the current trajectory of 
emission reduction pathways is not on track to meet 
the targets of the Paris Agreement and that further ac-
tion will be needed to keep the 1.5°C target within reach 
and tackle the climate crisis."
"Within the framework of our Group strategy, and in line 
with the Paris Agreement, we are significantly advanc-
ing our ambitious climate targets."
"The direct CO2 emis-
sions arising in the energy-intensive manufacture of 
cement during clinker production in cement kilns are a 
fundamental challenge for us."
"These process-related 
emissions are currently technologically unavoidable."
"That is why, on the one hand, we focus on making pro-
cess improvements, such as maximising the use of al-
ternative fuels, switching to electricity from renewable 
energy sources, or investing in plant efficiency."
"CCUS – carbon cap-
ture, utilisation, and storage – is another essential part 
of our climate strategy."
"By using waste materials and by-products from other 
industries as alternative raw materials and fuels, we 
also promote the circular economy, which can also 
contribute to the reduction of our carbon footprint."
"CO2 emissions that would otherwise have been pro-
duced during the extraction of primary raw materials 
can be avoided through recycling, reuse, renovation 
and maintenance measures, and by extending the 
­
service life of our products (see Circular economy 
­
section)."
"The use of carbon credits, i.e."
"tradable allow-
ances designed to offset a company’s own emissions 
(CO2 compensatory measures), is not part of our emis-
sions reduction strategy."
"In addition to CO2 emissions, cement production also 
causes the release of dust and air pollutants such as 
sulphur oxides (SOX) and nitrogen oxides (NOX)."
"We 
monitor emissions of air pollutants on an ongoing 
­
basis."
"We strive to reduce pollutants by using innova-
tive process technology and emission reduction sys-
tems, thus mitigating the impact of our activities on the 
environment and neighbouring communities."
"Targets and commitments
We want to make our contribution to limiting the rise in 
worldwide temperature to 1.5°C."
"Our reduction targets 
were reviewed, validated, and recognised as science-­
based by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), 
using their methodology, at the end of February 2023."
"Our target is to reduce our specific net CO2 emissions 
to 400 kg per tonne of cementitious material by 2030, 
equalling a reduction of 47% compared with 1990 4) lev-
els."
"We aim to achieve net-zero emissions 5)  by 2050 
at the latest."
"In this context, we made a commitment to the SBTi to 
reduce our specific gross Scope 1 CO2 emissions by 
24% compared with 2020."
"We also want to reduce our 
gross Scope 2 CO2 emissions per tonne of cementitious 
material – i.e."
"indirect emissions from purchased ener-
gy – by 65% between 2020 and 2030."
"Combined across 
these two scopes, this results in a 26.7% reduction over 
this period."
"As part of the SBTi validation, we have also 
set ourselves the target to reduce our absolute Scope 3 
CO2 emissions from purchased goods and services 6) by 
25% by 2030 compared with 2020."
"To reduce our carbon footprint, we will, for instance, 
increase the proportion of alternative fuels in the fuel 
mix to 45% by 2030 and raise the proportion of bio-
mass to 20%."
"At the same time, we plan to increase our 
use of alternative raw materials in order to decrease 
the clinker ratio – i.e."
"the proportion of clinker in ce-
ment."
"By 2030, we intend to reduce the ratio to 68%."
"In addition, we aim to reduce the specific SOX and NOX 
emissions per tonne of clinker generated in our cement 
production by 40% by 2030 and the specific dust emis-
sions per tonne of clinker by 80% in comparison with 
2008."

"Due to changes in the baseline 
value, Heidelberg Materials is reviewing an adjustment of the commitment."
"Responsibility and organisation
Environmental protection is an integral element of 
Heidelberg Materials’ business strategy."
"Responsibility 
for sustainability at Managing Board level lies with the 
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)."
"The CSO heads var-
ious internal working groups that deal with the different 
areas of focus of sustainability at Heidelberg Materials."
"The working groups include experts from the various 
areas of focus."
"The task of the working groups is to 
accelerate the progress of operating activities with re-
gard to sustainability and position Heidelberg Materials 
as a company with clearly defined sustainability tar-
gets, as formulated in the Sustainability Commit-
ments 2030, for example."
"The Supervisory Board addresses different topics con-
nected with sustainability and environmental protec-
tion on a regular basis."
"Since 2021, a CO2 component 
has linked the remuneration of the Managing Board 
and the majority of bonus-eligible employees to the 
reduction of our CO2 emissions (see Remuneration 
­
report chapter)."
"The departments of the Sustainability Office, which re-
ports to the CSO, support the implementation of the 
sustainability strategy at Group level."
"This includes de-
fining guidelines and targets, identifying improvement 
measures for achieving the sustainability targets, and 
coordinating research, development, and innovation 
projects."
"Combined management report

At country level, the ESG governance structures have 
been developed so that there is an ESG coordinator for 
each country."
"In addition, the countries have intro-
duced additional ESG functions or set up departments 
as required."
"The topic of energy is managed centrally by the Group 
Energy Procurement department, which supports the 
local business units in the procurement of alternative 
fuels or the implementation of projects to generate 
their own energy."
"To this end, there are working groups 
within the Group that develop the Group-wide strategy, 
monitor progress, and promote knowledge transfer."
"As Heidelberg Materials has a decentralised structure, 
the individual country organisations take responsibility 
for all areas of the operating activities, including com-
pliance with legal provisions and regulatory conditions."
"This also covers the correct recording and forwarding 
of all necessary production, operating, consumption, 
and emissions data that Heidelberg Materials is obliged 
to provide by law or by regulations, or has committed 
to providing voluntarily."
"In principle, the site manage-
ment is essentially responsible for environmental pro-
tection management at their respective plant."
"The internal monitoring of all operating data relevant 
to the environment is carried out by the competence 
centers of the business lines."
"Before publication, the 
data is also checked by the Group ESG department."
"Policies
Our Sustainability Commitments 2030, guidelines such 
as our Climate Policy, and our Code of Business Con-
duct demonstrate the great importance of environ-
mental protection for the sustainable development of 
Heidelberg Materials’ business activities."
"We also de-
scribe our strategy for reaching net-zero emissions 7) 
in our Climate Transition Plan, which was published 
in 2023."
"All countries in which we operate production facilities 
impose legal limits for most emissions of air pollutants 
in order to prevent any negative impact on the environ-
ment or the population."
"Failure to comply with the reg-
ulations could result in us losing our operating licence 
or jeopardise the renewal of our mining concessions."
"Processes
The internal working groups, e.g."
"focusing on climate 
strategy, analyse the progress of the operating activi-
ties with regard to achieving targets, report on the sta-
tus of research projects and research cooperation 
­
arrangements, and discuss further research measures 
in order to prepare decisions."
"In addition, the Manag-
ing Board is informed in detail several times a year 
about the research results and plans for new research 
projects."
"In the reporting year, planned measures to reduce CO2 
emissions were reviewed in detail for all fully consoli-
dated subsidiaries and tightened up where necessary."
"The extent to which we are achieving our targets is re-
viewed regularly."
"All relevant information on CO2 and air pollutant emis-
sions is recorded in our integrated reporting system on 
a monthly basis and available to consult there at any 
time."
"The Managing Board and senior management are 
7)	 According to SBTi definition
kept regularly informed by reports consolidated at 
Group level."
"We have established control mechanisms to verify that 
we are achieving our reduction targets for CO2 emis-
sions."
"The competence centers are responsible for pro-
viding the specialist advice and monitoring required 
in this area."
"As well as receiving monthly reports, the 
Managing Board also regularly checks the progress 
made towards achieving our targets during on-site visits."
"The Group Energy Procurement department constantly 
reviews new activities in numerous Group countries in 
order, among other things, to further expand the pro-
portion of green electricity in the coming years."
"Measures and progress
In order to reduce the specific CO2 emissions of our 
products, we continuously improve the energy effici­
ency of our plants, increase the proportion of alterna-
tive fuels, and decrease the proportion of the energy- 
intensive intermediate product clinker in our cements."
"In view of the enormous challenge posed by the un­
avoidable process emissions from cement production, 
our industry constantly strives to find new solutions 
to protect the climate."
"Heidelberg Materials therefore 
particularly invests in studies into innovative carbon 
capture and utilisation techniques: with the help of var-
ious technologies, we are working towards capturing 
CO2 in its purest form in order to either utilise or safely 
store it (CCUS)."
"Cement and concrete companies can 
also support the circular economy through resource 
efficiency, co-processing of waste materials, and con-
crete recycling, including its technical carbonation (see 
Circular economy section)."
"We test a variety of min-
erals for CO2 absorption and the possibility of using 
them to produce marketable building materials."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 118
In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio of carbon 
capture initiatives."
"For example, the Capture-to-Use 
project (Cap2U) was launched, as part of which the 
world’s first industrial-scale carbon capture and utilisa-
tion (CCU) facility in the cement industry is scheduled 
to go into operation in 2025 at our cement plant in 
Lengfurt, Germany."
"The facility will enable the captured 
CO2 from cement production to be reused as a valu­
able raw material in manufacturing applications."
"In 
2023, the GeZero project was selected to receive sup-
port from the EU Innovation Fund, a European financ-
ing programme for industrial decarbonisation."
"As the 
first project of its kind, GeZero in Geseke, Germany, will 
establish a complete carbon capture and storage 
(CCS) value chain for an inland location."
"In addition 
to financing the construction of a kiln equipped with 
state-of-the-art oxyfuel technology, the funding will 
also cover the installation of carbon capture and pro-
cessing facilities as well as transport and intermediate 
storage logistics at the plant location."
"We work with 
partners when it comes to transporting the CO2 to the 
storage site in the North Sea and the storage itself (see 
Research and development and Our CCUS project 
portfolio sections)."
"In 2023, we again increased the proportion of alter­
native fuels in the overall fuel mix."
"This predominantly 
relates to residues and waste that would be uneco-
nomical to recycle or cannot be recycled by any other 
means, such as processed household waste or bio-
mass (e.g."
"dried sewage sludge or rice husks in Asia), 
as well as industrial by-products and waste products."
"Globally, Heidelberg Materials is implementing numer-
ous projects aimed at further expanding the pro­
portion 
of alternative fuels."
"For example, a new storage and 
conveyor system is being constructed at our ­
cement 
plant in Bicaz, Romania, which will allow us to further 
optimise the use of alternative fuels."
"In Padeswood, 
United Kingdom, the installation of a new docking sta-
tion including a conveyor system is paving the way for 
greater use of alternative fuels."
"The Group Energy Procurement department constantly 
reviews new activities in numerous Group countries in 
order to further expand the proportion of green elec-
tricity in the coming years."
"These activities include in-
vestments in our own facilities for the generation of 
green electricity as well as long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs) to secure the supply of electricity 
from renewable energies."
"We are also implementing 
energy efficiency measures to reduce electricity con-
sumption and generate electricity from waste heat."
"In  2023, Heidelberg Materials signed further agree-
ments to source renewable electricity in Italy and 
­
Belgium, for example."
"In the 2023 reporting year, various measures to further 
reduce emissions of air pollutants were also imple-
mented."
"The facilities installed for the new kiln line at our 
plant in Mitchell, USA, deserve special mention."
"A state-­
of-the-art process exhaust gas filter and desulphurisa-
tion technology have been put into operation, along-
side other equipment."
"Performance indicators
In accordance with its internal CO2 roadmap, 
Heidelberg Materials was able to reduce its specific net 
CO2 emissions by a further 3% in the 2023 financial 
year to 534 kg/t of cementitious material (previous 
year: 551)."
"This corresponds to a reduction of 29% 
compared with the base year 19908) and 7% compared 
with 2020."
"We succeeded in further increasing the pro-
8)	 The reference values for the base years 1990 and 2008 are not included in 
the external voluntary audit to obtain limited assurance."
"portion of alternative fuels to 29.9% (previous year: 
28.7), while at the same time reducing the specific heat 
consumption of our kilns."
"The clinker ratio was reduced 
by 1.4 percentage points to 70.2% (previous year: 71.6)."
"Improvements were achieved by optimising the prod-
uct portfolio, especially in regions with a predominant-
ly high proportion of clinker in the cement."

The specific SOX and NOX emissions have fallen slightly 
or moderately compared with the previous two years."
"In addition to the usual fluctuations, this improvement 
can be explained by the shutdown of older models of 
kiln lines and targeted investments in the avoidance of 
air pollutants."
"Compared with the base year 20088), we 
achieved a 36% reduction in specific SOX emissions and 
a 24% reduction in NOX emissions."
"In line with normal fluctuations, our specific dust emis-
sions increased from 28 to 36 g/t clinker compared 
with the previous year, but are still below the 2021 level."
"This is an 89% reduction compared with the base year 
20088)."
"Heidelberg Materials recognised 87% of emis-
sions on a continuous basis in the reporting year."
"This results in temporary changes in land use and 
both positive and negative impacts on a variety of lo-
cally specific habitats and species."
"When an extraction 
area is opened up or extended, the surrounding en­
vironment is inevitably affected."
"To ensure that this im-
pact is kept to a minimum, operations are planned and 
implemented in line with the successive steps of the 
mitigation hierarchy."
"We want to reduce or neutralise 
the impacts of our activities or even make a positive 
contribution."
"We work to conserve habitats and species throughout 
the life cycle of our mining sites."
"Even during the extrac-
tion phase, we can create favourable conditions for 
threatened species, for example temporary or per­
manent wetlands, mosaics of bare ground and colonis-
ing vegetation, and sandy banks or rock faces for 
cliff-nesting species."
"Through the reclamation process, 
we are able to create and/or restore species-rich hab-
itats."
"For example, the bittern, which was on the brink 
of extinction in the UK in the late 1990s, can now be 
seen regularly again at the Ouse Fen Nature Reserve."
"This habitat was created as part of the reclamation of 
one of our aggregates quarries and is already home 
to 5% of the entire UK population of this remarkable 
species."
"9)
Before making any decisions concerning the develop-
ment of a new quarry or the expansion of an existing 
one, an extensive approval process in line with the cor-
responding regulations and policies must be followed."
"In some instances, additional assessments are con-
ducted to ensure that environmentally and socially re-
sponsible quarrying is possible."
"Typically, these would 
form part of an environmental impact assessment."
"Our 
sites are operated in accordance with relevant inter­
national, national, and local environmental legislation, 
and environmental impact assessments are usually 
prepared as a prerequisite for the approval of quarry-
ing activities."
"Targets and commitments
For environmental and economic reasons, we strive to 
limit land consumption in our quarrying and reclama-
tion plans."
"Our fundamental aim is to maximise the 
­
extraction of reserves and resources at all of our sites, 
while keeping adverse impacts to a minimum."
"Because we recognise the ecological value of tempor­
ary nature and the importance of reducing our poten-
tial on-site biodiversity impacts, we have committed to 
setting aside 15% of the land at 100% of our active 
extraction sites as space for nature by 2030."
"In this 
way, we want to ensure that species can thrive along-
side our active operations."
"Temporary nature refers to 
the spontaneous development of vegetation within a 
quarry and its colonisation by appropriate species."
"9)	 https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/wetland-wildlife-is-

These habitats may only exist for a few years due to 
expansion or reclamation, but they then re-emerge in 
other suitable locations on the site."
"In 2023, we re-
viewed and mapped the current proportion of land in 
our quarries that can be reserved for nature in order to 
establish a basis for measuring future developments."
"This phase will be completed in 2024 once 100% of our 
quarries have been assessed."
"Another target is to reduce our ecological footprint and 
contribute to the conservation and development of 
habitats and biodiversity features throughout the life 
cycle of our quarries."
"This includes operating all our ex-
traction sites on the basis of a restoration plan agreed 
together with local authorities and reflecting the needs 
of the respective communities."
"We have pledged to 
raise the proportion of quarries with restoration plans 
to 100% by 2030 at the latest."
"We also plan to inte-
grate recommendations for the promotion of biodiver-
sity into every new restoration plan, irrespective of the 
subsequent use."
"In this way, we manage our impact on 
biodiversity in line with the sequential steps of the mit-
igation hierarchy: avoid, minimise, and offset."
"In addition, we want to implement biodiversity man-
agement plans at all locations within one kilometre of 
a recognised area of high biodiversity value.10) The aim 
is to put this measure into action at 100% of our quar-
ries by 2025 and at 100% of our non-extraction sites 
by 2030."
"To better understand our environmental im-
pacts, we are committed to undertaking net impact 
assessments at all our extraction sites based on the 
restoration plans approved by the local authorities."

Responsibility and organisation
The topic of biodiversity is assigned to the Group ESG 
department."
"This is part of the Sustainability Office 
headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)."
"The 
internal Biodiversity Expert Group meets with repre-
sentatives from across the Group on a quarterly basis 
to share best practices, develop common guidelines, 
discuss changes to legal requirements, and participate 
in training given by external experts."
"Policies and processes
To ensure that biodiversity is fully taken into account 
in the operation of our quarries, we rely on knowledge 
sharing."
"A Biodiversity Handbook tailored to the cir-
cumstances in the individual Group areas helps the 
­
locations to create and preserve natural habitats, de-
velop projects with various stakeholders, and manage 
invasive species at our quarries."
"Heidelberg Materials 
has formulated ten biodiversity principles, which are 
set out in the Biodiversity Handbook."
"The purpose of 
these principles is to give guidance to those respon­
sible on-site on managing nature, making responsible 
decisions, and involving external stakeholders."
"In ad­
dition, we subscribe to the Integrated Biodiversity As-
sessment Tool (IBAT), which provides decision makers 
with up-to-date information on biodiversity at the re-
spective locations."
Our Biodiversity Policy forms the basis of our actions.
"It defines how we can minimise any negative outcomes 
and promote positive measures to increase biodiver­
sity in and around our locations."
"This includes partner-
ships with, among others, NGOs and universities, such 
as our global partner BirdLife International and its local 
country-specific partners, IUCN, Kings Park and 
­
Botanic Garden (Perth, Australia), and the University of 
South Bohemia in České Budějovice."
"In order to track 
and mitigate our impacts, a study is carried out every 
three years to determine the proximity of our opera-
tional sites to biodiversity-sensitive areas."
"The next 
study is scheduled to be undertaken in 2024 through 
our partnership with BirdLife International."
"In support of the global agenda for nature’s recovery 
and as a contribution to the UN Decade on Ecosystem 
Restoration, Heidelberg Materials has committed to 
include biodiversity measures in all restoration plans 
and report annually on the land reclaimed by the com-
pany."
"This action was initiated in 2023, with the first 
results due in 2024."
"Reclamation plans are an integral 
part of local authority approval processes, setting the 
targets and timetables for the reclamation of extraction 
sites."
"Even while a quarry is still in operation, wherever 
possible, we apply a policy of progressively reclaiming 
those areas of the quarry that are no longer used."
"In cooperation with our partner, BirdLife International, 
we have been collecting and analysing information 
about the biodiversity value of our quarries for more 
than ten years."
We now cover all our active quarries.
"In 
the process, we collect data about the proportion of 
quarries in areas with a high level of biodiversity and 
for which biodiversity management plans are being im-
plemented."

As early as 2010, we began to collect and analyse in-
formation about the biodiversity value of our quarries."
"We are steadily extending biodiversity monitoring to 
more and more quarries in a process that involves as-
sessing net impact by comparing a site’s ecological 
value before and after extraction based on its restora-
tion plan."
"The fifth edition of the Quarry Life Award, Heidelberg 
Materials’ nature-based research and education com-
petition, concluded in 2022."
"As part of the Quarry Life 
Award cycle, 2023 saw participating countries imple-
ment selected projects as a means of developing best 
practices for the improvement of biodiversity manage-
ment and community engagement."
"Projects ranged 
from establishing habitat assessment programmes for 
amphibians in Australia and reptiles in the UK to involve-
ment in environmental education in communities neigh-
bouring quarries in Germany and France."
"In 2023, our partnership with BirdLife International 
continued with a focus on joint advocacy for the EU 
Nature Restoration Law, which gained much attention 
at the European Parliament and was adopted in No-
vember 2023."
"Understanding the strong economic 
need for a healthy environment, Heidelberg Materials 
worked alongside associations from the non-energy 
extractive sector to provide a strong business voice 
in favour of this law."
"We also supported the #Restore 
Nature campaign, collaborating with BirdLife’s Europe 
and Central Asia regional offices to develop an animat-
ed video about quarries and their contribution towards 
restoring habitats."

Key performance indicators
In 2023, the method of collecting the key performance 
indicator data was revised and the data basis was re-
assessed, resulting in changes to the key performance 
indicators."
"Consequently, the proportion of our quar-
ries that are located near an area of high biodiversity 
value and have a biodiversity management plan is now 
61% (previous year: 51)."
"Owing to the new data collec-
tion method, the proportion of quarries with restora-
tion plans fell to 76% (previous year: 92)."

"Sustainable products and solutions
Our overall goal is to provide high-quality building 
­
materials to drive sustainable construction."
"The teams 
at our research centers work intensively on innovative, 
environmentally and socially responsible products that 
are designed to help buildings to be more sustainable 
over their life cycle (see Research and development 
section)."
"We aim to offer our customers solutions with 
a lower carbon footprint, good performance, and the 
possibility of reuse at the end of their service life."
"­
Examples of these products include cement and 
­
concretes with improved carbon footprints, as well as 
building materials with characteristics that support the 
use of less material and enable society to implement 
more climate-friendly solutions."
"To promote sustain­
able construction by means of low-carbon materials, 
we are working on three levers to reduce our products’ 
carbon emissions."
"These levers are 1) the incorporation 
of post-industrial by-products in our cements, 2) the 
use of biomass and alternative fuels in our cement 
plants as kiln fuels, and 3) carbon capture and storage."
"For example, the high heat absorption capacity of con-
crete means that ceilings and walls can be used for 
cold or heat storage, thereby significantly reducing en-
ergy consumption for air conditioning and heating."
"The 
use of alternative raw materials from other industrial 
sectors, for example fly ash, or demolished concrete 
for the production of circular concrete, also allows us 
to make an active contribution to the circular economy 
(see Circular economy section)."
"In addition, we are working to develop and implement 
applications and technologies that support our sus-
tainability targets."
"Examples include photocatalytic 
products for cleaning exhaust gases, drainage con-
crete to help regulate rainwater run-off, concrete for 
thermal energy storage, and ultra-high-performance 
concrete for infrastructure maintenance measures."
"As 
a service, we provide our customers with the know­
ledge required to use our products more efficiently, 
helping them to fulfil their performance requirements."
"Targets and commitments
Sustainable building materials with the smallest pos­
sible carbon footprint and a high circularity potential 
are playing an increasingly important role for us and 
our customers."
"We are investing in research and devel-
opment for innovative carbon-reduced and material- 
efficient production technologies and products."
"The development of these 
products is often supported by the Group Research 
and Development department and the Innovation Hub 
within the Sustainability Office."
"The topic of sustainable products and solutions is as-
signed to the Group Environmental Social Governance 
(ESG) department headed by the Vice President ESG, 
who reports directly to the Chief Sustainability Officer 
(CSO)."
"11)	 Revenue that we allocate here to our sustainable products is not aligned  
with the definitions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­

Heidelberg Materials 2023 122
Policies and processes 
The sustainability of our cement and concrete products 
is measured by their contribution to the reduction of 
CO2 emissions."
"Our sustainability strategy defines sus-
tainable cement and concrete as a reduction in CO2 
emissions of at least 30% compared with the GCCA’s 
global reference values from 2020."
"This translates into 
gross thresholds of ≤552 kg CO2/t for cementitious 
material and ≤5.5 kg CO2/m³/MPa for ready-mixed 
concrete."
"Circular products must contain at least 30% 
recycled aggregates or reduce material requirements 
by at least 30%."
"Our low-carbon, sustainable products are classified in 
accordance with the internal ESG Reporting Procedure 
Sustainable Revenue CEM and the internal Reporting 
Guidelines for RMC Sustainable Revenue."
"As a founding member of the Concrete Sustainability 
Council (CSC), we are involved in the ongoing develop-
ment of a certification system for sustainably produced 
concrete."
"The CSC certification system strives to im-
prove the sustainable use of concrete by promoting 
responsible practices throughout the value chain and 
incentivising continuous improvement."
"With the certifi-
cation of concrete and its production chain, we antici-
pate greater social acceptance of the product and of 
the entire industry."
"We are an active member of Green Building Councils 
(such as Deutsche Gesellschaft für nachhaltiges ­
Bauen, 
DGNB) and Infrastructure Sustainability Councils (such 
as the Australian ISCA) in order to advance the devel-
opment of sustainable products together with our cus-
tomers."
"Measures and progress
Thanks to the use of by-products from other industrial 
sectors for the production of clinker and cement or the 
recycling of demolition concrete, we are able to manu-
facture cement and concrete in a more resource-effi-
cient way and with lower CO2 emissions."
"For several of 
our products, we have developed Environmental Prod-
uct Declarations (EPDs), which are externally verified 
and provide information on the carbon footprint of 
these products."
"Product-specific EPDs can therefore 
be used to produce accurate life cycle assessments for 
buildings, and they can help buildings achieve higher 
scores when it comes to green building labels such as 
LEED or DGNB certification."
"A significant part of our research and development 
work is aimed at developing new cement and concrete 
formulations in order to minimise energy consumption 
and CO2 emissions, and thereby also reduce our envir­
onmental impact and costs (see Research and devel-
opment section)."
"In 2023, 19 ready-mixed concrete plants in Germany, 
30 plants in the Netherlands, 4 plants in Italy, and 
3 plants in Lithuania obtained CSC certification for the 
first time or underwent recertification."
"In Germany, all 
16 of our Lithonplus concrete products subsidiary’s 
production facilities were also CSC-certified for the 
first time."
"In addition, the CSC R-Module was awarded 
to selected ready-mixed concrete plants in Germany 
and the Netherlands, and the CSC CO2-Module was 
also awarded to selected plants in Germany, Belgium, 
and the Netherlands."
"The CSC R-Module provides an 
additional product-specific label for concrete products 
where at least 10% of the aggregates used is recycled 
content."
"The CO2 module provides an additional prod-
uct-specific label for concrete products with a carbon 
footprint at least 30% lower than the national baseline 
as defined by the respective national concrete associ-
ation."
"The use of CSC-certified concrete is recognised 
by green building labels such as DGNB and BREEAM, 
and the certification of Heidelberg Materials’ concrete 
plants in urban areas helps to improve the sustainabil-
ity rating of eco-friendly building projects."
"A CSC sup-
plier certificate was obtained by 2 cement plants in 
Italy, 4  plants in Belgium, 1 cement plant in Turkey, 
14 sand and aggregates production sites in Germany, 
and 1 site in Norway."
"The CSC supplier certificate of 
cement plants and aggregates pits supports the sus-
tainability rating of concrete plants undergoing CSC 
certification."
"Through our engagement in various initiatives and as-
sociations, we want to promote and accelerate devel-
opments relating to sustainable construction and 
­
market transformation."
"We continued our active in-
volvement in the DGNB in 2023 and as an official part-
ner in the European Network (ERN) of the World Green 
Building Council."
"We have also continued our engagement in various na-
tional Green Building Councils and other associations 
by providing human resources to support and acceler-
ate developments in sustainable construction and the 
associated market transformation."
"Combined management report

Heidelberg Materials 2023 123
Until the end of 2023, almost every Group country had 
its own brands for sustainable products, such as the 
German EcoCrete brand for the local sustainable 
­
concrete portfolio."
"While such individuality facilitated 
effective localisation, it restricted our capacity to influ-
ence the sustainable products in line with our Group-­
level objectives, such as sustainable revenue."
"Given 
these barriers, we decided to consolidate all our sus-
tainable products under a single, cohesive brand: 
evoBuild®."
"evoBuild is our new global brand for sustain-
able products and will be gradually rolled out in the 
Group countries over the course of 2024."
"Intensive 
preparations were made for the market launch in 2023."
"The process was carried out by several working groups 
involving the Commercial Directors and representatives 
from Group Communication, the Group ESG depart-
ment, and the country organisations."
"The new brand is 
also in line with Heidelberg Materials’ corpor­
ate re-
branding activities, which started in 2022."
"The require-
ments a product must meet to qualify for evoBuild 
branding align with our definition for sustainable prod-
ucts and are detailed in a specific procedure (see 
­
Policies and processes section)."
"In addition to evoBuild, another new brand, evoZero®, 
was developed specifically for Heidelberg Materials’ 
future CCS-based net-zero products."
"We anticipate mech­
anical completion of the CCS facility in Brevik, Norway, 
by the end of 2024 and plan to supply our customers 
with evoZero products from 2025."
"Our customers will 
12)	Related to CO2 emissions
13)	For more information, refer to https://www.evozero.com/docs/evozero-­
assurance-en.pdf
be able to choose between two products: evoZero Car-
bon Captured Brevik is our mass-balanced product, 
produced in and delivered from Brevik."
"Its net-zero 
footprint will be achieved over its entire life cycle."
"evoZero Carbon Captured, without the addition of 
“Brevik” in the product name, is based on a book-and-
claim approach."
"It will be available from any European 
plant located near a customer project, while leveraging 
the unique carbon-saving attributes realised in Brevik."
It will have a net-zero footprint from delivery onwards.
"The carbon capture and emission accounting mecha-
nisms have been reviewed by a third-party verifier, 
­
ensuring that each tonne of captured CO2 is only ac-
counted for once."
"We will also use blockchain tech­
nology to offer an additional layer of trust and provide 
proof that each carbon-saving attribute is only con-
sumed once."
"Performance indicators
As described above, the share of revenue from sustain-
able products encompasses the cement, aggregates, 
ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt business lines."
"The 
share of revenue generated by sustainable products 
increased to 35.4% in the 2023 financial year (previous 
year: 33.5)."
"The cement business line’s share of revenue 
from sustainable products rose to 39.5% in the report-
ing year (previous year: 37.2)."
"The increases are mainly 
attributable to higher revenue from sustainable ce-
ments, which was achieved by means of adjustments 
to our product portfolio in some key markets such as 
Germany and Italy."
"2)	
Revenue that we allocate to our sustainable products are not aligned  
with the definitions of the EU taxonomy regulation."
"3)	
The system does not yet record all relevant revenue for this figure at product 
level."
"We are working on continuously improving data collection over the next 
few years."
"The revenue shares shown here therefore only refer to the revenue 
that has already been measured (about 80% of total revenue)."
"4)	
The underlying survey method of the specific gross emissions of the individual 
cement types was slightly adjusted in 2022 compared with previous years."
"However, this has only an negligible impact on the reported sustainable 
revenue in 2022."
"Circular economy
Through our investments in the circular economy, we 
also aim to make a contribution to conserving finite 
resources by reducing material inputs as well as reusing 
and recycling concrete and aggregates."
"Recycling and 
reusing materials such as sandstone and other compo-
nents of concrete can extend their service life within the 
use cycle."
"This helps to reduce the CO2 emissions that 
would otherwise be released during the extraction and 
processing of raw materials."
"Furthermore, deliberate 
remineralisation in the recycling process can perma-
nently sequester CO2 in demolished concrete."
"Among other things, we are working to reduce our car-
bon footprint by closing the carbon loop, develop ce-
ments with a reduced clinker content, and devise inno-
vative recycling technologies that allow waste concrete 
to be fully reused in fresh concrete."
"Our attention is 
focused on the life cycle of concrete – including how 
demolition concrete is processed and returned to the 
construction cycle."
"ensuring our 
products are suitable for use in a circular economy – is 
an integral part of the Group strategy."
"Reducing CO2 
emissions and material inputs is central to this along-
side reuse and recycling."
"Targets and commitments
As part of its Sustainability Commitments 2030, 
Heidelberg Materials has set itself the target of offering 
circular alternatives for half of its concrete products by 
2030."
"In addition, we want to continuously raise the 
substitution rate of natural raw materials by using 
by-products and recycled materials and increase the 
use of recycled aggregates in our fresh concrete port-
folio."
"Responsibility and organisation
The topic of circularity is established within the Sustain-
ability Office."
"A project team steers the further devel-
opment of the circularity strategy, supports the coun-
tries in its implementation, and acts as an interface for 
coordination with the Managing Board."
"Responsibility 
for implementation and target achievement lies with 
the Group countries."
"Since the topics of circular econ-
14)	The circular economy in detail (ellenmacarthurfoundation.org)
omy and circularity are closely linked to our CO2 and 
emission reduction strategy and the topic of sustain­
able products, the respective project teams maintain 
close contact."
"In addition, the Recycling Steering Com-
mittee currently discusses circularity and recycling 
three times per year."
"Policies and processes
Policies and frameworks, such as the European Green 
Deal or the EU Circular Economy Action Plan, will help 
to guide the development and future regular review of 
our circularity strategy."
"At the end of 2023, Heidelberg 
Materials introduced a Circularity Policy."
"This will be im-
plemented by the Group countries in 2024 with support 
from the Sustainability Office."
"We define products as circular if they contribute either 
to a reduction in material inputs or to the reuse of ma-
terials."
"In both cases, the threshold set internally and 
applicable to the products reported here is 30%."
"Ma-
terial consumption can be reduced by 30% by using 
special high-performance concretes or digital design 
processes such as 3D printing, for example."
"Besides 
the potential material savings, 3D concrete printing 
also helps to reduce construction waste."
"Recycled con-
tent levels must comply with local regulations and 
standards."
"The development and testing of the performance of 
these circular products in the Group countries takes 
place in cooperation with the Group Global Research 
and Development department and our Concrete and 
Aggregates & Asphalt competence centers (CCR and 
CCA)."
"We make our circular products a topic of discus-
sion within our association activities in order to achieve 
standardisation and, in some cases, certification as 
well as general acceptance."
"Through our engagement 
in various initiatives and associations, we want to pro-
mote and accelerate developments in sustainable con-
struction and market transformation (see Sustainable 
products and solutions section)."
"Measures and progress
As factors such as the proportion of recycled material 
in products depend on how the circular economy is or-
ganised locally and the corresponding rules and regu-
lations, the possible measures and speed of implemen-
tation vary considerably from one Group country to 
another."
"Heidelberg Materials therefore works closely 
with the country locations to identify and facilitate the 
best possible implementation options in each case."
"In 
2023, the Sustainability Office led a project group con-
sisting of employees from the Group Research and De-
velopment department, the competence centers, and 
representatives from a total of six Group countries to 
look at ways of implementing our circular economy 
strategy."
"The initiative aims to both promote circularity 
in each country and encourage knowledge sharing 
­
between the Group countries – this is the main focus for 
2024."
"We are working on stepping up our recycling activities 
and expanding our corporate portfolio through acqui-
sitions."
"In the reporting year, Heidelberg Materials fur-
ther expanded the business area by means of acquisi-
tions in the field of construction materials recycling in 
Europe and the USA, for example (see Investments 
section)."
"The ReConcrete project demonstrated the develop-
ment of a limestone substitute made from demolition 
concrete."
"Waste concrete is crushed using novel pro-
cesses and sorted almost homogeneously into its com-
ponents to obtain not only sand and gravel but also 
hardened cement paste."
"The latter can be reused as a 
valuable, low-carbon raw material in clinker and ce-
ment production, replacing natural limestone as a raw 
material."
"In addition, the hardened cement paste can 
absorb and permanently bind CO2, thus acting as a 
carbon sink."
"The process thereby highlights not only 
concrete’s circularity potential, but also the close 
­
connection between the carbon and material loops."
"Construction of an industrial-scale facility that will im-
plement this process began in Poland in 2023."
"The in-
novative recycling plant for selective separation will 
start production in 2024."
"Performance indicators
By introducing the recycling operating line into our ac-
counting system, we have established a basis for 
measuring performance indicators relating to the cir-
cular economy."
"We plan to implement this approach in 
future."
"Information according to the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation
The Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system 
that translates the EU’s climate and environmental ob-
jectives into criteria for certain environmentally sus-
tainable economic activities for investment purposes."
"Economic activities are recognised as “environmental-
ly sustainable” if they make a substantial contribution 
to at least one of the EU’s climate and environmental 
objectives while not significantly harming any of the 
other defined environmental objectives."
"In addition, 
minimum social standards (termed minimum safe-
guards) must be met."
"Assessment of taxonomy eligibility
The portfolio of our economic activities was assessed 
in the reporting year with regard to taxonomy eligibility 
under the delegated acts."
"Manufacture of cement” (represented in the following 
as the cement business line), “CCM 5.9."
"In accordance 
with the disclosure requirements, we report in detail on 
these economic activities (alignment reporting)."
"Of the 
other four environmental objectives, only the environ-
mental objective “transition to a circular economy” 
with the activity “CE 2.7."
"Sorting and material recovery 
of non-hazardous waste” was identified as material for 
Heidelberg Materials."
"We have been reporting on tax-
onomy eligibility for this activity since 2023 pursuant to 
the Environmental Delegated Act."
"There are also other taxonomy-eligible economic ac-
tivities within Heidelberg Materials’ business lines, such 
as transport services, which are, however, not shown 
separately and are included in the reporting for the ce-
ment business line and activity 3.7, respectively."
"Additionally, we analysed our activities in relation to 
Delegated Act (EU) 2022/1214 regarding economic ac-
tivities related to the nuclear and fossil gas energy sec-
tors."
"We did not identify any relevant taxonomy-eligible 
activities in the 2023 reporting year."
"We have therefore 
not applied the reporting pursuant to Annex XII."
"Heidelberg Materials’ other economic activities, such 
as the ready-mixed concrete-asphalt business line, are 
taxonomy-non-eligible under the currently known legal 
acts."
"We also analysed cross-sectional economic ac-
tivities for the capital expenses (CapEx) and operating 
expenses (OpEx) KPIs, but this did not result in any 
­
additional reportable activities."
"The requirements of the Climate 
Change Adaptation Delegated Act were not pursued 
further, as we are currently unable to achieve taxono-
my-aligned revenue, capital expenses, and operating 
expenses in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation."
"To review the criteria determining whether a substantial 
contribution to climate change mitigation (“substantial 
contribution” criteria) is made, internal reporting sys-
tems and data were used to verify compliance with the 
respective limit values at plant level."
"A distinction is 
made between the various types of plants (integrated 
plants, clinker plants, grinding plants) and is based on 
the reporting definitions set out by the GCCA industry 
association."
"The recovery rate plays a decisive role for 
the taxonomy-eligible recycling activities under CCM

5.9."
"We use internal material stream statistics to assess 
whether the substantial contribution has been achieved."
"For the somewhat more qualitative DNSH criteria, the 
individual (legal) requirements and their applicability to 
Heidelberg Materials were reviewed and potential ap-
proaches for proving the alignment of the individual 
plants were devised."
"For example, a location-based 
assessment for climate change adaptation was devel-
oped, covering various climate scenarios and time ho-
rizons."
"If risks are identified, the plants will be expected 
to implement appropriate adaptation measures."
"At the 
same time, for criteria such as “protection and restor­
ation of biodiversity and ecosystems” or “sustainable 
use and protection of water and marine resources,” use 
is made of existing processes."
"We regularly assess the 
proximity of our operational sites to protected areas 
and, if necessary, develop biodiversity management 
plans."
"For the “sustainable use and protection of water 
and marine resources” criterion, we have extended our 
existing approach of creating water management 
plans and make use of the assessment of (potential) 
risks and impacts carried out for this purpose."
"For the “manufacture of cement” activity and the “pol-
lution prevention and control” criterion, we use, among 
other things, our long-established processes for mon-
itoring air pollutants to verify compliance."
"We have also 
examined the additional requirements for the products 
we manufacture, such as those relating to placing haz-
ardous substances on the market."
"We conclude that 
these criteria have been fulfilled."
"With respect to cir-
cular economy, there are no requirements within the 
­
Taxonomy Regulation for “CCM 3.7."
"Manufacture of 
­
cement” and “CCM 5.9."
"As we have been implementing compliance 
processes in these areas for many years and are con-
tinuously reviewing and expanding them, we have come 
to the conclusion that the minimum safeguards are be-
ing met."
"One current example of our continuous opti-
misation efforts is our work in the field of human rights 
to further expand our analysis of significant risks and 
their impact on potentially affected parties."
"Particular-
ly with respect to our supply chains, we have supple-
mented our existing risk management with suitable 
processes (in the context of the requirements of the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG), among 
others)."
"Further information on this topic can be found 
in the Compliance section."
"Explanation of the key figures
The key figures revenue, capital expenses (CapEx), and 
operating expenses (OpEx) relevant to the EU Taxono-
my Regulation were determined with reference to the 
definitions set out in the Annex to the Delegated Act 
(EU 2021/2178) to Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852."
"The relevant revenue, CapEx, and OpEx were assigned 
to the above-mentioned taxonomy-eligible economic 
activities."
"Standard reporting (assignment by business 
line) was used to determine the key figures, avoiding 
the possibility of double counting across the two econ­
omic activities."
"Revenue
The key figure for sustainable revenue pursuant to the 
Taxonomy Regulation is calculated on the basis of rev-
enue related to the taxonomy-aligned economic activ-
ities (numerator) divided by total revenue (denomina-
tor)."
"Revenue is defined as the revenue shown in the 
consolidated income statement that relates to revenue 
from contracts with customers pursuant to IFRS 15."
This can be found in Note 7.1.
"The taxonomy-aligned share of revenue is 
€124.5 million or 0.6% (previous year: €114.7 million 
or 0.5%15)) for the cement business line."
"In addition, 
­
taxonomy-aligned intercompany revenue is €40.8 mil-
lion."
"The taxonomy-aligned share of revenue for the re­
cycled aggregates operating line is €11.6 million or 0.1% 
(previous year: €11.1 million or 0.1%)."
"Capital expenditure (CapEx)
CapEx comprises all additions of tangible and intang­
ible assets, including leases but excluding goodwill and 
revaluations."
"CapEx thus results from the additions to 
intangible assets (Note 9.1) and from property, plant 
and equipment including right-of-use assets (Note 9.2) 
in the Notes to the balance sheet."
"Besides additions 
from ordinary business operations (see line “Addi-
tions”), additions from business combinations (see line 
“Business combinations”) are also included in the total 
CapEx."
"Total CapEx pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation 
amounts to €2,199.6 million (previous year: €1,570.1 mil-
lion)."
"Of this, €1,439.8 million or 65.5% (previous year: 
€952.5 million or 60.7%) is attributable to taxonomy- 
eligible CapEx for the cement business line and 
€55.2 million or 2.5% (previous year: €33.1 million or 
2.1%) to the recycled aggregates operating line."
"The 
taxonomy- aligned share of CapEx is €307.5 million or 
14.0% (previous year: €360.8 million or 23.0%) for the 
cement business line."
"The decline is primarily attribut-
able to the modernisation of the Mitchell cement plant 
in Indiana, USA, which was commissioned in June 2023."
"The ­
taxonomy-aligned share of CapEx is €4.3 million 
or  0.2% for the recycled aggregates operating line 
(­
previous year: €5.1 million or 0.3%)."
"Investment plan (“CapEx plan”)  
within the meaning of the EU taxonomy
Pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation, the cement busi-
ness line and the recycled aggregates operating line 
are taxonomy-eligible in the context of the climate 
change mitigation and circular economy environmental 
objectives."
"Heidelberg Materials has set climate targets for 2030 
based on detailed measures and plans (CO2 roadmap)."
"Large-scale projects in particular require a long plan-
ning and implementation phase, which is why the ex-
tension of the planning period to more than five years 
is objectively justified and in line with the internal CO2 
roadmap."
"We want to significantly reduce our specific 
CO2 emissions by 2030."
"Our corporate climate target 
is below the limit value defined by the EU for a substan-
tial contribution to climate change mitigation for spe-
cific gross CO2 emissions of 469 kg CO2 per tonne of 
cement or alternative binders."
"In order to achieve our 
corporate climate target by 2030 at the latest, further 
investments must therefore be made."
"We have updated the investment planning on which our 
internal CO2 roadmap is based."
"Manu-
facture of cement” by 2030."
"The figures are significant-
ly lower than the investment requirements reported in 
the previous year, as the investment volume defined in 
the CapEx plan for achieving the CO2 thresholds was 
reduced on the basis of updated analyses."
"In addition 
to the plants remaining in the CapEx plan, the analysis 
identified further opportunities to reduce CO2 emis-
sions, which primarily require operating expenses such 
as the procurement and use of alternative raw materi-
als."
"Furthermore, significant expenditure was already 
made on major projects and finalised in 2022."
"This ex-
penditure is therefore no longer part of the CapEx plan."
"Combined management report

Heidelberg Materials 2023 128
In the reporting year, investments towards the CapEx 
plan amounted to €296.2 million."
"The operating ex-
penses incurred under the CapEx plan for the 2023 
­
financial year came to €21.4 million."
"Operating expenditure (OpEx)
The following non-capitalised expenses are considered 
operating expenditure:
	
– Research and development: 
 
Our research and development expenditure is a key 
driver of innovation."
"This includes central innovation 
hubs focused on the development of new technolo-
gies, improved processes, and breakthrough digital 
technologies, as well as the local optimisation of 
products and applications for an elevated customer 
experience."
"The total amount for all business lines 
corresponds to the presentation in the Research and 
development section."
"– Lease expenses for short-term leases and low-value 
assets:
 
Expenses that meet the definition of IFRS 16 Leases 
but are not recognised as a right-of-use asset or 
lease liability because they relate to a short-term 
lease (<12 months) or a low-value asset."
"The total 
amount for all business lines corresponds to the 
lease expenses in the other operating expenses in 
Note 7.5."
"– Repair and maintenance/building renovation meas-
ures: 
 
Expenditure on repair materials, spare and wear 
parts, and repair services from external providers 
and employees."
"– All other direct expenditure relating to the daily main-
tenance of property, plant and equipment necessary 
to ensure the continuous and effective functioning of 
these assets."
"The method of collecting OpEx data was adjusted in 
2023."
"As a result, we can now collect OpEx figures in a 
more standardised and simple way, as they are some-
times recorded differently in the individual countries, 
which can lead to inconsistencies."
"The global approach 
that has been introduced means that the calculation is 
based on a standardised and structured procedure."
"For the 2023 financial year, total OpEx pursuant to 
the  Taxonomy Regulation amounted to €1,672.1 mil-
lion (previous year: €1,582.3 million)."
"Taxonomy-eligible 
­
operating expenses were identified as €917.8 million or 
54.9% (previous year: €877.6 million or 55.5%) for the 
cement business line and €9.4 million or 0.6% (previous 
year: €9.7 million or 0.6%) for the recycled aggregates 
operating line."
"For part of the taxonomy-eligible re-
search and development expenditure in the cement 
business line, no direct assignment to the taxonomy- 
aligned plants is possible, hence they were assigned 
proportionally to all plants using a key based on total 
cement production."

"We want to offer attractive working con­
ditions and jobs with a secure future."
"For us, a good 
personnel policy means respecting our employees with 
their range of talents, qualities, and diversity of exper­
ience as well as creating the right conditions to allow 
them to do their jobs with efficiency and dedication."
"As 
a manufacturing company, we also attach importance 
to occupational safety and the protection of our em-
ployees’ health."
"At the end of 2023, the number of employees at 
Heidelberg Materials stood at 50,997 (previous year: 
50,780), based on full-time equivalents."
"The increase 
of  around 220 employees essentially results from 
two opposing developments."
"On the one hand, around 
1,460 jobs were cut across the Group as a result of 
portfolio optimisation measures, the realisation of syn-
ergies, efficiency enhancements in sales and adminis-
tration, as well as location optimisations."
"On the other 
hand, around 1,680 employees joined the Group, large-
ly due to the expansion of our range of circular materi-
als through the acquisitions of RWG Holding GmbH and 
SER Group in Germany and the takeover of The SEFA 
Group in the USA."
"Information on the number of em-
ployees in the Group areas can be found in the Seg-
ment ­
reporting."
"Diversity, equity, and inclusion
Diversity in our workforce in terms of cultural and eth-
nic origin, gender, age, mental and physical abilities, 
and sexual orientation and identity is an asset to our 
global teams."
"We are convinced that this diversity, in 
harmony with an appreciative corporate culture, has a 
positive effect on our innovative strength and the com-
mitment of our employees."
The proportion of local managers – i.e.
"managers who 
are nationals of the same country as their place of 
work – at upper management level amounts to around 
80%."
"This international composition of our top and 
senior management gives us the benefit of a broad 
range of experience from different cultural back-
grounds."
"It allows us to respond flexibly and quickly to 
global challenges as well as local market needs."
"At our 
headquarters, we aim to ensure that the workforce is 
composed of employees from the countries in which we 
operate, with the intention of improving cooperation 
with our local teams."
"Currently, more than 65 different 
nationalities are represented at our headquarters."
"There are trade unions and similar organisations in 
nearly all of the countries in which Heidelberg Materials 
operates."
"We also engage in regular, open dialogue 
with representatives of these organisations."
"In the 
event of a reorganisation or job cuts, we work in close 
consultation with employee representatives to achieve 
a socially responsible solution."
"For example, we initially 
examine the possibility of transferring employees with-
in the Group."
"If this is not feasible, we try to cushion the 
individual impact through retraining, early-retirement 
schemes, outplacement, and compensation payments."
"Targets and commitments
Our aim is to develop and attract highly qualified and 
committed employees worldwide who bring their indi-
vidual skills and different perspectives to our company 
and thus contribute to our business success."
"By 2030, we aim to achieve a global target of 25% of 
management positions occupied by women."
"In Ger­
many, we want the proportion of women at both the 
first and second leadership levels below the Managing 
Board to reach 27% by 2027."
"We have been signatories 
to the Diversity Charter since early 2013."
"It is a cor­
porate initiative that aims to promote diversity and 
­
appreciation in the workplace and create a working 
environment that is free of prejudice."
"Responsibility and organisation 
The Group Human Resources (HR) department is sub-
ordinate to the Chairman of the Managing Board, to 
whom the Director Group Human Resources reports 
directly."
"Group HR is also responsible for the topics of 
diversity, equity, and inclusion."
"Each country has its 
own personnel organisation and sets country-specific 
human resources priorities."
"The individual HR directors 
of the countries report directly to the general manager 
of the respective country and, in a functional reporting 
line, to the Group HR department."
"Members of the employee committees at the individual 
locations form the General Works Council for Heidelberg 
Materials AG and the Group Works Council."
"The repre-
sentative body for severely disabled employees is em-
bedded in the local works council for the headquarters 
in Heidelberg."
"The local works council has also formed 
its own panels, such as the Personnel Planning Commit-
tee and working groups on data protection and IT sys-
tems, which liaise with the Director Group HR and the 
Director HR Germany on an ad hoc basis."
"More-
over, we have enshrined this commitment in our Leader­
ship Principles."
"We expect our employees worldwide 
to comply with these central guidelines and recommen-
dations."
"Our Code of Business Conduct is binding across the 
Group and describes our values as well as our ethical 
and legal standards."
"We urge our managers and employees world-
wide to apply these principles to the way they behave 
towards one another, taking local circumstances into 
account."
"With the Company Agreement on Mobile Working in 
Germany, we are placing particular emphasis on mak-
ing our working time models more flexible in order to 
help our employees achieve a better work-life balance."
"With our international workforce and calls for greater 
flexibility in mind, we have made it possible for our em-
ployees to work remotely in other European countries 
as part of a pilot project."
"We are currently examining 
the extent to which this will be possible on a long-term 
basis."
"Processes
Employee and employer representatives maintain a 
close and regular dialogue."
"For instance, monthly meet-
ings take place between Human Resources represent-
atives and the works councils at the various locations."
"Furthermore, the works council organises quarterly 
staff meetings at our headquarters, which are attend-
ed by the Chairman of the Managing Board and the 
Director Group HR every six months."
"A meeting of the 
General Works Council is held once a year, to which the 
Chairman of the Managing Board, the Managing Direc-
tor of the German organisation, the Director Group 
Human Resources, and the Director HR for Germany 
are invited."
"Group management and employee repre-
sentatives also engage in constructive dialogue in the 
European Works Council."
"Once a year, an in-person 
event is held with the European Group countries, the 
Chairman of the Managing Board, and the Director 
Group Human Resources, among others."
"Human resources issues are regularly on the agenda at 
Managing Board meetings to which the Director Group 
Human Resources is invited, depending on the topic."
"The Supervisory Board meets on an ad hoc basis to 
discuss HR matters concerning the Managing Board."
"We have embedded key leadership tasks in standard 
human resources processes."
"In salary review process-
es that take place globally every year, we ensure that 
the remuneration of our managers and employees not 
covered by collective agreements develops appropri-
ately for each individual."
"As part of a structured target 
agreement process, managers and employees jointly 
define the forthcoming tasks and expectations."
"Indi-
vidual performance appraisals also have an impact on 
remuneration."
"Furthermore, annual growth talks be-
tween managers and employees not covered by collec-
tive agreements help to support our employees’ devel-
opment and career planning."
"With the gradual introduction of Workday, we are integ­
rating these processes into a new, centralised HR IT 
system."
"Workday follows on from the predecessor sys-
tem, HR Globe, and the e-Campus learning manage-
ment system."
"More than 46,000 employees worldwide 
are already registered in Workday."
"Besides supporting 
the performance and potential assessment processes, 
Workday also assists with matters relating to remuner-
ation, recruitment, onboarding, and learning."
"We offer 
over 600 e-learning courses for specialist and work- 
related advanced training via the learning module."
"With 
the introduction of Workday, Heidelberg Materials is 
taking a significant step towards greater transparency, 
global standards, and digitalisation with self-service 
options for employees and managers."
"Measures and progress
In recent years, we have further developed our meas-
ures aimed at promoting women."
"The proportion of 
women in programmes for the advancement of future 
executives across Germany was 30% (previous year: 
31%) and therefore, as in previous years, significantly 
higher than the proportion of women in the total work-
force in Germany of 18.3% (previous year: 16.9%)."
"We 
also provide targeted support for the career develop-
ment of our female future executives."
"In Germany, for 
example, we participate in a cross-company mentoring 
programme in cooperation with other companies from 
the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, where our head-
quarters is located."
"Our measures aimed at promoting women and inclu-
sion are wide-ranging and adapted to individual local 
circumstances."
"In Australia, for example, we have been 
successfully implementing a Female Driver Program for 
several years, which offers women the chance to gain 
further qualifications as truck drivers."
"The opportunity 
to participate in specialist events, such as Female in 
Construction conferences in the USA, raises the visibil-
ity of talented women and gives them an opportunity 
to network with other professionals."
"The initiative aims, 
among other things, to support the network’s mem-
bers in developing their career potential and to build 
greater awareness throughout the company of the 
changing demands on working and living environments."
"The Allies of NOW programme also offers opportunities 
for male employees to advocate for gender equality at 
Heidelberg Materials."
"In Germany, as in previous years, Heidelberg Materials 
took part in a variety of activities for German Diversity 
Day in 2023."
"For example, employees had the oppor-
tunity to try out an age suit, which simulates various 
age-related impairments, to gain a better understand-
ing of how older people feel."
"With diversity and inclu-
sion training courses, we strive to combat unconscious 
bias, i.e."
"unintentional thought patterns and stereo-
types that are barriers to equality."
"To take account of 
the particular importance of diversity, equity, and in-
clusion and further anchor the topic at strategy level, 
the Group countries are developing country-specific 
action plans to suit their local circumstances."
"In the 
UK, for example, this is being done in connection with 
the FAIR Commitments campaign, where FAIR stands 
for fairness, awareness, inclusion, and respect."
"As part 
of the campaign, employees have been trained to 
­
become “inclusion champions,” paid paternity leave 
has been extended, and mandatory unconscious bias 
training has been introduced for personnel selection 
panels."
"Performance indicators
As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women in 
Germany in the first leadership level below the Manag-
ing Board was 13% (previous year: 16%) and 24% (pre-
vious year: 25%) in the second leadership level below 
the Managing Board."
"The reduction is due to various 
factors."
"This includes organisational and personnel 
changes at these two levels as well as the calculation 
of the values on the basis of full-time equivalents since 
2023."
"In addition, the definition of management posi-
tions was adjusted in connection with the introduction 
of Workday."
"Across the Group, the proportion of women in the first 
two leadership levels below the Managing Board was 
18% (previous year: 14%)."
"The increase is mainly due to 
the adjusted employee group in the upper manage-
ment levels following the introduction of Workday."
"Occupational health and safety
At Heidelberg Materials, we are aware that there are 
occupational health and safety risks associated with 
our business model."
"Occupational health and safety is there-
fore one of the essential components of our work pro-
cesses, and we strive to make continuous improve-
ments in this area."
"With effective preventive measures, we intend to mini-
mise the risk of accidents and injuries as well as the risk 
of occupational illness."
"However, accidents and occu-
pational illnesses do still occur."
"Accidents can range 
from cases where first aid is required to serious injuries 
and even fatalities."
"The most commonly recognised oc-
cupational illnesses include temporary conditions, such 
as back problems, other musculoskeletal disorders, 
and respiratory diseases, but there are also permanent 
impairments, such as noise-induced hearing loss."
"In 
many cases, such issues also have an impact on team 
members."
"Besides mental strain, these consequences 
may include additional overtime, restrictions on holi-
day, or the restructuring of working groups."
"Depending 
on the severity of the incident, it may also lead to inter-
ruptions in operational processes or even downtime for 
parts of production, naturally resulting in financial loss-
es for Heidelberg Materials."
"Targets and commitments
We work continuously to further minimise the risks 
for our employees, contractors, and third parties."
"Our 
most important aim in occupational health and safety, 
which we also confirmed in our Sustainability Commit-
ments 2030, is to prevent accidents and ill health, es-
pecially accidents resulting in fatalities."
"In addition, we 
want to reduce the lost time injury frequency rate 
(­
LTIFR) by at least 50% by 2030 compared with 2020."
"Responsibility and organisation
At Heidelberg Materials, all management levels are 
­
accountable and responsible for occupational health 
and safety."
"Our occupational safety organisation is 
sub­
ordinate to the Chairman of the Managing Board, 
to whom the Director Group Human Resources, who is 
responsible for Group Health & Safety, reports directly."
"She reports the global occupational safety figures to 
the Managing Board on a monthly basis."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 136
Country managers are responsible for ensuring that 
occupational health and safety in their country meets 
legal requirements."
"They provide leadership and the 
necessary resources to ensure these obligations are 
met."
"Country managers also prepare and implement 
annual country health and safety action plans to meet 
these obligations, reduce harm, and develop mitigation 
strategies for managing risk."
"To ensure we remain fo-
cused on activities that minimise risks and harm, the 
Managing Board and country managers employ health 
and safety specialists to advise, assist, and help deliver 
on legal and corporate requirements for occupational 
health and safety."
"Occupational safety is also included in the individual 
target agreements for the Managing Board and the op-
erational top management in the various countries."
"Policies
In all countries, occupational health and safety is sub-
ject to legal requirements."
"Furthermore, as a member 
of the Global Cement and Concrete Association 
(GCCA), Heidelberg Materials complies with its guide-
lines."
"These have been integrated into our internal 
standards."
"As part of our Group policy on occupational health and 
safety, we have defined a set of cardinal rules that are 
mandatory for all employees and contractors."
"They 
­
relate especially to those activities that have been 
identified as main risk areas for accidents."
"They include 
requirements for equipment isolation, protection from 
moving parts of machinery, driving safety – both at our 
sites and en route to customers – entry to confined 
spaces, a range of personal protective equipment, and 
the need to report all accidents and incidents."
"The car-
dinal rules are supported by Group H&S standards that 
provide additional information and guidance on how to 
meet these requirements."
"Processes
We recognise that there are inherent risks associated 
with our activities."
"Our approach to these risks is one 
of continuous improvement, taking into account indus-
try best practice, legal requirements, and government 
regulations."
"In addition, we assess our activities on a 
regular basis to ensure hazards are identified and con-
trol measures are put in place to mitigate risks."
"Risk 
assessments are mandatory in some of the countries 
in which we operate, and they play a key role in our 
business operations, whether or not they are not re-
quired by law."
"Each operational site has a risk register, 
identifying known risks and including corresponding 
risk assessments and agreed safe systems of work."
"We 
also use dynamic risk assessment as a method to es-
tablish if it is safe to work, just before starting any ac-
tivity and at any time something changes during that 
activity."
"To ensure we remain focused on activities that mini-
mise risks and harm, each country manager is respon-
sible for preparing health and safety action plans each 
year that target risk groups, activities, and primary 
causes of accidents and incidents."
"We also have robust 
selection and vetting criteria for appointing contrac-
tors and transport companies and ensure that their 
employees working for us are included in our on-site 
safety briefings and initiatives and regularly supervised 
by nominated competent persons."
"Occupational health and safety management systems, 
such as ISO 45001 and comparable local standards, 
have already been implemented in 99% of our loca-
tions."
"These locations are regularly internally and 
­
externally audited, as required by the relevant man-
agement system."
"The systems require a structured ap-
proach from the local line management with planning, 
clear work procedures, responsibilities, and controls to 
ensure an ongoing improvement process and thereby 
prevent accidents."
"To support this approach, we use HC Protect through-
out the Group."
"This is a standardised software in which 
accidents, incidents, near hits, inspections, and safety 
conversations by our own employees, employees of ex-
ternal companies, and if appropriate, third parties are 
recorded."
"It helps us conduct in-depth analysis of 
trends and patterns to understand and mitigate risks."
"An accident event cannot be closed in HC Protect until 
the causes of the accident have been analysed and 
documented and corrective or preventive actions have 
been defined."
"The system tracks the measures de-
fined to ensure that opportunities for improvement are 
­
realised."
"We place a special focus on potential fatal incidents 
(PFIs), i.e."
"accidents and incidents that are identified 
as unsafe activities or situations that could have been 
­
fatal."
"They are marked as PFIs in HC Protect and must 
be fully investigated even if no one was harmed."
"An 
incident can only be approved and closed once a root 
cause analysis has been completed and corrective 
­
actions have been defined."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 137
We share the findings from accident investigations 
across the Group in the form of safety alerts in order 
to prevent similar accidents elsewhere in the Group."
"In 
the event of an accident resulting in a fatality, this in­
cident will also be discussed by the Managing Board."
"As part of our behavioural safety programme, man­
agers and supervisors conduct safety conversations 
during operational site visits and record any observa-
tions in our HC Protect database."
"This includes com­
pliance with best practices as well as any unsafe con-
ditions observed."
"For any significant concerns or 
violations, actions are identified and agreed with re-
sponsible persons, and deadlines for corrective actions 
are set."
"In addition, we can identify trends, at-risk 
groups, and main areas of concern, and report on 
these monthly."
"The gaps and remedial 
measures identified in the process, as well as progress 
made, are discussed with local management on a reg-
ular basis and reported to the respective member of 
the Managing Board on a quarterly basis."
"To prevent job-related illnesses, we routinely check our 
workplaces for exposure to factors that could be haz-
ardous to health, such as respirable crystalline silica 
(RCS), noise, or dust."
"Employees who are exposed to 
these risks are regularly examined by occupational 
health specialists."
"Employees trained as first-aiders can 
provide first aid in emergencies at all operational sites."
"As part of our annual Global Safety Week, we organise 
a range of training sessions, exercises on real-world 
situations, visits by safety managers, audits, inspec-
tions, health awareness training, and plant inspections."
"At most of our locations in countries where there is lim-
ited access to health care, Heidelberg Materials oper-
ates on-site infirmaries, which are generally staffed by 
nurses and medical personnel."
"In addition, we provide follow-up checks, referrals, 
and limited treatment for chronic diseases."
"In Germany, for example, we have incorporated our 
health management activities into the FIT for LIFE ini-
tiative."
"This includes a prevention programme for the 
early diagnosis of illnesses and risk factors, but primar-
ily focuses on supporting the initiative of individuals to 
adopt a healthy lifestyle."
"For employees in Germany, 
we have also introduced the option of company bi­
cycles and set up a fitness studio at the Group head-
quarters offering physiotherapy support."
"In the future, 
our health management activities will continue to focus 
on preventing typical age-related health risks and sup-
porting health-conscious behaviour."
"We are therefore 
specifically promoting company sports activities for a 
range of age groups."
"In some countries, such as the 
United Kingdom, we have established mental health 
first-aiders."
"These are volunteers who have opted in to 
training on how to support people experiencing mental 
health issues."
"In addition, they have organised themed 
events on financial awareness, mental health aware-
ness, summer well-being, and health awareness."
"In 
France, similar actions were carried out, with monthly 
themed health events to raise awareness."
"In 
some cases, we work together with external providers 
of counselling services."
"Use of these services is free of 
charge and is treated confidentially."
"In many countries, 
we also offer appropriate support in the event of acci-
dents to help the employees affected to come to terms 
with what they have experienced."
"Combined management report
Non-financial ­

Heidelberg Materials 2023 138
Since the coronavirus pandemic, we have placed par-
ticular emphasis on preventive measures, including 
against other infectious diseases, such as flu."
"These 
include the provision of sanitisers, the installation of 
physical partitions, and more virtual meetings."
"In 2023, we continued training our employees on a 
range of occupational safety topics, including both leg­
ally mandated and internally defined topics relating to 
key hazards that are relevant locally and across the 
Group."
"By doing so, we aim to increase awareness of 
risks and further reduce the number of accidents, es-
pecially those resulting in fatalities, and continue our 
focus on mental health and well-being."
"We make use of conventional training in classrooms, 
e-learning courses, various media, and safety alerts to 
train and keep our people informed on health, safety, 
mental health, and well-being issues."
"This type of infor-
mation and training accounts for more than 50% of all 
the training provided at Heidelberg Materials."
"In addition to conventional training activities, safety 
conversations also play a central role as a preventive 
measure against accidents."
"During these conversa-
tions between managers and employees, both safe 
and unsafe behaviour in the relevant situation are dis-
cussed and, if necessary, safer procedures are agreed."
"This is an important tool for encouraging safe behav-
iours in our workforce."
"Performance indicators
The lost time injury frequency rate was unchanged in 
the reporting year at 1.7 (previous year: 1.7)."
"The lost 
time injury severity rate increased slightly from 79 to 
80."
"This development shows that there were a similar 
number of accidents compared with the previous year, 
but that, on average, absences were slightly longer."
"In 
the 2023 business year, we mourned the death of one 
of our own employees and that of four employees of 
contractors."
"One case involved a fire and another in-
volved a fall from a great height."
"Three other cases 
occurred in connection with working with heavy equip-
ment or on production facilities."
"All fatalities were in-
vestigated, and action plans were developed to pre-
vent similar incidents in the future."
"The lost time injury 
frequency rate increased 7% compared with the base 
year 2020."
"In order to take account of these differ­
ences and ensure responsible corporate governance, 
we have implemented a compliance management sys-
tem across the Group."
"Within this framework, we carry 
out compliance risk assessments every four years, 
most recently in 2020, and determine areas of focus 
for the content of the compliance programme."
"This is 
done by conducting structured interviews with the gen-
eral managers of the country organisations (country 
managers) and the Group directors."
"In this way, com-
pliance risk areas are identified and ranked."
"The risks in 
the topic areas of corruption, competition law, and hu-
man rights are among the ten most important risks 
that we mitigate by means of our compliance manage-
ment system."
"Corruption topic area
Heidelberg Materials’ business activity involves signifi-
cant cash flows, particularly in sales, procurement, fi-
nancing, and investments, which have the potential to 
provide opportunities for corruption in all countries of 
the world."
"According to Transparency International’s 
2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, many of the coun-
tries in which Heidelberg Materials operates have an 
increased risk of corruption."
"Competition law topic area 
As Heidelberg Materials’ products are largely stand-
ardised, competition is heavily determined by price."
"In 
addition, the markets in which we operate have a rela-
tively high degree of transparency and are often char-
acterised by oligopolistic structures."
"All of this can, on 
the one hand, increase the incentive for unlawful re-
straints on competition and, on the other hand, also 
lead to mere suspicions of antitrust violations."
"Human rights topic area
The due diligence process is the core of the compliance 
management system in the human rights area and 
is used to assess human rights risks in addition to de-
veloping and implementing preventive and remedial 
measures."
"Our industry is particularly exposed to po-
tential human rights risks relating to occupational safe-
ty, equality, and the environment."
"Working with heavy 
technical equipment or in logistics poses a potential 
risk of unsafe working conditions in our industry."
"Par-
ticular attention should also be paid to the risk of dis-
crimination against women in the sector, which is still 
male-dominated."
"The extraction of raw materials can 
lead to conflicts with the rights of the population, for 
example if there are resettlement plans or if specially 
protected indigenous groups are affected."
"However, 
according to the annual risk assessment of our Group 
companies, the overall likelihood of these risks is very 
low."
"In addition to the health and safety audits, data 
Combined management report
Non-financial ­
statement
Heidelberg Materials 2023 139
from 216 locations worldwide was evaluated, including 
100% of the plants in ten countries."
"Targets and commitments
We apply a zero tolerance policy to violations of appli-
cable laws, regulations, and internal company policies."
"All suppliers are also obligated 
to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"The impacts of any new investment on our compliance 
management system and, in particular, our human 
rights obligations are also part of our due diligence 
process."
"Human rights and business considerations are 
among the factors taken into account when making 
investment decisions."
"Responsibility and organisation
The compliance programme, which is anchored in the 
Group-wide management and supervisory structures, 
comprises the entire compliance organisation within 
the Group, the set-up of guidelines, and the verification 
of compliance with these guidelines."
"The compliance 
management system addresses all topics that 
Heidelberg Materials has identified as relevant in the 
compliance programme and compliance risk assess-
ment."
"The compliance organisation is under the authority of 
the Chairman of the Managing Board, to whom the 
­
Director Group Legal & Compliance reports directly."
"The Director Group Legal & Compliance reports twice 
a year to the entire Managing Board and the Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board on the status and 
development of the compliance management system 
and on key compliance figures."
"Compliance incidents 
within the Group that are rated to be significant are 
also discussed."
"The Managing Board is also informed 
in writing about significant compliance incidents on a 
quarterly basis."
"All Group countries have their own 
compliance officers, who report directly to the country 
managers and indirectly to the Group Compliance 
­
department."
"The Compliance function, including the 
Group human rights officer appointed by the Managing 
Board, is responsible for developing, implementing, 
and monitoring the compliance management system in 
relation to human rights."
"The Group ESG department 
is respons­
ible for implementing the environmental as-
pects relating to human rights within the compliance 
management system."
"The human rights team in the 
Group Compliance department supports the due dili-
gence processes with regard to human rights in its own 
area of the business and in the supply chain."
"In order 
to strengthen the human rights compliance pro-
gramme, each country organisation has a person re-
sponsible for coordinating human rights and a person 
with expertise in environmental issues assessing and 
dealing with human rights impacts related to environ-
mental aspects."
"Due to the overarching nature of 
­
human rights, the persons responsible for coordinating 
human rights are supported by a cross-functional team 
drawn from the Group departments ESG, Procurement, 
Human Resources, Occupational Safety, and Commu-
nications."
"Policies
Our compliance principles are laid down in our Code of 
Business Conduct, which covers all compliance topics 
that are material for Heidelberg Materials, and in our 
Policy Statement on Human Rights adopted in 2023."
"The organisation of the compliance management sys-
tem is defined in our internal Compliance Policy."
"In 2023, we aligned the existing compliance guidelines 
with our new brand identity and implemented ad­
justments in connection with the change of name to 
Heidelberg Materials AG."
"We also published the mo­
dified access information for the new version of our 
SpeakUp whistle-blower system."
"Major changes have 
been made to the content of the Group Compliance 
Incident Reporting & Case Management Guideline."
"These adjustments to the implementation of the German 
Whistleblower Protection Act (Hinweisgeberschutz­
gesetz, HinSchG) and the German Supply Chain Due 
Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichten­
gesetz, 
LkSG) with regard to the human rights-related com-
plaints mechanism."
"The Group Anti-Corruption Guideline defines principles 
for all companies under the Group’s control, such as 
behaving with integrity towards business partners or 
avoiding conflicts of interest."
"The policy aims to pre-
vent corrupt and unethical behaviour in business prac-
tice."
"Among other things, it sets out rules on how gifts 
and invitations should be handled as well as guidelines 
for interactions with consultants and advisors."
"The Group Competi-
tion Law Guideline was further developed in 2023 by 
means of supplementary provisions for all EEA coun-
tries and the United Kingdom."
"In 2023, the Managing Board adopted a Policy State-
ment on Human Rights, which replaces Heidelberg 
Materials’ previous position on human rights."
"The Policy 
Statement sets out the human rights strategy and ap-
plies to all Group companies directly or indirectly con-
trolled by Heidelberg Materials AG."
"It is a commitment 
to responsible corporate governance."
"It incorporates 
our main principles and key objectives with regard to 
protecting human rights and the environment, including 
the promotion of diversity, equality, and decent work-
ing conditions."
"Among other things, it addresses em-
ployees’ working conditions, the rights of vulnerable 
groups including indigenous peoples, responsibility at 
our locations, the selection of suppliers, and the in-
struction and oversight of security service providers."
"All Group countries are required to translate the Policy 
Statement into their respective national language."
"It 
has been published on the website and communicated 
to all relevant stakeholders."
"Its internal and external 
communication clarifies the company’s position on 
­
human rights and serves to integrate the principles 
into our corporate processes."
"The internal Guideline on 
­
Human Rights Compliance Management regulates the 
organisation and responsibilities associated with im-
plementing compliance with human rights."
"Processes
The compliance programme integrated across the 
Group serves as a cornerstone for achieving our com-
pliance targets."
"It is continuously reviewed for the need to adapt to 
current legal and social developments by keeping track 
of news and exchanging information with compliance 
experts, and is improved and further developed ac-
cordingly."
"A central element of this programme is the self-com-
mitment made by the Group management not to toler-
ate violations of applicable laws and to impose sanc-
tions."
"The programme also includes internal guidelines 
and measures that express the legal provisions in con-
crete terms."
"In addition, suitable corrective and pre-
ventive measures are taken to help prevent similar in-
cidents in the future."
"Further to annual communication 
of these guidelines, compliance letters and video mes-
sages are circulated to the workforce."
"Software is used 
for the administration of compliance tasks and report-
ing."
"The corruption and human rights risk assessments 
are also documented using this software and analysed 
by the Group Compliance department."
"Our well-estab-
lished web- and telephone-based whistle-blower sys-
tem SpeakUp is accessible across the Group and also 
in all Group languages to people outside the organisa-
tion."
"We updated the system in 2023 by switching to a 
new version."
"Employee training is carried out online as well as face 
to face."
"The range of digital courses, which are manda-
tory for specified groups of employees, covers topics 
such as the Code of Business Conduct, competition 
law, the prevention of corruption, and human rights."
"In 
order to achieve a 100% completion rate for all digital 
compliance training, we require the country managers 
to additionally report on training attendance to the re-
sponsible member of the Managing Board."
"The group 
of persons required to attend the online training cours-
es includes, depending on the course, all employees 
who have a company email address or employees of 
specific departments and/or managers."
"The training 
courses are mandatory for new hires and are repeated 
every two years."
"In addition, training sessions are con-
ducted on other compliance topics such as trade sanc-
tions or money laundering."
"They are carried out both 
at the request of specific departments and on the in-
structions of the Compliance function."
"In 2023, regular 
human rights training was organised for the individuals 
responsible for coordinating human rights at country 
level."
"Group-wide implementation of the compliance pro-
gramme is monitored via regular and special audits by 
Group Internal Audit as well as via half-yearly reporting 
by the Director Group Legal & Compliance to the Man-
aging Board and the Audit Committee of the Super­
visory Board."
"The latter monitors the effectiveness of 
the compliance programme and verifies in particular 
whether it adequately satisfies the legal requirements 
and recognised compliance standards."
"An additional 
quarterly report informs the Managing Board members 
with regional responsibility about the most important 
compliance and human rights incidents in their Group 
areas."
"Combined management report

We conduct comprehensive analyses to assess and 
prevent corruption risks and possible conflicts of inter-
est."
"Up until 2023, this risk assessment process was 
repeated approximately every three years."
"From 2023, 
the analysis will be carried out every two years."
"This will 
be done on a rolling basis, so that different Group 
countries are analysed each year."
"First, the potential 
risks within a country organisation are assessed."
"Then, 
the measures already in place to limit these risks are 
evaluated, and finally, we examine whether further 
measures are needed."
"On the basis of this assessment, 
an action plan is drawn up for each country, and its 
implementation is monitored by the Group Legal & 
Compliance department."
"In the area of competition law, we have a comprehen-
sive reporting system on antitrust investigation pro-
ceedings."
"An annual competition law update takes 
place at Managing Board level."
"Employees with respon-
sibility for sales who report directly to the members of 
the Managing Board are also regularly informed about 
antitrust regulations."
"Furthermore, annual qualitative 
assessments of the antitrust risks take place in the 
countries."
"A regular external audit of the Antitrust 
Compliance programme is conducted by a specialist 
law firm approximately every three years."
"We have established management processes that al-
low us to exercise effective human rights due diligence 
and in our opinion meet the requirements of both the 
United Nations Guiding Principles and the German 
­
Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG)."
"The human rights risk assessment covers potential and 
actual negative impacts of our business activities on 
people and incorporates knowledge from research as 
well as from internal and external dialogue."
"In the 
Group companies controlled by Heidelberg Materials 
AG, we carry out human rights risk analyses, which are 
carried out regularly (at least once a year) and on an 
ad hoc basis from 2023 onwards."
"The process con­
siders risks relating to discrimination, child or forced 
­
labour, risks to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, and risks to fair and safe working condi-
tions."
"The commitment to human rights aspects as a 
central selection criterion for suppliers is driven for-
ward by our supplier management system."
"This obliges 
our partners to commit to our Supplier Code of Con-
duct, which requires compliance with human rights due 
diligence obligations as defined by the German LkSG, 
such as the prohibition of forced labour and rules on 
non-discrimination."
"Measures and progress
Non-compliance with our guidelines by employees may 
result in disciplinary measures up to and including dis-
missal."
"Financial sanctions are possible too in some 
countries."
"Individuals may also be demoted, which can 
be reflected in their salary."
"Violations of corruption or 
competition laws, human rights, or contractual agree-
ments by third parties may exclude them from doing 
business with Heidelberg Materials or require them to 
meet certain test conditions."
"Our SpeakUp whistle-blower system helps us not only 
to track compliance violations, but also to improve our 
preventive measures."
"SpeakUp is publicised on the in-
tranet, on the internet, and at the various locations 
worldwide by means of informative posters."
"To rein-
force our efforts to combat corruption, the country or-
ganisations are working on the implementation of indi-
vidual country measures that were defined as part of 
the corruption risk assessment."
"The same applies to 
competition law and the protection of human rights."
"The communication of the values in our Code of Busi-
ness Conduct, including human rights aspects, is sup-
ported by animated explanatory videos and infor­
mation events."
"In 2023, the preventive activities of the 
compliance officers once again placed great emphasis 
on compliance with the provisions of competition law 
and anti-corruption regulations."
"In order to implement 
the German LkSG, the compliance officers and human 
rights coordinators continued to work with the Group 
Procurement department in 2023 as part of the Re-
sponsible Procurement initiative."
"Other functions were 
made aware of their human rights due diligence obliga-
tions via information events backed by appropriate 
training measures."
"Efforts to protect human rights at our own locations 
and in the supply chain continued and were intensified 
by the human rights team and the Responsible Procure-
ment initiative."
"Standardised preventive measures to 
fulfil our obligation to uphold human rights have been 
introduced at all country organisations."
"In addition to 
training activities, this work included systematically 
­
assessing human rights risks on a country-by-country 
basis and compiling key indicators relating to human 
rights."
"The results of the specific risk assessment, both 
in our own area of operations and in the supply chain, 
were analysed jointly by the respective country organ-
isation and the Group Compliance department’s ­
human 
rights team and reported to the responsible member of 
the Managing Board."
"Most of the reports received concerned employee re-
lations."
"Other reports related to health and safety; 
fraud, theft or embezzlement; and corruption or con-
flicts of interest."
"Other categories of cases accounted 
for lower percentages of the total."
"Of the 283 incidents reported, around half proved to be 
unfounded, while for 14%, no final investigation result 
had been determined by the editorial deadline."
"In the 
case of 36% of the incidents, the investigations re-
vealed that they were at least partially substantiated."
"None of the substantiated incident reports had a ma-
terial impact on the consolidated financial statements."
"In the case of substantiated incidents, measures were 
generally taken, ranging from root cause analysis, 
changes to policies and processes, and communica-
tion and training through to disciplinary action (such as 
a written warning or dismissal)."
"In 45% of the substan-
tiated incidents, sanctions were imposed, and for 69% 
of these incidents, preventive measures were imple-
mented."
"At the end of the reporting year, the compliance e-­
learning programmes assigned to employees across 
the Group, covering the Code of Business Conduct and 
anti-corruption issues, had completion rates of 93% 
and 91% respectively."
"Electronic training on antitrust law is additionally as-
signed to employees who work in sales or procurement, 
have management responsibility, or otherwise have 
contact with competitors, customers, and suppliers, 
achieving a completion rate of 93% at the end of the 
reporting year."
"There were also other compliance ac-
tivities in the area of antitrust law (seminars, lectures, 
and other measures)."
"The e-learning programme on the topic of human rights 
was completed as mandatory training for the first time 
in 2023 and achieved a completion rate of 87%."
"Around 
15,000 employees across the Group have successfully 
completed the course."
"The country organisations are required to report key 
figures, such as the number of compliance incidents 
reported through the case management system that 
involve suspected human rights violations."
"The investigation of the fourth case is still 
ongoing."
"There were also ten complaints about suppli-
ers, of which two were confirmed and three are still 
­
under investigation."
"Of the ten cases, nine related to 
possible unfair working conditions, and one concerned 
occupational safety."
"All confirmed incidents were re-
sponded to with sanctions and/or corrective meas-
ures."
"There were no complaints or violations concern-
ing other human rights."
"Incidents reported via case management system

"Such statements are naturally subject to 
risks and uncertainties and may therefore deviate sig-
nificantly from the actual development."
"Risks and opportunities that are not part of the outlook 
and may lead to significant negative or positive devia-
tions from the forecasted developments are included 
in the Risk and opportunity report chapter."
"Assumptions underlying our outlook
Our business is subject to a multitude of external in­
fluencing factors that are beyond our control."
"These 
include weather-related, macroeconomic, regulatory, 
and geopolitical factors."
"This outlook is based on the 
assumption that the global political environment will 
not change further as a result of geopolitical crises 
during the outlook period and that international ten-
sions will not significantly impair ­
­
Heidelberg ­
­
Materials’ 
business activities."
"Crucial factors for the development of the construction 
industry include, in particular, weather conditions, the 
local economic cycle, the development of energy and 
raw material prices, the level of public investments, and 
financing costs for real estate."
"In the growth markets 
of the emerging countries, the income available for 
­
private residential construction also plays an impor-
tant role."
"Global demand in the construction sector is expected 
to stabilise at a low level, even though inflation and 
persistently high financing costs are likely to continue 
to have a negative impact on residential construction 
in particular."
"For European construction activity, Euro-
construct forecasts a slight decline in almost all con-
struction sectors in 2024."
"The American cement asso-
ciation PCA and the Australian Construction Industry 
Forum expect a slight increase in construction activity, 
primarily driven by non-residential construction."
"The Managing Board therefore expects the result 
from current operations to be between €3.0 billion and 
€3.3 billion."
It expects a value of around 10% for ROIC.
"It aims to achieve a further slight reduction in specific 
net CO2 emissions."
"The Managing Board and Supervisory Board will pro-
pose to the 2024 Annual General Meeting a dividend of 
€3.00."
"The Managing Board continues to assess Heidelberg 
Materials’ financial situation as comfortable in the fore-
cast period."
"At the time of preparing the consolidated financial 
statements, the Managing Board is not aware of any 
material risks that might jeopardise the company as 
a  going concern (see Risk and opportunity report 
chapter)."
"Economic environment
General economic development
The global economy is coping better than initially 
feared with the consequences of geopolitical tensions 
and persistently high inflation."
"In its January 2024 forecast, the International Mone-
tary Fund (IMF) expects global economic output in 2024 
to grow slightly at the previous year’s level of 3.1%."
"Overall, however, expected growth remains below the 
2000–2019 average of 3.8%, which the IMF attributes 
to high central bank interest rates, the withdrawal of 
fiscal support, and weak productivity growth."
"Combined management report
Outlook
Heidelberg Materials 2023 144
However, the outlook is better than assumed in Octo-
ber 2023."
"The reasons identified by the IMF include the 
high resilience of numerous economies and higher 
growth expectations for the USA and China."
"By con-
trast, the forecasts for Germany and France have been 
lowered again."
"GDP growth of only 1.5% is forecast for 
2024 in industrialised countries, and around 4.1% in 
emerging and developing countries."
"According to the 
IMF’s forecast, India and China will achieve the highest 
growth rates in the current year."
"In view of the further decline in inflation rates and sta-
ble growth, the IMF considers the risks to global econ­
omic growth in the current year to be more balanced."
"On the one hand, growth could be higher than expect-
ed if, for example, inflation falls faster and financing 
conditions improve as a result."
"Budgetary consolida-
tion and structural reforms would also promote growth."
"On the other hand, sharp rises in raw material prices 
or persistent inflation would have a negative impact."
"A 
worsening of the problems in China’s property sector, 
as well as a shift towards tax increases and spending 
cuts, could also lead to weaker growth."
"At the end of 2023, energy prices fell, especial-
ly in Europe, due to mild and windy weather as well as 
high gas storage levels."
"This trend continued at the 
start of 2024."
"At current price levels and based on our 
contract portfolio – a mix of forward market and spot 
purchases – we do not expect energy prices to rise on 
average for the whole of 2024 compared with 2023."
"Development of the construction industry
The development of economic output is also reflected 
in the expectations for the construction industry."
"In its November 2023 forecast, Euroconstruct predicts 
a slight decline in construction activity in Europe as a 
whole in almost all construction sectors in 2024."
"Con-
struction activity is expected to decline in Sweden, 
Norway, Germany, France, and Italy as well as in Bel-
gium and the United Kingdom."
"Positive development in 
the construction sector is expected in the Netherlands 
and Spain."
"According to the fall forecast 2023 of the American 
­
cement association PCA, a slight increase in construc-
tion activity is anticipated in the USA for 2024, with all 
construction sectors expected to contribute."
"A positive 
development is forecast for non-residential construc-
tion in particular."
"Combined management report
Outlook
Heidelberg Materials 2023 145
The Australian Construction Industry Forum expects 
a further increase for the Australian construction in­
dustry."
"The forecasts are particularly positive for non-­
residential construction and infrastructure construc-
tion, which is supported by rising public spending, while 
residential construction continues to suffer from ele-
vated interest rates."
"In contrast to the mature and developed countries, the 
GDP growth forecasts and data on population growth 
as well as per capita cement consumption are fre-
quently used indicators for construction development 
in the growth markets of emerging countries in Africa 
and Asia."
"In this respect, the IMF growth rates for 
these markets provide an indication of the develop-
ment of the construction industry."
"Industry development
The European Commission has defined its position 
on  the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System 
(EU  ETS) for the fourth trading period from 2021 to 
2030 within the “Fit for 55” programme."
"The original 
cross-sectoral reduction target for 2030 within the EU 
ETS was thus raised from 43% improvement compared 
with 2005 to 62%."
"The existing benchmarks will apply 
to the first half of the fourth trading period until 2025."
"For the years from 2026 onwards, changes are antici-
pated that will lead to a further significant reduction in 
carbon allowances and thus in free allocations."
"The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has 
been phased in since 2024."
"Since October 2023, com-
panies have been required to publish quarterly reports 
on the quantities imported and the associated CO2 
emissions."
"In the second step, from 2026 onwards, al-
lowances corresponding to the amount of CO2 emis-
sions associated with the imported products (cement/
clinker) must also be purchased."
"An EU ETS has also been introduced for shipping in the 
2024 financial year."
"All ships operating within the EU or 
whose country of destination/origin is an EU country 
will be affected by the new ETS."
"We expect this to result 
in higher logistics costs from 2025."
"With the announced measures within the EU ETS, a sig-
nificant curtailment in the allocation of CO2 emission 
rights is also anticipated within the fourth trading 
­
period."
"Prices for emission rights averaged around €80 
in the 2023 financial year."
"At the beginning of 2024, the 
carbon price had fallen to around €60."
"A price increase 
in the fourth trading period could lead to additional 
costs for covering the required emission rights, accom-
panied by a decrease in the freely allocated ­
allowances."
"So far, Heidelberg Materials has a sufficient number of 
emission rights across the Group for the next two 
years."
"However, in individual countries there are al-
ready shortages of emission rights, which are covered 
by intra-Group trading."
"Further information can be 
found in the Risk and opportunity report chapter."
"Outlook 2024
Forecast of the key performance indicators
Demand in the construction sector is expected to sta-
bilise at a low level, even though inflation and persis-
tently high financing costs are likely to continue to have 
a negative impact on residential construction in par-
ticular."
"We expect cost developments on the energy 
and raw materials markets to remain volatile."
"The focus 
will therefore continue to be on price adjustments and 
strict cost management."
"For the 2024 financial year, the Managing Board ex-
pects the result from current operations (RCO) to be 
between €3.0 billion and €3.3 billion."
ROIC is expected to be at around 10%.
"The Managing Board anticipates a further slight reduc-
tion compared with 2023 in specific net CO2 emissions 
per tonne of cementitious material."
"Supplementary forecast of other financial figures
The Managing Board anticipates slight revenue growth 
(excluding scope and currency effects)."

"In com-
bination with the new share buyback programme, the 
first tranche of which is scheduled to start in the sec-
ond quarter of 2024 after the Annual General Meeting, 
Heidelberg Materials underscores its focus on share-
holder return."
"The company forecasts net investments in property, 
plant and equipment (investments in and divestments 
of property, plant and equipment) in the 2024 financial 
year to be around €1.1 billion, as in previous years."
"Heidelberg Materials plans to repay the financial liabil-
ities expiring in 2024 through free cash flow and avail-
able liquidity."
"With the €2 billion Multi-Currency Sustainability Target 
Commercial Paper programme and the €10 billion EMTN 
programme, we also have framework programmes in 
the money and capital markets in place, which allow 
us to issue the relevant securities within a short period 
of time."
"We aim to increase the share of sustainability-linked 
financing instruments to over 70% by 2025."
"We intend to maintain our solid investment grade rat-
ing."
"The leverage ratio is expected to be within the

strategic corridor of 1.5x to 2.0x."
"Risk and opportunity 
report
Risk and opportunity management
As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of building 
materials and solutions, Heidelberg Materials is ex-
posed to numerous risks and opportunities due to its 
international business activity."
"Heidelberg Materials’ 
risk policy is based on the Group strategy, which 
­
focuses, among other things, on both sustainably pre-
serving and increasing enterprise value."
"An effective 
risk and opportunity management system serves to 
identify these risks and opportunities at an early stage 
and to systematically assess and reduce them."
"Conse-
quently, the risk management process represents a 
central element of the Group’s value-oriented corpo-
rate governance."
"At Heidelberg Materials, risks and opportunities are 
monitored and managed across the Group with the 
help of integrated planning and monitoring systems."
"We consider events that may have a negative impact 
on the achievement of short-term and long-term stra-
tegic and operational corporate targets to be risks."
"Provided that these risks are consistent with the legal 
and ethical principles of entrepreneurial activity and 
are well balanced by the opportunities they present, 
these risks are classified as acceptable."
"We see pos­
sible achievements that go beyond our corporate plan-
ning as opportunities."
"Operational management in 
each Group country and in the central Group depart-
ments are directly responsible for identifying and ob-
serving risks and opportunities at an early stage."
"Risks 
and opportunities are recorded in the annual opera-
tional plan and followed up as part of monthly financial 
reporting."
"Risk management system
Pursuant to section 91(2) and (3) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG), the Managing 
Board of Heidelberg Materials AG is obliged to set up 
an appropriate and effective Group-wide internal con-
trol and risk management system."
"The Managing Board 
also has overall responsibility for the scope and organ-
isation of the established systems."
"For an assessment 
of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the risk 
management system and the internal control system, 
please refer to the details in the Corporate Governance 
statement."
"The Supervisory Board and its Audit Com-
mittee also regularly monitor the effectiveness of the 
risk management system pursuant to section 107(3)(2) 
of the AktG."
"Heidelberg Materials has installed transparent regula-
tions to govern competences and responsibilities for 
the risk management system that are based on the 
Group’s structure."
"A code of conduct, guidelines, and 
principles apply across the Group for the implementa-
tion of systematic and effective risk management."
"The 
risk management system primarily serves to record 
and analyse risks."
"Where appropriate and realisable in 
the short term, potential opportunities are taken into 
account by country management in regular planning 
processes and followed-up on an ongoing basis in op-
erating activities."
"Our risk management process re-
flects the decentralised structure of the company and 
facilitates the identification of risks as part of the op-
erational plan."
"It comprises several components that 
are carefully coordinated and incorporated into the 
structure and workflow organisation."
"Risk management process
The Group Insurance & Corporate Risk department 
­
defines the organisational requirements for the risk 
management system as well as binding guidelines and 
methods for the internal risk management process in 
the Risk Management Policy."
"In order to optimise risk 
management and incorporate it into the operational 
plan, we use a software across the Group that enables 
the decentralised recording of risks in the respective 
countries and Group departments during the year."
"The 
software allows us to visualise the Group structure and 
assign local responsibilities."
"Supported by a standardised evaluation framework for 
risk assessment, short-term risks are systematically 
recorded on a quarterly basis and can be tracked con-
tinuously."
"The risk data can be consolidated immedi-
ately, analysed flexibly, and presented via standard-
ised risk reporting."
"In addition to this short-term risk recording, risks with 
a medium-term (one to three years) or long-term (over 
three years) time horizon are also taken into account."
"As well as strategic risks, this medium- and long-term 
view also concerns climate risks, which according 
to the definition of the Task Force on Climate-related 
Finan­
cial Disclosures (TCFD) include both physical risks 
and transition risks."
"These risks are identified and cen-
trally recorded with regard to any potentially critical 
economic impact on our company."
"Identification and assessment of risks
The process of identifying risks is performed regularly 
on a decentralised basis by the country management 
and by the globally responsible Group departments."
"General macroeconomic data, industry-specific risk 
information sources, and identification tools and tech-
niques serve as auxiliary parameters for the identifica-
tion process, as does the internal risk catalogue, which 
records the various financial and non-financial risk cat-
egories."
"For regular risk reporting during the year, specific 
thresholds have been established for the individual 
countries, taking into account their specific circum-
stances."
"The risks are assessed for each defined risk 
category on the basis of a minimum likelihood of 10% 
and according to the expected impact."
"The two dimen-
sions provide an overall assessment of the risk (see 
graphic on the following page)."
"The risks are consid-
ered net – i.e."
after any risk mitigation measures.
"The effects on the following key para­
meters are used as a benchmark to assess potential 
impact: result from current operations, profit for the 
financial year, and cash flow."
"Both dimensions of risk 
assessment can be visualised by means of a risk map."
"These risks are recorded by the Group Strategy 
and Development/M & A department."
"In addition, their 
emergence and annual development are monitored."
"This includes the physical risks and transition risks 
­
associated with climate change."
"Risks with a likelihood below 20% that have a potential-
ly critical impact at Group level, known as tail event 
risks, must also be reported."
"These are recorded both 
centrally at Group level and, on an annual basis, sepa-
rately via the Finance Directors of the countries."
"The risk analysis process also takes into account 
risks that do not have a direct impact on the financial 
situation."
"ESG risks in particular are an example of 
this ­
category."
"These non-financial risks influence non-­
monetary factors such as reputation or business strat-
egy."
"For risks that cannot be quantified directly, a qual-
itative assessment is made of the potential impact and 
the likelihood (analogous to quantifiable risks), which is 
graded from low to critical."
"The process of regular identification is supplemented 
with an ad-hoc risk report in the event of the sudden 
occurrence of risks or of sudden damage caused."
"This 
can arise, in particular, in connection with political 
events, trends in the financial markets, or natural dis-
asters."
"­
Correlations between individual risks and events are 
considered at country level as far as possible."
"As part of risk aggregation, the Group’s overall risk 
­
position is determined, which is regularly used to mon-
itor the relationship to the risk-bearing capacity."
"The 
risk-bearing capacity represents the maximum risk 
that might jeopardise a company as a going concern 
within the meaning of section 91(2) of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG)."
"The Group Insurance & Corporate Risk department is 
responsible for coordinating the risk management pro-
cesses at Group level."
"It summarises all significant 
quantitative and qualitative risks for countries and 
Group departments in a central risk map at the quar-
terly management meetings."
"The current risk situation 
is communicated to the Managing Board after each 
quarterly management meeting."
"The consolidated risk 
report is also presented to the Board once a year."
"This 
examines the Group’s current risk situation, including 
the assessment of the current risk-bearing capacity, 
the global risk landscape, expected future develop-
ments, and significant regulatory changes."
"In addition, 
reporting to the Supervisory Board is effected every 
six months."
"Managing and controlling risks
Country management is responsible for managing risks 
on a continuous basis and for defining risk control 
measures."
"The regular management meetings provide 
a platform for the Managing Board and responsible 
country managers to discuss and define risk mitigation 
measures promptly."
"Decisions are thus made as to 
which risks will be intentionally borne independently 
and which will be transferred to other risk carriers, as 
well as which measures are suitable for reducing or 
avoiding potential risks."
"Costs and benefits are taken 
into account."
"Risk controlling includes monitoring the 
implementation and progress of the agreed measures 
as well as reviewing them on a regular basis."
"Monitoring the risk management process
The Group Internal Audit department examines and 
assesses the functionality and effectiveness of our risk 
management to help improve risk awareness."
"The Managing Board also regularly informs the Super-
visory Board and its Audit Committee about the risk 
situation."
"The internal monitoring system at Heidelberg Materials 
consists of process-independent and process-integrat-
ed control measures."
"The process-integrated auditing 
activities include controls like the principle of dual con-
trol."
"Process-independent measures are controls car-
ried out by persons not directly involved in the account-
ing process (e.g."
"Structures and processes
The organisational and management structure of 
Heidelberg Materials AG and its Group companies is 
clearly defined."
"The responsibilities and functions with-
in the accounting process (e.g."
"accounting of Heidelberg 
Materials AG and its Group companies, Group Treas-
ury, and Group Reporting, Controlling & Consolidation) 
are also clearly separated and defined."
"New laws, accounting standards, and current 
developments (e.g."
"in the Group’s economic and legal 
environment) are analysed and taken into account with 
regard to their relevance and impact on the consolidat-
ed financial statements."
"In the case of accounting 
­
issues that are complex or require discretionary judge-
ment, we also call upon the expertise of external ser-
vice providers."
"In most countries, the financial statements of the 
Group companies are prepared in shared service 
centers in order to centralise and standardise the ac-
counting processes."
"Accounting systems from SAP are 
used in the majority of cases."
"To prepare the consoli-
dated financial statements, further information is add-
ed to the separate financial statements of the Group 
companies, and these are then consolidated using 
standardised software developed by SAP."
"All consoli-
dation adjustments, such as the capital consolidation, 
the debt consolidation, the expense and income con-
solidation, and the at equity valuation, are carried out 
and documented."
"The various elements that make up the 
consolidated financial statements, including the Notes, 
are created entirely from this consolidation program."
"At Heidelberg Materials, the accounts data is checked 
at both local and central level."
"The decentralised check-
ing of the local financial statements is carried out 
by the responsible Finance Director and country con-
trolling."
"The central checking is undertaken by the 
Group departments Reporting, Controlling & Consoli-
dation, Tax, and Treasury."
"Heidelberg Materials’ control system is also supple-
mented by manual checks, such as regular spot checks 
and plausibility checks, carried out both locally and 
centrally."
"It is supplemented by system-side valida-
tions, which are performed automatically by the con-
solidation program."
"Process-independent checks are carried out by the 
­
Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board and by the 
Group Internal Audit department."
"The latter checks the 
internal control system for the structures and process-
es described and monitors application of the account-
ing guidelines and accounting framework."
"The results 
of the check are reported to the Managing Board and 
the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Measures for identifying, assessing, and  
limiting risks
In order to identify and assess risks, individual business 
transactions at Heidelberg Materials are analysed us-
ing the criteria of risk potential, likelihood, and impact."
"Suitable control measures are then established on the 
basis of these analyses."
"To limit the risks, transactions 
above a certain volume or with a certain complexity are 
subject to an established approval process."
"Organisa-
tional measures (e.g."
"separation of functions in sensi-
tive areas) and ongoing target/actual comparisons are 
also performed for key accounting figures."
"The IT sys-
tems used for accounting are protected from unauthor-
ised access by appropriate security measures."
"The established control and risk management systems 
are not able to guarantee accurate and complete ac-
counting with absolute certainty."
"In particular, individ-
ual incorrectly made assumptions, inefficient controls, 
and illegal activities may limit the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management systems em-
ployed."
"Exceptional or complex circumstances that are 
not handled in a routine manner also entail a latent risk."
"The statements made here apply to Heidelberg 
Materials AG and its subsidiaries included in the consol-
idated financial statements."
"In the following, we assess only the 
risk situation of risks that are significant for us."
"Financial risks
Our significant financial risks include currency risks, in-
terest rate risks, refinancing/liquidity risks, credit risks, 
tax risks, and pension risks."
"We manage these risks pri-
marily as part of our ongoing business and financing 
activities and, when required, by using derivative finan-
cial instruments."
"These risk areas are monitored on a 
continuous basis by the Group Treasury department in 
accordance with internal Group guidelines, which also 
define the work and processes of Group Treasury."
"All 
Group companies must identify their risks on the basis 
of these guidelines and, if necessary, hedge them in 
cooperation with Group Treasury."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 151
Currency risks
The most significant risk position with respect to finan-
cial risks is the currency risk, particularly the transla-
tion risk."
"Currency risks arise from our foreign currency 
positions and are characterised by uncertainty in rela-
tion to the future development of exchange rates."
"Econ­
omic, monetary, fiscal, and political factors of in-
fluence should not be underestimated in this context."
"Unforeseen events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war 
that has been ongoing since February 2022 or the es-
calating conflict in the Middle East since early Octo-
ber 2023, may lead to distortions in the currency mar-
kets and thus have a negative impact on translation 
and transaction effects."
"We consider these currency 
risks, primarily the translation risks, to represent a high 
risk with a possible likelihood and a significant impact."
"Currency risks arising as a result of transactions with 
third parties in foreign currency (transaction risks) are 
hedged in certain cases using derivative financial in-
struments."
"We primarily use foreign exchange swaps 
and currency forwards for this purpose."
"Through our 
Group-wide financing and liquidity management meas-
ures, the borrowing and investment of liquidity of the 
subsidiaries lead to currency positions that are hedged 
by external foreign exchange swap transactions, which 
are appropriate in terms of maturities and amounts."
"More information on cur-
rency risks can be found in Note 10.3."
"Interest rate risks are maintained within the 
para­
meters set by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer."
"By using financial instruments, primarily interest rate 
swaps, we are able to hedge both the risk of fluctuating 
cash flows and the risk of value fluctuations."
"A down-
grading of our credit rating by the rating agencies or 
the non-achievement of the key performance indica-
tors defined in the sustainable financing instruments 
could increase the interest margins of the financial in-
struments (see Group financial management section)."
"We anticipate that the interest rate rises by the major 
central banks have peaked."
"We therefore currently ex-
pect interest rates to fall and classify the interest rate 
risk overall as a medium risk with a possible likelihood 
and a low impact."
"More information on interest rate 
risks can be found in Note 10.3."
"Refinancing/liquidity risks
Refinancing/liquidity risks exist when a company is not 
able to procure the funds necessary to fulfil operation-
al obligations or obligations entered into in connection 
with financial instruments."
"Possible risks from fluctuating cash flows are consid-
ered as part of the Group liquidity planning."
"Assump-
tions concerning the expected economic cycle harbour 
particular uncertainties in liquidity planning, which is 
why we update them on an ongoing basis."
"In this way, 
we can – if necessary – initiate the appropriate meas-
ures, such as the issue of additional money and capital 
market securities or the raising of fresh funds in the 
bank market."
"To secure our payment obligations, we 
have access to a long-term syndicated credit line – 
taking into account sustainability targets – with a 
­
volume of €2 billion."
"As a result, we have access to sub-
stantial amounts of cash and cash equivalents and 
have thus considerably reduced the refinancing risk."
"In 
total, we have €5.0 billion of free liquidity, consisting of 
cash and cash equivalents, securities, and free credit 
lines, in our portfolio across the Group (see Liquidity 
instruments table in the Group financial management 
section)."
"As a further precautionary measure, a frame-
work for increasing shareholders’ equity was decided 
upon at the 2020 Annual General Meeting."
"In addition, 
the 2023 Annual General Meeting authorised Heidelberg 
Materials AG to issue warrant or convertible bonds 
or participating bonds, excluding subscription rights, 
against cash payment (until 10 May 2028) and condi-
tionally increased the subscribed share capital for this 
purpose."
"We consider refinancing/liquidity risks in gen-
eral to be a low risk with a seldom likelihood and a low 
to significant impact, depending on the capital market 
situation."
"More information on liquidity risks can be 
found in Note 10.3."
"Credit risks
Credit risks exist when a contractual partner cannot 
fulfil its obligations, or at least not within the stipulated 
period."
"We minimise the risk position arising from this 
by diversification and ongoing assessment of the cred-
itworthiness of our contracting parties."
"Credit risks from operating activities are monitored 
continuously as part of our receivables management."
"In this context, we also pay attention to the creditwor-
thiness of our business partners."
"In this way – as well 
as by avoiding concentrations of positions – we are 
able to minimise the Group’s credit risks."
"We minimise 
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 152
credit risks for our financial investments by only con-
ducting transactions with banks that are particularly 
creditworthy."
"We select banks for payment transac-
tions and establish cash pools in exactly the same way."
"We consider the credit risks as a medium risk with a 
seldom likelihood and a moderate impact."
"More infor-
mation on credit risks can be found in Note 10.3."
"Tax risks 
We operate in many countries around the world and are 
subject to the wide range of tax laws and regulations 
applicable in those countries as well as ongoing tax 
audits by the local tax authorities."
"Possible risks can 
arise from changes in local taxation laws or case law 
and from different or increasingly restrictive interpre-
tations of existing provisions."
"Significant acquisitions, 
divestments, restructuring measures, and reorganisa-
tion activities can also give rise to tax risks."
"These risks 
can impact our tax expense and income as well as our 
tax receivables and liabilities and our liquidity."
"Our Tax 
department continuously and systematically monitors 
the development of the tax risks and, if necessary, pro-
actively takes suitable measures to minimise them."
"We 
rate the tax risks as a high risk with a possible likelihood 
and a significant impact."
"Heidelberg Materials falls within the scope of the OECD 
Pillar Two Model Rules for the domestic implementation 
of the global minimum tax."
"The rules on global mini-
mum taxation have been transposed into local law in 
Germany and other countries in which business units 
exist, or their implementation has been announced."
"For 
Heidelberg Materials, this will result in initial application 
for the 2024 financial year."
"It is assumed that no sig-
nificant financial or regulatory risks will arise from the 
implementation of the global legislation."
"Pension risks
The financing status of the pension plans could be 
­
affected by adverse developments in the capital mar-
kets, demographic changes, and increases in pension 
benefits."
"In North America, Heidelberg Materials is in-
volved in various defined contribution pension plans for 
unionised employees (multi-employer pension plans)."
"If one of the participating companies no longer pays 
contributions into the pension plan, all other parties 
concerned will be held liable for the obligations that 
have not been covered."
"Regarding the year 2024, we 
consider the pension risks as a low risk with a seldom 
likelihood and low impact."
"More information on pen-
sions can be found in Note 9.12."
"Strategic risks 
Strategic risks are usually far-reaching in terms of time 
horizon and geographical dimension."
"Some strategic 
risks are general in nature, while others are industry and 
company specific."
"As outlined in the Risk management 
process section, medium- to long-term strategic risks 
are reported if the impact exceeds €300 million (gross, 
before any risk mitigation measures) and their likelihood 
exceeds 20%."
"In addition, the potential speed of occur-
rence is assessed – i.e."
"whether gradual or rapid occur-
rence is to be expected."
"Finally, the change in the esti-
mate in comparison with the previous year is assessed."
"The global economic and social environment is subject 
to constant transformation as a result of worldwide 
trends such as climate change, globalisation, demo-
graphic development, digitalisation, and new technol-
ogies."
"These trends present both risks and opportuni-
ties, and their impact on a company depends on its 
ability to adapt to changes."
"Risks arising from the changing trends may have an 
impact on demand, price levels, and costs in our sales 
markets and therefore on the company’s earnings."
"In 
the following, we describe and assess these risks and 
indicate measures taken to mitigate their impact."
"Economic risks
The global economy’s recovery from the effects of the 
coronavirus pandemic is slow and continues to be 
hampered by the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Following estim­
ated global economic growth of 3.1% in 2023, the IMF’s 
January 2024 forecast predicts growth of 3.1% for 
2024 and 3.2% for 2025, which means that growth is 
likely to remain below the 3.8% average for the years 
from 2000 to 2019."
"In the event of a recession and a decrease in construc-
tion activity, the Group faces the risk of a decline in 
demand and price pressure."
"At the same time, high en-
ergy and raw material prices continue to pose a risk to 
the Group’s profitability."
"In addition, growing competi-
tion has the potential to increase the pressure on our 
volumes, prices, and customer relationships in the indi-
vidual Group areas."
"We classify the economic risks as a general risk with a 
possible impact on the entire Group and, where appli-
cable, rapid occurrence."
"In comparison with the last 
year, we believe that the risk situation has remained 
stable."
"Heidelberg Materials can partially mitigate this 
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 153
risk thanks to its diversified country portfolio, which 
reduces dependence on individual markets."
"Political and social risks 
Potential turmoil in a (geo)political, legal, and social 
context poses fundamental risks for all companies."
"Heidelberg Materials operates on five continents and is 
therefore exposed to global and local political risks, 
such as nationalisation, trade conflicts, prohibition of 
capital transfer, terrorism, war, or unrest."
"Our risk ex-
posure may also depend on our level of shareholding 
and the control rights or participation of local partners."
"The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the war that broke 
out in the Middle East in 2023 carry the risk of the 
­
military confrontation extending beyond the original 
­
parties to the conflict and the initial conflict area."
"This 
could have a strong negative impact on demand and 
the profitability of Heidelberg Materials."
"In Russia, 
there is still an increased risk of nationalisation of pri-
vate companies."
"Furthermore, geopolitical tensions, such as those in the 
Middle East or Africa, and a deterioration in relations 
between global trading partners are among the risks 
that may lead to lower economic growth in the affected 
regions of the world."
"We classify the political and social risks as general risks 
with a possible impact on individual Group countries 
and, where applicable, rapid occurrence."
"We expect 
the risk to remain high compared with the previous 
year."
"Heidelberg Materials can partially mitigate this 
risk thanks to its diversified country portfolio, which 
reduces dependence on individual markets."
"Natural disasters/pandemics  
(exceptional external incidents)
Exceptional external incidents, such as natural disas-
ters or pandemics, could negatively impact our busi-
ness performance."
"Thanks to our diversified country 
portfolio, negative effects in individual countries can 
be offset."
"The compensation limits of our Group-wide property 
insurance programme guarantee comprehensive cov-
erage against natural disasters, including earthquakes, 
especially for our activities in high-risk regions of North 
America, Australia, and Asia."
"However, we cannot rule 
out the possibility that the cover may not be sufficient 
in the event of extreme damage."
"We classify natural disasters and pandemics as gener-
al risks with a possible impact on individual Group 
countries or the entire Group."
"Usually, they have a rap-
id occurrence."
"In our assessment, the risk outlook has 
not changed compared with last year."
"Raw material shortages 
The scarcity of natural raw materials and the increas-
ing difficulty in renewing mining concessions or obtain-
ing new ones can have an impact on costs and raw 
material availability and thus significantly affect earn-
ings."
"We classify raw material shortages as an industry-spe-
cific risk with a possible gradual impact on the entire 
Group."
"Compared with last year, we believe the risk 
outlook has not changed."
"Heidelberg Materials mitigates this risk by constantly 
monitoring global raw material reserves and, at the 
same time, securing substitute raw materials for its 
production sites wherever possible (including recycling 
of materials)."
"Substitution of products
Heidelberg Materials is closely monitoring the develop-
ment of alternative binders and, because of the risk 
that they will replace conventional cement types, is ac-
tively researching this area, especially as regards car-
bon-reduced materials."
"In view of the current state of 
knowledge, however, it appears unlikely that large-
scale replacement will take place in the next few years."
"Tighter regulation and 
changing investor preferences towards sustainable in-
vestments could also lead to a competitive advantage 
for manufacturers of alternative binders and result in a 
substitution effect."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 154
In the aggregates business, in which we extract and 
produce sand, gravel, and hard rock in our own quar-
ries, substitution could take place through increasing 
use of recycled materials."
"This effect is strengthened 
by the progressively stricter requirements when renew-
ing existing or applying for new mining concessions for 
natural raw materials."
"In addition, there is a risk that concrete will be replaced 
by other materials, such as steel, glass, or wood prod-
ucts, in the construction business."
"Although the use of 
these alternative materials is increasing to an extent in 
some countries, this is currently still limited."
"Overall, we classify substitution of products as an in-
dustry-specific risk with a possible gradual impact on 
the entire Group."
"Compared with last year, we believe 
the risk outlook has not changed."
"Digitalisation
The digital transformation is bringing about fundamen-
tal changes in the business world."
"New digital and net-
worked technologies, increasing automation, and the 
use of artificial intelligence could challenge existing 
business models and pave the way for new ones."
"The digitalisation of the construction and building ma-
terials industry is facilitating gradual changes in con-
struction methods and processes, which could also 
contribute to achieving climate neutrality during the 
lifetime of a building."
"It could enable the construction 
of more energy-efficient and longer-lasting buildings 
with lower emissions, which could ultimately also have 
an impact on concrete and cement consumption."
"Digitalisation can also increase efficiency and produc-
tivity – for example through data analysis in real time 
from networked systems, predictive maintenance, or 
better management of inventories and production 
­
processes."
"Insufficient progress in digitalisation could 
therefore result in a loss of efficiency and competitive-
ness."
"We classify digitalisation as a general risk with a pos-
sible impact on the entire Group and gradual occur-
rence."
"We anticipate an unchanged risk compared with 
the previous year."
"Heidelberg Materials proactively drives the digital 
transformation of the Group and, furthermore, invests 
in technology companies so that it can benefit from 
new digital developments at an early stage."
"Skills shortage
Increasing population ageing in industrialised coun-
tries may result in a lack of qualified workers, resulting 
in lower productivity and higher personnel costs, ulti-
mately increasing production costs."
"In the construction industry, this development could 
lead to a shift away from personnel-intensive construc-
tion on site towards industrial production of prefabri-
cated components and modular construction systems."
"In countries with mature markets, the skills shortage 
can therefore become an industry- and company-­
specific risk, which has a gradual occurrence."
"We antic-
ipate an unchanged risk compared with the previous 
year."
"Heidelberg Materials mitigates this risk with personnel 
development programmes to attract and retain em-
ployees (for example, through cross-departmental or 
transnational career paths)."
"The company is also ex-
ploring the possibilities of increased automation, in-
cluding the use of artificial intelligence."
"Other specific risks for the building materials 
sector 
Import risks
Clinker and cement are not transported overland for 
long distances on account of their heavy weight in re-
lation to the sales price."
"Internationally, they are trad-
ed by sea."
"If the difference in the price level between 
two countries, with connection to the sea trade, be-
comes too high, there is a risk of increased imports."
"This risk could arise particularly in countries and re-
gions that are subject to an emissions trading system 
with high pricing of carbon emissions."
"Since 2023, in 
the EU a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 
has therefore been gradually introduced for the cement 
sector, among others."
"However, the risk persists in re-
gions where carbon pricing is in place without such a 
compensation mechanism."
"Transition risks due to cli-
mate change are described in more detail in the Tran-
sition risks section."
"Risks from acquisitions, partnerships, 
and ­
investments
Heidelberg Materials also expands its activities through 
acquisitions, partnerships, and investments in order to 
improve its market positions and strengthen its vertical 
integration."
"Possible risks in the case of acquisitions can arise from 
the integration of employees, processes, technologies, 
and products."
"These also include cultural and language 
barriers as well as an increased level of personnel turn-
over, which leads to an outflow of knowledge."
"We coun-
teract these risks by targeted personnel development 
and an integrative corporate culture, including the cre-
ation of local management structures."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 155
Investments can affect the leverage ratio and financ-
ing structure."
"Unforeseen negative business trends 
can also lead to financial charges from impairments 
of goodwill."
"The success of acquisitions, partnerships, and invest-
ments can also be hindered by political restrictions."
"Heidelberg Materials therefore evaluates the political 
risk and stability of the region when making invest-
ments."
"In order to minimise financial burdens and risks 
and better exploit opportunities, Heidelberg Materials 
can also cooperate with suitable partners, particularly 
in politically unstable regions."
"Operational risks
Operational risks particularly include risks related to 
the cost development and availability of energy and 
raw materials."
"We also take into account regulatory 
risks associated with environmental regulations as well 
as risks relating to production, quality, and IT."
"Opera-
tional risks have decreased slightly in comparison with 
the previous year."
"Volatility of energy and raw material prices
As an energy-intensive company, Heidelberg Materials 
is exposed to risk from price trends in raw materials 
and energy markets."
"There is a risk that the costs for 
individual energy sources and raw materials will in-
crease and thus total expenses will be higher in the 
­
future than planned."
"The Russia-Ukraine war continued to have a significant 
impact on raw material prices in the 2023 financial 
year."
"Although prices on the raw materials and energy 
markets have fallen, they remain volatile at a high level 
compared with the average price level in the years ­
prior 
to 2022."
"The sanctions imposed on Russia in the finan-
cial and energy sectors, and the resulting ongoing gas 
supply shortage, continue to lead to increased costs, 
especially in Europe."
"We minimise the price risks for energy and raw mater­
ials by bundling and structuring procurement process-
es across the Group and securing mining concessions 
over the long term."
"We also make increased use of al-
ternative fuels and raw materials as well as renewable 
energies in order to minimise price risks, while reducing 
CO2 emissions."
"With the help of our various Group-wide 
programmes for increasing efficiency and continuous 
improvement, we are decreasing and optimising our 
consumption of electricity, fuels, and raw materials, 
which reduces our energy costs in a targeted way."
"In the process of setting prices for our products, we 
aim to pass on increases in the costs of energy and raw 
materials to our customers."
"As most of our products 
are standardised bulk goods for which demand is de-
termined by price rather than other differentiating fac-
tors, there is a risk that price increases cannot be 
passed on or will cause a decline in volumes, particu-
larly in markets with excess capacities."
"We consider the risk to be a high risk (previous year: 
medium to high risk) with a possible likelihood (previous 
year: high likelihood) and a significant impact."
"Availability of raw materials and additives
Heidelberg Materials requires considerable quantities 
of raw materials for cement and aggregates produc-
tion, which should be ensured mainly by own deposits."
"There is potential for certain risks in particular loca-
tions with regard to obtaining or extending mining con-
cessions."
"For example, necessary permissions may be 
refused in the short term or disputes may arise regard-
ing mining fees."
"The availability and prices of materials such as fly ash 
and blast furnace slag, which are by-products of steel 
production and used as clinker substitutes in the man-
ufacture of cement, are subject to economic fluctua-
tions and therefore entail a cost risk."
"As global demand 
for these cementitious materials increases, there is a 
risk of increasing shortages."
"Ecological factors and environmental regulations for 
access to raw material deposits are also sources of 
uncertainty."
"In some regions of the world, for example 
in West Africa south of the Sahara, raw materials for 
cement production are so scarce that cement or clink-
er needs to be imported by sea."
"Rising transportation 
costs and capacity constraints in the port facilities can 
lead to an increase in product costs."
"In addition, the availability of water can pose a risk."
"Based on a global water-risk study, we have drawn up 
a Group-wide guideline concerning sustainable water 
management in the cement, aggregates, and ready-
mixed concrete business lines."
"Back in 2015, we began 
developing individual water management plans for 
those plants in regions suffering from water scarcity."
"The plans include concepts and measures to ensure 
careful use of scarce water resources and enable local 
stakeholders to become involved so that the water util­
isation concepts support the common good and thus 
minimise local water risks."
"We aim to have water man-
agement plans in place by 2030 for all plants in regions 
affected by water scarcity, limited accessibility, poor 
water quality and climate-related physical water risks."
"This reporting standard is used to define 
harmonised Group-wide criteria for mineral reserves 
and resources, ensuring that the availability of raw ma-
terial reserves can be monitored in a standardised 
manner and increasing transparency for management."
"With a Group policy on reserve and resource manage-
ment derived from the standard, combined with con-
sistent local processes, we aim to reduce the risk asso-
ciated with the availability of raw materials."
"We also 
seek to mitigate possible supply shortages and price 
fluctuations in the future by securing long-term supply 
agreements and developing other sources of supply."
"From an operational point of view, we classify the risk 
of lack of availability of raw materials and additives 
overall as a medium risk (previous year: low risk) with a 
seldom likelihood and a moderate impact (previous 
year: low impact)."
"Production-related risks
The cement industry is an asset-intensive industry with 
complex technology for storing and processing raw 
materials, additives, and fuels."
"Because of accident 
and operating risks, personal injury and material or en-
vironmental damage may occur and operations may 
be interrupted."
"Heidelberg Materials’ risk transfer strategy sets de-
ductibles for the main insurance programmes that have 
been tailored to the size of the Group and are based on 
many years of failure analyses."
"Nevertheless, there is 
still a risk that the insured amounts in the event of dam-
age may not be sufficient, particularly in the case of 
very uncommon and serious types of damage, such as 
natural disasters."
We consider this to be a low risk.
"In order to avoid the potential likelihood of damage 
and the resulting consequences, we rely on various sur-
veillance and security systems in our plants as well as 
integrated management systems, including high safety 
standards, and regular checks, maintenance, and ser-
vicing."
"To identify the threat of potential dangers, we 
provide all employees with appropriate training to raise 
their risk awareness."
"As demand for building materials is heavily dependent 
on weather conditions, there is also a risk that capa­
city 
utilisation may fluctuate and production downtimes 
may occur."
"We minimise this risk by establishing loca-
tions in different regions, demand-oriented production 
control, and flexible working time models."
"In addition, 
we make use of production downtimes, where possible, 
to carry out any necessary maintenance work."
"Overall, we consider the production-related risks as a 
low and unlikely risk with a moderate impact."
"Quality risks
Building materials are subject to strict standardisa-
tion."
"If supplied products do not meet the prescribed 
standards or the customer’s quality requirements, we 
risk losing volumes, facing claims for damages, and/
or damaging our customer relationships."
"Heidelberg 
Materials ensures compliance with the standards at 
the Group’s own and third-party laboratories by means 
of fine-meshed quality assurance in parallel with every 
process step as well as final inspections."
"Quality as-
surance controls are also carried out by independent 
experts as part of the extensive quality assurance 
­
programmes already in place."
"Overall, we consider the quality risks as a low and un-
likely risk with a low impact."
"Regulatory risks
Changes to the regulatory environment can affect the 
business activities of Heidelberg Materials."
"This con-
cerns mainly legal regulations for environmental pro-
tection."
"Tighter environmental regulations could lead 
to increasing costs, higher demand for investments, or 
even the closure of production sites."
"Around 40% of 
Heidelberg Materials’ worldwide clinker production is 
affected by financial CO2 regulations such as emissions 
trading systems and CO2 taxes."
"Since 2005, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) 
has been the primary political instrument, acting as a 
cap-and-trade system for monitoring and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions in European industry with 
ambitious targets for climate protection."
"Besides the 
energy sector and refineries, this also affects all ener-
gy-intensive industries, which generate around 40% of 
all European emissions."
"The cement industry, like other CO2-intensive industries 
featured on the carbon leakage list, has not been af-
fected by the requirement since 2013 to purchase all 
emission rights by auction."
"It receives a portion of the 
emission rights free of charge on the basis of ambitious 
product-specific benchmarks."
"At the beginning of the 
fourth trading period in 2021, the benchmark was sig-
nificantly reduced in comparison with the third period."
"At the same time, prices for emission allowances have 
roughly tripled since 2020 and averaged around €80 in 
2023."
"It can be assumed that the price increase will 
continue in the further course of the fourth trading 
­
period."
"With the adoption of the EU climate protection 
programme “Fit for 55” (Green Deal), a decision was 
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 157
made to tighten the CO2 emissions reduction target 
within the EU ETS from 43% to 62% compared with 
2005."
"Alongside other influencing factors such as in-
creased interest from investment funds and specula-
tion in the market and a reduction in the quantity of 
free allocations to industry, this could be reflected in 
higher demand for carbon allowances on the market."
"Heidelberg Materials is also affected by CO2 regula-
tions in North America."
"While the EU ETS assesses 
emissions from clinker production, the emissions trad-
ing systems in North America are based on cement 
production."
"In Canada, a nationwide commitment to 
financial CO2 regulations has been in place since the 
adoption of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act 
in 2018."
"Heidelberg Materials North America is affect-
ed by emissions trading schemes in Alberta, Ontario, 
and  Quebec, and by CO2 taxes in British Columbia."
"Heidelberg Materials North America has drawn up ac-
tion plans as part of the Group-wide CO2 roadmap in 
order to keep its CO2 emissions below the declining up-
per limit for free emission rights."
"This will be achieved, 
for example, by improving kiln efficiency, using biomass 
as an alternative fuel, and reducing the clinker ratio."
"The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) replaced 
participation in the EU ETS."
"Although the approach to 
free allocation is similar to that of the fourth trading 
period of the EU ETS, the price of UK allowances was 
lower than that of EU carbon allowances (2023: be-
tween €60–€70 per tonne of CO2)."
"In the United King-
dom, a compensation mechanism similar to the CBAM 
has been agreed and is scheduled to be introduced in 
2027."
"However, no decision has yet been made on a 
possible discontinuation of the free allowances."
"In Ka-
zakhstan, the national allocation plan for 2022–2025 set 
a cap of 163.7 million tonnes of CO2 for 2023."
"The actu-
al market price for CO2 is around €1.50 per tonne of CO2."
"Other Group countries have announced the introduc-
tion of far-reaching CO2 regulations for the coming 
years."
"In the Chinese province of Guangdong, annual 
emission reductions of 1% have been planned since 
2022 as part of an emissions trading scheme."
"Further 
CO2 regulations are being discussed in countries such 
as Indonesia and Thailand."
"For Heidelberg Materials locations that are subject to 
CO2 regulations and easily accessible for imports, ris-
ing production costs lead to the risk of a competitive 
disadvantage resulting from cement imports from 
countries without CO2 regulations."
"The gradual intro-
duction of a CO2-related import regulation was estab-
lished with the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM) for the period from 2026 to 2034 as part of the 
“Fit for 55” climate protection programme within the 
EU."
"One of the consequences of the regulation will 
bethe continuous reduction of the free allocation of 
emission allowances for import volumes."
"Since Octo-
ber 2023, we have been required to publish quarterly 
reports on import quantities and associated emissions."
"From 2026, CBAM allowances corresponding to the 
volume of CO2 emissions embedded in the imported 
products (cement/clinker) will also need to be pur-
chased."
"With the EU Industrial Emissions Directive 2010/75 for 
the European cement industry, the limits for dust and 
ammonia emissions and for nitrogen oxide emissions 
were significantly tightened for Germany, considerably 
exceeding EU requirements."
"Further increases in re-
quirements are likely as part of the current revision of 
the directive."
"To comply with the environmental regula-
tions, Heidelberg Materials makes high ongoing invest-
ments aimed at improving its facilities so as to reduce 
emissions."
"Measures concerning climate and emission 
protection are outlined in the Non-financial state-
ment chapter and the Research and development 
section."
"We classify the regulatory risks related to CO2 and oth-
er emissions as a high and likely risk with a significant 
impact."
"IT risks
IT systems play a central role in both supporting our 
global business processes and achieving our corporate 
targets."
"To minimise IT risks, we identified and assessed the 
risks to our core systems back in 2022 and defined ad-
ditional measures aimed at minimising risks."
"The imple-
mentation of these measures and general risk manage-
ment began in 2023."
"In 2023, we identified and 
assessed the local risks in the individual countries and 
defined additional risk management measures."
"There are essentially two main areas of risk:
1."
"
Unavailability of IT systems as a result of natural 
disasters (e.g."
"fire, earthquake, or flood), infrastruc-
tural risks (e.g."
"power failure), technical failures (e.g."
"hardware or software failures), and human error (e.g."
operating errors or configuration errors).
"
The threat posed by deliberately harmful actions by 
external and internal actors."
"These are targeted ex-
ternal cyberattacks aimed at obtaining sensitive 
data or compromising systems."
"In addition, there 
are possible threats from internal actors creating or 
exploiting security gaps."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 158
Measures to minimise availability risks
In Europe, Asia, and North America, Heidelberg 
Materials operates data centers for critical IT systems 
in premises leased from third parties."
"Should one of 
these data centers fail, we use technical infrastructure 
leased from independent third parties for recovery."
"Backup procedures as well as standardised IT infra-
structure and processes are used to minimise availabil-
ity risks."
"The procedures were reviewed again in 2023 
and adapted to the current cybersecurity situation."
"In 
addition, Heidelberg Materials uses newly developed 
processes to ensure that relevant backup systems are 
continuously and dynamically adjusted."
"Both the data centers and the services provided by 
third-parties (cloud services) are operated by a central 
operations team staffed by our own employees in 
Czechia, who ensure the availability of all systems op-
erated by Group IT."
"Our internal software development teams use iterative 
processes that focus on identifying and managing 
risks."
"In 2023, procedures were also established that 
automatically analyse the developed software for 
common security issues."
"For particularly sensitive use 
cases that interact with our enterprise resource plan-
ning (ERP) system, small pilot tests are carried out in a 
structured manner with trusted partners."
"Developers 
are only granted access to sensitive data if an addi-
tional signed data protection agreement is in place."
"This allows risks to be identified quickly and dealt with 
at an early stage of development."
"Particular attention 
is paid to building a scalable architecture that can 
auto­
matically adapt to needs depending on the level of 
utilisation."
"Measures to minimise external  
and internal ­
cyberattacks
Due to the current worsening geopolitical situation and 
the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks as a busi-
ness model, there is a significantly raised threat level, 
especially from external actors."
"To counteract this threat, IT security capacities were 
significantly expanded in 2023."
"A new Director Security 
(CISO) was appointed, reporting directly to the Chief 
Digital Officer, and the Group Security team has been 
expanded extensively."
"In 2023, this team focused on the following strategic 
measures, among others:
	
– Adjustment and expansion of the vision, mission, and 
strategy regarding cybersecurity."
"– Regular reporting on the cybersecurity status to the 
Managing Board and Supervisory Board, and defini-
tion of action areas for the coming months and 
years."
"To this end, a central cybersecurity KPI re-
porting system was set up at Managing Board level 
in 2023."
"– Establishment and expansion of a central IT Security 
Operation Center (SOC)."
"Its task is to monitor sensi-
tive IT systems around the clock using a central plat-
form for recording and managing potential security 
incidents and to respond to relevant security incidents."
"– Expansion of cybersecurity awareness campaigns 
and regular training, including running phishing simu-
lations for employees in relation to cybersecurity risks."
"– Establishment of an in-house global community to 
address cybersecurity issues in the Group countries 
and spread awareness of cybersecurity within the 
organisation."
"Group Security is also responsible for the globally ap-
plicable company-internal IT security guidelines and 
standards, including monitoring, compliance, and im-
plementation."
"In addition, the department Group In-
ternal Audit checks compliance with the standards at 
regular intervals."
"Continuous security checks based on 
a structured risk assessment also ensure that the 
Group can respond to changes in the threat level at 
short notice."
"Operational technology risks 
Safeguarding the operation of our plants is our top pri-
ority."
"When it comes to operational technology (OT), 
we are facing increasing challenges and risks due to 
the worsening global threat landscape and increasing-
ly outdated systems."
"Like IT risks, OT risks are focused 
on security breaches where unauthorised access or 
tampering can result in physical damage to production 
facilities or an imminent threat to human life."
"To counteract this situation, Group Security worked 
with the digital infrastructure teams in 2023 to develop 
a concept for a secure and technologically standard-
ised OT platform."
"This platform will improve the secure 
operation of critical operational systems in our plants 
in the future."
"Consistent global processes and stand-
ards were also created and are to be implemented 
in 2024."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 159
A project to model threats to OT was also launched in 
2023, which is expected to provide initial insights into 
the vulnerabilities and risks of the current security sit-
uation at our plants in 2024."
"The aim of this project is 
to expand and continuously improve how we protect 
the OT at our plants."
"Overall risk assessment for IT and OT
Overall, the threat level has continued to intensify."
"We 
therefore consider the risk in both the IT and OT en­
vironments to be a high risk (previous year: medium 
risk) with a moderate impact (previous year: moderate 
impact) and a likely likelihood (previous year: possible 
likelihood)."
"Legal and compliance risks
Our important legal and compliance risks include risks 
from ongoing proceedings and investigations, as well 
as risks arising from changes in the regulatory environ-
ment and the non-observance of compliance require-
ments."
"The ongoing proceedings are being monitored 
from a legal perspective."
"In addition, provisions for 
possible disadvantages arising from these proceedings 
are recognised in accordance with the legislative 
­
requirements."
"Asbestos-related claims and environmental 
damage cases in the USA
Some of our shareholdings in the USA are exposed to 
particular legal risks and disputes relating to former 
activities."
"The most significant of these are asbes-
tos-related claims, which, among other things, allege 
bodily injury and involve several American subsidiaries."
"Products containing asbestos were manufactured 
­
before these companies belonged to Heidelberg 
Materials."
"In the USA, these damage claims are being 
handled and intensively managed by a team of in-
house lawyers in collaboration with insurers and exter-
nal consultants."
"The dispute is likely to continue for a 
few more years because of the complexity of the cases 
and the peculiarities of the American legal system."
"Pro-
visions have been formed on the basis of an extrap­
olation of the claims and reliable estimates of the de-
velopment of costs over the next 15 years."
"The damage 
claims are mostly covered by liability insurances."
"Therefore, provisions in the consolidated balance sheet 
are offset by corresponding claims against insurers."
"Furthermore, there are a considerable number of en­
vironmental and product liability claims against former 
and existing shareholdings in the USA that relate back 
to business activities discontinued a long time ago."
"There is partly insufficient insurance cover for lawsuits 
and liability loss claims relating to toxic substances 
such as coal by-products, wood preservatives, or soil 
contamination."
"Our subsidiaries may also be charged 
further fines set by the court in addition to the clean-
up  costs and the compensation; there is, however, 
a  possibility to settle valid claims for compensation 
outside of court."
"Overall, we consider the risks related 
to environ­
mental damages in North America as a 
­
medium risk."
"Antitrust proceedings
In recent years and again in 2023, Heidelberg Materials 
has gained experience from a series of antitrust pro-
ceedings."
"These include the now completed investiga-
tive proceedings against Italcementi S.p.A."
"for anti-
trust violations from the period before Heidelberg 
Materials took over control, in which a considerable 
number of private claims for damages are currently 
­
being pursued."
"These experiences motivate us to con-
tinuously review and develop intensive internal precau-
tions, particularly regular training initiatives – using 
electronic training programmes, among others – in 
order to avoid antitrust violations."
"At present, we con-
sider the risks from antitrust proceedings as a low risk."
"Compensation disputes in Egypt
Claims for compensation amounting to US$17 million 
(plus default interest claims exceeding this amount 
many times over) from unfulfilled commission claims 
have been brought against our Egyptian subsidiary 
Heidelberg Materials- Helwan Cement Company S.A.E."
(Helwan) before courts in Egypt and California.
"Helwan 
is defending itself against these claims."
"The alleged 
claims for compensation are said to arise from an ex-
clusive distribution agreement regarding cement ex-
ports with The Globe Corporation, California, and its 
legal successor Tahaya Misr Investment Inc."
"The claim 
has been conclusively dismissed in California."
"In addi-
tion, Tahaya Misr Investment Inc."
"filed a claim with 
the  Egyptian courts against Heidelberg Materials- 
Suez ­
Cement Company S.A.E."
"(Suez Cement), the ma-
jority shareholder of Helwan, for the same content in 
2018."
"For the legal proceedings in Egypt, we think there 
is a good chance of the same positive outcome as in 
California."
We assign a low risk to each of these cases.
"Potential risks due to climate claims
Recent international developments show an increasing 
number of civil proceedings against CO2 emitters by 
private individuals and environmental associations, al-
though the legal basis of such claims is contested."
"We 
cannot rule out the possibility that Heidelberg Materials 
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 160
AG or Group companies will also face legal action of 
this kind."
"The risks arising from such climate-related 
claims could be high, but cannot be estimated in more 
detail at present, given the wide variety of potential 
courses of such claims."
"As such, the risk assessment 
is  unchanged compared with the previous year."
"We 
­
currently consider the risk of climate-related claims to 
be low."
"Sustainability and compliance risks
As part of its sustainable corporate governance, 
Heidelberg Materials makes a special commitment to 
protect the environment and climate, preserve resourc-
es, conserve biodiversity, and act in a socially respon-
sible way."
"Compliance with applicable law and Group 
regulations is a part of our corporate culture and there-
fore a task and an obligation for all employees."
"Viola-
tions of our self-commitments or of laws and Group 
guidelines pose direct sanction risks in addition to stra-
tegic and operational risks, and also entail a risk to our 
reputation."
"We consider compliance risks relating to 
sustainability as a medium risk."
"Compliance programme
We have implemented an integrated compliance pro-
gramme across the Group to ensure conduct that is 
compliant both with the law and with Group guidelines."
"Our compliance programme comprises, among other 
things, the communication of compliance topics via 
letters and videos, a compliance whistle-blower sys-
tem, and training measures, and it covers, for example, 
the risk areas of antitrust and competition law, 
­
anti-corruption, and human rights."
"Violations of appli-
cable laws and internal guidelines will be sanctioned."
"In addition, corresponding corrective and preventive 
measures will be taken to help prevent similar incidents 
from arising in the future."
"Moreover, we have implemented a Group-wide system 
for the evaluation and reduction of corruption risks and 
potential conflicts of interest."
"A comparable system to 
assess human rights risks has also been implemented 
within the Group."
"The human rights organisation has been 
expanded under the leadership of the Group’s human 
rights officer."
"To ensure that we comply with the relevant sanctions 
regulations in the countries in which we are active, in 
particular those of the EU and the USA, we carry out 
systematic verification procedures against internation-
al sanctions lists."
"In response to the increased risk 
posed by complex sanctions regulations following the 
start of the Russia-Ukraine war, Heidelberg Materials 
has expanded its screening of business partners."
"Sig-
nificant changes to sanctions regulations are commu-
nicated on a regular basis."
"The results of our compliance risk assessments show 
a  medium compliance risk for Heidelberg Materials."
"Based on the compliance cases recorded and con-
firmed in the reporting year, we assess the financial risk 
from compliance violations as low."
"For further informa-
tion, see the Non-financial statement chapter."
"Climate risks
According to the definition issued by the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), climate 
risks include physical risks and transition risks, which 
we present below."
"Physical risks
Physical climate risks are divided into acute and chron-
ic risks."
"The potential impact of climate change also 
depends heavily on global developments such as de-
mographic change, economic growth, and efforts to 
rapidly reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmo­
sphere."
"These 
SSP scenarios depict possible ways in which climate 
change could unfold and also include socio-economic 
aspects such as projected population growth."
"The development pathways that were previously used, 
which were primarily based on the concentration of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (Representative 
Concentration Pathways, RCP), have also been incor-
porated into these scenarios and expanded."
"The SSP 
scenarios cover both optimistic and pessimistic varia-
tions."
"While the SSP1 scenario can be considered con-
sistent with achieving the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C tar-
get, the effects of climate change are more severe in 
the other scenarios and the greenhouse gas concen-
tration also increases."
"SSP5 corresponds to a “worst-
case” scenario."
"Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 161
One industry-specific risk for Heidelberg Materials is 
the dependence of construction activities on weather 
conditions."
"Harsh winters with extremely low tempera-
tures or high precipitation throughout the year can 
have a short-term negative effect on construction ac-
tivity, with direct consequences for our revenue and 
operating performance."
"In general, there are significant geographical varia-
tions in climate risks."
"The impact of extreme weather 
scenarios, such as floods or droughts, can lead to 
damage to our production sites, interrupt the supply to 
our customers, or have adverse effects on the supply 
of upstream products to our operating units."
"In recent 
years, for example, prolonged dry periods in Western 
Europe have caused low water levels, making it difficult 
to deliver raw materials by water."
"At the same time, 
flooding in Australia, for example, have led to interrup-
tions in production and supply."
"We respond to weather 
scenarios like these in various ways, including by using 
water-saving production techniques and by optimising 
our wastewater management."
"Nevertheless, river 
flooding is currently a major concern for our business 
in this connection."
"These actual effects are also reflected in our overall 
risk analysis."
"Precipitation stress and heat stress are 
the principal chronic climate risks, while river flooding 
is the most significant acute risk."
"For the period up to 
2030, the picture remains largely unchanged, but the 
risk exposure to drought increases significantly."
"Depending on the scenarios considered, the proportion 
of locations subject to climate risks will continue to rise 
over the periods up to 2040 and 2050."
"For drought 
stress, for example, there are significant differences 
between the moderate SSP2 scenario and the SSP5 
scenario, which is based on the continued use of fossil 
fuels."
"The modelling indicates that our risk exposure 
would double."
"Similar developments would also be 
forecast for other chronic climate risks such as heat 
stress and precipitation stress."
"According to the scen­
arios, our locations in Asia and Africa in particular 
would suffer from drought and heat if greenhouse gas 
concentrations increase, while more northerly regions, 
such as North America and Europe, would be more se-
verely affected by rainfall stress."
"If we analyse the periods up to 2040 and 2050 for 
acute risks such as tropical cyclones and river flooding, 
these remain largely stable."
"While the former naturally 
occur in Africa, Asia, and Australia in particular, the risk 
of river flooding tends to affect the northern hemi-
sphere."
"The relative stability of the acute risks also 
means that the effects of climate change are already 
impacting us today."
"As the risks are already significant, we began a more 
in-depth analysis in 2022 and, based on the risk expo-
sure and strategic importance, identified around 100 
plants, which are being examined in detail."
"For this pur-
pose, further risks were included in the modelling and 
made available to the plants."
"They have verified the 
findings, compared them with their own experiences, 
and are now tasked with developing location-specific 
adaptation measures for the critical risks, including 
necessary investment plans."
"With this analysis, we 
have also begun to quantify the specific financial im-
pact on our locations."
"We aim to develop this analysis 
further, utilise it more intensively, and integrate it into 
accounting processes in the future."
"Transition risks
Transition risks are risks arising from the transition to a 
low-emission economy."
"They can arise from develop-
ments aimed at ending or reversing damage to the cli-
mate or nature."
"The TCFD categorises risks into politi-
cal and legal, technology, market, and reputational 
risks."
"We have identified the following risks as the most 
important transition risks for Heidelberg Materials."
"Policy and legal risks
In the medium to long term, we see the main risk as 
being additional climate-related regulations or chang-
es to the design (especially prices) of existing regulato-
ry systems."
"In 2023, almost 
40% of our activities were in countries with a cap-and-
trade system or comparable CO2-related taxes with 
limited financial impact due to partial offsetting (see 
also Regulatory risks section)."
"The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism 
(CBAM) is therefore intended to progressively ensure a 
level playing field between EU manufacturers and im-
porters by 2034."
"The official start of the CBAM and the 
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report

gradual reduction in the annual allocation of emission 
allowances is in 2026."
"However, importers must report 
their annual production volumes as well as their direct 
and indirect CO2 emissions since October 2023."
"In addition to emissions related to clinker production, 
the EU has expanded its emissions trading system for 
transport-related CO2 emissions."
"This obligation will be 
implemented gradually starting in 2024."
"Then, from 
2025, companies will have to pay for the emissions 
caused by transport by ship."
"This will likely lead to high-
er logistics costs for Heidelberg Materials."
"The EU regulates other emissions such as SOX, NOX, 
and particulate matter, and requires them to be within 
or below the limits achieved by the best available tech-
nology (BAT)."
"As countries outside the EU also require 
their emissions to be within the limits set by the EU, we 
need to adapt our production facilities worldwide."
"Technology risks
The main technological risk is the substitution of exist-
ing products with lower-emission ones that could be 
available in sufficient volumes in the future and are cur-
rently being tested on the market, primarily in small 
quantities."
"This relates in particular to new alternative 
binder concepts, which in turn could trigger a shift in 
customer preferences (see also Market and reputa-
tional risks section)."
"We are actively involved in the 
research and development of potential new product 
solutions."
"The Innovation Hub, which is part of the Sus-
tainability Office, works in cooperation with our cus-
tomers to develop new applications in order to com-
pete by offering alternative products."
"Another technology risk in the transition to a low-emis-
sion economy is investing in processes that may not 
succeed in the market."
"This risk exists particularly with 
new processes such as carbon capture, utilisation, and 
storage (CCUS), which may not prove to be as efficient 
as expected in the future, while investment decisions 
are already required today."
"The construction and test-
ing of carbon capture facilities are complex large-scale 
projects in which unexpected delays can occur in the 
course of technological implementation."
"Heidelberg 
Materials has now launched around a dozen industrial- 
scale CCUS projects in Europe, the USA, and Canada."
"Some of the most important future carbon capture 
technologies for the cement industry, such as direct 
separation (LEILAC) or oxyfuel technology, are de-
scribed in the Research and development section."
"Heidelberg Materials is pursuing a gradual investment 
approach based on research cooperation with other 
partners and, wherever possible, also supported by 
public funding, in order to gain experience with all ma-
jor carbon capture technologies."
"On the one hand, this 
minimises the risk of failed or uneconomic investments 
and, on the other hand, ensures that Heidelberg 
Materials gains experience with future-oriented tech-
nologies that could be successful in the market."
"The 
roll-out costs of new technologies are also considered 
risks."
"Current estimates range widely and depend on 
several factors, such as economies of scale, which in-
fluence the final, currently unknown costs of each tech-
nology."
"Large-scale CCUS projects generally span a 
value chain in which we are primarily responsible for the 
carbon capture component in a cement plant."
"In addition to the operational risks mentioned above, 
investments in new technologies such as CCUS may 
also have an impact on the achievement of targets 
within the framework of our sustainability strategy."
"If 
the commissioning of corresponding projects is de-
layed, our CO2 reduction targets may be missed."
"Among other consequences, this could jeopardise the 
company’s reputation."
"Market and reputational risks
One of the biggest market risks results from a possible 
change in consumer preferences that may occur during 
the transition to a low-emission economy."
"Such a 
change could lead to increased substitution of con-
crete by other building materials perceived as having a 
lower carbon footprint."
"Another market risk is the rising cost of raw materials, 
which could be caused at least in part by the transition 
to a low-emission economy."
"We are also seeing an in-
crease in electricity costs, while at the same time the 
demand for renewable energy is on the rise."
"As alter-
native fuels and raw materials are becoming increas-
ingly difficult to procure, owing to rising demand on the 
one hand and declining availability on the other, we 
expect a cost increase closely linked to rising CO2 
costs."
"We are also working to secure the necessary 
quantities of alternative fuels and raw materials for our 
Combined management report

future production through acquisitions, such as the 
takeover of fly ash recycler The SEFA Group in the USA."
"In addition, we are carrying out research and develop-
ment on the suitability of other alternative materials, 
such as pozzolans."
"At the same time, we are exploring 
opportunities for a long-term supply of renewable en-
ergy generated on site at our plants or from specific 
(virtual) power purchase agreements ((V)PPAs) with 
strategic partners."
"We regard changing investor preferences towards sus-
tainable investments in companies with low CO2 emis-
sions as a further market risk."
"This trend could lead to 
increased financing costs (e.g."
"when issuing corporate 
bonds) or lower market capitalisation."
"Furthermore, we 
envisage the possibility of negative feedback from cer-
tain stakeholders should we delay or fail to achieve our 
sustainability targets, which could create a reputation-
al risk for the company."
"Increasing public interest in 
sustainability issues and the associated heightened 
awareness of the company’s ESG strategy come with 
reputational risks."
"These risks can be mitigated both 
through the measures outlined above and through 
open and regular communication."
"Overall, we classify the climate risks described above 
as a general risk with a possible gradual impact on the 
Group."
"In our opinion, the risk outlook is stable com-
pared with the previous year."
"Opportunity areas 
Business opportunities are identified at Group level and 
at operational level in the individual countries and, if 
they are likely to materialise, taken into account as 
part of the strategy and planning processes."
"In the op-
portunities outlined below, we refer to possible future 
developments or events that can lead to a positive de-
viation from our forecast."
"Usually, we do not assess 
opportunities as their likelihood is difficult to estimate."
"Financial opportunities
Exchange rate and interest rate risks described under 
Financial risks are also offset by opportunities that 
can turn the identified factors of influence to our ad-
vantage."
"Fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign 
currencies against the euro thus present both risks and 
opportunities."
"In addition, we see opportunities within our Sustain­
ability-Linked Financing Framework and the associated 
sustainability-linked financing instruments."
"These bring 
our financing strategy in line with our sustainability tar-
gets, particularly in relation to climate protection and 
occupational safety, and could help us to appeal to a 
broader investor base and thus improve refinancing 
costs."
"Opportunities also arise from the achievement 
of the contractually agreed KPIs, since these too could 
have a positive impact on the refinancing costs."
"Strategic opportunities
In the medium and long term, as a result of rising pop-
ulation numbers, we particularly see opportunities for 
growth in demand for our building materials for resi-
dential, commercial, and public construction."
"An in-
crease in prosperity and the ongoing trend of urban­
isation, especially in the growth markets of emerging 
countries, will also drive demand."
"We also see particular potential in activities relating to 
sustainability and digitalisation, which will further de-
velop and transform our core business."
"Our aspiration 
to close the loop in terms of carbon emissions and ma-
terial streams will enable us to market new products 
and solutions and thus take advantage of the opportu-
nities arising from the increasing demand for sustain­
able products."
"Increasing digitalisation will improve efficiency at 
Heidelberg Materials, reduce production and adminis-
trative costs, and thus improve overall competitive-
ness."
"We can achieve significant cost reductions and effi-
ciency enhancements by consistently further develop-
ing and scaling up the HProduce solutions."
"The devel-
opment of new, digital technology solutions, including 
solutions for our customers, also opens up opportuni-
ties to further expand our role in this area and tap into 
new fields of value creation."
"With over 32,000 monthly 
users, our HConnect product suite gives us direct di­
gital access to over 5,000 cement and aggregates 
­
customers and over 14,000 construction companies 
worldwide."
"Going forward, we intend to use this chan-
nel to offer our customers bundled products and ser-
vices consisting of sustainable building materials and 
digital solutions from our partners that aim to reduce 
CO2 emissions and increase efficiency."
"Examples in-
clude Giatec’s app-supported sensor technology and 
AI-based formulation optimisation for the concrete 
sector."
"Operational opportunities
Risks from the strong increase in prices for energy, raw 
materials, and additives are also offset by opportuni-
ties."
"Overall, the development of energy prices could 
be more advantageous than planned if the supply of 
coal, shale gas, and oil exceeds demand again and we 
can fully reflect the increase in costs in our pricing."
"Heidelberg Materials is also making greater use of 
waste materials and by-products from other industries 
as valuable raw materials and fuels."
"We aim to increase 
the proportion of alternative fuels in the fuel mix to 45% 
by 2030, thereby reducing both CO2 emissions and our 
dependence on natural resources and fossil fuels."
"In 
addition, our recycling activities are contributing to the 
diversification of our portfolio and offering opportuni-
ties for organic growth and vertical integration."
"Inno-
vations relating to the circular economy are opening up 
new possibilities in terms of process optimisation and 
portfolio expansion, enabling us to reach new custom-
ers and enter new markets with circular products."
"In 2023, we introduced evoZero®, the world’s first car-
bon captured net-zero cement, which we will produce 
once our CCS project starts in Brevik, Norway."
"With 
evoZero, we will be able to deliver a net-zero product 
with the same performance characteristics as conven-
tional cement products as early as 2025."
"Since CCS 
technology does not alter the chemical composition 
and performance of the building material, evoZero ce-
ment and concrete can be used for all kinds of applica-
tions."
"On the one hand, this offers Heidelberg Materials 
the opportunity for product differentiation in a stand-
ardised mass market."
"On the other hand, we will bene-
fit from the fact that Brevik CCS will be the first indus-
trial-scale CCS project in the cement industry to go into 
operation, ahead of comparable projects by our com-
petitors."
"We anticipate mechanical completion of the 
CCS plant in Brevik at the end of 2024."
"By 2030, we aim to generate half of our revenue from 
sustainable products 1), for which we expect increased 
demand."
"More details about our sustainable products 
and solutions can be found in the Non-financial state-
ment chapter."
"The consistent and ongoing implementation of meas-
ures to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and improve 
margins in production, logistics, and distribution is an 
integral part of our Group strategy."
"The opportunity 
exists for all projects to produce higher than ­
anticipated 
results and margin improvements that exceed previous 
expectations."
"1)	 
Revenue that we allocate to our sustainable products is not aligned  
with the definitions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"Climate-related opportunities
The cement industry can make a decisive contribution 
in the transition to a low-emission and climate-resilient 
global economy."
"The urbanisation trend and growing 
world population are expected to increase the demand 
for cement and concrete."
"In the medium term, we see 
opportunities in a growing demand for durable building 
materials produced using resource-efficient processes 
for the construction of resilient infrastructure."
"To expand our activities in relation to the circular econ-
omy and reduce CO2 emissions, Heidelberg Materials 
acquired the largest harvested fly ash recycling com-
pany in the USA in 2023."
"The reuse of fly ash from 
­
energy generation in alternative products such as 
­
composite cements strengthens circularity within 
Heidelberg Materials’ value chain."
"The addition of fly 
ash as secondary cementitious material (SCM) helps to 
reduce the CO2 intensity of concrete."
"As part of our strategic alignment towards climate pro-
tection and circularity, we are doing intensive research 
into possible uses for recycled concrete."
"One focus is 
on the recarbonation of cement in recycled fractions."
"The aim of this process called “enforced recarbona-
tion” is to store the same amount of CO2 in this mater­
ial as was previously released during the cement pro-
duction process."
"The results of our R&D efforts are 
encouraging, demonstrating a CO2 uptake potential 
close to the amount of process greenhouse gases 
emitted during clinker production."
"This has the poten-
tial to make a significant contribution to the decarbon-
Combined management report
Risk and opportunity report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 165
isation of the industry, and it gives us the opportunity 
to access new markets with recarbonated products."
"In order to be able to offer climate-neutral cement and 
concrete in the medium term, we are focusing on car-
bon capture, utilisation, and storage technology."
"We 
have launched around a dozen CCUS projects (includ-
ing in Brevik in Norway, Slite in Sweden, and Edmonton 
in Canada)."
"The importance of CCUS in terms of achiev-
ing global, regional, and national climate targets has 
been confirmed by leading international organisations 
such as the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (UN IPCC), the International Energy Agency, 
and the European Commission."
"The decision on the 
global stocktake that was adopted at the UN Climate 
Change Conference (COP28) in December 2023 con-
tains a clear reference to CCUS as one of the necessary 
climate technologies whose expansion must be accel-
erated."
"Various regions and countries are therefore 
working on the necessary regulatory framework and 
financial incentives to scale up the technology for pro-
cess industries."
"For example, both the US Inflation 
­
Reduction Act and the European Innovation Fund are 
supporting innovative large-scale CCUS projects in the 
cement industry, including our CCS projects in Bulgaria 
and Germany."
"Further funding measures are also being 
driven forward, including the Carbon Contracts for Dif-
ference in Canada and the United Kingdom, the intro-
duction of which is also planned in Germany and 
France."
"At the same time, an Industrial Carbon Man-
agement Strategy is being developed at EU level to 
­
ensure the rapid introduction of the necessary trans­
national CO2 infrastructure."
"This includes measures to 
improve the planning and coordination of new CO2 
pipelines, new standardisation processes, and the re-
moval of existing legal obstacles at national level."
"Ef-
forts are also underway to raise demand for green 
products through the introduction of green lead mar-
kets and sustainability criteria in procurement law."
"By continuously expanding our CCUS activities, we ex-
pect to be able to reduce costs and increase revenue."
"Firstly, capturing and storing CO2 removes the need to 
purchase emission allowances."
"The financial effect will 
increase as we emit less CO2 and as the price of carbon 
allowances rises."
"Secondly, we expect a significant rev-
enue effect in the medium term due to higher sales pric-
es for sustainable products."
"We anticipate that these 
two effects will exceed the expected annual capital 
expenditure of expanding our CCUS projects."
"More information about our CCUS projects and climate 
protection measures can be found in the Research and 
development and Non-financial statement chapters."
"Assessment of the overall risk and oppor-
tunity situation by Group management
The assessment of the Group’s overall risk situation is 
the result of a consolidated examination of all major 
compound and individual risks."
"Compared with the pre-
vious year, the risks have decreased slightly overall."
"This is primarily due to the relative easing of tensions 
on the raw materials and energy markets."
"However, the 
current political, social, and economic situation re-
mains unstable and tense, which continues to entail 
risks for the Group."
"Overall, the Managing Board is not aware of any risks 
that might jeopardise the Group as a going concern 
either independently or in combination with other risks."
"There has been no notable change in the Group’s risk 
situation between the reporting date and the prepara-
tion of the 2023 consolidated financial statements."
"The 
company has a solid financial base, and its liquidity 
situation is comfortable."
"With its integrated product portfolio, its positions in 
growth markets, and its cost structure, Heidelberg 
Materials considers itself well positioned to overcome 
any risks that may materialise and benefit from oppor-
tunities that arise."
"According to this recommendation, Managing Board 
members’ variable remuneration shall be granted 
predominantly as share-based remuneration; fur-
thermore, granted long-term variable remuneration 
components shall be accessible to Managing Board 
members only after a period of four years."
"The pre-
vious Managing Board remuneration system of 
Heidelberg Materials AG, which was approved by the 
Annual General Meeting in 2021, provides that only 
the capital market component of the long-term vari­
able remuneration is share-based."
"The management 
component of the long-term variable remuneration is 
already paid out after three years."
"Under the 2024+ 
­
Remuneration System, variable remuneration will be 
granted predominantly as share-based remunera-
tion."
"The long-term bonus (LTI) is structured as a 
100% virtual performance share plan, under which 
the entire grant amount is granted in virtual shares 
(so-called performance share units) on a share basis."
"The previous distinction in the LTI between capital 
market component and management component no 
longer applies."
"The members of the Managing Board 
may only dispose of the LTI payout amount after four 
years."
"The duration consists of a three-year perfor-
mance period and a one-year waiting period."
"However, a deviation from recommendation G.10 
sentence 2 is declared with regard to the 2024 LTI 
tranche."
"In the 2027 financial year, 25% of the provi-
sional payout amount of the 2024 LTI tranche will 
be provisionally paid after expiry of the three-year 
performance period."
"The reason for the deviation is that this payout after 
expiry of the performance period is intended to mit-
igate a one-time shift of the payout in the 2027 finan-
cial year, as only the capital market component of 
the 2023 LTI tranche will be paid out in that financial 
year."
"The provisional payout will be set off against 
the regular payout of the 2024 LTI tranche after ex-
piry of the waiting period in the 2028 financial year."
"– The recommendation in G.13 sentence 2 is not com-
plied with."
"According to this recommendation, sever-
ance payments shall be taken into account in the cal-
culation of any waiting allowances if post-­
contractual 
non-compete clauses apply."
"This is not the case at 
Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The reason for this deviation is that a possible sever-
ance payment and a waiting allowance are intended 
to compensate for different issues in terms of content."
"Remuneration system and remuneration

risk management is an essential component of good 
corporate governance."
"The comprehensive and Group-
wide risk management system at Heidelberg Materials 
serves to ensure the early identification, systematic 
assessment, and targeted management of risks."
"Heidelberg Materials also has an internal control sys-
tem that consists of process-independent and pro-
cess-integrated control measures."
"Our risk manage-
ment system and internal control system are used to 
identify circumstances with the potential to jeopardise 
the Group."
"The internal control and risk management 
system is implemented both at the level of Heidelberg 
Materials AG and throughout the Group."
"The Managing 
Board of Heidelberg Materials AG is responsible for ful-
filling the obligation to set up the systems and for con-
tinuously monitoring their effectiveness."
"With regard to the internal 
control and risk management system’s main account-
ing-related features, there are comprehensive stat­
utory disclosure obligations, which are set out in great-
er detail at Group level by German Accounting Standard 
no."
"The relevant disclosures and further 
information about the internal control and risk manage-
ment system can be found in the Risk and opportunity 
report chapter."
"The statements made there for the ac-
counting-related components of the internal control 
and risk management system essentially also apply to 
the business and operational system com­
ponents."
"Compliance management system
Integrity, legality, and compliance are integral to every­
day business at Heidelberg Materials."
"The company 
has a compliance management system that is subject 
to constant further development."
"Practical implementation in the operating units is the 
responsibility of the compliance officers of the individ-
ual country organisations."
"Further information about the compliance manage-
ment system can be found in the Non-financial state-
ment chapter."
"Based on its review of the internal control and risk man-
agement system, including the compliance manage-
ment system, and the reporting by Group Internal 
­
Audit, the Managing Board is not aware of any circum-
stances that cast doubt on the adequacy and effec-
tiveness of these systems."
"The Managing Board has the quality, adequacy, and 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk manage-
ment system, including the compliance management 
system, regularly monitored and assessed by independ-
ent parties, in particular by Group Internal Audit."
"The 
latter performs independent objective audit proce-
dures, which, in addition to examining the design and 
effectiveness of the aforementioned systems, also ex-
plore the potential for optimisation in the operational 
processes."
"In compliance with internationally recog-
nised auditing principles and standards, Group Internal 
Audit contributes to the evaluation and optimisation of 
the internal control and risk management system and 
the compliance and governance processes."
"The activ-
ities of Group Internal Audit are thus intended to sup-
port the company in terms of both reducing risks and 
strengthening its organisational governance processes 
and structures."
"The Managing Board and the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board receive regular reports on the audit 
results."
"The Supervisory Board also has the 
functionality of the accounting-related internal control 
system and the early risk identification system certified 
by the auditor."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board has 
satisfied itself of the effectiveness of the compliance 
management system, which guarantees Group-wide 
compliance with law, legality, and internal guidelines."
"Code of Business Conduct
A Group-wide Code of Business Conduct requires all 
employees to observe the basic rules of business de-
corum – irrespective of whether these rules are pre-
scribed by law or not."
"Heidelberg Materials’ Code of 
Business Conduct is an important element of our cor-
porate governance and is published on the website un-
der Corporate Governance."
"The Code of Business 
Conduct is binding on the Managing Board and all 
­
employees worldwide."
"It forms part of Heidelberg 
Materials’ comprehensive compliance programme and 
its observance is monitored by control mechanisms in-
cluded in the programme."
"Functioning and composition of the 
­
Managing Board, Supervisory Board, 
and Super­
visory Board committees
Managing Board
The Managing Board is the company’s managing body 
and has overall responsibility for corporate governance."
"In this regard, it is obliged to act exclusively in the 
Group’s best interests within the framework of the law."
"It takes into account the interests of shareholders, its 
employees, and other stakeholders with the aim of 
­
creating sustainable added value."
"The Managing Board 
develops the Group’s strategy, coordinates it with the 
Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation."
"It 
makes sure that all provisions of law and the Group’s 
internal guidelines are adhered to and works to achieve 
compliance by Group companies."
"It ensures appropriate 
risk management and risk controlling within the Group."
"In accord-
ance with these rules, each member of the Managing 
Board runs their management department inde-
pendently and on their own responsibility, with the pro-
vision that all matters of clearly defined fundamental 
importance are to be decided upon by the full Manag-
ing Board."
"This takes place in the regular meetings of 
the Managing Board, led by the Chairman of the Man-
aging Board, on the basis of prepared meeting docu-
ments."
"The results of the meetings are recorded in min-
utes, which are issued to all members of the Managing 
Board."
There are no Managing Board committees.
"Fur-
ther details can be found in the Managing Board Rules 
of Procedure, which have been made publicly available

"Diversity concept for the Managing Board
The requirements for filling a Managing Board position 
include, among others, many years of international 
management experience at Heidelberg Materials or at 
other internationally active companies."
"With the tar-
geted use of programmes for the advancement of 
­
future executives, Heidelberg Materials is working at 
creating a pool of suitable candidates."
"Subject to the 
achievement of the below-mentioned target figure for 
the proportion of women, the Supervisory Board makes 
no distinction on the basis of gender, origin, or any oth-
er characteristics when filling Managing Board posi-
tions."
"It makes its decisions regarding appointments to 
Managing Board positions at the company on the basis 
of objective criteria such as professional qualifications 
(international leadership experience, industry know­
ledge) and the personal suitability of the relevant per-
son for the actual task."
"In this context, the Supervisory 
Board also pays particular attention to an internation-
ally balanced and complementary composition of the 
Managing Board."
"This diversity regarding the origin of 
the members reflects the international and regional 
positioning of Heidelberg Materials."
"The diversity con-
cept mentioned above is taken into account in the 
composition of the Managing Board."
"The standard 
­
retirement age for members of the Managing Board is 
65 years."
"Long-term successor planning  
for the ­
Managing Board
With the support of the Managing Board, the Super­
visory Board ensures long-term successor planning for 
the Managing Board."
"The chairs of the Managing Board 
and the Supervisory Board are in regular contact for 
this purpose."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board’s 
­
Personnel Committee regularly addresses the issue by 
discussing the contract durations and renewal options 
for serving members of the Managing Board and con-
sulting on possible successors."
"This allows candidates to be identified for the 
Managing Board at an early stage and prepared for 
their tasks in a targeted way."
"Structured discussions 
are held with these candidates, involving the Super­
visory Board’s Personnel Committee and, if necessary, 
supported by external advisors."
"A recommendation for 
resolution is then presented to the Supervisory Board."
"Cooperation between Managing Board 
and ­
Supervisory Board
The Managing Board and Supervisory Board cooperate 
closely for the benefit of the Group."
"To this end, the 
Managing Board coordinates the Group’s strategic ap-
proach with the Supervisory Board and discusses the 
current state of strategy implementation with it at reg-
ular intervals."
"For clearly defined transactions of fun-
damental importance, the Supervisory Board has stip-
ulated reservations of consent in the Managing Board 
Rules of Procedure."
"The Managing Board informs the Supervisory Board 
regularly, in a timely manner, and comprehensively of 
all issues of importance to the Group with regard to 
strategy, planning, business development, risk situa-
tion, risk management, compliance, and sustainability."
"The Managing Board explains deviations of the actual 
business development from previously formulated 
plans and targets, indicating the reasons for this."
"Doc-
uments required for decisions, in particular, the annual 
financial statements, the consolidated financial state-
ments, and the auditors’ report, are sent to the mem-
bers of the Supervisory Board in due time before the 
meeting."
"The cooperation between the Managing 
Board and the Supervisory Board is shaped by mutual 
trust and a culture of open debate while fully protecting 
confidentiality."
"The Chairman of the Super­
visory Board is informed by the Chairman of the Man-
aging Board without delay on important events that 
are essential for the assessment of the situation and 
development, as well as for the management of the 
company."
"Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board of Heidelberg Materials AG con-
sists of 12 members."
"Pursuant to the German Codeter-
mination Law (Mitbestimmungsgesetz, MitbestG), it is 
composed of an equal number of shareholder repre-
sentatives and employee representatives."
"The share-
holder representatives are elected by the Annual 
­
General Meeting by a simple majority."
"At Heidelberg 
Materials AG, these elections are held regularly as 
­
individual elections."
"The employee representatives are 
elected by the employees in accordance with the rules 
of the MitbestG."
"Further information on the members 
of the Supervisory Board and the information required 
under section 285(10) of the HGB can be found in the 
Boards chapter."
"The Managing Board involves the Supervisory Board in 
all decisions of fundamental importance to the Group 
directly and at an early stage."
"The Supervisory Board 
also appoints the members of the Managing Board."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board has de-
fined a catalogue of transactions and measures that 
require its consent, based on the size and risk profile of 
the company."
"The Supervisory Board decides on the 
granting of consent for significant company trans­
actions with members of the Managing Board or their 
related parties (related party transactions)."
"The Supervisory Board meets at least twice every half-
year; at these meetings, it usually discusses the open 
topics and passes the required resolutions, on the 
­
basis of reports drawn up by the Managing Board and 
documents received in advance in preparation for the 
meeting."
"Additional or extraordinary meetings are held 
if necessary."
"The results of the meetings are recorded 
in minutes, which are issued to all members of the Super-
visory Board."
"Separate preliminary meetings of the 
employee representatives are held regularly to prepare 
for the meetings."
"The Supervisory Board also meets 
regularly and on an ad hoc basis without the Managing 
Board."
"Information on any conflicts of interest of a 
member of the Supervisory Board and how these are 
treated is disclosed annually in the Report of the Super-
visory Board to the Annual General Meeting."
"The Chair-
man of the Supervisory Board regularly seeks informa-
tion about investors’ views on strategic issues and is 
prepared to receive and consider suggestions from 
investors on topics specific to the Supervisory Board."
"An onboarding process is in place for new members of 
the Supervisory Board, which provides them with infor-
mation relevant to their Supervisory Board activities."
"If 
required, they are given an introduction to the legal 
framework surrounding the Supervisory Board and can 
also meet with members of the Managing Board and 
line managers to discuss fundamental and current is-
sues in order to gain an overview of the topics that are 
relevant to the company."
"The purpose of this is to fa-
miliarise the new members of the Supervisory Board 
with their rights and obligations as well as the compa-
ny’s business model and the structures at Heidelberg 
Materials."
"The members of the Supervisory Board are 
themselves responsible for obtaining the training re-
quired for their tasks and are supported by the compa-
ny in this respect."
"The company also offers specific 
training sessions – sometimes with external support – 
for members of the Supervisory Board, most recently 
in November 2023."
"Supervisory Board committees
In accordance with the Articles of Association, the 
Super­
visory Board has set up a total of five commit-
tees, which are entrusted with the tasks and function-
ing described below."
"The following respective plenary 
session of the Supervisory Board is given an account of 
the results of the committee work."
"It is also responsible for making 
a decision concerning the structuring of the non-remu-
neration-related legal relationships between the com-
pany and the members of the Managing Board."
"The 
Personnel Committee comprises Mr Ludwig Merckle 
(Chairman), Ms Birgit Jochens, Mr Luka Mucic, Dr Ines 
Ploss, Dr Bernd Scheifele, Mr Heinz Schmitt, Mr Werner 
Schraeder, and Ms Margret Suckale."
"The Audit Committee is responsible for preparing the 
decision of the Supervisory Board concerning the 
adoption of the annual financial statements and the 
approval of the consolidated financial statements, in-
cluding the non-financial statement."
"It is also respon-
sible for monitoring the accounting process, the effec-
tiveness of the internal control system, the risk 
management system, the internal audit system, the 
compliance management system, the audit, and the 
quality of the audit."
"Furthermore, the Audit Committee dis­
cusses the half-year financial report and quarterly 
statements with the Managing Board before they are 
­
published."
"The Audit Committee is responsible for com-
pliance and human rights issues and monitors the ad-
equacy and effectiveness of the internal process for 
related party transactions."
"The Audit Committee comprises Mr Luka Mucic (Chair-
man), Mr Ludwig Merckle (Deputy Chairman), Ms 
­
Barbara Breuninger, Mr Peter Riedel, Dr Bernd ­
Scheifele, 
Mr Heinz Schmitt, Mr Werner Schraeder, and Ms ­
Margret 
Suckale."
"Both have specialist 
knowledge and experience in the application of ac-
counting standards and internal control and risk man-
agement systems, in auditing, and in sustainability 
­
reporting and the auditing thereof."
"The Sustainability and Innovation Commit-
tee comprises Professor Dr Marion Weissenberger-­
Eibl 
(Chairwoman), Mr Ludwig Merckle, Dr Ines Ploss, 
Mr ­
Peter Riedel, Mr Werner Schraeder, and Dr Sopna 
Sury."
"According to the Supervisory Board’s assessment, 
Ms Suckale, Dr Sury, and Professor Dr Weissenberger-­
Eibl have proven expertise in sustainability and are 
therefore sustainability experts on the Supervisory 
Board of Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The Nomination Committee is responsible for putting 
suitable candidates for the Supervisory Board forward 
to the Supervisory Board for its proposals for election 
to the Annual General Meeting."
"To this end, it regularly 
compiles and reviews requirement profiles for share-
holder representatives on the Supervisory Board and 
monitors suitable individuals."
"Before submitting a can-
didate recommendation to the Supervisory Board, the 
Nomination Committee defines the requirements for 
the specific mandate to be filled."
"In doing so, it com-
plies with the legal requirements and takes into ac-
count the recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code and the guidelines and objectives 
adopted by the Supervisory Board for its composition, 
in particular the profile of skills for the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Nomination Committee comprises Mr Lud-
wig Merckle (Chairman), Ms Margret Suckale, and Pro-
fessor Dr Marion Weissenberger-Eibl as shareholder 
representatives."
"It comprises 
Professor Dr Marion Weissenberger-Eibl (Chairwoman), 
Dr Ines Ploss, Dr Bernd Scheifele, and Mr Heinz Schmitt."
"Self-assessment of the effectiveness of the work 
of the Supervisory Board
Every two years, the Supervisory Board carries out a 
regular self-assessment of the effectiveness of the 
work of the Supervisory Board and its committees, as 
required by the German Corporate Governance Code."
"The last such self-assessment took place in autumn 
2023."
"The self-assessment was performed by means of 
a detailed questionnaire, which the members of the Su-
pervisory Board completed anonymously, and a subse-
quent discussion within the Supervisory Board."
"The self-­
assessment of the Supervisory Board and its commit-
tees revealed highly favourable opinions on all topics."
No significant need for change was identified.
"Oppor-
tunities to further optimise the work of the full Super­
visory Board and the committees in individual areas 
were identified and corresponding measures were initi-
ated."
"The next self-assessment of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees is scheduled for the 2025 
financial year."
"In doing so, the Supervisory Board aims to 
make a wide range of expertise available to the Group 
and to have the broadest possible pool of candidates 
at its disposal for the election of future Supervisory 
Board members."
"Diversity concept
On the Supervisory Board, the skills listed above should 
be represented as broadly and in as balanced a way as 
possible."
"In addition, the in-depth skills of the ­
individual 
members of the Supervisory Board in individual fields 
should complement each other."
"Furthermore, the Super­
visory Board shall ensure an appropriate diversity with 
regard to the age structure and the respective educa-
tional and professional background of its members as 
well as their personal, national, and/or international 
background."
"Attention shall be paid to the time avail­
ability of the Supervisory Board members."
"The compo-
sition of the Supervisory Board shall appropriately 
­
reflect the national and international orientation of 
Heidelberg Materials as a leading building materials 
manufacturer."
"The Supervisory Board shall be com-
posed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men."
"Independence
The Supervisory Board aims to include at least four 
shareholder representatives who are independent with-
in the meaning of recommendation C.6 of the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
"Age limit and length of membership
At the time of election, the members of the ­
Supervisory 
Board shall not be older than 70 years."
"The regular ­
limit 
of length of membership of the Supervisory Board is 
twelve years."
"Status of implementation
The Supervisory Board considers that its current com-
position corresponds to its specified targets and the 
profile of skills."
"Details on the status of implementation 
of the fulfilment of the profile of skills for the Super­
visory Board can be found in the following qualification 
matrix, which was adopted by the Supervisory Board 
on the basis of a self-assessment by the individual 
Super­
visory Board members."
"According to the Supervisory Board’s own assessment, 
the objectives of the diversity concept have been ful-
filled."
"The composition of the Supervisory Board exhib-
its appropriate diversity with regard to the age struc-
ture and the educational and professional backgrounds 
of its members and reflects the national and interna-
tional alignment of Heidelberg Materials."
"There are cur-
rently six women on the Supervisory Board, of whom 
three represent the shareholders and three represent 
the employees."
"The proportion of women on the Super-
visory Board is thus 50%."
"The minimum proportion of 
at least 30% each of women and men on the Super­
visory Board, as specified in section 96(2) of the AktG, 
has therefore been fulfilled."
"In its assessment, the Supervisory Board 
took into account the fact that Mr Luka Mucic, as a 
member of the board of Vodafone Group plc, holds a 
position of responsibility at an external company with 
which Heidelberg Materials AG has a business relation-
ship."
"However, as the business success of Heidelberg 
Materials AG is not significantly influenced by its busi-
ness relationship with Vodafone and no other depend-
ency on Vodafone Group plc exists, the Supervisory 
Board considers Mr Mucic to be independent."
"The 
Super­
visory Board also took into account the fact that 
Mr Ludwig Merckle has been a member of the Super­
visory Board for more than 12 years."
"In the opinion of 
the Supervisory Board, this length of membership 
does  not lead to a conflict of interest on the part of Mr 
Merckle, as his work in past years has shown that this 
length of membership does not give cause for any such 
concern."
"In addition, the regular limit of length of mem-
bership of the Supervisory Board and the standard 
­
retirement age have been taken into account."
"On 18 March 2020, the Supervisory Board resolved to 
set the target figure for the proportion of women on 
the Managing Board of Heidelberg Materials AG as at 
least one woman for the period from 1 July 2020 to 
30 June 2025."
"In addition, according to the AktG, the 
Managing Board must have as members at least one 
woman and at least one man (minimum participation 
requirement)."
"With Dr Nicola Kimm as a member of the 
Managing Board, the Supervisory Board’s target was 
achieved ahead of schedule, and the composition of 
the Managing Board of Heidelberg Materials AG thus 
complies with the above-mentioned legal require-
ments."
"The Supervisory Board will continue its efforts 
to identify suitable women who meet the requirements 
for filling a position on the company’s Managing Board."
"Independently of this, the Supervisory Board continues 
to strive to take diversity into account when making 
personnel decisions."
"When filling management positions within the Group, 
the Managing Board also considers diversity, and in 
doing so, strives to give due consideration to women."
"In the 2022 financial year, the Managing Board defined 
a new, ambitious target for the proportion of women in 
leadership positions."
"In Germany, the aim is for the 
proportion of women to reach 27% for each of the two 
leadership levels below the Managing Board by 2027."
"As at 31 December 2023, the proportion of women in 
leadership positions in Germany was 13% at the first 
level below the Managing Board and 24% at the second 
level below the Managing Board."
"In 2022, the Managing Board also formulated a global 
target for the proportion of women in leadership posi-
tions of 25% by 2030."
"As at 31 December 2023, the 
proportion of women across the Group in management 
positions in the first and second leadership levels below 
the Managing Board was 18%."
"Further information can 
be found in the Non-financial statement chapter."
"According to the voting rights notifications available to 
the company, Supervisory Board member Mr Ludwig 
Merckle holds 27.67% of the issued shares via Spohn 
Cement Beteiligungen GmbH, a company under his 
control."
"As regards the other members of the Super­
visory Board, the ownership of shares or share-based 
derivatives has not exceeded the threshold of 1% of the 
issued shares in any individual case or in total, accord-
ing to the available notifications."

"2.2	 Scope of consolidation
In addition to ­
Heidelberg Materials AG, the consoli-
dated financial statements include subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements, and associates."
"Subsidiaries are characterised by the fact that

Heidelberg ­
Materials can exercise control over these

a shareholding of less than 50%, this company is in­
cluded in the consolidated financial statements as a

shareholding of more than 50% as a result of contracts 
or legal regulations, this company is not included in the 
consolidated financial statements as a subsidiary."
"In joint arrangements, ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials exercises 
joint control over a company with one or more parties 
through contractual agreements."
"Joint control exists if 
decisions about the relevant activities of the company 
must be made unanimously."
"Depending on the rights 
and obligations of the parties, joint arrangements may 
be joint operations or joint ventures."
"In joint opera-
tions, however, the controlling parties have direct 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of 
the jointly controlled operation."
"Joint ventures are 
characterised by the fact that the parties that have 
joint control participate in the net assets of the com-
pany by virtue of their position as shareholders."

"2.3	 Consolidation principles
The capital consolidation of subsidiaries is performed 
using the acquisition method pursuant to IFRS 3 
(­
Business Combinations)."
"In this process, the acquirer 
measures the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed at their fair values at the acquisition date."
"The 
acquiring entity’s investment, measured at the fair 
­
value of the consideration transferred, is eliminated 
against the revalued equity of the newly consolidated 
subsidiary at acquisition date."
"The residual positive dif-
ference between the fair value of the consideration 
transferred and the fair value of acquired assets and 
liabilities is shown as goodwill."
"A residual negative dif-
ference is recognised in profit or loss after further re-
view."
"Non-controlling interests can be recognised ei-
ther at their proportionate share of the acquiree’s net 
assets or at fair value."
"This option can be applied sep-
arately for every business combination."
"Income and expenses as well as receivables and pay-
ables between consolidated companies are eliminated."
"Profits and losses from intra-Group sales of assets are 
eliminated."
"The consequences of consolidation on in-
come tax are taken into account by recognising de-
ferred taxes."
"The share of equity and the share of profit or loss for 
the financial year attributable to non-controlling inter-
ests of consolidated subsidiaries are shown separately."
"In the case of put options held by non-controlling inter-
ests, the total comprehensive income attributable to 
the non-controlling interests as well as the dividend 
payments to non-controlling interests are shown over 
the course of the year as changes in equity."
"At the re-
porting date, non-controlling interests with a put op-
tion were reclassified as financial liabilities."
"The finan-
cial liability is measured at the present value of the 
redemption amount."
"Differences between the carrying 
amount of the non-controlling interests and the pres-
ent value of the redemption amount are recognised 
directly in equity."
"In the case of non-controlling inter-
ests in German partnerships, changes in the value of 
the settlement obligation are recognised in profit or 
loss in the financial result."
"In the statement of changes 
in equity, this is reported in the line Change in non-con-
trolling interests with put options."
"In the event of business combinations achieved in 
stages, ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials achieves control of a 
company in which it held a non-controlling equity inter-
est immediately before the acquisition date."
"In this 
scenario, differences between the carrying amount and 
the fair value of previously held shares are recognised 
in profit or loss."
"Changes in the ownership interest in a 
subsidiary that do not lead to a loss of control are rec-
ognised outside profit or loss as equity transactions."
"In 
the case of transactions that lead to a loss of control, 
any residual interests are revalued at fair value in prof-
it or loss."
"In joint operations, the assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses, as well as cash flows are included pro rata in 
the consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with the rights and obligations of ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials."
"Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using 
the equity method."
"Initially, the acquired investments 
are recognised at cost."
"In subsequent years, the carry­
ing amount of the investment is increased or decreased 
according to the share of ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials in the 
comprehensive income of the investee."
"Dividend pay-
ments received from investees reduce the carrying 
amount."
"Unrealised gains on transactions between the 
Group and its associates and joint ventures are elimi-
nated to the extent of the Group’s participation in 
these companies."
"Unrealised losses are eliminated un-
less the transaction provides evidence of an impair-
ment of the asset transferred."
"When the share of loss-
es attributable to ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials in the company 
in which a participating interest is held equals or ex-
ceeds the carrying amount of the investment, no fur-
ther shares of losses are recognised."
"If the investee 
subsequently reports profits, the investor resumes rec-
ognising its share of these profits only after the share 
in profit equals the share of losses not yet recognised."
"Subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures, and asso-
ciates that do not have a material impact on the as-
sets, financial, and earnings position of the Group, 
­
either individually or collectively, are accounted for at 
cost less impairment and shown as financial invest-
ments."
"In each case, the financial data of the immate-
rial subsidiaries accounted for less than 1% of Group 
revenue, equity, and balance sheet total."
"In gen-
eral, for operating companies, the functional currency 
is the local currency of the country in which the subsid-
iary is based, since all foreign subsidiaries are financial-
ly, economically, and organisationally independent in 
the conduct of their business."
"Assets and liabilities are 
translated using the middle rates at the reporting date, 
with equity, in contrast, using the historical exchange 
rates."
"The translation differences resulting from this are 
recognised outside profit or loss in other components 
of equity through other comprehensive income until the 
subsidiary is disposed of."
"The proportionate equity of 
the foreign joint ventures and associates is translated 
in accordance with the procedure described for sub­
sidiaries."
"Income and expenses are translated using 
average annual exchange rates."
"The differences arising 
from the translation at the closing rate are also recog-
nised outside profit or loss in other components of 
­
equity through other comprehensive income."
"Foreign currency transactions in the companies’ sepa-
rate financial statements are recorded at the spot ex-
change rate at the date of the transaction."
"Exchange 
gains or losses from the measurement of monetary 
items in foreign currency at the closing rate up to the 
reporting date are recognised in profit or loss."
"Ex-
change differences arising from foreign currency bor-
rowings, to the extent that they are part of a net in­
vestment in a foreign operation, form an exception to 
recognition in profit or loss."
"They are part of a net in-
vestment in a foreign operation if settlement is neither 
planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future."
"These translation differences are recognised directly in 
equity via other comprehensive income and only re-
classified to profit or loss on disposal of the business."
"Non-monetary items in foreign currency are recorded 
at historical exchange rates."
"The following table shows the key exchange rates used 
in the translation of the separate financial statements 
denominated in foreign currencies into euro."

"IAS 29 was thus applied retroactively to the activities 
of our subsidiaries that are based in Ghana and whose 
functional currency is the cedi (GHS) with effect from 
1 January 2023."
"Accordingly, the non-monetary assets 
and liabilities, equity with the exception of retained 
earnings, and income statement items as at 31 Decem-
ber 2023 have been adjusted using the consumer price 
index published by the Ghana Statistical Service."
"The 
balance sheet items as well as expenses and income 
were then translated into the reporting currency euro 
at the closing rate."
"Pursuant to IAS 21 (The Effects 
of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates), the previous 
year’s figures did not need to be adjusted."
"The initial 
retroactive application resulted in an adjustment to the 
currency translation reserve of €53.4 million, recog-
nised directly in equity."
"The application of IAS 29 in the 
reporting year resulted in a gain from the net position 
of the monetary items and the indexation of the income 
statement totalling €0.3 million, which has been shown 
in other operating income."
"Non-monetary assets that 
have been revalued in accordance with IAS 29 continue 
to be subject to impairment testing pursuant to the rel-
evant IFRSs."
"Turkey has been classified as hyperinflationary in ac-
cordance with IAS 29 since 30 June 2022."
"In order to 
reflect the change in purchasing power, the activities 
of our joint venture Akçansa Çimento Sanayi ve Ticaret 
A.S."
"are therefore not recognised on the basis of his-
torical acquisition or production costs, but adjusted for 
the effects of inflation."
"The Turkish consumer price in-
dex is used for this purpose."
"The balance sheet items 
as well as the expenses and income are then translated 
into the reporting currency euro at the closing rate."
"As 
in the previous year, the effect on the result from ­
equity 
accounted investments (REI) is of minor importance."
"Consolidated financial statements

2.5	 Recognition and measurement principles
The consolidated financial statements are generally 
prepared using the historical cost principle."
"Exceptions 
to this are derivative financial instruments and certain 
non-derivative financial assets, which are measured at 
fair value."
"Furthermore, the carrying amounts of the 
assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet, 
which represent the hedged items in fair value hedges 
and are otherwise accounted at cost, are adjusted as 
a result of changes in the fair values assigned to the 
hedged risks."
"The fundamental recognition and meas-
urement principles are outlined below."
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
"In 
subsequent periods, intangible assets with a finite use-
ful life are measured at cost less accumulated amorti-
sation and impairment, and intangible assets with an 
indefinite useful life are measured at cost less accumu-
lated impairment."
"Intangible assets with a definite use-
ful life are amortised using the straight-line method."
"Pursuant to IFRS 3 (Business Combinations), goodwill 
is not amortised."
"Instead, goodwill is tested for impair-
ment according to IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) at 
least once a year in the fourth quarter after completion 
of the current operational plan or upon the occurrence 
of significant events or changes in circumstances that 
indicate an impairment requirement."
"In this impairment 
test, the carrying amount of a group of cash-generat-
ing units (CGUs) to which goodwill is allocated is com-
pared with the recoverable amount of this group of 
CGUs."
"On the basis of the sales and management 
structure, a group of CGUs is defined generally as a 
country or Group area; exceptions are the cross-bor-
der Nordic Precast Group and the Mibau Group."
"As 
soon as the carrying amount of a group of CGUs to 
which goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable 
amount, an impairment loss of the allocated goodwill 
is recognised in profit or loss."
"The recoverable amount 
is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the 
value in use of a group of CGUs."
"The fair value is the 
best estimate of the price at which an independent 
third party would acquire a group of CGUs."
"The value 
in use is calculated by discounting estimated future 
cash flows after taxes with a post-tax risk-adjusted 
discount rate (weighted average cost of capital  – 
WACC)."
"Property, plant and equipment are accounted for ac-
cording to IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) at 
cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment."
"Existing asset retirement obligations are also capital-
ised."
"Cost includes all costs that can be attributed to 
the manufacturing process and appropriate amounts 
of production overheads."
"Costs for repair and mainte-
nance of property, plant and equipment are generally 
expensed as incurred."
"Capitalisation takes place if the 
measures lead to an extension or significant improve-
ment of the asset."
"Property, plant and equipment are 
depreciated on a straight-line basis unless there is an-
other depreciation method more appropriate for the 
pattern of use."
"Scheduled depreciation of property, 
plant and equipment is determined on the basis of the 
following Group-wide useful lives."
"Useful lives
Years
Buildings
20 to 40
Technical equipment and machinery
10 to 30
Plant and office equipment
5 to 15
Exploitation land and mineral reserves are amortised 
using the unit of production method."
"Borrowing costs 
that can be allocated directly or indirectly to the con-
struction of large facilities with a creation period of 
more than 12 months (qualifying assets) are capitalised 
as part of the cost in accordance with IAS 23 (Borrow-
ing Costs)."
"Government grants for the acquisition or construction 
of property, plant and equipment reduce the cost of 
the respective assets."
"Investment grants are reported 
as soon as there is reasonable assurance that the con-
ditions attached to them have been met and that the 
grants will be received in full."
"Grants received are re-
ported separately in the cash flow from investing activ-
ities."
"Other expenditure-related grants or subsidies are 
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the 
corresponding expenses to be compensated are rec-
ognised."
Leases are accounted for pursuant to IFRS 16 (Leases).
"According to IFRS 16, the lessee has a fundamental 
­
obligation to recognise rights and obligations arising 
­
under leases in the balance sheet."
"Lessees account for 
the right-of-use asset in the fixed assets as well as a 
corresponding lease liability."
"Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes
Heidelberg Materials 2023 198
The lease liability is measured at the present value of 
the lease payments to be made during the term of the 
lease."
"In addition, payments connected with purchase 
options are taken into account if their exercise is rea-
sonably certain."
"The lease payments are discounted at 
the incremental borrowing rate."
"Lease liabilities are 
­
reported in the other financial liabilities."
"The costs of 
the right-of-use asset include the initially recognised 
amount of the lease liability as well as any additional 
costs connected with the lease."
"The lease liability is 
compounded in subsequent periods and reduced by 
the amount of the lease payments made."
"The right-of-
use assets are depreciated over the term of the under-
lying lease."
"If the ownership of the leased asset is 
transferred to the Group at the end of the lease term 
or the exercise of a purchase option is included in the 
cost of the right-of-use asset, the depreciation takes 
place on the basis of the expected useful life of the 
underlying leased asset."
"In the case of leases for vehicles and ships that contain 
lease and non-lease components, ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials 
separates the components so that only the lease com-
ponents are accounted for in accordance with the reg-
ulations of IFRS 16."
"No right-of-use assets or lease lia-
bilities are recognised for leases with a term of up to 
12 months and contracts for low-value assets."
"The ex-
penditure on these leases is recognised in the period 
in which it arises in the other operating expenses; the 
payments are shown under cash flow from operating 
activities in the statement of cash flows."
"The same ap-
plies to variable lease payments not linked to an index 
or (interest) rate."
"Leases for exploitation land do not 
fall within the scope of IFRS 16."
"These leases are con-
sidered pending transactions and the expenses are 
recognised in the material costs in the period in which 
they arise."
"Inventories are measured pursuant to IAS 2 (Invento-
ries) at the lower of cost and net realisable value using 
the weighted average cost method."
"Adequate provi-
sions are made for risks relating to quality and quan-
tity."
"Besides direct expenses, the costs for finished 
goods and work in progress include production-related 
indirect materials and indirect labour costs, as well as 
production-related depreciation."
"The overhead rates 
are calculated on the basis of the average operating 
performance rate."
"Borrowing costs are not recognised 
as part of the costs because the production period is 
less than 12 months."
"Spare parts for equipment are 
generally reported under inventories."
"If they were ac-
quired in connection with the acquisition of the equip-
ment, or in a separate acquisition meet the definition 
of an asset, then they are reported under property, 
plant and equipment."
"Emission rights are reported under raw materials and 
consumables."
"Emission rights granted free of charge 
by the public sector are initially measured at a nominal 
value of zero."
"Emission rights acquired for considera-
tion are accounted for at cost and measured at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value using the average 
cost method."
"Provisions for the obligation to return 
emission rights are recognised if the actual CO2 emis-
sions up to the reporting date are not covered by emis-
sion rights granted free of charge."
"The amount of the 
provision for emission rights already acquired for con-
sideration is measured at the carrying amount and, for 
emission rights yet to be acquired in order to fulfil the 
obligation, at the market value as at the reporting date."
"Treasury shares acquired are recognised at the set-
tlement date at the consideration paid, including any 
directly attributable additional costs, and are deduct-
ed from equity in a separate item until the shares are 
cancelled, re-issued, or resold."
"Both the purchase or 
sale and any subsequent cancellation of treasury shares 
are recognised directly in equity."
"Pension provisions and similar obligations are deter-
mined pursuant to IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)."
"For nu-
merous employees, the Group makes provisions for 
retirement either directly or indirectly through contri-
butions to pension funds."
"Various post-employment 
­
benefit plans are in place, depending on the legal, eco-
nomic, and tax framework in each country, which are 
generally based on employees’ years of service and 
remuneration."
"The pension provisions include those 
from current pensions and from entitlements from pen-
sions to be paid in the future."
"At ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials, the company pension schemes 
include both defined contribution and defined benefit 
plans."
"In defined contribution plans, the Group pays 
contributions into external funds."
"After paying the con-
tributions, the Group has no further benefit obligations."
"In defined benefit plans, the Group’s obligation is to 
provide the agreed benefits to current and former em-
ployees."
"A distinction is made between benefit systems 
financed by provisions and those financed by funds."
"Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes

The most significant post-employment benefit plans 
financed by funds exist in the United Kingdom, the USA, 
Belgium, Canada, Norway, Indonesia, and Australia."
"The retirement benefit system in Indonesia consists of 
a statutory defined benefit plan and a company-based 
defined contribution plan financed by funds, the bene-
fits from the latter may be set off from the statutory 
benefits."
"In Germany, Sweden, and France, the retire-
ment benefit plans are predominantly financed by 
means of provisions."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials also has 
a  number of post-retirement medical benefit plans 
­
financed by provisions to cover the health care costs 
of pensioners mainly in the USA, France, Belgium, Mo-
rocco, and Canada."
"In addition, the Group grants its 
employees other long-term employee benefits, such as 
jubilee benefits, old age part-time arrangements, or 
early retirement commitments."
"The Group areas or 
countries North America, the United Kingdom, and 
Germany account for around 90% of the defined ben-
efit obligations."
"All material defined benefit pension plans in North 
America have been closed to new entrants, the major-
ity of these have been frozen for future accruals."
"The regulatory framework for each of 
the qualified pension plans in the USA has a minimum 
funding requirement based on the statutory funding ob-
jective agreed with the plan administrator."
"In the USA, 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(ERISA) provides the national legal framework."
"­
ERISA 
sets minimum standards for participation, vesting, the 
funding 
status 
of 
the 
pension 
plan, 
and 
the 
­
accountability 
of plan fiduciaries."
"In Canada, the pension plans fall 
under the jurisdiction of the province of ­
Alberta."
"In the United Kingdom, the main defined benefit pen-
sion plans operate under UK trust law and under the 
guidelines of the UK Pensions Regulator."
"These plans 
are run by groups of trustees, some of whom are ap-
pointed by the sponsoring employer and some of whom 
are nominated by the plan members."
"Under UK law, the 
trustees are obligated to meet the statutory funding 
objective of having sufficient assets to cover the 
schemes’ technical provisions."
"Benefits are granted 
­
under a number of plans, many of which are final ­
salary 
plans."
"All of the main defined benefit pension plans in 
the United Kingdom are closed to new entrants and to 
future accruals."
"As such, the liabilities are expected to 
trend downwards in the medium to long term as bene-
fits are paid out gradually."
"Liability-driven investment 
(LDI) strategies are used extensively, and the pension 
plans are, in aggregate, overfunded as at the reporting 
date."
"As pension benefits in the United Kingdom re-
ceive inflationary increases after benefit commence-
ment, these benefits are subject to inflation risk."
"This 
risk is mitigated in many cases through the use of LDI 
products and/or caps on the maximum pension index-
ation granted."
"Given the closed nature of main ar-
rangements, the defined benefit obligation in the Unit-
ed Kingdom is only marginally impacted by the salary 
trend assumption."
"In Germany, pension plans operate under the frame-
work of the German Company Pension Law (Betriebs­
rentengesetz, BetrAVG) and general regulations based 
on German Labour Law."
"The main pension plans were 
closed to new entrants in 2005."
"Employees hired prior 
to 2006 continue to earn benefits under these arrange-
ments which are final salary and/or years of service 
related."
"In addition, individual pension entitlements 
have been granted to the members of the Managing 
Board and to executives."
"The German pension benefits 
are largely unfunded."
"The defined benefit obligation and 
the expenses required to cover these obligations are 
measured in accordance with the internationally ac-
cepted projected unit credit method."
"Consolidated financial statements

For the purpose of financial reporting, the actuarial as-
sumptions are dependent on the economic situation in 
each individual country."
"The interest rate is based on 
the interest yield achieved on the measurement date 
for high-quality corporate bonds (AA rating) in the rel-
evant currency with a duration corresponding to the 
pension plans concerned."
"In countries or currency are-
as without a deep market for high-quality corporate 
bonds, the interest rate is determined on the basis of 
government bonds or using approximation methods."
"Actuarial gains and losses may result from increases or 
decreases in the present value of the defined bene-
fit obligations."
"These may be caused by, for example, 
changes in the calculation parameters or deviations 
between the actual and expected development of the 
pension obligations."
"These amounts, as well as the dif-
ference between the actual asset performance and the 
interest income recognised in profit or loss, and the 
effect of the asset ceiling are reported in other compre-
hensive income."
"Defined contribution accounting has been applied for 
certain multi-employer pension plans for which insuffi-
cient information is available to apply defined benefit 
accounting."
"The provisions are calculated on the basis of the best 
estimate, taking into account all identifiable risks."
"The capital market components of the Group-wide 
­
virtual stock option plan are accounted for as cash-­
settled, share-based payment transactions pursuant 
to IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment)."
"As at the reporting 
date, a provision is recognised pro rata temporis in the 
amount of the fair value of the payment obligation."
"Changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or 
loss."
"The fair value of the options is determined using a 
recognised option price model."
"The current tax expense is determined according to 
the local tax regulations in which the respective Group 
company operates."
"Local tax liabilities not yet covered 
by prepayments are presented as non-current or cur-
rent tax liabilities in the financial statements, depending 
on the expected cash outflow."
"Any overpayments are 
capitalised as current or non-current tax receivables."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in 
accordance with the balance sheet liability method 
(IAS 12 Income Taxes)."
"This means that deferred taxes 
are principally recognised for all temporary differences 
between the IFRS amount and the tax amount."
"No de-
ferred taxes are recognised for temporary differences 
from goodwill, unless tax-deductible goodwill exists at 
the same time."
"Deferred tax assets are only recognised 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will 
be sufficiently available in the future."
"Furthermore, de-
ferred tax assets are recognised on unused tax losses 
carried forward, to the extent that the probability of 
their recovery in subsequent years is sufficiently high."
"The deferred taxes are meas-
ured using the rates of taxation that, as at the report-
ing date, are applicable or have been announced as 
applicable in the individual countries for the period 
when the deferred taxes are realised."
"Deferred tax as-
sets and liabilities are offset if there is an enforceable 
right to set off current tax assets and liabilities and if 
they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing 
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis."
"In principle, chang-
es in the deferred taxes in the balance sheet lead to 
deferred tax expense or income."
"If circumstances that 
lead to a change in the deferred taxes are recognised 
outside profit or loss in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity, the change in deferred taxes is also 
taken into account in other comprehensive income or 
directly in equity."
"If deferred taxes were recognised 
via other comprehensive income, they are also sub­
sequently released via other comprehensive income."
"Financial instruments are any contracts that give rise 
to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability 
or equity instrument of another entity."
"The financial in-
struments include non-derivative and derivative finan-
cial instruments."
"The non-derivative financial assets include invest-
ments in equity instruments and debt instruments."
"These assets are divided into the amortised cost, fair 
value through other comprehensive income, and fair 
value through profit or loss measurement categories 
when initially recognised, pursuant to IFRS 9 (Financial 
Instruments)."

Investments in equity instruments are in principle 
measured at fair value."
"The gains and losses resulting 
from the subsequent measurement are recognised ei-
ther in profit or loss or directly in equity through other 
comprehensive income."
"For investments in equity in-
struments that are not held for trading, an individual 
decision can be made for each participation, when ini-
tially recognised, as to whether it is measured at fair 
value through profit or loss or through other compre-
hensive income."
"Investments are generally measured 
at fair value through profit or loss and are therefore 
allocated to the financial investment category fair val-
ue through profit or loss, provided that there is no sig-
nificant influence on the investee."
"If a participation is 
irrevocably allocated to the category fair value through 
other comprehensive income, the gains and losses re-
sulting from the subsequent measurement are recog-
nised outside profit or loss in other comprehensive 
­
income."
"After the participation is derecognised, the 
gains and losses will not be subsequently reclassified 
from fair value through other comprehensive income to 
profit or loss."
"Dividends received from these participa-
tions are recognised in profit or loss."
"For debt instruments, the initial recognition of a finan-
cial asset is at fair value plus transaction costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition, provided that the finan-
cial asset is not measured at fair value through profit 
or loss."
"For financial assets recognised at fair value 
through profit or loss, attributable transaction costs 
are recognised directly as an expense in profit or loss."
"The subsequent measurement is based on the cash 
flow characteristics and the business model in use."
"Ac-
cordingly, ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials divides its debt instru-
ments into the following two measurement categories:
	
– At amortised cost (AC): Financial assets held for the 
collection of contractual cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest are measured at 
amortised cost."
"Interest income from these financial 
assets is recognised in the financial result using the 
effective interest method."
"All gains or losses resulting 
from derecognition, impairment losses, or currency 
translation are recognised directly in profit or loss."
"Impairment losses represent probability-weighted 
estimates of credit losses."
"They are calculated on the 
basis of the best available information and the time 
value of money."
"Reversals are carried out if the 
­
reasons for the impairment losses no longer apply."
"Financial assets measured at amortised cost include 
non-current receivables, interest-bearing receiva-
bles, trade receivables, and other current operating 
receivables."
"In principle, the amortised cost in the 
case of current financial assets corresponds to the 
carrying amount."
"– Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Financial 
assets for which the cash flow condition is not met 
because there are not only payments of principal and 
interest on the nominal amount outstanding are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Finan-
cial assets held for the purpose of sale are also as-
signed to this measurement category."
"This category 
mainly includes trade receivables that are intended 
for sale in the context of factoring transactions."
"Changes in the fair value and income from these as-
sets are recognised directly in profit or loss in the 
period in which they are incurred."
"Financial assets are derecognised from the balance 
sheet at the point in time that the contractual rights to 
cash flows from the asset expire or the financial asset 
is transferred."
"Transferred financial assets are fully 
derecognised if all risks and rewards are substantially 
transferred to the acquirer."
"If the risks and rewards are 
only partially transferred (risk sharing), the assets con-
tinue to be recognised to the extent of the maximum 
risk retained due to the impossibility of resale."
"Financial assets are also derecognised when there is 
no prospect of recovery, for example if enforcement 
measures have been unsuccessful, insolvency proceed-
ings have been discontinued due to lack of assets, or 
the debt has since become statute barred."
"No further 
enforcement activities will subsequently be taken."
"Non-derivative financial liabilities are initially recog-
nised at the fair value of the consideration received or 
at the value of the cash received less transaction costs 
incurred, if applicable."
"These instruments are subse-
quently measured at amortised cost, using the effec-
tive interest method if applicable."
"In principle, the am-
ortised cost in the case of current financial liabilities 
corresponds to the nominal value or the redemption 
amount."
"Non-derivative financial liabilities include 
trade payables, other operating liabilities, and financial 
liabilities."
"The Group has not yet made use of the pos-
sibility of designating non-derivative financial liabilities, 
when initially recognised, as financial instruments at 
fair value through profit or loss."
"At ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials, derivative financial instru-
ments are generally used to minimise financial risks 
and include stand-alone derivatives such as currency, 
interest rate, and commodity derivatives as well as em-
bedded electricity derivatives."
"In principle, embedded derivatives must be separated 
from the non-derivative host contract and recognised 
separately if the economic characteristics and risks of 
the embedded derivative are not closely linked to the 
economic characteristics and risks of the host con-
tract."
"Separation is not required if the entire contract 
is already measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
for example because it is a financial asset and the cash 
flow criterion has been violated."
"Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair 
value both on their initial accounting on the trade date 
and in subsequent periods."
"The valuations are derived 
from the market or determined using recognised valu-
ation methods (discounted cash flow or option price 
models)."
"In particular, currency exchange rates, inter-
est rate curves, and raw material prices are used, which 
can be observed in the corresponding markets."
"If mar-
ket prices are no longer available for long-term com-
modity futures, the prices available on the market are 
extrapolated for the valuation."
"Derivatives are recog-
nised as assets if their fair value is positive and as lia-
bilities if their fair value is negative."
"Whether changes in fair value are recognised in profit 
or loss or directly in equity depends on whether the 
derivative financial instrument is designated as being 
in an effective hedging relationship (hedge accounting) 
pursuant to IFRS 9 and the type of the underlying 
transaction."
"Derivative financial instruments held for trading are 
classified in the category fair value through profit or 
loss (FVTPL)."
"The changes in fair values are recognised 
immediately in profit or loss."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials uses cash flow 
hedges and fair value hedges."
"At the beginning of each 
hedge, the clear hedging relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument as well as the 
objectives and the risk management strategy are doc-
umented and the effectiveness of the hedge is demon-
strated."
"The effectiveness of existing hedges is contin-
uously monitored."
"When hedging future cash flows (cash flow hedges), the 
effective portion of the changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity 
through other comprehensive income."
"The ineffective 
portion of the hedging instrument is recognised imme-
diately in profit or loss."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials 
accounts for the hedging of the currency risk of off-­
balance sheet firm commitments as a cash flow hedge."
"In this case, only the spot component is designated as 
a hedging instrument."
"The change in the forward com-
ponent of the currency derivative is recognised in prof-
it or loss in the other financial result."
"In the case of fair value hedges of balance sheet items, 
both the hedging instrument and the effective portion 
of the hedged portion of the risk of the underlying 
transaction are measured at fair value."
"The change in 
fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item are recognised simultaneously in the same item 
in profit or loss."
"Written options for the 
purchase or sale of non-financial items that can be 
cash-settled are not classified as own use contracts."
"Both physical and virtual long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs) have been concluded to secure the 
supply of electricity from renewable energies."
"Depend-
ing on their structure, the physical PPAs are accounted 
for as lease contracts in accordance with IFRS 16 
with fully variable lease payments or as pending trans­
actions in accordance with IFRS 9, using the own use 
exception."
The terms are up to 20 years.
"In addition, 
virtual PPAs with a term of up to 10 years have also 
been concluded in some cases."
"The embedded elec-
tricity price differential contracts are accounted for as 
derivatives that are designated in a cash flow hedge."
"Assets held for sale and discontinued operations are 
shown separately in the balance sheet if they can be 
sold in their present condition and the sale is highly 
probable."
"Assets classified as held for sale are recog-
nised at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
­
value less costs to sell, unless another value is to be 
recognised under other standards."
"According to their 
classification, liabilities directly connected with these 
assets are shown in a separate line on the liability side 
of the balance sheet."
"For discontinued operations, the net result is shown in 
a separate line in the income statement."
"In the state-
ment of cash flows, the cash flows are broken down 
into continuing and discontinued operations."
"For dis-
continued operations, the previous year’s figures in the 
income statement, the statement of cash flows, and 
the segment reporting are adjusted accordingly in the 
year of the reclassification."
"The Notes include addition-
al details on the assets held for sale and discontinued 
operations."
"Contingent liabilities and assets are, on the one hand, 
possible obligations or assets arising from past events 
and whose existence depends on the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events 
that are not within the Group’s control."
"On the other 
hand, contingent liabilities are current obligations aris-
ing from past events for which there is unlikely to be an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits or 
where the scope of the obligation cannot be reliably 
estimated."
"Contingent liabilities are not included in the 
balance sheet unless they are current obligations that 
have been taken on as part of a business combination."
"Contingent assets are only recognised in the balance 
sheet if they are virtually certain."
"Insofar as an outflow 
or inflow of economic benefits is possible, details of 
contingent liabilities and assets are provided in the 
Notes."
"Income is recognised when control of a promised good 
or service is transferred to a customer."
"It is measured 
at the fair value of the consideration received or receiv-
able, including variable consideration; sales tax and 
other duties collected on behalf of third parties are not 
taken into account."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials primarily generates revenue from 
simply structured sales of building materials, such as 
cement, aggregates (including processed primary raw 
materials), ready-mixed concrete, and asphalt, for 
which the control is transferred to the customer at a 
specific point in time."
"In the context of the sale of the 
products, separate performance obligations may arise 
from transport services as well as from services direct-
ly related to the sale of the products."
"These services 
are generally performed at the time that the control of 
the products is transferred."
"In a few exceptional cases, 
the transport services are performed after the control 
of the products has been transferred."
"In accordance 
with IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers), 
the revenue relating to these transport services is real-
ised later than the corresponding product revenue."
"The 
revenue is measured on the basis of the consideration 
defined in the contract with a customer, including var-
iable consideration, such as discounts, volume rebates, 
or other contractual price reductions."
"The variable con-
sideration is estimated on the basis of the most likely 
amount."
"However, variable consideration is only includ-
ed if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of 
revenue will not occur once the uncertainty related to 
the variable consideration is resolved."
"Contract 
assets and contract liabilities are recognised as soon 
as one of the contracting parties has commenced per-
formance of the contract."
"If the right to consideration 
is unconditional, it is recognised as a trade receivable."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials grants its customers country- and 
industry-specific payment terms, which normally in-
clude payment within 30 to 60 days after the date of 
invoicing."
"Contract assets and contract liabilities are 
not shown separately in the balance sheet but under 
other operating receivables and assets and other op-
erating liabilities respectively."
"They are shown sepa-
rately in the Notes."
"Costs directly attributable to ob-
taining or fulfilling the contract are recognised as an 
expense when they are incurred, as the amortisation 
period is generally no longer than one year."
"Interest income is recognised pro rata temporis using 
the effective interest method."
"Dividend income is realised when the legal entitlement 
to payment arises."

Judgements, estimates, 
and ­
assumptions
Judgements must be made by management when ap-
plying the accounting and valuation methods."
"Assumptions and 
estimates are also used in the recognition and meas-
urement of deferred tax assets, the measurement of 
pension provisions and other provisions, and the meas-
urement of financial instruments."
"Effects of the on­
going Russia-Ukraine war, the war in the Middle East 
broken out in 2023 as well as the price development for 
energy and raw materials and the slight decline in in­
flation expectations were also taken into account."
"Furthermore, Heidelberg Materials is subject to climate-­
related risks."
"Climate risks include both transition risks 
and physical risks."
"Transition risks exist in connection 
with the shift to a low-emission economy."
"As part of the 
structural transition, Heidelberg Materials anticipates 
a rise in prices for the acquisition of emission allowanc-
es."
"These cost increases are taken into account in the 
operational plans."
"Physical climate risks are the direct 
consequences of extreme weather scenarios (e.g."
"floods and droughts), which may lead to a reduction in 
the useful lives of property, plant and equipment."
"The 
useful lives are reviewed regularly and, if necessary, 
­
adjusted to the changed conditions."
"In determining the scope of consolidation, discretion-
ary decisions may be required when assessing the 
­
existence of control over subsidiaries or joint control or 
significant influence."
"When accounting for business combinations, discre-
tionary judgement is required to determine whether the 
business combination concerns a business operation or 
the acquisition of an individual asset or a group of as-
sets."
"As part of the purchase price allocation, all iden-
tifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities must 
be recognised at fair value on first-time consolidation."
"In this context, judgement must be exercised as to 
whether an intangible asset is identifiable and should 
be recognised separately from goodwill."
"The fair values 
of the assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date 
are determined on the basis of estimates."
"Among other 
things, valuation methods are used that require a fore-
cast of expected future cash flows."
"Explanations con-
cerning business combinations are provided in Note 5.1."
"A cash flow-based method in accordance with IAS 36 
(Impairment of Assets) is used to determine the recov-
erable amount of groups of cash-generating units as 
part of the impairment test for goodwill and property, 
plant and equipment."
"In particular, estimates are re-
quired in relation to future cash flows of the groups of 
cash-generating units as well as to the discount rates 
and growth rates used (discounted cash flow method)."
"A change in the influencing factors may have a signifi-
cant impact on the existence or amount of impairment 
losses."
"In addition, the decision on how to define a 
group of cash-generating units to which goodwill is al-
located is subject to discretion."
"Discretionary decisions 
are also required for the assessment of the existence 
of indications of impairment or, in the case of impaired 
cash-generating units, for the assessment of the oc-
currence of significant changes compared with the pre-
vious year."
"Explanations concerning the composition of 
the carrying amount of goodwill and the impairment 
test are provided in Note 9.1 Intangible assets."
"Expla-
nations of impairments of property, plant and equip-
ment are made in Note 9.2."
"Estimates of the useful lives of intangible assets and 
depreciable fixed assets are based on empirical values 
and subject to regular review."
"If the estimate changes, 
the remaining useful life is adjusted and, if necessary, 
an impairment is recognised."
"In the accounting of leases in accordance with IFRS 16, 
judgement is required when assessing whether or not 
to exercise extension or termination options and when 
determining the incremental borrowing rate."

Furthermore, estimates and assumptions are made 
when recognising inventories that are subject to inher-
ent measurement-related uncertainties due to their 
physical nature and when measuring inventories."
"The 
lower of cost and net realisable value is used in the 
impairment test."
"The net realisable value is determined 
as the estimated sales proceeds less the estimated 
costs to completion and the estimated necessary sale 
costs and therefore has an influence on any require-
ment for impairment or reversal of impairment losses."
"Impairments or reversal of impairment losses on inven-
tories are shown in Note 9.5."
"To assess the future probability that deferred tax as-
sets can be utilised, various estimates must be adopt-
ed, for example operational plans and tax projections."
"If the actual results deviate from these estimates, this 
may impact the assets and earnings position."
"Further 
explanations on current and deferred taxes are provid-
ed in Note 7.10 Income taxes."
"Owing to the international nature of its business activ-
ities, Heidelberg Materials AG and its subsidiaries are 
subject to a large number of national tax laws and reg-
ulations."
"Changes in tax laws as well as the issuance of 
case law and the possible differing interpretation by 
local tax authorities due to the complexity of tax laws 
can have an influence on the amount of both current 
and deferred taxes."
"The potential uncertainties result-
ing from this are to be resolved by means of appropri-
ate discretionary decisions."
"Recognition and measure-
ment are based on the most probable realisation value 
of the uncertainty."
"Individual presentation or aggrega-
tion of several uncertainties depends on the individual 
case under consideration."
"Uncertainties in current 
­
taxes are taken into account with an appropriate 
­
estimate of potential tax payments."
"Uncertainties re-
garding the recoverability of deferred tax assets are 
countered by means of internal planning, also with re-
gard to the future development of results of the Group 
company concerned."
"Ongoing monitoring of the afore-
mentioned uncertainties is ensured by organisational 
measures."
"The obligations arising from defined benefit plans are 
determined on the basis of actuarial methods, which 
are based on assumptions and estimates concerning 
the discount rate, pension increase rate, life expec-
tancy, and other influencing factors."
"A change in the 
under­
lying parameters may lead to changes in the ex-
tent of the obligation."
"Further details are given on page 
199 f."
and in Note 9.12 Pension provisions.
"Provisions for damages and environmental obligations 
are measured on the basis of an extrapolation of the 
claims and estimates of the development of costs."
"A change in the influencing parameters may have an 
impact on the income statement and the amount of the 
provision."
"Discretionary assumptions are required when 
determining the necessary parameters for the meas-
urement of other environmental provisions (e.g."
"amount 
and timing of expected payouts, discount factor, rate 
of cost increase)."
"The recognition and measurement of 
the miscellaneous other provisions are based on esti-
mates of the probabilities of future outflow of resourc-
es and on the basis of empirical values and the circum-
stances known at the reporting date."
"The actual 
outflow of resources may differ from the outflow of 
resources expected at the reporting date and may 
have an impact on the recognition and measurement."
"Further explanations on provisions can be found in 
Note 9.13 Other provisions."
"Financial assets are classified on the basis of the con-
tractual cash flows and the business model used."
"While 
the contractual cash flows are determined by the char-

decisions may be required when assessing under which 
business model a financial asset should be classified."
"For certain contracts, a decision must be made as to 
whether they should be treated as derivatives or ac-
counted for as own use contracts."
"Furthermore, dis­
cretionary judgement may be required to determine 
whether the material opportunities and risks of selling 
receivables under factoring agreements have been 
transferred."
"The measurement of specific financial instruments such 
as put options of non-controlling interests, which are 
not traded on an active market, is based on best pos-
sible estimates using probability forecasts and recog-

Notes to the segment reporting
­
Heidelberg ­
Materials’ segment reporting is based on 
the Group’s internal division into geographical regions, 
corresponding to the management organisation."
"As Group financing (including financ-
ing expenses and income) is managed centrally by the 
Group and income taxes are, in general, calculated 
across business lines, neither is allocated to segments."
"The IFRS used in these financial statements form the 
basis for the valuation principles of the segment re-
porting."
"The Inter-Group areas revenue represents the 
revenue between segments."
"In the reconciliation, intra-­
Group relationships between the segments are elimi-
nated."
"The revenue and non-current assets of the main coun-
tries are shown in the table below."
"Revenue is allocated 
to countries according to the supplying company’s 
country of origin."
"In the following table, the 
revenue is broken down into two categories: type 
of products and services (business lines) and Group 
areas."
"Foreign exchange gains from interest-­
bearing receivables and liabilities are shown in the fi-
nancial result."
"The gains from the sale of fixed assets 
include gains from the sale of quarries that were de-
pleted and no longer in operational use to the amount 
of €7.3 million (previous year: 41.5)."
"The income from 
the reversal of provisions includes the reversal of pro-
visions that cannot be assigned by cost type."
"Significant income that occurs in the course of ordinary 
business activities but is not reported in result from 
current operations is shown in the additional ordinary 
income and explained in Note 7.7."

"For the capital market component, the number of PSUs 
granted is determined in a first step: the number of 
PSUs is calculated from a set percentage of the fixed 
annual salary divided by the reference price of the 
Heidelberg Materials share as at the time of issue."
"The 
reference price in each case is the average of the daily 
closing prices (trading days) of the Heidelberg Materials 
share on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra trading 
system in the three months before the start or expira-
tion of the performance period."

"The intro-
duction of additional taxes in the reporting year and 
the associated impact on cash flow resulted in an im-
pairment loss of €23.0 million."
"The carrying amount of 
€58.6 million was impaired to a value in use of €35.7 mil-
lion."
A cost of capital of 13.7% was used.
"The impair-
ment loss is shown in the additional ordinary expenses."
"In the reporting year, the result from equity accounted 
investments (REI) amounted to €–6.4 million."
"In view of the economic situation and the hyper­
inflationary environment in Turkey, an impairment re-
view was also conducted for the joint venture Akçansa 
­
Çimento Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S."
"This resulted in a rever-
sal of impairment losses of €57.1 million."
"The reasons for 
this were the increased fair value and an improvement 
in the operating business plan."
"A reversal of impairment 
losses was recognised on the carrying amount of 
€201.6 million to a fair value of €258.7 million."
"The rever-
sal of impairment loss is shown in the additional ordi-
nary income."
"In the reporting year, the result from eq-
uity accounted investments amounted to €28.9 million."
"In addition, Heidelberg Materials recognised further 
impairments totalling €6.1 million and reversals of im-

vestments during the reporting year that are of minor 
importance, both individually and collectively, for the 
presentation."

amount of €24.1 million and from the sale of the busi-
ness activities in Greece in the amount of €18.7 million."
"An explanation of the reversal of impairment losses on 
other intangible assets and property, plant and equip-
ment is given in Note 9.2."
"The reversal of impairment

"Also included is 
other income not reported in result from current oper-
ations."
"In the 2022 financial year, the item included 
­
income from the reversal of provisions in connection 
with divested business activities."
"Additional ordinary expenses
The losses from the disposal of subsidiaries and other 
business units in the 2023 financial year are essentially 
attributable to the liquidation of several participations."
"In the previous year, this item included losses from the 
liquidation of a subsidiary."
"An explanation of the impairment of other intangible

Interest expenses
In the 2023 financial year, the interest expenses for 
lease liabilities amounted to € 35.5 million (previous 
year: 32.2)."
"The valuation result of deriv-
ative financial instruments essentially stems from the 
interest component of the foreign currency derivatives."
"The miscellaneous other financial result includes ex-
penses from the continuing involvement to the amount 
of €46.6 million (previous year: 19.7)."
"This in-
crease is primarily attributable to the rise in profit be-
fore tax."
"The deferred tax expense includes expenses 
of €149.3 million (previous year: 74.2) due to the recog-
nition and reversal of temporary differences."
"Deferred 
tax assets created in previous years for carryforwards 
of unused tax losses and interest as well as tax credits 
were offset and reduced by €15.5 million (previous year: 
9.6) during the reporting year."
"The reduction in the cur-
rent and deferred tax expense for carryforwards of un-
used tax losses and interest not recognised in previous 
years as well as tax credits amounted to €127.4 million 
(previous year: 90.7) in the financial year."
"The deferred 
tax income from changes in the tax rate of €21.1 million 
(previous year: –1.1) largely results from the reduction 
in corporate income tax rates in the USA and a fall in 
the tax rate in India."
"In the reporting year, deferred tax 
assets of €9.5 million (previous year: 7.2) not covered 
by deferred tax liabilities were recognised from compa-
nies that had made a loss in the current or previous 
period."
"This mainly concerns companies in Spain and 
Thailand and corresponds to the assessment of recov-
erability based on positive business development and 
corporate planning."
"Tax refund claims and liabilities from income taxes 
­
include assessed taxes and taxes not yet assessed for 
the current year and for previous years."
"Carryforwards of unused tax losses as well as tax cred-
its for which no deferred tax assets are recognised 
amount to €2,532.9 million (previous year: 2,745.9)."
"They have essentially vested both in Germany and 
abroad."
"However, they are not determined separately 
in all countries by official notice and are therefore part-
ly subject to review by the financial authorities prior to 
utilisation."
"In addition, no deferred tax assets were rec-
ognised for carryforwards of interest amounting to 
€326.2 million (previous year: 374.3) and deductible 
temporary differences of €71.7 million (previous year: 
88.0)."
"Overall, unrecognised deferred tax assets 
amounted to €736.5 million (previous year: 771.8) in the 
reporting year."
"In the financial year, net deferred tax liabilities were 
reduced by €49.5 million in equity account (previous 
year: increase in deferred tax liabilities of €5.4 million)."
"This reduction results primarily from the measurement 
of pension provisions in accordance with IAS 19."
"In ad-
dition, current tax liabilities were reduced by €6.6 mil-
lion in equity account (previous year: increase in cur-
rent tax liabilities of €24.9 million)."
"This decrease is 
related to the measurement of financial instruments 
pursuant to IFRS 9."
"Changes to the scope of consolida-
tion led to a net increase in deferred tax liabilities of 
€21.3 million (previous year: 3.1), recognised directly in 
equity."
"The change in comparison with the previous 
year is largely due to the first-time consolidation of the 
Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes
Heidelberg Materials 2023 221
two subsidiaries PT Semen Grobogan in Indonesia and 
Tanga Cement PLC in Tanzania."
"On the basis of the 
regulations for the application of IAS 12.39, deferred 
taxes of €58.5 million (previous year: 43.1) were recog-
nised on planned future dividends."
"In accordance with the regulations of 
IAS 12.87, the amount of unrecognised deferred tax 
­
liabilities was not computed."
"To measure deferred taxes, a combined income tax 
rate of 29.7% is applied for the domestic companies."
"This consists of the statutory corporation tax rate of 
15.0% plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% levied on 
the corporation tax to be paid, as well as an average 
trade tax burden of 13.9%."
"For 2022, the combined 
­
income tax rate was also 29.7%."
"The calculation of the 
expected income tax expense at the domestic tax rate 
is carried out using the same combined income tax rate 
that is used in the calculation of deferred taxes for 
­
domestic companies."
"The profit before tax of the Group companies based 
abroad is taxed at the applicable rate in the respective 
country of residence."
"The local income tax rates in the 
individual countries vary, thus resulting in correspond-
ing tax rate differentials."
"These are shown in the line 
“Effect of different tax rates in countries in which the 
Group operates.”
A weighted average tax rate is established by taking 
the tax rate differentials of foreign Group companies 
into account."
"The increase in this rate in comparison 
with the earlier period is due to the change in the rela-
tive weighting of the companies’ results."
"For Heidelberg Materials, this will 
result in initial application for the 2024 financial year."
"An impact analysis was carried out in order to estimate 
the future effects of the new regulations on the Group."
"This analysis is based on the currently available tax re-
turns, the country-by-country report, and the financial 
statements of the business units to be included."
"Based 
on the impact analysis, we assume that we are repre-
sented in only a few jurisdictions where the transitional 
safe harbour regulations do not apply and where the 
simplified effective tax rate is simultaneously less than 
15%."
"In accordance with IAS 12.88, Heidelberg Materials 
has made use of the exception from the recognition 
and disclosure of deferred tax assets and deferred tax 
liabilities in connection with the global minimum tax 
(Pillar Two)."
"7.11	 Discontinued operations and disposal

Discontinued operations
The following table shows the composition of the result."
"Further 
details on the obligations are provided in Note 9.13 
Other provisions."
"In the 2023 financial year, expenses 
of €61.3 million were recognised in connection with a 
claim for damages."
"Disposal groups
As part of its portfolio optimisation programme, 
Heidelberg Materials signed agreements with various 
regional transport specialists in December 2023 to sell 
its French cement transport business Tratel S.a.s."
"The 
transactions were concluded on 2 January 2024, with 
final closing for one location expected in the first half 
of 2024."
"In the previous year, the disposal groups included the 
assets and liabilities of the aggregates and ready-
mixed concrete business in the Madrid region, which 
were sold on 31 July 2023."
"Further explanations are 
given in Note 5.2."
"The disposal groups also included 
non-current assets of the Western and Southern ­
Europe 
Group area that were sold during the financial year."
"Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes
Heidelberg Materials 2023 223
The following overview shows the main groups of as-
sets and liabilities of the disposal groups."
"In ac-
cordance with IAS 7 (Statement of Cash Flows), a dis-
tinction is made between cash flows from operating, 
investing, and financing activities."
"The changes in the 
relevant balance sheet items cannot be directly derived 
from the consolidated balance sheet, as they are ad-
justed for non-cash transactions, such as effects aris-
ing from currency translation and changes to the scope 
of consolidation."
"The cash flow is calculated as net income from contin-
uing operations adjusted for income taxes, net interest, 
depreciation, amortisation, impairment, and other 
eliminations."
"Cash flows from dividends received from 
non-consolidated companies, from interest received 
and paid, and from income taxes paid are also recog-
nised."
"Changes in working capital and utilisation of pro-
visions are taken into account when determining the 
cash flow from operating activities."
"Cash flows from the acquisition or sale of intangible 
assets as well as property, plant and equipment and 
financial fixed assets are recognised in the cash flow 
from investing activities."
"If these relate to the acquisi-
tion or disposal of subsidiaries or other business units 
(gain or loss of control), the effects on the statement 
of cash flows are shown in separate items."
"The cash flow from financing activities mainly results 
from changes in capital and dividend payments as well 
as proceeds from and repayments of bonds and loans 
and repayments of lease liabilities."
"In addition, cash 
flows from changes in ownership interests in subsidiar-
ies that do not result in a loss of control are classified 
as financing activities."
"The cash flows from foreign Group companies shown in 
the statement are generally translated into euro using 
the average annual exchange rates."
"In contrast, cash 
and cash equivalents are translated using the exchange 
rate at year end, as in the consolidated balance sheet."
"The effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash 
equivalents are shown separately."
"The significant individual items in the statement of cash 
flows are explained below."
"8.1	
Dividends received
Of the cash inflow from dividends received, €173.9 mil-
lion (previous year: 177.8) relates to joint ventures, 
€27.8 million (previous year: 30.0) to associates, and 
€1.7 million (previous year: 1.5) to other participations."
"8.2 Interest received / interest paid
The cash inflow from interest received decreased by 
€113.7 million to €158.9 million (previous year: 272.5), 
primarily as a result of the decline in payments received 
from interest rate swaps."
"Interest paid increased by 
€110.4 million to €321.9 million (previous year: 211.6)."
"This was mainly due to the rise in payments for interest 
rate swaps and the rise in interest payments for bonds."
"8.3	 Other eliminations
The other eliminations include non-cash expenses and 
income, such as results from equity accounted invest-
ments (REI) (before impairment or reversal of impair-
ments), additions to and reversal of provisions, and 
impairment and reversal of impairments of working 
capital."
"Furthermore, the results from divestments are 
adjusted because the total amount earned from 
­
divestments is shown in the cash flow from investing 
activities."
"­
Operating liabilities include trade payables and other 
liabilities from operating activities."
"8.5 Investments (cash outflow)
The payments for investments differ from additions in 
the fixed asset movement schedule, which shows, for 
instance, non-cash transactions as additions, such as 
additions in connection with leasing transactions."
"In the 
previous year, the payments resulted mainly from busi-
ness combinations in the United Kingdom and North 
America."
"Further details of the acquisitions are provid-
ed in Note 5.1."
"Investments in financial assets, associates, and joint 
ventures amounted to €200.2 million (previous year: 
487.8) and primarily resulted from the acquisition and 
granting of loans totalling €151.5 million."
"Payments in 
the previous year related to the acquisition of 44.9% of 
the shares in Command Alkon for €325.8 million, the 
indirect acquisition of 50% of the shares in CBI Ghana 
for €32.5 million, and the acquisition and granting of 
loans totalling €94.8 million."
"8.6 Divestments (cash inflow)
The cash inflow from the disposal of subsidiaries and 
other business units amounted to €26.6 million (previ-
ous year: 144.8) and primarily relates to the sale of the 
business in the Madrid region of Spain."
"Proceeds in the 
previous year mainly related to the sale of the business 
activities in southern Spain as well as the sale of the 
aggregates business and two ready-mixed concrete 
plants in Greece."
"Detailed explanations on the divest-
ments are provided in Note 5.2."
"Proceeds from the disposal of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment amounted to €135.6 mil-
lion in the financial year (previous year: 144.9)."
"The pay-
ments received from the disposal of financial assets, 
associates, and joint ventures as well as the repayment 
of loans amounting to €207.8 million (previous year: 
39.0) primarily resulted from the disposal of the joint 
venture in Georgia and of the Chaney Group in the USA."
"8.7	
Acquisition of treasury shares
The third tranche of the share buyback programme 
was completed in the financial year with the acquisition 
of 4,117,499 shares for a total of €298.0 million (includ-
ing incidental acquisition costs)."
"In the previous year, 
6,906,281 shares were acquired for a total of €350.0 mil­
lion under the second tranche."
"8.8 Decrease / increase in ownership interests 
in subsidiaries
In the financial year, there were no cash inflows or out-
flows from the decrease or increase in ownership inter-
ests in subsidiaries that do not lead to a loss of control."
"Of the payments amounting to €78.4 million made to 
increase ownership interests in subsidiaries in the pre-
vious year, €77.2 million related to the 1.8% increase in 
our share in PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa Tbk., In-
donesia, through the acquisition of treasury shares."
"8.9 
Proceeds from bond issuance and loans
This item includes the issue of two bonds, each with a 
nominal value of €750.0 million."
"The bond issued in 
January with a coupon of 3.75% has a term ending on 
31 May 2032."
"The bond issued in November with a cou-
pon of 4.875% has a term ending on 21 November 2033."
"8.10	Repayment of bonds, loans, and lease 
liabilities
This item includes the scheduled repayments of finan-
cial liabilities."
"In the 2023 financial year, Heidelberg 
Materials AG repaid the loan from the European Invest-
ment Bank Luxembourg in the amount of €180.0 million 
as well as other bank loans in the amount of €20.4 mil-
lion."
"In addition, financial liabilities assumed as a result 
of business combinations amounting to €283.1 million 
were repaid."
"Lease liabilities of €233.4 million (previous 
year: 236.7) were also repaid."
"In the previous year, this 
item included the repayment of the debt certificate 
amounting to €360.5 million and of a bond with a nom-
inal volume of €750.0 million."
"8.11 Changes in short-term financial liabilities

negative fair values."
"This results in a negative net carry­
ing amount of €40.7 million (previous year: 37.0) as at 
31 December 2023."
"The total change in interest liabili-
ties is shown in other changes, as interest-related pay-
ment flows in the statement of cash flows are allocated 
to cash flow from operating activities."
"8.13	 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents with a remaining term of up 
to three months are included."
"The cash equivalents in 
this item are short-term, highly liquid financial invest-
ments that are readily convertible to a known amount 
of cash and subject to only insignificant changes in 
­
value."
"Of this item, €75.6 million (previous year: 54.8) 
is not available for use by Heidelberg Materials."
"This 
includes €17.1 million (previous year: 21.1) in short-term 
cash deposits at banks that were placed as security for 
various business transactions, for example outstand-
ing recultivation payments and guarantees provided."
"The figure also takes into account bank balances of 
€58.5 million (previous year: 33.7) that cannot be free-
ly transferred within the Group because of foreign ex-
change restrictions."
"In this impairment test, the carrying amount of a group 
of cash-generating units (CGUs) to which goodwill is 
allocated is compared with the recoverable amount of 
this group of CGUs."
"Cash flow estimates extend over a five-year planning 
period, after which a terminal value is applied."
"A three-
year detailed bottom-up operational plan approved by 
the Managing Board and Supervisory Board forms the 
basis for these estimates."
"This is generally comple-
mented by a top-down plan for an additional two 
years, which incorporates medium-term expectations 
of the management based on estimates of market vol-
ume, market shares, as well as cost and price develop-
ment."
"As a general rule, the top-down plan is derived 
by applying growth rates to the detailed three-year 
operational plan."
"A detailed plan is created for all CGUs 
operating in unstable markets."
"This applies especially 
to those markets in which demand for building materi-
als and building products, as well as the price level, 
have decreased substantially due to economic un­
certainties."
"It is generally assumed that demand and 
prices in these markets will recover."
"The sales volumes derived from the demand are gen-
erally based on the assumption of constant market 
shares."
"The underlying development of the price level 
varies by CGU."
"Variable costs are assumed to evolve in line with the 
projected development of sales volumes and prices."
"As 
a rule, it is expected that the contribution margin as 
a percentage of revenue will increase slightly."
"With in-
creasing sales volumes, this leads to a significant im-
provement in the operating margin in some cases."
"Under our Sustainability Commitments 2030, we will 
further reduce our emissions through conventional 
­
levers and carbon capture, utilisation, and storage 
(CCUS), circular economy, responsible land use, and 
water conservation."
"The assumptions for the estimated 
CO2 costs are based on analyst estimates."
"The poten-
tial impact of physical climate risks was assessed and 
taken into account accordingly in operational planning."
"The projections for the estimated growth rates of the 
terminal value are based on country-specific long-term 
inflation rates."
"The WACC rates for the Group were calculated using a 
two-phase approach, whereby a phase-one WACC rate 
was used to discount the payment surpluses for the 
first five years and a phase-two WACC discount rate 
was applied for the determination of the terminal value."
"The difference between the two WACC rates merely re-
sults from the downward adjustment for the perpetual 
growth rate as well as a long-term inflation differential 
adjustment in phase two."
"The credit spread as premium 
to the risk-free rate was derived from the rating of the 
homogenous peer group."
"The peer group is subjected 
to an annual review and adjusted if necessary."

"The second phase WACC, used to calculate the terminal value,  
is equal to the phase one WACC after adjustment for growth and long-term inflation differential."
"As in the previous year, the goodwill impairment test 
did not lead to any impairment."
"For the CGUs Bangladesh, France, and Nordic Precast 
Group, changes in the sustainable growth rate or in the 
operational plan as the basis for cash flow estimates 
or the weighted average cost of capital could cause the 
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount."
Management does not rule out such a development.
"With a reduction of the growth rate of around 1.6 per-
centage points for the CGU France, around 2.0 per-
centage points for the CGU Nordic Precast Group, and 
around 2.9 percentage points for the CGU Bangladesh, 
the recoverable amount corresponds to the respective 
carrying amount."
"With a decline in the planned results 
(EBIT) for each year of planning as well as in the termi-
nal value of around 14.8% for the CGU Bangladesh, 
around 15.9% for the CGU France, and around 22.5% 
for the CGU Nordic Precast Group, the recoverable 
amount and carrying amount are equal."
"For the 
CGU Morocco, we assumed the fair value less costs to 
sell on the basis of the stock market price."
"Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets mainly include concessions, 
­
acquired customer relationships, development costs, 
and software."
"Spending on research and development 
of €95.3 million (previous year: 103.2) was recorded 
as an expense as it did not fulfil the recognition criteria 
for intangible assets."
"In the 2023 financial year, government grants of 
€94.4 mil­
lion (previous year: 75.6) were deducted di-
rectly from the acquisition costs."
"The conditions at-
tached to these grants have been met in full and there 
are no other uncertainties."
"In the 2023 financial year, no property, plant and 
equipment was pledged as security (previous year: 
€5.9 million)."
"In addition, borrowing costs of €7.7 million 
(previous year: 9.9) were capitalised."
"The average cap-
italisation rate applied was 2% (previous year: 2%)."

"The sensitivities to changes in assump-
tions as shown below are determined by changing one 
assumption as indicated and keeping all other assump-
tions constant."
"In reality, multiple assumptions may 
change at the same time, and changing one parameter 
may lead to a change in another parameter."
"The majority of the Group’s plan assets are based di-
rectly on quoted market prices for the invested assets 
or, in the case where investment funds are used, indi-
rectly based on the quoted value of the underlying in-
vestments."
"Exceptions are that in the United Kingdom, 
a portion of the assets needs to be estimated as at the 
year end, as detailed asset information is not available 
or cannot be provided in time for the adoption of the 
consolidated financial statements by the Managing 
Board."
"The assets without a quoted market price (to-
talling €71.4 million) consist of insurance policies pri-
marily in the United Kingdom."
"As a rule, the plan assets 
do not include any significant own financial instru-
ments, real estate occupied by, or other assets used by 
Heidelberg Materials."

Cash flows
Heidelberg Materials paid €63.7 million (previous year: 
61.5) directly to the pension recipients and €25.7 million 
(previous year: 23.1) as employer contributions to the 
plan assets."
"In 2024, Heidelberg Materials expects to 
make pension payments of €57.0 million and employer 
contributions to the plan assets of €26.3 million."
"Over the next ten years, average annual benefits of 
€283.0 million are expected to be paid to the pension 
recipients either in the form of direct payments or in the 
form of payments from the plan assets."
"The average 
duration of the obligations is 10.6 years (previous year: 
10.4)."
"Multi-employer pension plans
Heidelberg Materials participates in multi-employer 
pension plans (MEPPs), predominantly in North Ameri-
ca, which award some unionised employees fixed ben-
efits after their retirement."
"These MEPPs are accounted 
for as defined contribution plans because it is not pos-
sible to isolate the individual company components for 
these plans."
"The contributions are determined on the 
basis of collective bargaining."
"Contributions of 
€13.2 million (previous year: 13.0) were paid in 2023."
"The funding status of these pension plans could be af-
fected by adverse developments in the capital mar-
kets, demographic changes, or increases in pension 
benefits."
"If one of the participating companies no 
longer pays contributions into the MEPP, all other par-
ties concerned will be held liable for the obligations 
that have not been covered."
"For 2024, contributions of 
€6.8 million are expected in North America."
"The with-
drawal liability of these plans as at 31 December 2023 
would amount to €63.9 million (previous year: 68.9), 
should Heidelberg Materials decide to withdraw."
"Heidelberg Materials has provisions of €12.7 million 
(previous year: 12.8) for these liabilities, which are 
shown under miscellaneous other provisions."
"9.13	 Other provisions
The following table explains the development of other 
provisions."
"The obligations 
are therefore not linked to the continuing operations of 
the Heidelberg Materials Group."
"The provisions for damages concern legal proceedings 
before US courts."
"The claims relate to health problems 
allegedly caused by the sale of products containing as-
bestos."
"The provisions to be formed are measured at 
the present value of the expected expenses using reli-
able estimates of the development of costs for the next 
15 years."
"The environmental liability claims pertain to 
remediation obligations in connection with the sale of 
chemical products and environmental pollution by for-
mer Hanson participations."
"The provisions are offset by claims for reimbursement 
against environmental and third-party liability insurers."
"As at 31 December 2023, the claims amounted to 
€53.2 million (previous year: 75.9), of which €42.5 mil-
lion (previous year: 61.7) is recorded under other 
non-current receivables and assets and €10.6 million 
(previous year: 14.2) under other current receivables 
and assets."
"Other environmental provisions
The other environmental provisions include recultiva-
tion, environmental, and asset retirement obligations."
"Recultivation obligations relate to legal and constructive 
obligations to backfill and restore raw material quarry-
ing sites."
"The provisions recognised for these obligations 
are measured in accordance with the extraction pro-
gress on the basis of the best cost estimate for fulfilling 
the obligation."
"As at the reporting date, these provisions 
amounted to €500.6 million (previous year: 500.3)."
"Provisions for environmental obligations are recog-
nised on the basis of contractual or official regulations 
and essentially include expenses connected with the 
cleaning up of contaminated areas and the remedia-
tion of extraction damages."
"The provisions are meas-
ured at the present value of the expected expenses."
"These provisions amount to a total of €84.6 million 
(previous year: 73.6)."
"The provisions for asset retirement obligations pertain 
to obligations arising in connection with the removal of 
installations (e.g."
"conveying systems at rented loca-
tions), so that a location can be restored to its contrac-
tually agreed or legally defined state after the end of 
its useful life."
"As at the reporting date, provisions for 
asset retirement obligations of €150.4 million (previous 
year: 145.2) had been recognised."
"Miscellaneous other provisions
Miscellaneous other provisions exist in particular for 
restructuring obligations, other litigation risks, com-
pensation obligations, the obligation to return emission 
rights, and obligations to personnel."
"The provisions for restructuring obligations concern ex-
penses for various optimisation programmes, such as 
the closure of plants."
"Provisions of €38.1 million (previ-
ous year: 46.2) had been recognised for this purpose 
as at the reporting date."
"Because of pending legal action against the Group, 
provisions for litigation risks, including those relating to 
pending antitrust proceedings, amounting to €107.1 mil-
lion (previous year: 113.8) were recognised in the bal-
ance sheet."
"These obligations are assessed as most 
likely, provided that other estimates do not lead to a 
fairer evaluation as a result of specific probability dis-
tributions."
"Provisions for compensation obligations relate to the 
Group’s obligations arising from occupational acci-
dents."
"As at the reporting date, provisions of €54.8 mil-
lion (previous year: 63.3) had been formed for this pur-
pose."
"As at the reporting date, provisions for emission rights 
of €1.2 million (previous year: 35.7) had been recog-
nised."
"Obligations to personnel include the provision for the 
long-term bonus plan (management and capital mar-
ket component) of €60.4 million (previous year: 27.6), 
as well as provisions for multi-employer pension plans 
amounting to €12.7 million (previous year: 12.8)."
"Additionally, there are provisions for a variety of minor 
issues."
"Impact of interest effects
Provisions are measured at their present value, which 
is determined using a pre-tax interest rate."
"For this pur-
pose, Heidelberg Materials uses the risk-free interest 
rate of government bonds from the respective coun-
tries, taking into account the relevant term."
"The risks 
specific to the liability are taken into account in the 
estimate of future cash outflows."
"Changes in the interest rate led to a decrease of 
€8.0 million in other environmental provisions and mis-
cellaneous other provisions."
"Compounding effects of 
€19.9 million led to an increase in other environmental 
provisions and miscellaneous other provisions."
"Positive 
effects from the change in interest rate of €0.1 million 
and negative compounding effects of €12.4 million for 
provisions for damages and environmental obligations 
are included in the expenses from discontinued opera-
tions."

"Current contract liabili-
ties of €134.7 million as at 31 December 2022 were ful-
ly recognised in revenue in the 2023 financial year."
"Explanations on the derivative financial instruments 
are provided in Note 10.2."
"Trade payables
Trade payables at year end include liabilities of 
€342.4 million (previous year: 398.8) settled by exter-
nal payment service providers (reverse factoring)."
"The 
use of payment service providers does not change the 
disclosure of the trade payables concerned because 
this does not result in any significant changes to the 
contractual terms of the liabilities."
"The aggregation of 
liabilities with individual payment service providers has 
not resulted in an increased liquidity risk."
"In addition, the ag-
gregate carrying amounts for each measurement cat-
egory and the fair values for each class are depicted."
"For level 2, the fair value 
is determined using a discounted cash flow model on 
the basis of input data that does not involve quoted 
prices classified in level 1, and which is directly or indi-
rectly observable."
"The fair values of level 3 are calcu-
lated using measurement models that include factors 
that cannot be observed on the active market."
"The following table shows the fair value hierarchies for 
the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value 
in the balance sheet."
"Here, the fair value always corre-
sponds to the carrying amount."
"The financial investments in level 3 include participa-
tions on which Heidelberg Materials has no significant 
influence."
"The decrease of €0.4 million in the financial 
year was mainly due to disposals of €7.3 million, which 
were offset by remeasurements at fair value through 
profit or loss amounting to €3.9 million and additions of 
€3.2 million."
"The fair value measurement is mainly car-
ried out using the multiplier method, which determines 
the proportionate enterprise value based on compa-
ny-specific variables using EBITDA or revenue multipli-
ers."
"The revaluation through profit or loss is reported in 
the result from other participations."
"Uncertainties re-
lating to the determination of the fair value of these 
investments mainly result from the change in the multi-
pliers used, as no quoted price on an active market 
exists."
"If the multipliers used were increased or de-
creased by 10.0 percentage points, the fair value of 
these investments would increase or decrease by 
€1.8 million."
"The receivables are receivables that are intended for 
sale in the scope of factoring transactions."
"The fair 
­
values were primarily determined using the prices of 
recent transactions."
"Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid money 
market funds whose fair value was determined by mul-
tiplying the shares by the price quotation as at the re-
porting date."
"Derivative financial instruments in level 2, both those 
designated as hedges and those held for trading, are 
measured using recognised actuarial models based on 
observable input parameters."
"The derivative financial 
instruments designated as hedges in level 3 are em-
bedded derivatives from long-term power purchase 
agreements (PPAs) for solar and wind power plants in 
Poland and Italy."
"The changes in value during the finan-
cial year resulted from the remeasurement at fair value 
in the amount of €–41.0 million and from the further 
development of the measurement model in the amount 
of €11.0 million."
"The fair values are determined by dis-
counting the expected future cash flows, which are 
largely determined by future electricity market prices."
"Any changes to the market situation could have a pos-
itive or negative impact on this figure."
"If the electricity 
prices used were increased or decreased by 10.0 per-
centage points, the fair values would increase or de-
crease by €7.1 million (previous year: 15.0)."

The following table shows the fair value hierarchies for 
the assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair 
value in the balance sheet, but whose fair value is re-
ported."
"The fair values of the listed bonds correspond to the 
nominal values multiplied by the price quotations as at 
the reporting date."
"For the financial instruments with 
short-term maturities, the carrying amounts on the re-
porting date represent appropriate estimates of the 
fair values."
"Non-controlling interests with put options in level 3 are 
liabilities that relate to put options resulting from ten-
der rights of non-controlling interests."
"The calculation 
of the fair value is based on the respective contractual 
agreements for paying off the non-controlling interests 
in the event of a tender."
"These usually provide an ap-
proximation of the proportionate enterprise value 
based on company-specific variables and multipliers."
"If the tender is only possible at a later point in time, the 
payoff amount is discounted using an appropriate mar-
ket interest rate."
"For the German partnerships, the fair 
value is calculated using a discounted cash flow model."
"In this respect, the cash flows based on the companies’ 
underlying plans were discounted with a risk-adjusted 
discount rate (WACC)."
"The assessment as to whether financial assets and lia-
bilities that are accounted for at fair value are to be 
transferred between the levels of the fair value hierarchy 
takes place at the end of each reporting period."
"No re-
classifications were carried out in the reporting period."
"The following table shows the net gains or losses from 
the financial instruments by measurement category."
"The net result of derivative financial instruments held

10.2 Derivative financial instruments  
and hedging relationships
The following table shows the nominal values and fair 
values of the derivative financial instruments."
"The commodity derivatives with negative market values relate to a delivery volume of 1.7 (previous year: 0.7) million MWh of electricity 
and 0.018 (previous year: 0.015) million tonnes of fuels."
"3)	
Fair values specified with €0.0 million amount to less than €50,000."
"At Heidelberg Materials, derivative financial instruments 
are generally used for economic hedging purposes 
arising from operational business or refinancing activ-
ities."
"In order to correct the accounting mismatch be-
tween the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
hedges are designated in individual cases (hedge ac-
counting)."
"Cash flow hedges
Our Group trading companies hedge significant pur-
chase and sale contracts in foreign currencies through 
currency forwards and cash holdings in foreign curren-
cies."
The term of the contracts is up to three years.
"The 
features of the hedging instruments match those of the 
hedged items."
"The two fixed-interest bonds issued in the 2023 finan-
cial year, each with a nominal volume of €750 million, 
were hedged by rolling forward starting payer interest 
rate swaps."
"Heidelberg Materials recognises the effec-
tive portion of the gains realised from the cancelled 
interest rate swaps directly in equity in the cash flow 
hedge reserve, which is reclassified to the income state-
ment over the term of the bonds."
"Due to timing differ-
ences in the hedged item and the hedge, an ineffective-
ness of €5.6 million was recognised as income in the 
income statement."
"The weighted average hedge rate of 
the interest rate swaps is 1.4%."
"As an energy-intensive company, Heidelberg Materials 
is exposed to energy price risks in its fuel and electric-
ity procurement activities."
"In Northern Europe, some of 
the future electricity and gas oil deliveries are hedged 
using electricity and gas oil forward contracts with 
terms of up to three years."
"In the electricity price 
­
hedges, 22% (previous year: 10%) of the short-term 
and 28% (previous year: 5%) of the long-term planned 
electricity purchases are hedged."
"The hedge ratio for 
the short-term gas oil hedges is 65% (previous year: 
46%)."
"Consolidated financial statements

In Poland and, starting this financial year, Italy, elec-
tricity prices are secured via three long-term power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) until 2032."
"In one of the 
Polish PPAs, the contractually agreed fixed price scale 
was modified in the 2023 financial year."
"This resulted in 
an ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge of €–5.1 mil-
lion, which was recognised in profit or loss in other op-
erating expenses."
"In the case of the other cash flow 
hedges, the main contract features of the hedging 
­
instruments correspond in principle to the features of 
the hedged items and do not lead to any significant 
ineffectiveness."
"The hedge ratio is 26% in Poland (pre-
vious year: 27%) and 8% in Italy."
"The hedging instruments and hedged items designated 
as hedges have the following impact on the balance 
sheet and income statement."
"The weighted average hedge rate of 
the outstanding interest rate swaps is the six-month 
EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.06%."
"The interest rate 
swaps have similar terms to the hedged items as re-
gards the benchmark interest rate, payment dates, 
terms, and notional amount."
"The changes in the value 
of the hedged items arising from the change in the 
­
EURIBOR ­
are offset to the greatest extent possible by 
the change in the value of the swaps."
"The hedge ratio 
is 100%."
"The hedging instruments and hedged items designated 
as fair value hedges have the following impact on the 
balance sheet and income statement."
"The accrued interest of €0.9 million (pre-
vious year: 3.9) included in the fair value was recog-
nised in profit or loss in the interest result."
"The effectiveness of the cash flow hedges and fair 
­
value hedges is verified prospectively on the basis of 
the main contract features at inception and at every 
reporting date."
"These market price risks might have a 
negative impact on the assets, financial, and earnings 
position of the Group."
"The Group manages these risks 
primarily as part of its ongoing business and financing 
activities and, when required, by using derivative finan-
cial instruments."
"The main aspects of the financial pol-
icy are determined by the Managing Board and im­
plemented by the Group Treasury department on the 
basis of existing guidelines."
"Credit risk
­
Heidelberg ­
Materials is exposed to credit risk through 
its operating activities and certain financial trans­
actions."
"The credit risk stands for the risk that a con-
tracting party unexpectedly does not fulfil, or only 
­
partially fulfils, the obligations agreed when signing a 
financial instruments contract."
"The Group limits its 
credit risk by essentially only concluding contracts for 
financial assets and derivative financial instruments 
with partners that meet our credit rating requirements 
(investment grade range)."
"Credit rating
The rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s 
assess the Group’s creditworthiness as Baa2/P-2 
(­
stable outlook) and BBB/A-2 (stable outlook) as at the 
end of 2023."
"Any potential downgrading of the ratings 
awarded by the rating agencies could have a negative 
impact on the Group’s cost of capital and refinancing 
options."
"Cash and cash equivalents
This item essentially comprises cash and cash equiva-
lents."
"The Group is exposed to losses arising from cred-
it risk in connection with the investment of cash and 
cash equivalents if contracting parties do not fulfil their 
obligations."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials manages the result-
ing risk position by diversification of contracting par-
ties."
"Currently, no cash or cash equivalents are overdue 
or impaired as a result of actual defaults."
"The maximum 
credit risk of cash and cash equivalents corresponds to 
the carrying amount."
"Trade receivables and contract assets
Trade receivables result mainly from the sale of cement, 
concrete, and aggregates."
"In operating activities, the 
outstanding debts are monitored on an ongoing basis."
"The maximum risk position from trade receivables cor-
responds to the carrying amount."
"The concentration of 
risk with regard to trade receivables and contract 
­
assets is classified as low because of ­
Heidelberg 
­
Materials’ global activity and the dispersion across a 
large number of customers."
"To calculate the expected credit losses for trade re-
ceivables carried at amortised cost and contract as-
sets, ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials uses the simplified approach 
of IFRS 9."
"This provides for a loss allowance at every 
reporting date in the amount of the expected credit 
losses over the term."
"Initially, receivables are tested for impairment individ-
ually."
"The decision as to when an individual loss allow-
ance is required is made at the individual company 
­
level, taking local conditions into account."
"If there are 
objective indications that a receivable is not or only 
partially realisable, an individual loss allowance is re-
corded, e."
"for customers in financial difficulties or if 
insolvency proceedings have been opened."
"Available 
external and internal information on the financial situ-
ation of customers, such as an assessment of credit-
worthiness or past experience with these customers, is 
used to assess the need for impairment."
"The impaired 
receivables are classified as “credit-impaired”."
"For receivables whose expected credit losses are not 
determined individually (“not credit-impaired”), the loss 
allowance is determined on the basis of the sector-­
specific default probability and country-specific de-
fault probabilities."
"The calculated default rate is then 
adjusted by a factor in order to reflect forward-looking 
macroeconomic information that could have an impact 
on customers’ ability to settle the receivables."
"The ex-
pected real growth of the gross domestic product of 
the countries in which the customers are domiciled is 
used for this purpose."
"In addition, the expected credit 
loss is determined by taking into account the turnover 
period of the receivables of the respective individual 
companies, i."
"the average number of days from in-
voicing to receipt of payment."
"In each country’s domestic business, trade receivables 
may be secured by various types of collateral, such as 
guarantees, letters of credit, and other types of credit 
insurance."
"These securities are considered an integral 
part of the trade receivables and are taken into ac-
count when calculating impairment."
"The securities re-
ceived as at 31 December 2023 amount to € 267.6 mil-
lion (previous year: 358.6)."
"Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes
Heidelberg Materials 2023 258
The contract assets relate to performance obligations 
already fulfilled for which no unconditional right to pay-
ment exists as at the reporting date."
"The contract as-
sets essentially have the same risk characteristics as 
the trade receivables."
"The expected default rates for 
trade receivables in each country are therefore regard-
ed as a reasonable approximation of the default rates 
for the contract assets and used to calculate the ex-
pected credit losses."
"Information about the credit risk position and the ex-
pected credit losses for the trade receivables account-
ed for at amortised cost is shown in the following table."
"The calculated loss allowance in % is derived from the 
ratio of all loss allowances posted per individual com-
pany to the gross carrying amount."
"The credit risk position from other receiva-
bles and financial assets corresponds to the carrying 
amount of these instruments."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials 
­
regards this credit risk as insignificant."
"­
Heidelberg ­
Materials already takes into account the 
default risk when a financial asset is initially recognised 
by setting up loss allowances for expected credit loss-
es."
"The general approach in accordance with IFRS 9 
is  used for the calculation of impairments."
"At every 
­
reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether 
the credit risk has increased significantly."
"If the credit 
risk has not increased significantly since initial recogni-
tion, the default probability is calculated on the basis 
of a 12-month period; otherwise, the total remaining 
term is used."
"In order to assess whether the credit risk has increased 
significantly, the risk of a default on the financial asset 
at the reporting date is compared with the default risk 
at the time of initial recognition."
"A significant increase 
in credit risk is assumed if there is information about a 
deterioration in the debtor’s financial situation or if 
agreed payments have been overdue for more than 
30 days."
"In addition to the local conditions, which vary 
from country to country, and customers’ payment 
­
behaviour, this assessment also takes into account 
credit ratings according to internal assessments of 
­
Heidelberg ­
Materials or external rating agencies."
"Consolidated financial statements
Group Notes
Heidelberg Materials 2023 259
External and internal credit assessments taking into 
account both quantitative and qualitative information 
are used to calculate the expected credit losses."
"The 
internal classifications are then reconciled with the rat-
ing classes of external rating agencies and the result-
ing default probabilities."
"The default probability, which 
is then determined by considering probability-weighted 
scenarios, is adjusted to take into account the expect-
ed real growth of the gross domestic product of the 
country in which the debtor is domiciled."
"Both the fi-
nancial situation and earnings position of the debtor 
and securities received are taken into consideration 
when calculating the risk provision to be set up."
"If there are objective indications of impairment, indi-
vidual loss allowances are made to the corresponding 
receivables in the amount that is likely to be no longer 
recoverable, taking into account any securities re-
ceived."
"Objective indications are, inter alia, payment 
arrears of more than 90 days, information about sig-
nificant financial difficulties of the debtor, non-compli-
ance with a payment plan, or a high probability of in-
solvency proceedings against the debtor."
"The securities available as at the reporting date amount 
to € 126.9 million (previous year: 128.6) and mainly com-
prise liens and guarantees."
"The following table explains the development of the 
loss allowances for the other financial receivables that 
are accounted for at amortised cost."
"The cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the 
impairment requirements of IFRS 9."
"The identified im-
pairment loss was immaterial."
"Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are generally used to 
reduce risks."
"In the course of its business activity, 
­
Heidelberg ­
Materials is exposed to interest rate, cur-
rency, and energy price risks."
"For accounting purposes, 
a significant portion of the derivatives are not account-
ed for as hedges in accordance with IFRS 9, but as in-
struments in the held-for-trading category."
"However, 
from a commercial perspective, the changes in the fair 
values of these instruments represent an economically 
effective hedge within the context of the Group strate-
gy."
"The maximum credit risk of this item corresponds 
to the fair value of the derivative financial instruments 
that have a positive fair value and are shown as finan-
cial assets at the reporting date."
"To reduce default 
risks, care is taken to ensure that, as far as possible, 
hedging transactions are concluded only with finan-
cial institutions with a good credit rating (investment 
grade)."
"There are currently no past-due derivative 
­
financial instruments in the portfolio."
"Liquidity risk
The liquidity risk describes the risk of a company not 
being able to fulfil its financial obligations to a suffi-
cient degree."
"To manage Heidelberg Materials’ liquidi-
ty, the Group maintains cash and cash equivalents as 
well as credit lines with banks, besides the cash inflow 
from operating activities."
"The operating liquidity man-
agement includes a daily reconciliation of cash and 
cash equivalents."
"The Group Treasury department co-
ordinates the Group’s financing and liquidity manage-
ment measures."
"This allows liquidity surpluses and 
­
requirements to be managed in accordance with the 
needs of the entire Group and of individual Group com-
panies."
"In addition, factoring programmes are used to 
optimise working capital."
"As at the year end, the Group still has as yet undrawn, 
confirmed credit lines of €1.8 billion available in order 
to secure liquidity, in addition to available cash and 
cash equivalents."
"Heidelberg Materials AG has an open-­
ended framework agreement for the issue of short-
term bearer bonds (commercial papers) of €2 billion to 
cover short-term liquidity peaks."
"Within the context 
of the programme, individual tranches with different 
terms will be issued at different times depending on the 
market situation."
"As at the end of 2023, none of the 
commercial papers issued by Heidelberg Materials AG 
were outstanding."
"As the financial contracts of Heidelberg Materials do 
not contain any clauses that trigger a repayment obli-
gation in the event of the credit rating being down­
graded, the maturity structure will remain unaffected 
even if the credit assessments change."
"Margin calls 
that could lead to an outflow of liquidity are not agreed 
in any of the main financial instruments."
"All derivative 
financial instruments are contracted on the basis of 
existing framework agreements that contain netting 
agreements for the purpose of reducing credit and 
­
liquidity risks."
"The maturity overviews below show the future cash 
flows of financial liabilities and derivative financial in-
struments."
"Payments include the undiscounted repay-
ments and interest payments for bonds payable, bank 
loans, and other financial liabilities."
"The cash flows of 
the lease liabilities are presented on a gross basis – i.e."
before deducting financing costs.
"The trade payables are

"For 
variable interest payments, the current interest rate is 
taken as a basis."
"Payments in foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at year end."

"Interest rate risks are maintained within the 
­
parameters set by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer."
"For financial instruments with fixed interest that are 
measured at amortised cost, interest rate risks have no 
impact on result and equity."
"Currency risk
Heidelberg Materials’ currency risk results from its in-
vesting, financing, and operating activities."
"Risks from 
foreign currencies are generally hedged, insofar as 
they affect the Group’s cash flow."
"Currency forwards 
and foreign exchange swaps are used in the elimination 
of existing currency risks."
"Consequently, cur-
rency fluctuations in connection with the financing and 
liquidity management measures usually have no impact 
on result or equity."
"Unhedged items exist only in isolat-
ed cases, such as where currencies are not convertible."

By contrast, foreign currency risks that do not affect

sidiaries into the Group reporting currency) generally 
remain unhedged."

Other disclosures
11.1	 Capital management
The objective of capital management is to ensure suf-
ficient liquidity for the Group at all times."
"Therefore, the 
Group makes use of external and internal financing op-
portunities."
"The net debt and the leverage ratio, which 
corresponds to the ratio of net debt to the result from 
current operations before depreciation and amortisa-
tion, are of fundamental importance to the monitoring 
of the Group’s capital."
"Leverage ratio

"11.2	 Contingent liabilities
As at the reporting date, contingent liabilities amount-
ed to € 181.9 million (previous year: 199.1) and essential-
ly concern risks related to taxes on income."
"The timing 
of the possible cash outflows for the contingent liabili-
ties is uncertain because they depend on various exter-
nal factors that remain outside ­
Heidelberg ­
Materials' 
control."
"The application of taxation regulations might 
not yet be determined at the time that tax refund 
claims and liabilities are calculated."
"The calculation of 
tax items is based on the regulations most likely to be 
applied in each case."
"Nevertheless, the fiscal authori-
ties may be of a different opinion, which could give rise 
to additional tax liabilities."
"Future cash outflows of €60.6 million (previous 
year: 68.5) result from leases that had been entered 
into as at the reporting date but have not yet com-
menced."

­
activities and financial transactions."

"In the 2023 financial 
year, guarantees of €0.5 million (previous year: 0.5) 
were outstanding to joint ventures."
"Business transactions with associates include revenue 
and other sales amounting to €97.1 million (previous 
year: 113.1), the procurement of goods and services 
amounting to €28.9 million (previous year: 26.2), and

tions that would also apply to third parties."
"11.5	 Managing Board and Supervisory Board
The fixed remuneration of the Managing Board re-
mained at the level of the previous year of €7.4 million 
(previous year: 7.4)."
"The sum of short-term variable re-
muneration elements amounted to €11.3 million (previ-
ous year: 9.9)."
"In 2023, it consisted of the annual bonus 
in the amount of €11.3 million (previous year: 9.9)."
"The 
annual bonus is a variable remuneration element, which 
relates to the financial year."
"Two thirds of the overall 
target achievement for the annual bonus is measured 
by corporate targets (profit for the financial year at-
tributable to the shareholders of Heidelberg Materials 
AG and CO2 component) and one third by individual 
targets."
"The achievement of the corporate targets re-
sults from the multiplication of the target achievement 
of the performance criterion profit for the financial year 
attributable to the shareholders of Heidelberg Materials 
AG with the multiplier of the CO2 component."
"Other remuneration elements again totaled €1.7 million 
(previous year: 1.7)."
"In 2023, they consisted of a con-
tribution of private pension benefits (cash allowance) 
and taxable fringe benefits."
"The members of the Managing Board are participating 
in the long-term bonus plan 2023-2025/26, granted in 
2023."
"The target values for the plan, rounded to the 
nearest €’000, are €9,783,000."
"The plan comprises two equally weighted components: 
the management component and the capital market 
component."
"The PSUs are virtual 
shares used for the calculation of the capital market 
component."
"The target value, rounded to the nearest 
€’000, amounts to €4,890,000 for the management 
component and €4,892,000 for the capital market 
component."
"The different amounts result from the 
pro-rata calculation for the incoming and outgoing 
members of the Managing Board during the year."
"The 
reference price for the capital market component 
amounts to €48.74."
"This equates to 100,377 perfor-
mance share units (PSUs) in total."
"Pursuant to section 314(1)(6a) sentence 4 of the Ger-
man Commercial Code (HGB), the fair value at the 
grant date must be indicated for the capital market 
component."
"For the members of the Managing Board, 
the amount, rounded to the nearest €‘000, is in total 
€5,348,000."
"The total remuneration pursuant to HGB amounted to 
€35.2 million (previous year: 30.4)."
"The retirement agreements of the members of the 
Managing Board appointed prior to 2019 contain the 
promise of an annual retirement pension, in the form of 
either an absolute amount or a percentage of the pen-
sionable income."
"In 2019, a defined contribution pen-
sion commitment was introduced for the newly and 
reappointed members of the Managing Board."
"The de-
sign and expected pension benefits are based on the 
customary characteristics of such schemes, and exist-
ing contractual obligations are taken into account."
"In 
the financial year, allocations to provisions for pen-
sions (service cost) for active members of the Manag-
ing Board amounted to €2.6 million (previous year: 3.7)."
"The present values of the defined benefit obligation 
increased with the change in the discount rate relevant 
to the provisions to €26.1 million (previous year: 20.6)."
"In accordance with IAS 24, recognized expenses relat-
ing to the long-term capital market components for the 
service as members of the Managing Board amounted 
to €9.0 million (previous year: 1.7)."
"Due to the record 
performance of the financial targets, the expenses rec-
ognized relating to the long-term management com-
ponents came to €16.7 million (previous year: -3.0)."
"Provisions for capital market components amounted to 
€11.1 million (previous year: 2.1), and for management 
components they amounted to €18.6 million (previous 
year: 19.6)."
"For the members of the Managing Board appointed as 
of 2016 and 2019, the existing contractual entitlements 
from long-term bonus and pension plans from prior po-
sitions within the Heidelberg Materials Group were con-
tinued."
"These entitlements are serviced according to 
the original plan conditions."
"The corresponding ex-
penses in the financial year are included in the following 
table, in addition to the expenses for the service as 
member of the Managing Board."
"Total remuneration of the Managing Board in accord-
ance with IAS 24 came to €48.8 million in 2023 (previ-
ous year: 21.4) as represented in the following table."
"Provisions 
for pension obligations to former members of the Man-
aging Board amounted to €62.0 million (previous year: 
56.1)."
"The total Supervisory Board remuneration (excluding 
value added tax), which is short-term only, for the 2023 
financial year amounted to €1,911,000 (previous year: 
1,738,000)."
"com under Company/Corporate Governance/Decla-
ration of compliance pursuant to section 161 of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz)."
"The fee for the other assurance services 
primarily includes the fee for the audit to obtain limited 
assurance on the non-financial statement and selected 
ESG indicators."
"It also includes remuneration for issu-
ing a comfort letter in connection with the €10 billion 
Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and for 
auditing the remuneration report."
"This corresponds to ap-
proximately 2.21% of the company’s subscribed share 
capital before cancellation and capital reduction."
"The 
Supervisory Board approved the cancellation on 
21 February 2024."
"Following the cancellation of the 
shares and the capital reduction, the subscribed 
share capital of Heidelberg Materials AG amounts to 
€546,204,360 and is divided into 182,068,120 no-par 
value shares, each representing a notional amount of 
€3.00 of the subscribed share capital."
"On 21 February 2024, the Managing Board, with the 
consent of the Supervisory Board, resolved to launch a 
new share buyback programme with a total volume of 
up to €1.2 billion (excluding incidental acquisition costs) 
and a term no later than the end of 2026."
"It is envis-
aged that the share buyback will be carried out in three 
tranches."
"The first tranche is scheduled to start in the 
second quarter following the Heidelberg Materials AG 
2024 Annual General Meeting."
"The share buyback will 
be carried out via the stock exchange."
"11.9	 Approval by the Supervisory Board
The consolidated financial statements were prepared 
by the Managing Board and adopted on 20 March 2024."

uary to 31 December 2023."
"In accordance with the 
German legal requirements, we have not audited the 
content of those parts of the group management re-
port listed in the “Other Information” section of our 
auditor’s report."

– the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU and the additional requirements 
of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 
315e Abs."
"In all material respects, this group manage-
ment report is consistent with the consolidated finan-
cial statements, complies with German legal require-
ments and appropriately presents the opportunities 
and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion on 
the group management report does not cover the 
content of those parts of the group management re-
port listed in the “Other Information” section of our 
auditor’s report."
"3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we de-
clare that our audit has not led to any reservations re-
lating to the legal compliance of the consolidated finan-
cial statements and of the group management report."
"Basis for the Audit Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the group management report in 
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation 
(No."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU Audit 
Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally 
­
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer 
[­
Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our re-
sponsibilities under those requirements and principles 
are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and of the Group Management Report” section of our 
auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group en-
tities in accordance with the requirements of European 
law and German commercial and professional law, and 
we have fulfilled our other German professional re-
sponsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In 
addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of 
the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not 
provided non-audit services prohibited under Arti-
cle 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and ap-
propriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on 
the consolidated financial statements and on the group 
management report."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do 
not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"Goodwill is tested for impairment by the 
Company once a year or when there are indications 
of impairment to determine any possible need for 
write-downs."
"The impairment test is carried out at 
the level of the groups of cash-generating units to 
which the relevant goodwill is allocated."
"The carry-
ing amount of the relevant cash-generating units, 
including goodwill, is compared with the corre-
sponding recoverable amount in the context of the 
impairment test."
"The recoverable amount is gener-
ally determined using the value in use."
"The present 
value of the future cash flows from the respective 
group of cash-generating units normally serves as 
the basis of valuation."
"Present values are calculated 
using discounted cash flow models."
"For this pur-
pose, the adopted medium-term business plan 
of the Group forms the starting point which is ex-
trapolated based on assumptions about long-term 
rates of growth."
"Expectations relating to future 
market developments and assumptions about the 
development of macroeconomic factors as well as 
the expected effects on the Group’s business activ-
ities of the corporate strategy geared towards car-
bon neutrality are also taken into account."
"The dis-
count rate used is the weighted average cost of 
capital for the respective group of cash-generating 
units."
"The impairment test determined that no 
write-downs were necessary."
"Against this background and 
due to the complex nature of the valuation, this 
matter was of particular significance in the context 
of our audit."
"Heidelberg Materials 2023 300
Consolidated financial statements
﻿
Independent auditor’s ­
report
b)	 As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology 
used for the purposes of performing the impairment 
test, among other things."
"After matching the future 
cash flows used for the calculation against the 
adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, 
we assessed the appropriateness of the calcula-
tion, in particular by reconciling it with general and 
sector-specific market expectations."
"In this con-
text, we also evaluated the assessment of the exec-
utive directors regarding the effects of the corpo-
rate strategy geared towards carbon neutrality on 
the Group’s business activities, and examined how 
this was taken into consideration in determining the 
future cash flows."
"In the knowledge that even rela-
tively small changes in the discount rate applied can 
have a material impact on the value of the entity 
calculated in this way, we also assessed the param-
eters used to determine the discount rate applied, 
and evaluated the measurement model."
"In order to 
reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, 
we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by 
the Company in order to estimate any potential 
impair­
ment risk related to key assumptions of the 
measurement."
"Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions 
used by the executive directors are in line with our 
expectations and are also within the ranges consid-
ered by us to be reasonable."
"c)	 The Company’s disclosures on the “goodwill” bal-
ance sheet item are contained in section “9.1 Intan-
gible assets” of the and notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"2	 Accounting treatment of deferred taxes
a)	 In the consolidated financial statements of the 
Company deferred tax assets amounting to 
EUR 295.5 million after netting are reported."
"De-
ferred tax assets amounting to EUR 1,173.3 million 
are recognized before netting with matching de-
ferred tax liabilities."
"For this purpose, insofar as sufficient 
­
deferred tax liabilities are not available, future tax-
able profits are projected on the basis of the adopt-
ed business plan."
"From our point of view, the accounting treatment of 
deferred taxes was of particular significance in the 
context of our audit, as it depends to a large extent 
on the estimates and assumptions made by the 
­
executive directors and is therefore subject to un-
certainties."
"b)	 As part of our audit, we assessed, among other 
things, the internal processes and controls for re-
cording tax matters as well as the methodology 
used for the determination, accounting treatment 
and measurement of deferred taxes."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to 
satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assump-
tions made by the executive directors are substan-
tiated and sufficiently documented."
"c)	 The Company’s disclosures relating to deferred tax-
es are contained in section “7.10 Income taxes” of 
the and notes to the consolidated financial state-
ments."
"The recognition 
and measurement of current and non-current in-
come tax obligations as well as the determination 
and disclosure of contingent liabilities are based to 
a large extent on estimates and assumptions made 
by the executive directors."
"Against this background 
and due to the amount of these material items, 
these matters were of particular significance in the 
context of our audit."
"b)	 As part of our audit, we assessed, among other 
things, the internal processes and controls for re-
cording and assessing tax matters and the pres-
entation of obligations arising from tax matters in 
the financial statements."
"We also involved our internal special-
ists from the Tax department in the audit team."
"Furthermore, we also held 
meetings with the Company’s tax department in 
order to receive updates on current developments 
with regard to the material tax matters and the rea-
sons for the corresponding estimates."
"As of the bal-
ance sheet date, we also obtained confirmations 
from external tax advisors that support the execu-
tive directors’ estimates."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to 
satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assump-
tions made by the executive directors are substan-
tiated and sufficiently documented."
"Other Information
The executive directors are responsible for the other 
information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial state-
ments and on the group management report do not 
cover the other information, and consequently we do 
not express an audit opinion or any other form of as-
surance conclusion thereon."
"1 HGB and that 
the consolidated financial statements, in compliance 
with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial per-
formance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
executive directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They 
also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applica-
ble, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they 
are responsible for financial reporting based on the 
going concern basis of accounting unless there is an 
intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the 
Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and of the 
group management report."
"Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements and this group management report."

We exercise professional judgment and maintain pro-

"The risk of not detecting a ma-

than for one resulting from error, as fraud may in-
volve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, mis-
representations, or the override of internal controls."
"– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies

"However, future events or conditions

conformity with German law, and the view of the 
Group’s position it provides."
"– Perform audit procedures on the prospective infor-

group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, 
the significant assumptions used by the executive di-
rectors as a basis for the prospective information, 
and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospec-
tive information from these assumptions."
"We do not 
express a separate audit opinion on the prospective 
information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future 
events will differ materially from the prospective in-
formation."
"We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope

including any significant deficiencies in internal control

granted and owed in the 2023 financial year to the 
members of the Managing Board and Supervisory 
Board in office in the 2023 financial year and to former 
members."
"The remuneration granted includes the re-
muneration components whose underlying (single or 
multi-year) service or performance period was fully 
completed in the financial year."
"The remuneration re-
port was jointly prepared by the Managing Board and 
the Supervisory Board in accordance with the provi-
sions of section 162 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG)."
"In addition, it takes into ac-
count the recommendations and suggestions of the 
German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) in its 
version of 28 April 2022."
"The remuneration report was also audited with reason-
able assurance by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH 
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft beyond the require-
ments of section 162(3) of the AktG."
"The report on the 
audit of the remuneration report can be found at the 
end of the remuneration report."
"The record result 
in the profit for the financial year attributable to the 
shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG adjusted for 
special effects and the reduction in CO2 emissions con-
tributed to the achievement of the objectives for the 
annual bonus."
"In addition, initiatives were implemented 
that served as a basis of the individual target agree-
ments for the members of the Managing Board within 
the framework of the company strategy."
"For the management component of the long-term 
­
bonus 2021-2023/2024, a strong performance of EBIT 
and ROIC, adjusted for special effects, led to a target 
achievement of 200 %."
"However, the total shareholder 
return (TSR) of the Heidelberg Materials share after the 
end of the performance period from 2020 to 2023 
was below that of the TSRs of the DAX and the MSCI 
World Construction Materials Index."
"Consequently, and 
­
despite the positive development of the Heidelberg 
Materials share in 2023, there is no payment from the 
capital market component of the long-term bonus."
"This 
result can be explained, among other things, by the 
fact that the target achievement is measured by the 
change in TSR based on a four-year reference period 
prior to the start of the plan (degressive smoothing)."
"Fol-
lowing the termination of his Managing Board man-
date, it was agreed with Mr Jelito that he will remain

"This in-
cludes an external, horizontal comparison with the re-
muneration of managing boards of comparable com-
panies as well as an internal, vertical comparison of 
remuneration within Heidelberg Materials."
"For the hori-
zontal comparison, the selection of companies is based 
on the size and international activity of Heidelberg 
Materials, the economic and financial situation, and 
future prospects."
"The companies of the DAX are used for the horizontal 
comparison."
"The horizontal comparison serves to veri-
fy that the remuneration of the Managing Board is mar-
ket common."
"For the vertical comparison, the remuneration of the 
Managing Board is compared with the remuneration of 
top and senior management (upper management) and 
the remuneration of the total workforce of Heidelberg 
Materials AG, both overall and in terms of development 
over time."
"The following overview shows the development of the 
target direct remuneration (fixed annual salary, target 
value of the annual bonus, and – if the corresponding 
employee groups are eligible – the target value of the 
long-term bonus) in the internal comparison in the pe-
riod from 2019 to 2023."
"The vertical comparison of the 
target remuneration is used when reviewing the appro-
priateness of the remuneration of the Managing Board

The decrease of 9.1% in the average target direct remuneration of the Managing Board from 2020 to 2021 is mainly due to the new appointment of three Managing

Pay for performance and the focus on the sustainable 
and long-term development of the company are cen-
tral principles of the remuneration of its Managing 
Board."
"With these principles in mind, 71% of the target 
direct remuneration for the Chairman of the Managing 
Board and around 67% for the members of the Manag-
ing Board consists of variable remuneration compo-
nents."
"The fixed annual salary thus accounts for 29% of 
the target direct remuneration for the Chairman of the 
Managing Board and around 33% for the members of 
the Managing Board."
"To ensure the long-term focus of the remuneration of 
the Managing Board, the share of the long-term bonus 
exceeds that of the annual bonus within the variable 
remuneration components."
"The amount of the 
target remuneration depends on the responsibilities as 
well as the relevant experience of and tasks carried out 
by the individual member of the Managing Board."
The remaining 10% are paid by Heidelberg Materials AG.

"3)	
90% of Chris Ward’s fixed annual salary, annual bonus, and long-term bonus are paid by Heidelberg Materials US, Inc."
The remaining 10% are paid by Heidelberg Materials AG.
"Chris Ward receives his remuneration in US dollars in accordance  
with his employment contract."
The average exchange rates for 2022 (1.0536 USD/EUR) and 2022 (1.0816 USD/EUR) were used for conversion into euros.

"The maximum remuneration for Ernest 
Jelito, Jon Morrish, and Chris Ward corresponds to up to 
177% of the target direct remuneration, the maximum 
remuneration for Kevin Gluskie and Hakan Gurdal 184% 
of the target direct remuneration."

nual service costs of pension commitments) are defined

12 monthly instalments."
"The employment contracts of the members of the 
Heidelberg Materials Managing Board provide for peri-
odic reviews of the fixed annual salary."
"In the past

was reviewed and adjusted."
"In connection with his re-

creased by 8% with effect from 1 September 2023."
"Tak-
ing into account the most recent adjustment to the

annual rate of increase of 2.9% since his appointment 
to the Managing Board in the year 2019."
"In comparison, 
the average annual rate of increase for the total work-
force of Heidelberg Materials AG over the years 2020 
to 2023 was over 2.9% as well."

"Variable remuneration components
The variable remuneration components include the an-

"While the annual 
bonus relates to a financial year, the long-term bonus 
has a duration (performance period) of three years 
(management component) or four years (capital mar-
ket component)."
"For the overall consideration of the company’s success, 
different performance criteria are used within the vari-
able remuneration components to measure the target 
achievement."
"The performance criteria are derived 
from the Group strategy and are both financial and 
non-financial."
"For new appointments and reappointments as of 
2019, this margin of discretion has been reduced to 
±15% of the target value of the variable remuneration 
components."
"For Managing Board agreements con-
cluded before 2019, it is ±25% of the respective target 
value."
"In the 2023 reporting year, this still applies to 
Managing Board members Kevin Gluskie and Hakan 
Gurdal."
"As in previous years, the Supervisory Board did 
not make use of the option of discretionary adjustment 
to the remuneration of the Managing Board in the 2023 
financial year."
"Remuneration report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 320
Annual bonus
Fundamentals of the annual bonus
The annual bonus is a variable remuneration compo-
nent that provides incentives to implement the opera-
tional targets in the financial year."
"At a target achieve-
ment rate of 100%, the annual bonus amounts to 100% 
of the fixed annual salary for the Chairman of the Man-
aging Board and 80% for the members of the Manag-
ing Board."
"The share of the annual bonus in the target 
direct remuneration amounts to around 29% for the 
Chairman of the Managing Board and 26% for the 
members of the Managing Board."
"The payout amount 
depends on the overall target achievement, which can 
range between 0% and 200%."
"The annual bonus is paid in cash after the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting of the following year."
"If the term of office of the Managing Board member 
begins during the year, the target value will be reduced 
pro rata temporis."
"Performance criteria of the annual bonus
Two thirds of the overall target achievement for the an-
nual bonus is measured by corporate targets (profit for 
the financial year attributable to the shareholders of 
Heidelberg Materials AG and CO2 component) and one 
third by individual targets."
"The achievement of the cor-
porate targets is calculated by multiplying the target 
achievement of the performance criterion profit for 
the financial year attributable to the shareholders of 
Heidelberg Materials AG by the multiplier of the CO2 
component."
"At the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory 
Board sets the target and threshold values for the indi-
vidual performance criteria or, in the case of individual 
targets, the specific targets for the financial year."
"The 
Supervisory Board makes sure that these targets are 
challenging and ambitious."
"At the end of the financial 
year, the Supervisory Board determines the extent to 
which the individual performance criteria have been 
reached."
"Profit/loss for the financial year attributable 
to Heidelberg Materials AG shareholders
The profit for the financial year attributable to the 
shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG, adjusted for 
special items, is the basis for the first performance cri-
terion."
"Special items are only taken into account above 
a value of €20 million."
"The profit for the financial year attributable to the 
shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG reflects 
Heidelberg Materials’ profitability as a basic parame-
ter."
"Increasing the value of the Group through sustain-
able and result-oriented growth is intended to guaran-
tee a lasting entrepreneurial capacity to act."
"In line 
with its financial strategy, Heidelberg Materials strives 
to offer an attractive investment opportunity for its 
shareholders and to pursue a progressive dividend pol-
icy."
"The profit for the financial year attributable to the 
shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG provides the 
basis for dividend payments."
"As a component of the 
annual bonus, this key figure is therefore intended to 
provide incentives for profitable management."
"The target achievement 
can range from 0% to 200%."
"For the 2023 financial 
year, the Supervisory Board set a target corridor of 
€1,268 million to €1,288 million."
"The target achievement 
rate is 100% if the actual value of the profit for the 
­
financial year attributable to the shareholders of 
Heidelberg Materials AG is within the target corridor."
"The floor was set at €1,068 million and the cap at 
€1,413 million."
"In the 2023 financial year, the actual value of the prof-
it for the financial year attributable to the shareholders 
of Heidelberg Materials AG, including adjustments for 
special items relevant to remuneration, amounted to 
€1,865 million."
"This results in a target achievement of 
200%."

"At 
the same time, the aim is to promote the long-term and 
sustainable development of Heidelberg Materials by 
orienting the business model towards resource-effi-
cient production."
"The methodology for calculating the CO2 component is 
based on an internal definition for the specific CO2 
emissions per tonne of cement."
"The internal definition 
takes into account the CO2 emissions of the main pro-
cess steps in cement manufacture."
"These include the 
consumption of raw materials and fuel, clinker produc-
tion, and clinker grinding."
"The CO2 emissions of pur-
chased clinker are also factored in."
"In line with the EU 
ETS accounting methodology, the biomass content of 
the alternative fuels used is considered carbon-neutral."
"To ensure comparability with relevant competitors, 
Heidelberg Materials reports on CO2 emissions in ac-
cordance with the GCCA standard (specific net CO2 
emissions per tonne of cementitious material) in the 
Non-financial statement chapter."
"Compared with the 
internal definition, the net CO2 emissions calculation 
considers alternative fuels in their entirety as carbon-­
neutral rather than just their biogenic content."
"As a re-
sult, the CO2 emissions according to the internal defi-
nition are higher than those calculated in line with the 
GCCA standard."
"The CO2 component is set up as a multiplier, which can 
range between 0.7 and 1.3 (CO2 multiplier)."
"To deter-
mine the CO2 multiplier, the Supervisory Board defines 
a target for the specific CO2 emissions per tonne of 
cement at the beginning of the respective financial 
year."
"That target is derived from Heidelberg Materials’ 
long-term CO2 roadmap and the Group’s current CO2 
performance."
"For the 2023 financial year, the Super­
visory Board set a target value of 571 kg of CO2 per 
tonne of cement."
"Overachievement or underachieve-
ment of the target value by up to –2% or +2% leads to 
a linear increase or decrease of the target achieve-
ment."
"This results in a CO2 multiplier between 1.3 (at 
–2%: cap) and 0.7 (at +2%: floor)."
"In the 2023 financial year, the actual value of CO2 
emissions was 569 kg of CO2 per tonne of cement."
"This 
results in a CO2 multiplier of 1.05."
"At the beginning of the financial year, the 
Supervisory Board defines the targets for each mem-
ber of the Managing Board."
"The target achievement 
can range from 0% to 200%."
"Individual targets were agreed for each member of the 
Managing Board in 2023 depending on their respective 
area of responsibility."
"These targets are based on the 
objectives of the Group strategy: growth and transfor-
mation, sustainability, digital transformation, people 
and organisation, corporate portfolio, capital alloca-
tion, and added value."
"Strategic growth targets were 
implemented in the areas of growth and transforma-
tion as well as corporate portfolio, particularly for re-
cycling and digital partnerships."
"In order to achieve 
Heidelberg Materials’ sustainability goals, targets were 
agreed to increase revenue from sustainable products, 
reduce the global carbon footprint, further improve 
sustainability reporting, and increase occupational 
safety."
"As for digital transformation, targets were set 
to commercialise digital products, enable efficiency 
gains in production and administration (HProduce), 
and further strengthen the digital customer base 
(HConnect)."
"In order to improve capital allocation and 
added value, targets were set to increase free cash 
flow, cash conversion rate, and RCOBD margin as well 
as to reduce fixed costs."
"For 2023, the achievement rate of individual targets for 
Managing Board members was between 128% and 
152%."
"In many areas, the Managing Board not only 
achieved the targets, but even exceeded them."
"In the 
area of sustainability, we increased revenue of sustain-
able products and launched initiatives to further re-
duce our carbon footprint."
"In the area of digitalization, 
the digital customer base was increased (HConnect), 
the growth of investments (e.g."
"Giatec) was accelerat-
ed and measures to further improve cyber security 
were implemented."
"The acquisition of various compa-
nies and targeted disposals further expanded our pres-
ence in strategically important markets and advanced 
the optimization of our company portfolio."
"In terms of 
capital allocation and value creation, our excellent per-
formance was reflected in the increase in free cash flow 
and the cash conversion rate (ratio of free cash flow to 
EBITDA) as well as the significant recovery in our profit 
margins (RCOBD margin)."
"At the same time, fixed cost 
reduction targets were missed due to the persistently 
high inflation rates worldwide."
"The following table provides an overview of the targets 
and their achievement per Managing Board member 
for 2023."
"The 2023 annual bonus will be 
paid after the Annual General Meeting in 2024."
"Remuneration report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 327
Long-term bonus
The long-term bonus is a variable remuneration com-
ponent based on the company’s long-term perfor-
mance and is allocated in annual tranches."
"If 100% of 
the target is achieved, it amounts to 150% of the fixed 
annual salary for the Chairman of the Managing Board 
and 125% of the fixed annual salary for the members of 
the Managing Board."
"At the beginning of the 2023 financial year, the long-
term bonus 2023–2025/2026 was allocated."
"The first 
allocation was made in the 2011 financial year."
"The following illustration gives an overview of the pay-
out scheme of the long-term bonus tranches in relation 
to the 2023 financial year and the still outstanding 
tranches:
 
The long-term bonus consists of two components."
"Management component
The management component is structured as a perfor-
mance cash plan."
"It has a three-year performance pe-
riod and considers internal added value as measured 
by the equally weighted performance criteria earnings 
before interest and taxes (EBIT) and return on invested 
capital (ROIC)."
"The target value for the management 
component is 50% of the total target value for the 
long-term bonus."
"At the end of the performance ­
period, 
the Supervisory Board determines the target achieve-
ment for the management component."
"The overall tar-
get achievement can range between 0% and 200%."
"Capital market component
The capital market component is structured as a per-
formance share plan."
"It is based on virtual shares, so-
called performance share units (PSUs), thus establish-
ing a direct link to the development of the Heidelberg 
Materials share price and strengthening the alignment 
between the interests of the Managing Board and the 
shareholders."
"The capital market component has a 
four-year performance period and considers the exter-
nal added value as measured by the performance cri-
terion TSR compared with the relevant capital market 
indices."
"For the capital market component, the first 
step is to determine the number of PSUs to be provi-
sionally allocated."
"The number of PSUs is calculated on 
the basis of 50% of the overall target value for the 
long-term bonus divided by the reference price of the 
Heidelberg Materials share at the start of the perfor-
mance period (allocation price)."
"The allocation price is 
the average of the daily closing prices of the Heidelberg 
Materials share on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra 
trading system in the three months prior to the start of 
the performance period."
"At the end of the four-year performance period, the 
target achievement is determined for the performance 
criterion of the capital market component."
"The target 
achievement can range between 0% and 200%."
"The 
final number of PSUs is calculated by multiplying the 
provisionally allocated number of PSUs with the target 
achievement."
"The resulting number of PSUs is then mul-
tiplied by the current reference price of the Heidelberg 
Materials share at the end of the performance period 
(closing price), adjusted for the notionally reinvested 
dividend payments and for changes in capital."
"The 
closing price is the average of the daily closing prices 
of the Heidelberg Materials share on the Frankfurt 
Stock Exchange Xetra trading system in the three 
months prior to the start of the performance period."
"The increase in value per PSU is limited to 250% of the 
allocation price."
"The management component is paid in cash after the 
Annual General Meeting of the year following the three-
year performance period and is limited to 200% of the 
target value."
"The capital market component is paid in 
cash after the Annual General Meeting of the year after 
the four-year performance period and is limited to 
400% of the target value."
"Payouts from the overall long-term bonus are capped 
at a maximum of 200% of the contractually agreed 
target value, where the amount of the capital market 
component can offset the amount of the management 
component payout."
"DAX Index
Relative TSR vs."
"EBIT
The basis for the performance criterion is the EBIT, 
which is adjusted for one-time special effects that 
could not be foreseen at the time when the operating 
plan and the targets were set."
"As for the calculation of 
the profit for the financial year attributable to the 
shareholders of Heidelberg Materials AG, only special 
items above a threshold of €20 million are taken into 
account."
"EBIT is a measure of profitability and reflects the eco-
nomic strength of Heidelberg Materials."
"Combined with 
the consideration of the profit for the financial year at-
tributable to the shareholders of Heidelberg Materials 
AG in the annual bonus, incentives for profitable growth 
are thus provided in both the short-term and long-term 
variable remuneration components."
"At the beginning of each tranche, the Supervisory 
Board determines a target corridor, which is derived 
from the Group’s three-year operational plan, as well 
as the thresholds (floor and cap)."
"The calculation of the 
target achievement at the end of the performance pe-
riod is based on the comparison of the average EBIT 
over the three-year performance period with the spec-
ified target corridor."
"The target achievement can range 
from 0% to 200%."
"For the performance criterion EBIT, the defined target 
corridor, the thresholds (cap and floor), as well as the 
resulting target achievement and the adjustments 
made for the calculation of target achievement are dis-
closed in the remuneration report after the perfor-
mance period has ended."

ROIC
The performance criterion is based on ROIC."
"Starting 
with the 2023 tranche of the long-term bonus, adjusted 
ROIC is calculated as EBIT adjusted for exchange rate 
effects less standard taxes and divided by invested 
capital."
"EBIT is adjusted solely for exchange rate differ-
ences compared with the assumptions made in the op-
erational plan in the first year of the performance peri-
od."
"The standard tax rate is calculated by dividing the 
current tax expense (non-deferred) for the current year 
by the profit before tax adjusted for impairments."
"For 
tranches of the long-term bonus that were awarded 
before 2023, a different calculation methodology ap-
plies, which is described in the Completed tranches at 
the end of the 2023 financial year section."
"ROIC is 
one of Heidelberg Materials’ most important financial 
performance indicators."
"The inclusion of ROIC as a 
performance criterion in the long-term bonus therefore 
provides further incentives to increase capital efficien-
cy in line with the Group strategy."
"The ROIC target achievement is measured by compar-
ing the target value set at the beginning of the respec-
tive tranche with the actual value at the end of the per-
formance period."
"The lower and upper limits of the 
target achievement curve are defined depending on 
the target value."
"The target value set by the Super­
visory Board is derived from the company’s relevant 
three-year operational plan."
"The target achievement 
can range from 0% to 200%."
"Relative TSR represents a capital market-oriented per-
formance criterion that provides an incentive for the 
sustainable and long-term outperformance of the peer 
groups and is thus in line with Heidelberg Materials’ tar-
get of offering shareholders an attractive investment 
opportunity."
"Furthermore, the relative TSR adds a rela-
tive performance metric to the long-term bonus."
"The target achievement range for determining the final 
number of PSUs at the end of the performance period 
is 0% to 200%."
"Target achievement is measured by the 
change in TSR based on a four-year reference period 
prior to the start of the plan (degressive smoothing)."
"The development of the TSR of the Heidelberg Materials 
share is determined and compared with the respective 
development of the benchmark indices."
"Target achieve-
ment is then calculated on the basis of the average 
relative TSR.  
The target achievement curve for the relative TSR is as 
follows:
 
Relative TSR
Target achievement
– 25 pp."
TSR performance Heidelberg Materials share vs.
"benchmark indices
+ 25 pp."
"The structure of the two completed 
tranches largely corresponds to the tranches of the 
long-term bonus allocated in the 2023 financial year."
"2021 tranche of the management component
The target achievement for the 2021 tranche of the 
management component was determined on the basis 
of the equally weighted performance criteria EBIT and 
ROIC."
"Deviating from the calculation methodology ap-
plied since the 2023 tranche and described in the pre-
vious section, ROIC is calculated as the ratio between 
the adjusted EBIT minus standard taxes and invested 
capital."
"Invested capital is calculated as equity plus net finan-
cial liabilities less “loans,” “financial investments,” and 
current “interest-bearing receivables” at the end of the 
performance period."
"Invested capital is calculated as 
the average of the opening balance sheet and the clos-
ing balance sheet of the last year of the management 
component performance period."
"Before the start of the tranche, a target corridor of 
€2,295 million to €2,395 million corresponding to a tar-
get achievement of 100% was set for EBIT."
"The actual 
EBIT value, which is calculated as the average of the 
EBIT over the three years of the performance period, 
was €2,647 million (2021: €2,565 million, 2022: €2,419 
million, 2023: €2,957 million)."
"In previous years, these were pri-
marily restructuring expenses, impairments, and gains 
on disposals."
"For 2023 these are listed in the Annual 
bonus section and include the gains from the sale of 
the Chaney group in North America, impairments of the 
participation in the joint venture Duna Dráva Kft."
"in 
Hungary, reversal of impairment of the participation in 
the joint venture Akçansa Çimento Şanayi ve Ticaret 
A.S."
"This results in a target achievement for EBIT of 
200%."
"Before the start of the tranche, a target value of 8.70% 
was set for ROIC, for which a target achievement of 
100% could be reached."
"The lower threshold (floor) for 
ROIC, where the target achievement is 0%, is 8.00%, 
while the upper threshold (cap) for ROIC, which must 
be reached for a target achievement of 200%, is 
9.40%."
"The actual ROIC value at the end of the perfor-
mance period was 10,1%, corresponding to a target 
achievement of 200%."
"Based on the target achievements in the two perfor-
mance criteria, the overall target achievement for the 
2021 tranche of the management component is 200%."
"This results in a difference of –20.9 
percentage points compared with the DAX and a differ-
ence of –31.0 percentage points compared with the 
MSCI World Construction Materials Index."
"The average 
difference amounts to –26.0 percentage points."
"The 
overall target achievement rate for the relative TSR is 
therefore 0% for the 2020 tranche of the capital mar-
ket component."
"The allocation price for determining the number of pro-
visionally allocated PSUs at the start of the tranche 
was €65.84."
"The closing price, including notionally rein-
vested dividends and adjusted for changes in capital, 
was €83.17 at the end of the performance period."
"This 
corresponds to a development of 26.3% over the per-
formance period."
"The amount of this contribution is reviewed 
on a regular basis."
"In the framework of a capital mar-
ket-oriented model, these contributions are used to 
acquire fund shares that are credited to a pension ac-
count."
"The Managing Board member is entitled to a 
one-off capital payment in the amount of the value of 
the pension account at the time of benefit commence-
ment."
"Alternatively, the Managing Board member can 
choose to receive an annuity based on the accumulat-
ed pension capital."
"The pension contributions accumu-
lated over the duration of the commitment are guaran-
teed."
"If the member of the Managing Board dies, the 
pension entitlement shall pass to the widow or widower 
or to the children of the Managing Board member."
"Dr  Dominik von Achten, René Aldach, Ernest Jelito, 
Dr Nicola Kimm, and Dennis Lentz each had a defined 
contribution commitment in the 2023 financial year."
"In lieu of a pension commitment, an annual cash allow-
ance is made available to Chris Ward, which can be 
used to finance a private pension plan."
"Defined benefit commitment prior to 2019 
(old commitment)
In addition to his defined contribution commitment, Dr 
Dominik von Achten has a defined benefit commitment 
in the form of an annual retirement pension for the de-
fined benefit entitlements earned until his reappoint-
ment in 2020."
"The retirement agreements of the members of the 
Managing Board appointed between 2016 and 2018 
contain the commitment to an annual retirement pen-
sion in the form of a percentage of the pensionable 
income."
"Kevin Gluskie, Hakan Gurdal, and Jon Morrish 
still had such a defined benefit commitment in the 2023 
financial year."
"The percentage can equal up to 4% per 
commenced year of service; the maximum percentage 
accumulated is 40% of the pensionable income."
"The 
pensionable income is agreed individually for each 
member of the Managing Board."
"Upon reappointment, existing defined benefit commit-
ments are continued with the value of the pension ben-
efit at the reappointment date."
"If the Supervisory 
Board agrees additional retirement benefit commit-
ments, these will be covered by a defined contribution 
commitment."
"The Supervisory Board reserves the right 
to agree an adjustment of the retirement benefit, in-
cluding within the existing system, in the event of a con-
tract extension when an employee is close to retire-
ment age."
"In addition to the defined benefit commitment and de-
fined contribution commitment, a transitional allow-
ance equal to a monthly salary will be paid for a period 
of six months upon termination of the contract and 
benefit commencement."
"If a member of the Managing Board dies, their 
widow or widower and their dependent children receive 
a widow’s, widower’s, or orphan’s pension."
"In the case 
of defined benefit commitments, the widow/widower’s 
pension is 60% and the orphan’s pension 10% of the 
deceased’s pension benefit as long as a widow/widow-
er’s pension is being paid at the same time."
"If a widow/
widower’s pension is not being paid at the same time, 
the orphan’s pension is 20% of the deceased’s pension 
benefit."
"In the case of defined contribution commit-
ments, the full entitlement to the value of the pension 
account shall pass to the widow or widower and the 
surviving children."
"The sharp rise in interest rates over the past 
year led to a smaller increase in the present values of 
defined benefit entitlements than in previous years and, 
as can be seen in the table, even to a decrease in indi-
vidual cases."
"The increase in the present value of pen-
sion obligations between 2022 and 2023 is due to ex-
pense booked in the 2023 financial year as well as a 
lower interest rate."
"The amount of the service cost is determined at the 
beginning of the respective financial year in accord-
ance with IFRS."
"Accordingly, the comparison of the ser-
vice cost between 2023 and 2022 still shows the ef-
fects of the increased interest rate level spike at that 
time."
"However, the amount of contributions under the 
defined contribution plans granted remained constant 
in the reporting year."
"Share ownership
To further harmonise the interests of the Managing 
Board and the shareholders, the Supervisory Board 
has adopted guidelines for share ownership."
"The mem-
bers of the Managing Board are obliged to acquire a 
contractually defined number of Heidelberg Materials 
AG shares and to hold them for the duration of their 
appointment as a member of the Managing Board."
"The share ownership is a key element in creating a 
strong link between the interests of the Managing 
Board and the shareholders and at the same time 
aligning the remuneration of the Managing Board even 
further with the long-term success of Heidelberg 
Materials."
"The number of Heidelberg Materials shares 
to be held equals 30,000 for the Chairman of the Man-
aging Board and 15,000 for each of the members of 
the Managing Board."
"Before 2019, the obligation for 
members of the Managing Board equalled 10,000 
Heidelberg Materials shares, which is why agreements 
concluded prior to this date stipulate an obligation in 
this amount."
"In the event of a reappointment, the re-
quired number of 15,000 shares also applies to these 
Remuneration report
Heidelberg Materials 2023 337
members of the Managing Board."
"In order to fulfil the 
share ownership, provided that the investment target 
has not yet been achieved at the relevant payout date, 
half of the payout amounts from the long-term bonus 
must be used to acquire shares of the company until 
the complete share ownership requirement has been 
met."
"Accumulating the share ownership can therefore 
take several years."
"Company shares that are already 
held by members of the Managing Board are taken into 
account when calculating share ownership."
"The mem-
bers of the Managing Board have confirmed to the 
Super­
visory Board that sufficient shares were acquired 
in accordance with the respective obligation."
"According to the Managing Board contract,  
there has therefore been no obligation to purchase shares to date."
"Malus and clawback rules
The variable remuneration components include malus 
and clawback rules."
"The 
malus and clawback rules apply to both the annual bo-
nus and the long-term bonus."
"In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board did 
not see any reason to apply malus and clawback rules, 
which is why the Supervisory Board did not reduce or 
reclaim variable remuneration."
"There shall be no accel-
erated settlement or payout."
"The annual bonus and 
long-term bonus shall be reduced pro rata temporis in 
case of a departure during the financial year in which 
the annual bonus or long-term bonus is allocated."
"In the event of the early termination of a Managing 
Board membership for good cause before the end of 
the performance period, entitlements to the annual bo-
nus and long-term bonus shall be forfeited."
"The severance pay cap is calcu-
lated based on the amount of the total remuneration 
for the past financial year and, where applicable, on 
the amount of the expected total remuneration for the 
current financial year."
"A severance pay cap has been 
agreed with all members of the Managing Board in of-
fice in the 2023 financial year."
"Managing Board agreements concluded since the 
2020 financial year are governed by the proposal of 
the GCGC in force since 2019, according to which 
change of control clauses are no longer to be part of 
Managing Board agreements."
"The agreements of René 
Aldach, Dr Nicola Kimm, and Dennis Lentz therefore do 
not contain change of control clauses."
"Moreover, the 
members of the Managing Board are prohibited from 
establishing, acquiring, or directly or indirectly partici-
pating in such a competing company for the duration 
of the post-contractual non-compete clause."
"For the 
duration of the post-contractual non-compete clause, 
the member of the Managing Board receives their last 
fixed annual salary in equal monthly instalments (wait-
ing allowance)."
"The waiting allowance shall be reduced 
to the extent that the member of the Managing Board 
receives benefits from their pension agreement after 
leaving the company."
"Heidelberg Materials AG may 
waive the post-contractual non-compete clause be-
fore the termination of the employment contract."
"In 2023, a waiting allowance of €450,000 was paid to 
Dr Lorenz Näger."
"Dr Lorenz Näger received the last pay­
ment from his waiting allowance in August 2023."
"Disclosure of benefits from third parties
For the 2023 financial year, the members of the Man-
aging Board have not received any benefits from third 
parties in connection with their Managing Board activ-
ities."
"The cost of Mr Gluskie’s 
remuneration was split between Heidelberg Materials 
AG and Heidelberg Materials Asia Pte."
"due to his 
role as CEO of Heidelberg Materials Asia Pte."
"The remuneration granted includes the remuneration 
components whose underlying (single or multi-year) 
service or performance period was fully completed in 
the financial year, even if payout does not take place 
until the following financial year."
"With the exception of 
the lack of including the service costs of the pension 
commitments, this reporting logic corresponds to 
the  previous remuneration reporting of Heidelberg 
Materials AG in the table Allocations according to 
GCGC in the version of the GCGC of 7 February 2017."
"In addition to the absolute remuneration amounts, the 
tables also contain the relative proportion of the indi-
vidual remuneration components within the total remu-
neration granted and owed."
The remaining 10% was paid by Heidelberg Materials AG.
"The fringe benefits of Kevin Gluskie include, in addition to 
the assumption of costs for a company car, group accident insurance and flights home, as well as a travel allowance and the assumption of costs for a company flat."
"Under the terms of his employment contract, Kevin Gluskie receives his remuneration 
in Australian dollars."
The average exchange rates for 2021 (AUD/EUR 1.5751) and 2022 (AUD/EUR 1.5169) were used for translation into euros.
"The closing rates prior to the start of the performance period (31 December, 2018: AUD/EUR 1.62681, 
31 December, 2019: AUD/EUR 1.5971) were used to convert its long-term bonus into euros."
"2)	
With his departure from the Managing Board on December 31, 2023, Mr. Jelito received a contractual advance payment in the amount of the target value of the management component of the long-term bonus 2023–2025/26."
"The advance payment does 
not represent a guaranteed payment and will be offset against the final target achievement at the end of the performance period."
(Lehigh Hanson until 1 January 2023).
"The remaining 30% are paid by 
­
Heidelberg Materials AG."
"The fringe benefits of Dennis Lentz include, in addition to the assumption of costs for a company car, group accident insurance and flights home, especially secondment-related 
benefits such as foreign health insurance, relocation, housing, school and living costs."
"2)	
90% of the fixed annual salary, the annual bonus, and the long-term bonus of Chris Ward are borne by Heidelberg Materials US, Inc."
(Lehigh Hanson until 1 January 2023).
"The remaining 10% is borne by ­

"Further development of the remuneration 
system
The Supervisory Board is committed to continuously 
improving the remuneration system for the members of 
the Managing Board in the interests of the sharehold-
ers of Heidelberg Materials AG."
"This is done by main-
taining ongoing dialogue with our investors and by reg-
ularly analysing current market practice."
"In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board car-
ried out a comprehensive review of the remuneration 
system, taking into account investor expectations and 
Heidelberg Materials’ strategic objectives."
"The 2024+ Remuneration Sys-
tem will also be effective as of 1 January 2024 with 
respect to members of the Managing Board already 
appointed as at the date on which the Annual General 
Meeting approves the remuneration system."
"In future, 
the two target categories, Group Performance and 
Sustainable Strategy Targets, will have equal weighting 
in the annual bonus."
"By reducing the individ-
ual targets from up to six targets in the previous remu-
neration system to one target, complexity is signifi-
cantly 
reduced 
and 
the 
harmonisation 
and 
comparability of objectives within the Managing Board 
is increased."
"In future, the long-term bonus will be allocated entirely 
equity-based in the form of performance share units 
(PSUs)."
"By dispensing with the previous separation into 
a management and a capital market component, the 
intention is to significantly reduce the complexity of the 
long-term bonus."
"In addition, the duration of the long-
term bonus will be harmonised to four years, strength-
ening the long-term focus of variable remuneration."
"To 
incentivise the achievement of Heidelberg Materials’ 
ambitious sustainability targets, a strategy-derived 
and measurable ESG target will also be anchored in the 
long-term bonus."
"In future, target achievement for the 
long-term bonus will be determined on the basis of the 
equally weighted performance criteria EBIT, ROIC, rel-
ative TSR, and ESG targets."
"The relative TSR will no 
longer be measured against the DAX and MSCI World 
Construction Materials Index, but against a peer group 
of competitors:

Furthermore, the defined maximum remuneration is 
concretised in accordance with section 87a(1)(2)(1) of 
the AktG."
"In future, the maximum remuneration for the 
Chairman of the Managing Board will be €11 million, and 
that of the regular members of the Managing Board will 
be €6 million."
"For regular members of the Managing 
Board whose remuneration is defined in US dollars, the 
maximum remuneration to avoid risks arising from ex-
change rate fluctuations is US$6.5 million."
"In addition, as part of the share ownership aspect of 
the 2024+ Remuneration System, the members of the 
Managing Board will in future be obliged to invest a 
fixed amount in euros in Heidelberg Materials shares 
corresponding to a fixed percentage of their respective 
fixed annual salary."
"The move away from the previous 
rule requiring a fixed number of shares to be held serves 
the purpose of increasing the comparability of share 
ownership."
"The future share ownership figure has been 
determined in accordance with German market prac-
tice and will amount to 180% of fixed annual salary for 
the Chairman of the Managing Board and 100% for 
regular members of the Managing Board."
"To further increase consistency with current market 
practice, the option of granting a transitional allow-
ance in the event of a member of the Managing Board 
leaving the company’s service will be removed."
"In ad-
dition, the existing clawback rule will be extended to 
include the option of reclaiming variable remuneration 
components in the event of materially incorrect consol-
idated annual financial statements (performance claw-
back)."
"The adjusted 
­
remuneration system of the Supervisory Board of 
Heidelberg Materials AG was approved by the Annual 
General Meeting in 2023."
"The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is set out in 
section 12 of the Articles of Association of Heidelberg 
Materials AG."
"It consists of fixed amounts and attend-
ance fees."
"Each member receives a fixed remuneration 
of €80,000, the Chairman receives two and a half 
times and his deputy one and a half times the amount."
"The members of the Audit Committee additionally re-
ceive a fixed remuneration of €25,000 and the mem-
bers of the Personnel Committee €20,000."
"The chair-
person of the committees receives twice these 
respective amounts."
"In addition, an attendance fee of €2,000 is paid for 
each personal participation in a meeting of the Super-
visory Board and its committees, irrespective of the 
form in which it is carried out."
"For multiple meetings 
that take place on the same day or on subsequent 
days, the attendance fee is paid only once."

board are also responsible for such internal control as 
they determine is necessary to enable the preparation

"Auditor’s Responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remu-
neration report, including the related disclosures, 
based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in accord-
ance with German generally accepted standards for 
the audit of financial statements promulgated by the 
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Audi-
tors in Germany) (IDW)."
"Those standards require that 
we comply with ethical requirements and plan and per-
form the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the remuneration report, including the related 
disclosures, is free from material misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain au-
dit evidence about the amounts including the related 
disclosures stated in the remuneration report."
"The pro-
cedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment."
"This includes the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the remuneration report including the 
related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error."
"In making those risk assessments, the auditor consid-
ers internal control relevant to the preparation of the 
remuneration report including the related disclosures."
"The objective of this is to plan and perform audit pro-
cedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company's internal control."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion."
"Audit Opinion 
In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the 
remuneration report for the financial year from Janu-
ary 1 to December 31, 2023, including the related dis-
closures, complies in all material respects with the ac-
counting provisions of § 162 AktG."

A supplier can only receive a green ESG rating if it offers full transparency in answering ESG questions and if the assessment by IntegrityNext does not reveal any significant risks.
The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner’s report.
"Our engagement in context to 
the selected ESG indicators relates solely to the disclo-
sures denoted with the symbols “○” and “○ ●”."
"Not subject to our assurance engagement are the ex-
ternal sources of documentation or expert opinions 
mentioned in the Combined Non-financial Statement, 
which are marked as unassured and the disclosures de-
noted with “●” and “● ●”."
"This responsibility includes the selection and applica-
tion of appropriate non-financial and sustainability re-
porting methods and making assumptions and esti-
mates about individual non-financial and sustainability 
disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the 
circumstances."
"Furthermore, the executive directors 
are responsible for such internal control as the execu-
tive directors consider necessary to enable the prepa-
ration of the Annual report that is free from material 
misstatement whether due to fraud (manipulation of 
the Annual report) or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts 
issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are 
still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties 
and for which clarifications have not yet been published 
in every case."
"Therefore, the executive directors have 
disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Reg-
ulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in 
section “Information according to the EU-Taxonomy 
Regulation”  of the Combined Non-financial Statement."
"They are responsible for the defensibility of this inter-

ments other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information, issued by the IAASB."
"In a limited assurance engagement the procedures 
performed are less extensive than in a reasonable as-
surance engagement, and accordingly a substantially 
lower level of assurance is obtained."
"The selection of 
the assurance procedures is subject to the profession-
al judgement of the assurance practitioner."
"Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms 
may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of 
their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance en-
gagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"We do not express an assurance opinion on the exter-
nal sources of documentation or expert opinions men-
tioned in the Combined Non-financial Statement or the

"Energy & CO2 reporting
Heidelberg Materials applies the GCCA’s “Sustainability 
Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 
emissions from cement manufacturing” (Oct."
"2019) as 
the basis of the energy and CO2 reporting."
"The guide-
line is based on the CEN Standard EN 19694-3."
"For direct CO2 emissions (Scope 1) for the cement 
­
business line, process emissions as well as fuel-related 
emissions are considered."
"In accordance with the 
GCCA guidelines, all alternative fuels are considered 
carbon-neutral."
"For our aggregates business line we 
report our Scope 1 emissions based on the fuel con-
sumptions on site and apply appropriate emission fac-
tors to derive the associated CO2 emissions."
"We report 
separately the emissions generated by transporting 
raw materials and products in our own vehicles."
"For the 2023 financial year, we also report the 
emissions resulting from the electricity mix actually 
purchased using the market-based method for the first 
time, drawing on 59% primary and 41% secondary data 
for the cement business line."
"For the other indirect emissions (Scope 3) we report in 
alignment with the recommendations of the GCCA and 
Cement Sector Scope 3 GHG Accounting and Report-
ing Guidance about the four most material categories 
(purchased materials, fuels, up- and downstream 
transportation, and distribution)."
"Emissions of pur-
chased materials are based on the volumes of main 
raw materials we procure externally and cover our 
­
cement and aggregates business lines."
"We apply 
­
emission factors from the GCCA EPD tool (based on 
Heidelberg Materials 2023 368
Additional information
About our sustainability reporting
EcoInvent)."
"Emissions of purchased fuels are reported 
for the cement and aggregates business lines and are 
calculated with the latest DEFRA well-to-tank factors 
(UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Compa-
ny Reporting 2023)."
"Upstream and downstream trans-
port and distribution information is collected annually 
for all of our activities."
"We derive the overall CO2 emis-
sions by using transported volumes and – if neces-
sary  – estimations of distances travelled as well as 
emission factors from the GCCA EPD tool."
"We want to further increase transparency with regard 
to the various Scope 3 categories."
"For this reason, we 
report on Scope 3 Category 10 (Processing of sold 
products) for the first time for the 2023 financial year."
"The methodology used is based on default values in 
accordance with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidelines."
"We take into account the non-final end products sold 
and apply the standard emission factor to determine 
the total emissions for further processing."
"Also for the 
first time, we report on Scope 3 Category 15 (Invest-
ments)."
"Here we disclose the Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
of our joint ventures in the cement business line."
"We use 
the GCCA CO2 protocol for this and take into account 
Heidelberg Materials’ share of investments."
"Alternative raw materials and fuels
We apply the “GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for 
co-processing fuels and raw materials in cement man-
ufacturing” (Oct."
"2019) to calculate the required per­
formance indicators on alternative raw materials and 
fuels used in the production of cement and clinker."
"Air pollutants
Our reporting of air pollutants is based on the “GCCA 
Sustainability Guidelines for the monitoring and re­
porting of emissions from cement manufacturing” 
(Oct."
"As outlined in the figures on measurement 
of emissions, most data is based on actual measure-
ments."
"Only if no measurements are available, we use 
estimates, for example from past analysis."
"Water
Water reporting for our cement business line is based 
on the “GCCA Sustainability Guidelines for the monitor-
ing and reporting of water in cement manufacturing” 
(Oct."
"2019), which is also aligned with the GRI require-
ments for reporting on water withdrawal (GRI 303-3) 
and water discharge (GRI 303-4)."
"The same method is 
applied for our aggregates business line."
"Specific water 
consumption per revenue is €3.67 per litre."
"The majority of water discharged is subject to primary 
treatment."
"This is because water extracted for quarry 
dewatering and extraction purposes generally does 
not require subsequent treatment as it only contains 
natural mineral components."
"The water used to wash 
and clean the aggregates is often reused in closed 
loops, recycled, or added to the final concrete product."
"Wastewater generated during production processes is 
initially treated on site, so that regular water sampling 
can be used to demonstrate that primary treatment is 
sufficient."
"Waste
In accordance with the requirements of GRI Standard 
306, we report on generated waste and secondary ma-
terials used for the cement and aggregates business 
lines."
"Waste is any material or object that the owner 
discards, intends to discard, or is required to discard."
"In the case of “generated waste”, a distinction is made 
between hazardous and non-hazardous waste, with 
further categorisation according to the type of dispos-
al or recycling."
"Secondary materials and by-products 
are production residues that are not waste."
"Consider-
ation is given to materials produced in-house and re-
ceived from external suppliers for backfilling, reuse, or 
use as an alternative fuel or raw material."
"Biodiversity 
We report on the proportion of our quarries located 
near an area of high biodiversity value with a biodiver-
sity management plan as well as those with an after-­
use plan."
"The reporting is based on the “GCCA Sus­
tainability Guidelines for Quarry Rehabilitation and 
Biodiversity Management” (May 2020)."
"Sustainable revenue
We have developed our own definition to determine the 
sustainable share of revenue."
"Cement: CO2 reduction of at least 30% compared with 
the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA) 
global reference value for CEM I from 2020."
"This trans-
lates into a gross threshold of ≤552 kg CO2/t for 
­

"We continuously work on further developing our sus-
tainable products."
"Products that we categorise as sus-
tainable do not necessarily meet the definitions of the 
EU taxonomy."
"Health and safety
Our disclosed information on occupational health and 
safety (H&S) is based on the “GCCA Sustainability 
Guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of safety 
in cement and concrete manufacturing” (Feb."
"­
Accident data is collected using a commercial H&S 
management software from Intelex."
"Each accident is 
recorded and analysed by the designated safety inves-
tigators and approvers following the mandatory work-
flow defined in the software."
"Statistical accident data 
is extracted by the software based on raw data and 
linked with working hours reported by controllers."
"Compliance
E-learning completion rates are calculated using data 
retrieved from the global Learning Management Sys-
tem."
"The system contains information for the different 
e-learning programmes about the people to whom the 
courses were assigned, when they completed these 
courses or if they are still due for completion or already 
overdue, and if completion happened within the set 
deadline."
"Administrators of the Learning Management 
System can use reports to follow up on the numbers 
and calculate ratios."
"Compliance incident statistics are based on data from 
our Case Management System where all reported 
­
compliance cases are documented on a global basis."
"This includes cases reported via our SpeakUp whistle-­
blower system and incidents reported through other 
channels such as e.g."
"emails, phone calls, or letters."
"The case managers ensure that each case is docu-
mented, including data that can be used for statistical 
analysis."
"Such statistical data includes the date of re-
porting, the country of origin, the incident type, the 
outcome of the investigation (substantiated or unsub-
stantiated), and information on whether sanctions 
and/or preventive measures were implemented."
"The 
Case Management System enables generating reports 
to analyse the statistical data."
"Employees
The total employees represent the number of full-time 
equivalent (FTE) employees on the payroll at the end of 
the reporting period."
"People who work part-time are 
counted partly with the respective percentage."
"All per-
manent positions plus temporary positions are includ-
ed and both white-collar and blue-collar employees."

Associations, initiatives, and networks
The following is a selection of our activities."
"We have 
singled out memberships and engagements that we 
consider to be of central strategic importance for the 
company as a whole, since they address current and 
future transformation activities in a significant way."
"BirdLife International: Since 2011, we have been work-
ing together with the largest international nature con-
servation organisation, BirdLife International."
"It is a member of the Federation 
of German Industries (BDI)."
"The GCCA published the first global net-­
zero roadmap in the industrial sector, thus helping to 
limit global warming to 1.5°C.
 
www.gccassociation.org
Global CCS Institute: The mission of the Global CCS 
Institute (GCCSI) is to facilitate and accelerate the 
­
deployment of CCS worldwide."
"The GCCSI shares ex-
pertise and offers advice and support to help this im-
portant technology play its part in reducing green-
house gas emissions."
"The initiative focuses on 
areas that require cross-industry collaboration, such 
as the demand for carbon-reduced products."
"The CAC 
is co-led by the World Economic Forum and the GCCA."
"www.missionpossiblepartnership.org
Race to Zero: Heidelberg Materials is a signatory to 
Business Ambition for 1.5°C, a global initiative commit-
ted to reducing CO₂ emissions to net zero by 2050 at 
the latest."
"As a member 
of this network, we develop cross-sectoral approaches 
and policy concepts for a successful industrial trans-
formation towards climate neutrality."
"The goal 
here is to jointly develop certification systems for sus-
tainable construction and to make the design, con-
struction, and operation of buildings more sustainable."
"We want 
to achieve specific net CO2 emissions of 400 kg per tonne of 
­
cementitious material by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 
at the latest."
"Overall responsibility for achieving this target lies 
with the Managing Board and in particular with the Chief Sustain-
ability Officer."
"We give careful consideration to the risks and opportunities of 
climate change for our industry."
"We see a key role for the cement 
industry in the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient 
global economy: our building materials enable the construction 
of robust infrastructure protected against the physical effects 
of climate change."
"The urbanisation trend and growing world 
population are also likely to increase the demand for cement 
and concrete."
"We therefore expect greater demand for sustain-
able products and are reviewing our entire product portfolio 
accordingly."
"Heidelberg Materials’ target is to achieve net-zero emissions 
by 2050 at the latest."
"By 2030, half of the Group revenue is to 
be generated with sustainable products."
"We also consider it 
our responsibility to actively convince customers of the quality 
of CO2-reduced products."
"Weather-related dependencies, the design of regulatory frame-
works with regard to carbon pricing, and market risks arising 
from shifting consumer preferences are some of the risks we see 
as relevant to our company."
"– Medium term (to 2030): The medium term is defined as 
the time horizon that goes beyond that of regular strategic 
planning, but for which a strategic roadmap exists."
"– Long term (from 2040): Long term refers to the time horizons 
that extend beyond the next ten years."
"In the climate scenari-
os, we look in particular at the 2040 and 2050 time horizons."
"Several potential risks have 
thus been identified that might significantly impact the compa-
ny in the medium and long term."
"These include physical as well 
as transition risks."
"The process of identifying risks is performed 
annually across the Group and combines bottom-up reporting at 
country level with a top-down global analysis of our physical risk 
exposure."
"At both levels, risks are assessed qualitatively and, 
wherever possible, supplemented with quantitative appraisals."
"As part of the regular risk management process, identified risks 
are monitored and possible risk avoidance and reduction meas-
ures are evaluated."
"All relevant information on CO2 emissions is recorded in an 
integrated reporting system on a monthly basis."
"We have 
established control mechanisms to verify that we are achieving 
our reduction targets for CO2 emissions."
"In our Sustainability 
Commitments 2030, climate protection is laid down as a crucial 
element of Heidelberg Materials’ sustainability strategy."
"The 
Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has validated ­
Heidelberg 
Materials’ 2030 carbon reduction targets under its 1.5°C frame-

Glossary
Composite cement
In composite cements, a proportion of the clinker is 
replaced with alternative raw materials, usually by-­
products from other industries, such as blast furnace 
slag or fly ash."
"Decreasing the proportion of energy-­
intensive clinker in cement is of critical importance for 
reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions as 
well as for preserving natural raw materials."
"Concrete
Building material that is manufactured by mixing 
­
cement, aggregates (gravel, sand or crushed stone) 
and water."
"CCUS
CCUS stands for the capture, utilisation, and storage 
of CO2."
"Direct separation
Direct separation technology is supposed to enable 
the capture of process-related CO2 without additional 
use of heat or any other commodity."
"A special reactor 
replaces the conventional calciner of the kiln system to 
separate the CO2 already during calcination."
"EMTN programme
An EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme repre-
sents a framework agreement made between the 
­
company and the banks appointed to be dealers."
"­
Heidelberg Materials has the option of issuing deben-
ture bonds up to a total volume of €10 billion under 
its EMTN programme."
"European Union Emissions Trading Scheme 
(EU ETS)
The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) 
obliges companies or operators of emission-intensive 
industrial facilities to participate in European emissions 
trading."
"These companies must purchase allowances 
for their CO2 emissions."
"Fly ash
Solid, particulate combustion residue from coal-fired 
power plants."
"Full-time equivalents (FTE)
Number of hours worked by all full-time and part-time 
employees divided by the working hours of a full-time 
employee."
"Grinding plant
A grinding plant is a cement production facility without 
clinker-burning process."
"Delivered clinker and selected 
additives, depending on the type of cement, are ground 
into cement."
"Grinding plants are particularly operated 
at locations where suitable raw material deposits for 
cement production are not available."
"Leverage ratio
Ratio of net debt to result from current operations 
­
before depreciation and amortisation (RCOBD)."
"Net debt
The sum of all non-current and current financial liabili-
ties minus cash and cash equivalents and short-term 
derivatives."
"Net-zero emissions
Reduction of our CO2 emissions across the value chain 
in line with SBTi's 1.5 °C pathway, while neutralising re-
sidual emissions."
"OxyCal technology
Clinker-burning technique in which only the static part 
of the kiln process is operated in Oxyfuel mode."
"OxyCal 
is often combined with amine technology to also cap-
ture the CO2 from the rotary kiln."
"In this way, up to 97% 
of the CO2 can be captured with a purity of 99%."
"Oxyfuel technology 
Clinker-burning technique in which pure oxygen is intro-
duced into the kiln instead  of air."
"This leads to a CO2 
content of up to 90% in the exhaust gases, which can 
be further upgraded to 99%."
"The aim is to capture the 
CO2 in a more energy-efficient way than by post-com-
bustion capture, as no additional heat is required."
"Ready-mixed concrete
Concrete that is manufactured in a ready-mixed con-
crete facility and transported to the building site using 
ready-mix trucks."
