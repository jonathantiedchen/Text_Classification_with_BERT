"We can 
look toward 2024 and 
the following years with 
great confidence.” 
CARSTEN KNOBEL 
CHAIR OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD
In 2023, we once again steered Henkel successfully through a year of many challenges."
"We were confronted 
with multiple crises, war and military conflicts, geopolitical tensions, as well as economic uncertainties, 
extraordinarily high inflation rates and persistent muted growth in many countries."
"I would like to thank all Henkel employees for their teamwork, resilience, and dedication which enabled us to 
navigate our company through these challenging times."
"We have made 2023 a pivotal year for our company 
in many ways."
"Together, as a strong global team, we managed to successfully drive our Purposeful Growth 
Agenda forward, delivered tangible progress across all our strategic priorities, and significantly exceeded the 
outlook made at the beginning of the year."
We promised and we delivered.
"The performance of our teams, 
guided by an inspiring purpose, shared values and a strong culture, makes me proud and very confident for 
our future."
"Over the last four years, since I took over as CEO, Henkel has changed fundamentally in many 
dimensions: structure, team, and culture."
I am glad to share with you the tangible results of these changes.
"While the last year was full of important achievements, exciting developments, and memorable moments, 
I would like to highlight three major projects which we executed successfully over the past year – and which 
have substantially advanced the transformation of Henkel."
"Firstly, the sale of our business in Russia was certainly an important step."
"In April 2022, just a few weeks after 
Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we took the decision to exit our activities in Russia."
"This was followed by a highly 
complex divestment process."
"In April 2023, we were finally able to sell our business in Russia to a consortium 
of local financial investors."
The agreed purchase price amounted to slightly above 600 million euros.
"With that, we have concluded our exit from Russia."
"This makes us one of the very few companies in our 
competitive environment which acted so boldly."
"I can assure you that the decision to exit a highly profitable 
business with around 2,500 employees, almost 20 sites and a sales volume of around one billion euros in 2022 
was tough."
"But we are convinced that we have taken the right decision, also in the interests of our shareholders, 
especially considering the ongoing war and its far-reaching consequences."
"With that chapter closed and 
behind us, we are looking to the future and focusing on our growth agenda."
"The second major achievement I would like to comment on in more detail was the merger of our two former 
consumer businesses, Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care, to create our new Consumer Brands business 
unit."
"By bringing our consumer brands across all categories under a single roof, including iconic brands such 
as Persil or Schwarzkopf, as well as our successful hair salon business, we have established a multi-category 
platform to enable dynamic growth."
"In January 2023, we went “live” with our new business unit."
"At the same time, we have made much faster progress with the first phase of the integration process 
than originally planned."
This is reflected in the savings we have realized in 2023.
"More than 80 percent of 
the targeted savings of around 250 million euros by the end of 2024 had already been achieved by the end 
of 2023."
"This means that the first phase of the integration process has been almost completed, well ahead 
of time."
"A great accomplishment by our teams in Consumer Brands, especially the leadership team around 
Wolfgang König, who heads the Consumer Brands business, and all the Henkel colleagues contributing to 
this success."
"The next phase of integration, which will focus on optimizing the supply chain network in the Consumer Brands 
business, has also been launched."
"In addition, the so-called “1-1-1 principle” has already been introduced in 
initial countries."
"In line with the principle of “one face to the customer,” this means: one order, one delivery, 
one invoice."
"At the same time, we have invested in our businesses to further strengthen our brands and innovation, for 
example by significantly increasing marketing and sales investments, to fuel future growth and further improve 
profitability of the business."
"In our combined Consumer Brands business, we are focusing on brands and businesses with a strong gross 
margin, and actively managing our portfolio – even if this might temporarily impact our volume."
"In addition, 
we are benefiting from more efficient structures in the merged business."
"These free up funds to invest in our 
brands, in innovation, sustainability and digitalization, enabling us to create new momentum for profitable 
growth in the future."
"Changing a long-standing structure with two separate consumer business units, introducing a new leadership, 
and a fundamentally revised strategic direction for the integrated business required courage and confidence 
in our abilities and teams."
"But looking back at 2023, it is evident that it was the right step, and I am very proud 
of how we have successfully implemented this highly complex and demanding project."
"Going forward, we are 
committed to fully capturing the potential for a substantially improved growth and margin profile in our 
Consumer Brands business."
"Under the leadership of Mark Dorn, who took over responsibility for this business at the beginning of 2023, 
we made several changes at the top management level in the business unit, promoting a more diverse 
and international composition."
"At the same time, we optimized the organizational set-up to further enhance 
our customer and market proximity."
"The new structure comprises three business areas: Mobility & Electronics, 
Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Consumer, Craftsmen & Professional."
"It was established in the course of 
2023 and is already fully reflected in our reporting."
"The new set-up is based on three central criteria: industry segments, technologies, and leveraging our scale."
We carefully analyzed our different markets and the customers we serve.
"In the new organizational structure, 
we are combining our industry knowledge and our go-to-market models, which allows us to better serve our 
customers from more than 800 industry segments."
"With the new organizational structure, we also want to 
make better use of our unique technological expertise and capabilities."
"And finally, we want to capture synergies across the entire organization through even greater leverage."
"We 
are continuously evolving our manufacturing footprint to ensure an even more efficient and resilient production 
set-up."
"In addition, we are investing in our business."
"In June, for example, we celebrated the groundbreaking 
of a new site in the Asia-Pacific region as part of our global production network."
"And in India, we opened a 
new R&D services hub for our Adhesives business."
"While global industrial demand was under pressure in 2023, the Adhesive Technologies business unit ended 
the year with strong organic sales and a significantly improved adjusted EBIT margin, which clearly underpins 
the resilience and strength of this dynamic business."
"Group 
sales amounted to 21,514 million euros in fiscal 2023."
"This corresponds to very strong organic sales growth 
of 4.2 percent, driven by both Adhesive Technologies and Consumer Brands."
"Even more importantly, we made very good progress in restoring our profitability."
"Adjusted1 operating profit 
(adjusted EBIT) increased by 10.2 percent to 2,556 million euros."
"At 11.9 percent, adjusted1 return on sales 
(adjusted EBIT margin) was significantly higher than in the previous year."
"This improvement was supported 
by strong pricing to further compensate for the elevated input costs."
"The savings from the Consumer Brands 
merger and continued portfolio measures also contributed substantially to this positive development."
"Adjusted1 
earnings per share (EPS) rose by 20.0 percent at constant exchange rates."
"At the same time, we put a strong emphasis on investing in growth, for example by stepping up marketing 
activities in the consumer business to further strengthen brand equity, and by promoting strong innovations 
in both business units."
"Looking more closely at the performance of our business units, sales of Adhesive Technologies amounted to 
10,790 million euros, reflecting strong organic sales growth of 3.2 percent."
"This was driven by very strong 
pricing."
"Volumes declined overall, in particular due to continued subdued demand in some key end markets."
"In the course of the year we saw sequential volume development improvement, turning again into positive 
development in the fourth quarter."
"Adjusted return on sales increased by 110 basis points compared to the 
previous year and reached 14.7 percent."
"The significant increase was achieved primarily through price increases, 
as well as measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency in order to continue to compensate for still high 
material prices."
"Our Consumer Brands unit reached 10,565 million euros in sales and delivered very strong organic sales growth 
of 6.1 percent."
"This development was driven by a double-digit price increase, while volumes declined, also 
due to continued portfolio optimization measures."
"However, volume development showed a clear sequential 
improvement in the second half of the year."
"Adjusted return on sales reached 10.6 percent, an increase of 
220 basis points compared to the previous year."
"1 Adjusted for one-time expenses and income, and for restructuring expenses."

In 2023, we also successfully completed Henkel’s first share buyback program."
"By the end of March, we had 
bought back shares amounting in total to around 1 billion euros."
"Free cash flow in 2023 was significantly higher than in the previous year and amounted to 2,603 million euros 
(2022: 653 million euros), reaching the highest level to date."
"Our net financial position also improved 
significantly, amounting to 12 million euros at the end of 2023 compared to -1,267 million euros at the end 
of 2022."
"At the Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2024, we will propose a stable dividend of 1.85 euros per preferred 
share and 1.83 euros per ordinary share to our shareholders."
"This represents a payout ratio of 42.4 percent 
and is thus slightly above our target range of 30 to 40 percent of adjusted net income after non-controlling 
interests."
"Consistently pursuing our Purposeful Growth Agenda 
We are shaping our future based on our purpose, our values, and our strategic agenda for purposeful growth."
"Despite the difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical environment in 2023, we continued to consistently 
implement our growth agenda across all strategic dimensions."
"As part of our active portfolio management, we divested or discontinued in our Consumer Brands business 
brands and activities representing total sales of around 650 million euros following announcement of the 
merger in early 2022."
"For example, we divested our North American air freshener business in 2023."
"At the 
same time, we strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of the sustainable laundry and home care 
brand Earthwise in New Zealand."
"In the Adhesive Technologies business unit, we expanded our portfolio in 
the area of maintenance, repair and overhaul with the acquisition of Critica Infrastructure, a specialized 
provider of innovative fiber-composite solutions for repairs in a wide range of industrial applications."
"With 
this transaction, we have added an attractive adjacent business to our adhesives portfolio and created a 
platform for further growth."
"In 2023, we also made progress in the area of innovation."
"Our Adhesive Technologies business opened, for 
example, a new innovation center in Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA, as well as a battery center at the Inspiration 
Center Düsseldorf (ICD), which is intended to intensify cooperation with automotive and battery manufacturers."
Our Consumer Brands business unit also strengthened its innovative power.
"For example, we opened a “J-Beauty 
Innovation Hub” for our hair salon business in Tokyo, Japan, the world’s second largest hair professional 
market, pooling the expertise of Schwarzkopf and the Shiseido Professional business acquired in 2022."
"Together 
with our existing Schwarzkopf Professional hubs, we have created a global ecosystem for our Hair Professional 
business across North America, Europe, and Asia."
"In our Adhesive Technologies business, we intro-
duced a new solution for bonding camera lenses in driver assistance systems."
"This enables fast and robust 
camera production in the automotive industry while ensuring greater safety in the next generation of autono-
mous vehicles."
We also further improved our adhesive solutions used in food packaging.
"The enhanced 
products allow manufacturers to switch to solvent-free adhesives, enabling more sustainable packaging."
"In our Consumer Brands business, we launched Persil Deep Clean in over 30 countries, introducing a new 
formula with innovative enzyme technology."
"It provides excellent stain removal, while at the same time pre-
venting unpleasant odors in the washing machine."
"We also relaunched our entire got2b styling portfolio 
with a new packaging design and improved sustainability with vegan formulas, natural ingredients and 
more sustainable packaging."
"These developments are also the result of close collaboration with our got2b 
co-creation community, which consists of a diverse group of “Gen Z” consumers from across Europe."
"According to data from numerous scientific institutions, 2023 was the warmest year on record, and the topic 
of climate change and its consequences took center-stage in public and political debate."
"At Henkel, climate 
protection is one important pillar of our “2030+ Sustainability Ambition Framework,” which we continued to 
embed in our business and across the entire value chain."
"A particular focus is to expand the use of renewable 
energies and to drive progress toward our ambition to achieve climate-positive operations by 2030."
"Henkel 
converted more than a dozen sites to CO2-neutral production in 2023."
"By the end of 2023, we were able to 
achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 51 percent per ton of product (compared to our reference year 2017)."
"In the Adhesive Technologies business unit, we have further evolved our assessment 
methodology to create transparency on the sustainability performance of our product portfolio."
"The results 
of this assessment, that have also been audited by an external third party, help us to develop a clear under-
standing about the specific contribution and performance of each of our products."
"In addition, this approach 
provides even more transparency for our customers and supports the transformation toward new solutions 
enabling emission reduction and circular economy."
"Our progress is also driven by expanding the proportion 
of recycled material in the plastic packaging of our consumer goods."
"Global initiatives and co-operation 
help us to drive innovations in packaging development even further."
"This is why we, for example, also entered 
into a partnership with the Circular Valley Foundation, which offers us the opportunity to get in touch with 
start-ups and scientists from all over the world and further expand our own local networks."
"At Henkel, we have also made significant progress in the 
area of digitalization."
"In our digital unit “Henkel dx,” we continued to optimize internal structures, strength-
ened the development of digital expertise and further promoted a culture of innovation."
"We have also 
deepened our strategic partnerships with globally leading digital companies such as SAP, Microsoft and 
Adobe."
These enable us to integrate cutting-edge technology into our digital platforms and projects.
"By 
accelerating digital innovations, our platform strategy and close collaboration between all business units 
and functions, we were able to further improve IT efficiency last year and create new business opportunities 
for Henkel, for example in the area of business-to-business marketplaces."
Strengthening our company culture is particularly important to me.
"To support employees in 
reflecting on their behavior and interaction with one another, we offer a range of learning formats such as 
the “Iceberg Learning Module.” At the same time, cultural change requires greater transparency regarding 
areas of manager development."
"We therefore guide our top managers through a 360-degree coaching process 
that helps them to create an inspiring and modern working environment as role models."
"To support our 
employees in accelerating our cultural transformation, we launched and successfully implemented the 
“Accelerate Cultural Transformation” (ACT) initiative across the entire global organization in 2023 with the 
aim of promoting a deeper dialog and connection within our teams."
"Establishing a strong and collaborative culture is deeply dependent on fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion 
(DEI)."
"We are convinced that a diverse workforce and an open and appreciative corporate culture are important 
success factors in a globalized world and provide the foundation for our competitive advantage."
"Our aim is 
to promote a culture of belonging and create equal opportunities in order to develop the full potential of 
our diversity."
"We have set ourselves the ambition to achieve gender parity across all management levels by 
2025."
"Today, around 39.5 percent of our management positions are held by women."
"To further increase diversity, we pursue a clearly defined strategy based on three key pillars: Firstly, we raise 
awareness of different diversity dimensions via various formats such as campaigns and events."
"Secondly, 
we strengthen inclusive behavior through training courses for managers and employees."
"And thirdly, we 
continuously improve structural framework conditions, such as work-life balance offerings, to remove 
structural barriers and define clear targets for monitoring our progress."
"Let me summarize the year 2023 as follows: We achieved or exceeded all our financial targets, consistently 
implemented our Purposeful Growth Agenda across all strategic dimensions and progressed the transformation 
of our company."
"In the year ahead of us, we expect a moderate growth of global GDP driven by a moderate increase in 
industrial demand, as well as customer demand in our active businesses."
"In fiscal 2024, we expect Henkel to 
generate organic sales growth of 2.0 to 4.0 percent and adjusted return on sales in the range of 12.0 to 
13.5 percent."
"For adjusted earnings per preferred share (EPS) at constant exchange rates, we expect a develop-
ment in the range of 5.0 to 20.0 percent."
"We would also 
like to express our gratitude to our Shareholders’ Committee and Supervisory Board for their valuable guid-
ance in navigating Henkel through this challenging year."
"We would also like to thank all our customers, consumers, and business partners for putting their trust in our 
brands and technologies."
"And finally, we want to express our sincere gratitude to you, our shareholders."
"We 
greatly value your continued confidence in our company."
I am firmly convinced that we are well on track and that we are pursuing the right strategy.
"We can look toward 
2024 and the following years with great confidence and are fully committed to delivering on our ambitions 
for the future."
"Although inflation has weakened, it continues to adversely affect economic 
performance and is slowing private demand."
"By the same token, the situation surrounding energy and raw 
material prices continues to pose a huge challenge."
"In addition, the ongoing war in Ukraine and the escalating 
conflict between Israel and Hamas pose risks for future global economic development."
"In this changeable and 
difficult environment, Henkel succeeded in delivering a good business performance overall."
"On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank all employees at Henkel for their dedicated com-
mitment and their contribution to the successful further development of our company over the past year."
"My thanks are equally due to the members of the Management Board who have steered the transformation 
of the company through a difficult market environment."
"I am also grateful to our employee representatives 
and works councils for their consistently constructive support in growing Henkel."
"Ongoing dialog with the Management Board 
We continued to diligently discharge in full our Supervisory Board duties in fiscal 2023 in accordance with the 
legal statutes, Articles of Association and rules of procedure governing our actions."
"This included consist-
ently monitoring the work of the Management Board, advising and supporting it in its stewardship and in 
the strategic development of the corporation, and discussing with it business matters of major importance."
"In doing so, we were able to ascertain that the Management Board’s performance of its duties was consistently 
legally and regulatory compliant, fit for purpose, and proper at all times."
"The Management Board and Supervisory Board continued to cooperate in 2023 through extensive dialog 
founded on mutual trust and confidence."
"The Management Board kept us regularly and extensively informed 
of all major issues affecting the corporation’s business and our Group companies with prompt written and 
oral reports."
We also discussed the risk situation and dealt with compliance and governance issues.
"Financial reports 
focused on the sales and earnings figures of the Henkel Group as a whole, with further analysis by business 
unit and region."
"We also regularly discussed the status of transformation of the Consumer Brands business 
unit."
"All members of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee consistently had sufficient opportunity 
to critically review and address the issues raised by each of these reports and associated explanations, and 
to provide their individual guidance."
"This procedure ensured that we were constantly aware of 
current business developments and significant events."
"Outside of meetings, we also regularly held confidential 
talks with the auditor to discuss audit-related topics and other important issues of relevance for the Supervisory 
Board’s work."
"Major outcomes of these talks were shared with the other members no later than by the next 
Supervisory Board or committee meeting."
"I reported on these talks in summary form to 
the Supervisory Board."
"There were no indications of conflicts of interest involving Management Board or Supervisory Board members 
that might have required immediate disclosure to the Supervisory Board and reporting to the Annual General 
Meeting."
"Members of the Supervisory Board take it upon themselves to seek the training needed to perform their 
duties; these efforts are appropriately supported by the company."
"The company again offered information 
and training events focusing on specific topics in the year under review."
"This included an explanation of the 
significance of and outlook for the IMEA (India, Middle East, Africa) region for Henkel and an in-depth 
discussion of digitalization and artificial intelligence."
"Supervisory Board meetings 
The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee held four regular meetings in the reporting year."
"Some 
members attended the meetings in person; others took part by video conference."
"A further special meeting 
of the Supervisory Board was held by video conference."
"The members of the Management Board participated in the meetings of the Supervisory Board unless it was 
deemed expedient for the Supervisory Board to discuss individual agenda items without the Management 
Board being present."
Discussions were also possible without the Management Board.
"In each of our meetings, we discussed the reports submitted by the Management Board, conferring with it 
on the development of the corporation and on strategic issues."
"We also discussed the overall economic situation 
and Henkel’s business performance."
"In an extraordinary meeting on January 23, 2023, we discussed the appointment of Mark Dorn to succeed 
Jan-Dirk Auris on the Management Board, and options for developing the Adhesive Technologies business unit."
"KGaA and the Group, together with the risk report, corporate governance report and separate combined 
non-financial statement for Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA and the Group, which was issued in the form of our 
Sustainability Report."
"We also approved the declaration of compliance for 2023, and examined how the 
discontinuation of our business activities in Russia and the transformation of the new Consumer Brands 
business unit were progressing."
"Our meeting on April 24, 2023, focused on the sale of our business activities in Russia and the associated 
impacts."
"We also discussed the performance of our business units in the first three months of the fiscal year, 
including volumes and margins and provisional expectations regarding future business development in a 
market environment that remains volatile."
"In our meeting on September 20, 2023, we focused both on the performance of our business units over the 
first eight months and on the progress achieved in implementing our strategic priorities in the business units."
"These discussions related particularly to the progress in the transformation and the mid-term goals of our 
Consumer Brands business unit, together with the continued development and innovations of Adhesive 
Technologies."
"We also examined issues relating to our corporate culture, the development of our employees 
and our sustainability progress."
"Our meeting on December 8, 2023 focused on the expected results for 2023 and our assets and financial 
planning for fiscal 2024."
"We also examined in detail the associated budgets of our business units based on 
comprehensive documentation."
Personnel development and our most recent transactions were also discussed.
"Committees of the Supervisory Board 
In order to enable us to efficiently comply with the duties incumbent upon us according to legal statute 
and our Articles of Association, we have established an Audit Committee and a Nominations Committee."
"Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke as Chair of the Audit Committee in the reporting year until April 24, 2023,

"KGaA and the Group, which is compiled as a separate non-financial report, and of the remuneration report 
compiled in accordance with Section 162 AktG."
"Both reports will be made available in the public domain 
through publication on our website."
"The four meetings held by the Audit Committee in the year under review were a mixture of personal attendance 
and video conference."
"In the run-up to each meeting, the Chair of the Audit Committee held confidential talks

their duties and the required independence of their membership were duly confirmed."
"Corporate governance and declaration of compliance 
The Supervisory Board again dealt with questions of corporate governance in the reporting year."
"The work and 
remuneration of our committees was a particular area of focus."
"Given the importance of ESG issues for 
the company and the future sustainability reporting requirements, the Supervisory Board plans to establish a 
Sustainability Committee to oversee the Management Board’s sustainability strategy and ongoing development, 
and also ESG reporting procedures."
"Accordingly, the remuneration policy needs to be revised to include 
remuneration for the members of this Sustainability Committee."
"In light of the increased requirements, it is 
also intended that the activities of the members of the Nominations Committee will be remunerated."
"A 
corresponding proposal to revise the remuneration policy in the Articles of Association will be submitted to 
the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"Further details of Henkel’s corporate governance can be found in the 
corporate governance statement (pages 52 to 92 of this Annual Report), with which we fully acquiesce."
"At our meeting on February 27, 2024, we discussed and approved the joint declaration of compliance for 
2024 to be submitted by the Management Board, Shareholders’ Committee and Supervisory Board, as specified 
in the GCGC."
"The full wording of the current and previous declarations of compliance can be accessed 
through the company website."
"The current declaration of compliance is also reflected in the corporate 
governance statement."
"Individual meeting attendance  
Members’ participation in the meetings of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee was 95 percent 
overall."
"excluding attendance at the Audit Committee’s meeting to discuss the annual  
financial statements by members of the Supervisory Board who are not members of the Audit Committee."

by the Management Board in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as endorsed 
by the EU, and in accordance with the supplementary German statutory provisions pursuant to Section 315e (1)

"Separate non-financial report 
PwC also reviewed the separate, combined non-financial report for Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA and the Group 
for fiscal 2023 as compiled by the Management Board to ensure its content included the disclosures required 
by law."
"Based on its review and the evidence obtained, the auditor is not aware of any circumstances that might 
prompt it to believe that the disclosures in the separate, combined non-financial report for Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA and the Group for fiscal 2023 have not been prepared in compliance with all material aspects of 
commercial law provisions."
"We reviewed these documents and discussed them at our meeting on February 27, 2024, in the 
presence of the auditor, which reported on its main audit findings."
We received and approved the audit reports.
"Having received the final results of the review conducted by the Audit Committee and concluded our own 
examination, we see no reason for objection to the aforementioned documents."
"We confirm the results of 
PwC’s audits."
"The assessment by the Management Board of the position of the company and the Group 
coincides with our own appraisal."
"Additionally, we discussed and approved the proposal by the Management Board to pay out of the unappro-
priated profit of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA a dividend of 1.83 euros per ordinary share and of 1.85 euros per 
preferred share, and to carry the remainder and the amount attributable to the treasury shares held by the 
company at the time of the Annual General Meeting forward to the following year."
"This proposal takes 
into account the financial and earnings position of the corporation, its medium-term financial and investment 
planning, and the interests of our shareholders."
"We also approved our proposals for resolution at the Annual General Meeting at our meeting on February 
27, 2024."

"OUR 
PURPOSE
Pioneers at heart for the good 
of generations."
"OUR 
VISION
Win the 20s by outperforming 
the markets through innovative 
and sustainable solutions."
"OUR
VALUES
We put our customers and consumers at the center of what we do."
"We value, challenge and reward our people."
We drive excellent sustainable financial performance.
We are committed to leadership in sustainability.
"We shape our future with a strong entrepreneurial spirit based on 
our family business tradition."
Our strategic framework has a clear focus on purposeful growth.
"This means, we aim to create superior value 
for customers and consumers to outgrow our markets, to strengthen our leadership in sustainability, and to 
enable our employees to grow both professionally and personally at Henkel."
"The key elements of our strategic framework are a winning portfolio, clear competitive edge in the areas of 
innovation, sustainability and digitalization, and future-ready operating models – underpinned by a strong 
foundation of a collaborative culture and empowered people."
"After getting off to a weaker start than the market as a whole, Henkel shares subse-
quently experienced a very positive upturn due particularly to good operating results in the first quarter, and 
also to the successful disposal of our business activities in Russia."
"As analysts raised their share price expec-
tations, the prices of both ordinary and preferred shares reached their highest levels for the year in May."
"As a result, our ordinary shares recorded their lowest price level for the year in October, while 
the preferred share prices were only just above the level recorded at the start of the year."
"Year-end then saw 
a marked recovery in Henkel share prices in a market environment that was positive overall."
"The substantial 
increase was bolstered by Henkel raising its sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2023 in November."
"Henkel preferred shares closed the year at 72.86 euros, up 12.1 percent year on year."
"The ordinary shares 
closed the year up 7.9 percent at 64.98 euros."
"Assuming reinvestment of the dividend (before tax deduction) 
in the shares at the time of payment, the preferred shares generated a total return of 14.8 percent, and the 
ordinary shares 10.7 percent."
"Henkel preferred shares therefore underperformed the DAX but outperformed 
the STOXX® Europe 600, which gained 20.3 percent and 12.7 percent respectively over the course of the 
year."
"Henkel preferred shares traded at an average premium of 10.5 percent over the ordinary shares in 
2023."
"Year on year, the trading volume (Xetra) of preferred shares decreased significantly in 2023, this being 
partly due to the share buyback program from February 15, 2022 to March 31, 2023.1 Each trading day saw 
an average of around 434,000 preferred shares changing hands (2022: 664,000)."
"1 Further details of treasury shareholdings and the share buyback program can be found in the section “Treasury shares” in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"2 Proposal to shareholders for the Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2024."
"3 Based on all outstanding shares, i.e."
number of shares issued less treasury stock.
Henkel shares still represent a good investment for investors with a very long-term horizon.
"Shareholders 
who invested the equivalent of 1,000 euros when Henkel preferred shares were issued in 1985, and reinvested 
the dividends received (before tax deduction) in the stock, had a portfolio value of 28,079 euros at the end 
of 2023."
"This represents an increase in value of 2,708 percent or an average return of 9.1 percent per year."
"Over the same period, the DAX provided an annual return of 7.3 percent."

Henkel is also listed on all regional stock exchanges in Germany.
"In the USA, investors are able 
to invest in Henkel preferred and ordinary shares by way of stock ownership certificates obtained through 
the Sponsored Level I ADR (American Depositary Receipt) program."
One share is equivalent to four ADRs.
"Following a strong increase in the previous year, the number of ADRs outstanding for ordinary and preferred 
shares decreased to 34.7 million at year-end (2022: 38.0 million)."

"Particularly 
noteworthy in this respect are the STOXX® Europe 600, MSCI World and FTSE World Europe indices."
"Henkel’s 
inclusion in the Dow Jones Titans 30 Personal & Household Goods Index also makes it one of the most important 
corporations in the personal and household goods sector worldwide."
"As a DAX stock, Henkel is one of the 
40 most significant exchange-listed companies in Germany."
"The weighting of Henkel preferred shares in the DAX 
increased slightly to 1.01 percent (2022: 0.92 percent)."
"Once again, our advances in sustainable management earned recognition from external experts in 2023."
"Our 
performance with respect to non-financial indicators (environmental, social and governance themes) was 
reflected in regular positive assessments by various national and international rating agencies, from which – 
among other things – sustainability indices are derived."
Henkel has been represented in the ethics index FTSE4Good since 2001.
"Henkel is, moreover, one of only 
50 corporations worldwide to be included in the renowned Global Challenges Index of particularly sustainable 
companies that make substantial contributions to overcoming major global challenges, such as climate change."
"We have 
received no other notices indicating that a shareholder holds more than 3 percent of the voting rights 
(notifiable ownership)."
"As of December 31, 2023, moreover, Henkel held 3.3 million ordinary shares as treasury 
stock, equivalent to 1.27 percent of all ordinary shares (2022: 1.12 percent)."
"Apart from the treasury shares held, which amount to 8.61 percent of the preferred shares (2022: 7.27 percent), 
they are entirely in free float."
"A large majority are owned by institutional investors whose portfolios are, in 
most cases, broadly distributed internationally."
"As of December 31, 2023, treasury stock amounted to 15.3 million 
preferred shares."
"In 2023 again, Henkel added 33 eurocents for each euro invested by an employee (limited to 4 percent 
of salary up to a maximum of 4,992 euros per year)."
"Around 13,000 employees in 59 countries purchased 
Henkel preferred shares under this program in 2023."
"At year-end, some 17,000 employees held a total of 
around 3.2 million shares in the ESP securities accounts, representing 1.8 percent of total preferred shares 
outstanding."
The lock-up period for newly acquired ESP shares is three years.
"Investing in Henkel shares through long-term participation in our ESP has proven to be beneficial for our 
employees in the past."
"Henkel bonds 
At the end of fiscal 2023, six Henkel bonds were outstanding with a total volume of around 1.9 billion euros 
and maturities ranging between 2025 and 2032."
"In April 2023, Henkel redeemed the 330 million Swiss franc 
bond issued in April 2020."
"The Sustainable Finance Framework established in October 2021 enables Henkel to issue two types of bonds 
on the capital market: bonds tied to sustainability criteria that are linked to the sustainability targets of 
Henkel, and “green bonds” that only fund selected sustainable projects."
"The 650 million euro bond issued in 
September 2022 with a term of five years is tied to the achievement of certain sustainability targets by 
year-end 2025 relating to the sustainability of our packaging and to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
"Failure to meet the sustainability targets at the relevant audit points will incur an interest rate premium that 
raises the cost of funding the outstanding three bonds linked to those criteria."
"The issuance proceeds will 
be used for general corporate purposes, including the refunding of maturing bonds."
"Also linked to sustainability targets is the bond privately placed in July 
2020 aligned to the reduction of plastic waste – implemented by Henkel as the world’s first-ever company 
to follow this route."
"The issue consisted of two tranches – 70 million US dollars and 25 million euros – 
with a term of five years."

The company is the sole shareholder of Henkel Management AG.
"The rights and duties of the supervisory board of a KGaA are more limited compared to those of the super-
visory board of an AG."
"Specifically, the supervisory board of a KGaA is not authorized to appoint personally 
liable partners, preside over the partners’ contractual arrangements, impose procedural rules on the manage-
ment board, or rule on business transactions."
"These duties are performed for the company by the Shareholders’ 
Committee and by the Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG respectively."
"A KGaA is not required to 
appoint a director of labor affairs, even if, like Henkel, the company is bound to abide by the German Code-
termination Act of 1976."
The general meeting of a KGaA essentially has the same rights as the shareholders’ meeting of an AG.
"For 
example, it votes on the appropriation of earnings, elects members of the supervisory board (shareholder 
representatives) and formally approves the supervisory board’s actions."
"It appoints the auditor and also 
votes on amendments to the articles of association and measures that change the company’s capital, which 
are implemented by the management board."
"According to our Articles of Association, in addition to the Supervisory Board, Henkel also has a standing 
Shareholders’ Committee comprising a minimum of five and a maximum of ten members, all of whom are 
elected by the Annual General Meeting (Art."
27 of the Articles of Association).
"The Shareholders’ Committee 
is required in particular to perform the following functions (Section 278 (2) AktG in conjunction with Sections 
114 and 161 HGB, and Art."
"8, 9 and 26 of the Articles of Association): 
 The Shareholders’ Committee acts in place of the Annual General Meeting in guiding the business activities 
of the company."
 It decides on the appointment and dismissal of the Personally Liable Partners.
" It holds both the power of representation and executive powers over the legal relationships prevailing 
between the company and Henkel Management AG, the Personally Liable Partner."
" It exercises the voting rights of the company in the Annual General Meeting of Henkel Management AG, 
thereby choosing its three-member Supervisory Board which, in turn, appoints and dismisses the members 
of the Management Board."
There were no changes in the Group management and supervisory structure in the year under review.

"The tasks and duties of an executive board in a German joint stock corporation (“AG”) are assigned to the

the business activities of the Company."
The Company is the sole shareholder of Henkel Management AG.
"It also issues the rules of procedure governing
the actions of Henkel Management AG."
"The Shareholders’ Committee is likewise responsible for exercising the Company’s voting rights at Annual 
General Meetings of Henkel Management AG."
"In so doing, it likewise appoints the members of the supervi-

a supervisory board of a non-Group listed company."
"Whether the number of mandates held by members 
of the management board who sit on the supervisory board remains appropriate is to be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis as a more reasonable approach, rather than by means of a rigid upper limit."
"
According to Recommendation G.10 GCGC, the amounts corresponding to the variable components of
remuneration awarded to the members of the Management Board should be predominantly invested by
them in company shares, or be awarded in appropriately share-based form."
"Long-term variable remuner-
ation awards to Management Board members should be subject to a four-year lock-up period."
"The lock-up period for the Henkel preferred shares expires in each case on December 31 of the fourth calen-
dar year following the remuneration year."
"This share deferral ensures that the members of the Management 
Board are required to accumulate a significant share portfolio during the rolling lock-up period, and that 
they participate in the long-term performance of the company, whether this be positive or negative."
"This 
share portfolio continues to grow due to the fact that shares are sold, if at all, only in exceptional instances 
once the respective lock-up period has expired."
The performance measurement period for the LTI was three years.
"The LTI is paid in cash once the Company’s 
annual financial statements for the final year in the performance measurement period have been approved 
by the General Meeting."
"As part of the efforts to modify the remuneration policy for Management Board members starting from 
fiscal 2023, variable remuneration will be largely share-based overall in future."
"This policy will be submitted 
to the Annual General Meeting 2023 for approval."
"Moreover, the aforementioned derogations do not apply 
to the LTI term, whose term is four years anyway."
"By the same token, if the recipient dies, LTI entitlements with 
regard to outstanding tranches are settled on the basis of budget figures and paid to the heirs."
"Suggestions of the Code 
Notwithstanding the aforementioned special features arising from its legal form, the company has adopted 
and will continue to adopt the discretionary suggestions of the GCGC 2019/2022."


Pioneers at heart for the good of generations."


Win the 20s by outperforming the markets through innovative and sustainable solutions."
"Our values:

We put our customers and consumers at the center of what we do."
"
We value, challenge and reward our people."
"
We drive excellent sustainable financial performance."
"
We are committed to leadership in sustainability."
"
We shape our future with a strong entrepreneurial spirit based on our family business tradition."
"The corporate bodies of Henkel and our employees worldwide are guided by this purpose, this vision, and these 
values."
They reaffirm our ambition to meet the highest ethical standards in everything we do.
"And they guide 
our employees in all the day-to-day decisions they make, providing a compass for their conduct and actions."
"Henkel is committed to ensuring that all business transactions are conducted in an ethically irreproachable, 
legal fashion."
"Consequently, Henkel expects all our employees not only to respect the company’s internal rules 
and all relevant laws, but also to avoid conflicts of interest, to protect Henkel’s assets and to respect the social 
values of the countries and cultural environments in which Henkel does business."
"The Management Board 
has therefore issued a series of Group-wide codes and standards with precepts that are binding worldwide."
"These regulatory instruments are not static, but are periodically reviewed and amended as appropriate, evolv-
ing in step with the changing legal and commercial conditions that affect Henkel as a globally active company."
The Code of Conduct supports our employees in ethical and legal issues.
"The Leadership Commitments 
define the principles of management conduct."
"The Code of Corporate Sustainability describes the principles 
that drive our sustainable, socially responsible approach to business."
"This code also enables Henkel to meet 
the commitments derived from the United Nations Global Compact."
"Key principles governing the internal control and risk management systems 
A responsible and appropriate approach to managing risks and opportunities is a central element of cor-
porate governance at Henkel."
"To enable us to identify and assess risks and opportunities early on, we have 
established coordinated risk management and internal control systems that are closely aligned to the nature 
and scope of the business activities and the risk situation of Henkel."
"Both systems feature operational 
components alongside the accounting-related elements."
"Sustainability aspects are also taken into account, 
whereby the internal control system related to sustainability is still being established."
"The aforementioned systems are supplemented by a compliance management system 
aligned to the risk situation of the company."
"Overall responsibility for ensuring effective control and risk 
management and compliance with laws and guidelines lies with the Management Board."
The three-lines model provides the organizational framework for these systems.
"The first line of defense is 
provided by those charged with managing business operations, who are responsible for identifying, assessing 
and managing the associated risks."
"The second line of defense relates to the specific governance of Henkel 
and is responsible for developing/improving and implementing the processes and systems for use by the 
first line."
"The Management Board and Supervisory Board each receive regular risk management, internal control 
system and compliance reports."
"The third line of defense is provided by the Corporate Audit function, 
which acts as an impartial oversight body and regularly reports to the Management Board and the Super-
visory Board’s Audit Committee on its audit findings."
"For financial reporting, the three lines of defense are 
supplemented by the activities of the external auditor."

"It is subject to continuous development 
and improvement."
"Policies that apply throughout the Group describe the material principles and objectives, 
as well as the structure, of the internal control system and the approach to examining the effectiveness of 
same."
"The design of the internal control system extends beyond just an internal accounting control system 
and includes control mechanisms for material operational and other business processes, such as procure-
ment, distribution, personnel management and – to a certain degree – supply chain."
"The key characteristics 
of our internal control and risk management systems relating to financial reporting and accounting pro-
cesses per Section 315 (4) HGB are described in our risks and opportunities report on pages 201 and 202."
"Compliance management 
Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations is an integral component of our operating models and busi-
ness processes."
"Henkel has established a Group-wide compliance organization with locally and regionally 
responsible compliance officers led by a globally responsible General Counsel & Chief Compliance Officer 
(CCO)."
"They report to the 
Corporate Compliance Office."
"The General Counsel & CCO reports regularly to the Management Board and 
to the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee and the Shareholders’ Committee on identified compliance 
violations."
"In addition, compliance issues and potential violations are also regular items on the agenda of 
other local corporate management bodies."
"The issue of compliance is moreover an integral part of the target agreements signed by all managerial staff 
of Henkel."
"Due to their position, it is particularly incumbent on them to set the right example for their subor-
dinates, to effectively communicate the compliance rules and to ensure through the implementation of 
suitable organizational measures that these are obeyed."
"The procedures to be followed in the event of complaints or suspicion of malpractice also constitute an 
important element of the compliance policy."
"Since we place great importance on identifying potential miscon-
duct and taking suitable action to prevent violations, all Henkel employees and stakeholders are required to 
report possible misconduct."
"In addition to our internal reporting system and complaint registration channels, 
a compliance hotline operated by an external service provider is available for the purpose of reporting sus-
picions of violations – anonymously, if preferred – to the Corporate Compliance Office."
"The Head of the 
Corporate Compliance Office is mandated to initiate the necessary follow-up procedures."
Our corporate compliance activities are focused on antitrust law and the fight against corruption.
"In our 
Code of Conduct, the corporate guidelines based upon it, and in other publications, the Management Board 
clearly expresses its rejection of all infringements of the principles of compliance, particularly antitrust viola-
tions and corruption."
We do not tolerate such violations in any way.
"For Henkel, bribery, anticompetitive 
agreements, or any other violations of laws are no way to initiate or conduct business."
A further compliance-relevant area relates to capital market law.
"Supplementing the legal provisions, internal 
codes of conduct have been put in place to regulate the treatment of issues and information that have the 
potential to materially affect share prices."
"The company has an Ad Hoc Committee comprised of representa-
tives from various departments."
"In order to ensure that potential insider information is handled as required 
by law, this Committee reviews occurrences for their possible effect on share prices, determining the need 
to issue reports to the capital markets on an ad hoc basis."
"The ultimate authority to decide how to handle 
potential insider information lies with the Management Board."
"The Sustainability Council chaired by CPO Sylvie Nicol is the central 
corporate management body in charge of our global sustainability activities."
"At the request of the Manage-
ment Board, the Council performs initiative and control functions relating to sustainability issues."
"They include 
strategic issues and issues of operational relevance, such as climate change and the impacts of same, human 
rights, sustainable products and technologies, packaging, product safety, and management systems."
"The 
Sustainability Council establishes project groups to address sustainability issues and oversees the findings."
"Additionally, overarching projects are initiated and the achievement of sustainability targets is regularly 
monitored."
"The Sustainability Council is composed of senior executives from all business units and functions 
throughout the company."
"The operating business units are responsible for the operational design of our sustainability strategy and for 
providing the resources needed to implement same."
"They align their brands and technologies, and the sites 
involved, to sustainability in line with the specific challenges and priorities of their product portfolio."
"The 
managers in charge of the regional and national companies are responsible for implementing Group specifi-
cations and for ensuring compliance with legal requirements."
"With the support of the corporate functions 
and the operating business units, they develop an implementation strategy appropriate to the individual 
sites and their local circumstances."
"The corporate functions support the implementation of our sustainability strategy in the respective areas 
and the measurement of progress."
"In this respect, the central Corporate Sustainability function headed by 
the Chief Corporate Sustainability Officer acts as an important coordinator and steward."
"Internal audit 
The primary task of our internal audit function (Corporate Audit) is to provide independent and objective 
auditing and consultancy services aimed at adding value and improving business processes."
"A systematic and 
target-oriented approach assesses the effectiveness of the risk management system, control mechanisms 
and management and monitoring processes and is used to coordinate improvement programs."
"Regular audits 
are conducted around the globe at our production and administrative sites, as well as at our toll/contract 
manufacturers and at logistics centers to assure compliance with our codes and standards."
"Our audits 
focus particularly on the areas of procurement, distribution, marketing, finance, IT, personnel, supply chain, 
production, and health and environmental safety."
"Our Corporate Audit function reports regularly to the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee on the findings of its audits."
"The efficacy of the control and risk management systems are examined on the basis of risk reports, the 
report on the internal control system and reports submitted by the General Counsel & Chief Compliance 
Officer and the Corporate Audit function."
"The Audit Committee also approves the relevant risk-based audit 
schedule submitted by the Corporate Audit function."
"Generally speaking, however, internal control 
and risk management systems – irrespective of their individual design – cannot guarantee with absolute certainty 
that all risks will be identified in time or that (compliance) violations will be avoided or discovered."

"Wherever possible, Management Board resolutions are adopted unanimously."
"In the 
absence of a unanimous vote, the majority decides; in the event of a tie, the Chair of the Management Board 
has the casting vote."
"The Chair cannot force a decision against a majority vote but does have a veto right if 
outvoted."
Exercising the veto right prompts renewed debate of the resolution by the Management Board.
"If 
the veto right is exercised again in response to the proposed adoption of a resolution, the matter is forwarded

The Chair of the Supervisory Board is also Chair of the Nominations Committee.
"The Nominations Committee 
prepares the resolutions of the Supervisory Board on election proposals by the Supervisory Board to be 
presented to the Annual General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives."

"The Shareholders’ Committee comprised ten members in 
the year under review."
"The Shareholders’ Committee performs the tasks assigned to it by the Annual General Meeting or according 
to the Articles of Association."
"In particular, the Shareholders’ Committee acts in place of the Annual General 
Meeting in guiding the business activities of the company."
"It is involved in defining corporate policies, 
objectives and long-term planning activities, and monitors and regularly advises Henkel Management AG 
and its Management Board on the management of the corporation."
"The Shareholders’ Committee takes part 
in important business decisions, offers suggestions with regard to the further development of the company, 
and monitors adherence to budgets."
"In addition, it governs the appointment and dismissal of personally liable partners and holds both executive 
powers and the power of representation over the legal relationships prevailing between the company and 
Henkel Management AG as the Personally Liable Partner."
"The Shareholders’ Committee is likewise responsible 
for exercising the company’s voting rights at Annual General Meetings of Henkel Management AG."
"The Shareholders’ Committee 
has, moreover, determined rules of procedure for Henkel Management AG that specify which transactions 
are subject to its approval."
"As a general rule, the Shareholders’ Committee meets six times per year."
"If deemed necessary, it meets 
without participation of the Management Board."
"It also holds a joint conference with the Management Board 
lasting several days to discuss issues surrounding corporate strategy, including sustainability."
"The Share-
holders’ Committee reaches its decisions by a simple majority of the votes cast."
"It has established Finance 
and Personnel Committees that likewise meet six times per year, as a rule."
"The Finance Committee deals primarily with financial matters, questions of financial strategy, financial position 
and structure, taxation, balance sheet and insurance policy, accounting, non-financial reporting procedures, 
compliance issues and risk management within the corporation."
"It also performs the necessary preparatory 
work for decisions to be made by the Shareholders’ Committee in matters for which decision authority has 
not been delegated to it."
"As of December 31, 2023, the following were members of the Finance Committee: 
Konstantin von Unger (Chair), Dr. Christoph Kneip (Vice Chair), Dr. Paul Achleitner and James Rowan."

holders’ Committee on the content and results of each of the committee meetings."
"Members encountering material 
conflicts of interest that are not of a merely temporary nature are required to resign their mandate."
"No consulting or other service or works agreements existed between members of the Supervisory Board or 
Shareholders’ Committee on the one side, and the company on the other."
"Some members of the Supervisory Board and of the Shareholders’ Committee are or were in past years holders 
of senior managerial positions in other companies."
"If and when Henkel pursues business activities with these 
companies, the same arm’s length principles apply as those adopted in transactions with and between unrelated 
third parties."
"In our view, such transactions do not affect the impartiality of the members in question."
"Further, members take it upon 
themselves to seek the training needed to perform their duties – as recommended, for example, in the case 
of amendments to legal frameworks."
These efforts are appropriately supported by the company.
"If the need 
arises, in-house information events provide specific upskilling."
"Interaction between Management Board, Supervisory Board and Shareholders’ Committee 
The Management Board, Supervisory Board and Shareholders’ Committee work in close cooperation for the 
benefit of the company."
"The Management Board agrees the strategic direction of the company with the Shareholders’ Committee 
and discusses with it the status of strategy implementation at regular intervals."
"It also regularly discusses the status of strategy implementation, including sustainability 
strategy."

"
Internationality
The international activities of the corporation in both emerging and mature markets should be appropriately
reflected in the composition of the Management Board."
"Henkel therefore strives to ensure that several members
of different nationalities or with international backgrounds (who have spent several years working abroad
or supervising foreign business activities, for example) are included on the Management Board."
"
Gender
A reasonable proportion of both genders shall be represented in the Management Board."
"The Management
Board must include at least one woman and at least one man."
"
Seniority
Change and continuity are two issues that must be taken into reasonable account when composing the
Management Board."
"Henkel therefore aims to include members with different levels of seniority on the
Management Board."
"Irrespective of this requirement, members of the Management Board should generally
not be older than 63."
"Implementation progress 
We believe that the aforementioned requirements were met in full in the reporting period."

ment Board to ensure long-term succession planning with regard to Management Board composition."
"Although 
both in-house and external candidates are considered for future appointment, every effort is made to select 
candidates from within the organization who have proven their aptitude for such duties."
"Management potential within the individual business units is like-
wise discussed."
"When a Management Board vacancy requires filling, a corresponding profile is developed that incorporates 
the specific qualification requirements and the aforementioned criteria; this is then used as the basis for 
shortlisting available candidates."
Corresponding interviews are held with these candidates.
"Where necessary, 
external consultants are engaged to help develop the profile and to assist with selecting and evaluating 
candidates."
"The Shareholders’ Committee then submits an appropriate recommendation to the Supervisory 
Board of Henkel Management AG."

Recommendation C.6 GCGC, a member of a supervisory board is considered independent if they are
independent from the company and its management board and independent from a controlling share-
holder."
"Pursuant to Recommendation C.7 GCGC, more than half the shareholder representatives should
be independent from the company and the Management Board."
"Supervisory Board members are consid-
ered independent from the company and its Management Board if they have no personal or business
relationship with the company or its Management Board that could create a substantial and not merely
temporary conflict of interest."
"KGaA or one of its affiliates, a material business relationship – either directly or indirectly – as a 
partner, shareholder, member of management or in a leading position of the entity maintaining the 
business relationship (e.g."
"as customer, supplier, lender or advisor), 
– is a close family member of a member of the Management Board or 
– has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years."
"If one or more of the aforementioned indicators apply and a shareholder representative is still considered 
independent from the company and/or the Management Board, the reasons for this assessment must be 
given in the corporate governance statement."
"Membership of the Shareholders’ Committee or 
of the Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG is compatible with membership of the company’s 
Supervisory Board."
"
Availability
When proposing new candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board,
the Supervisory Board must make sure that the relevant candidates can devote the anticipated time
required to the task."
"
Internationality
The international activities of the company should be appropriately reflected in the composition of the
Supervisory Board."
"Henkel therefore strives to ensure that several members with international backgrounds
(who have spent several years working abroad or supervising foreign business activities, for example) are
included on the Supervisory Board."
"
Gender
A reasonable proportion of women shall be appointed to the Supervisory Board."
"The statutory minimum
requirement of 30 percent is deemed to be reasonable."
"Henkel strives to increase the proportion of
women when new or replacement members are elected."
"
Age and length of service
The Supervisory Board should appropriately include representatives from different generations/age
groups."
"Henkel therefore aims to include members from different generations/age groups on the Super-
visory Board."
"Irrespective of the aforementioned, nobody should, as a rule, be proposed to the Annual
General Meeting for election to the Supervisory Board who, at the time of the election, has already
reached their 70th birthday."
"Also, as a rule, nobody should be proposed to the Annual General Meeting
for election to the Supervisory Board who, at the time of the election, has already served more than ten
years on the Supervisory Board."
"However, to ensure continuity, members may also serve on the Supervisory
Board for longer periods of time in individual cases."
"In keeping with the ownership structure and the
company’s tradition as an open family business, this applies particularly to members of the Henkel family
share-pooling agreement."
"Overall, the Supervisory Board believes it has the knowledge and skills needed to properly and effectively 
perform its duties."
"Several of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are or were members 
of management/executive boards in relevant companies and are experienced and skilled in managing globally 
operating corporations and in leading employees."
"Equally, several shareholder representatives have in-depth 
knowledge in the fields of research and development, production, marketing, selling and distribution, digi-
talization/e-commerce and sustainable management."
"The same applies for the fields of finance/accounting, 
financial control/risk management and governance/compliance."
"In addition, several shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board offer international business 
experience or other international expertise."
No shareholder representative exceeded the specified maximum age at the time of their election.
The GCGC recommendations on impartiality have been adopted.
"Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah, Supervisory Board Chair, and Prof. Dr. Michael Kaschke, former Audit Committee Chair, 
have been or were members of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years."
"According to the GCGC, 
this could indicate a lack of impartiality."
"After exercising their due discretion, the shareholder representatives 
judged that – despite this indication – Dr. Bagel-Trah is, and Prof. Dr. Kaschke was, regarded as independent 
from the company and its Management Board as seen from an overall perspective."
"Dr. Bagel-Trah maintains, 
and Prof. Dr. Kaschke maintained, the necessary impartiality toward the company and the Management Board 
in the performance of their respective office and their functions."
"Their conduct of office demonstrates a critical 
approach to the issues and questions to be assessed, while safeguarding the interests of the corporation."
"According to the precepts of Recommendation C.7 GCGC, these shareholder representatives are 
therefore independent from the company and the Management Board."
"The shareholder side therefore 
believes that all shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are independent from the company 
and the Management Board."
"Four of the eight shareholder representatives – Barbara Kux, Simone Menne, Laurent Martinez and Poul 
Weihrauch – are not party to the Henkel family share-pooling agreement; under GCGC Recommendation 
C.9, they are therefore independent from the controlling shareholder."
"Apart from Dr. Simone Bagel-Trah, 
none of the shareholder representatives in office is a member of the Shareholders’ Committee or the 
Supervisory Board of Henkel Management AG."
"As such, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board include what they believe to be a reasonable 
number of independent members as recommended by the GCGC."
2 As defined in Recommendation C.9 GCGC 2022.
"In this respect, the Supervisory Board must submit appropriate proposals for 
adoption by the Annual General Meeting."
"When elections are required, the Nominations Committee defines appropriate profiles that consider the 
requirements of German company law [AktG] and the GCGC and the aforementioned objective for Supervisory 
Board composition."
This forms the basis for shortlisting available candidates who are then interviewed.
"Where necessary, external consultants are engaged to help develop the profile and to assist with selecting 
and evaluating candidates."
"Finally, the Nominations Committee submits its recommendation to the Supervisory 
Board of Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA for its election proposal to the Annual General Meeting.

pany or its Management Board that could create a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of interest."
"Membership of the company’s Supervisory Board or of the Supervisory Board of Henkel 
Management AG is compatible with membership of the Shareholders’ Committee."
"As a rule, however, five, 
and at least four, members of the Shareholders’ Committee or their close families should be neither members 
of the share-pooling agreement nor members of the company’s Supervisory Board, and they must be named 
accordingly in the corporate governance statement."
"Implementation progress 
As of December 31, 2023, the Shareholders’ Committee was comprised of nine men and one woman."
"This 
represents an overall ratio of 90 percent men and 10 percent women."

believes it has the knowledge and skills needed to properly and effectively perform its duties."

members of the Management Board that could create a substantial and not merely temporary conflict of 
interest."

company’s Supervisory Board."

Board are required to submit appropriate proposals for adoption by the Annual General Meeting."
"When elections are required, appropriate profiles are defined that consider the aforementioned diversity 
objectives for Shareholders’ Committee composition and which serve as the basis for shortlisting available 
candidates."
Corresponding interviews are then held with these candidates.

Operational activities 
Overview 
Henkel was founded in 1876."
"Therefore, the year under review marks the 147th in our corporate history."
"At 
the end of 2023, Henkel employed around 47,750 people worldwide."
"We hold globally leading market positions 
in our consumer and industrial businesses."
"Our purpose expresses what unites everyone at Henkel: “Pioneers at heart for the good of generations.” It is 
firmly anchored in our DNA and continues our success story of innovation, responsibility and sustainability 
as we move forward."
"Organization and business units 
Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA is operationally active as well as being the parent company of the Henkel Group.
"As 
such it is responsible for defining and pursuing Henkel’s corporate objectives and also for the management, 
control and monitoring of Group-wide activities, including risk management and the allocation of resources."
"KGaA performs its tasks within the legal scope afforded to it as part of the Henkel Group, 
with the affiliated companies otherwise operating as legally independent entities."
"Operational management and control is the responsibility of the Management Board of Henkel Management AG 
in its function as sole Personally Liable Partner."
"The Management Board is supported in this by the central, 
corporate functions."
"Since the start of fiscal 2023, Henkel has been organized in two business units: Adhesive Technologies and 
Consumer Brands."
"As global market leader for adhesives, the Adhesive Technologies business unit offers a broad portfolio of 
high-impact solutions in adhesives, sealants and functional coatings."
"The organizational structure of the 
business unit was optimized in fiscal 2023."
"The new structure comprising the three business areas Mobility & 
Electronics, Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Craftsmen, Construction & Professional enables us to use 
scale and competence benefits even more efficiently, while at the same time ensuring close customer and 
market proximity."
"Additionally, with our business 
area Other Consumer Businesses, we are active in selective body care markets."
"We occupy leading positions 
in numerous markets and categories and offer a strong brand portfolio featuring consumer-relevant innovations 
that create added value for our customers and consumers."
"We distribute our products through brick-and-
mortar stores, hair salons and digital channels."
"Details of the individual business areas of both business units can be found on page 122 for Adhesive 
Technologies and page 130 for Consumer Brands."
"KGaA, our Global Supply Chain organization and our Global Business Solutions organization with its 
Shared Service Centers, thus enabling optimum utilization of corporate network synergies."
"Implementation of the business activities at the country and regional level is the responsibility of the national 
affiliated companies whose operations are supported and coordinated by Regional Centers."
"Further details on the organization of our business activities along the value chain can be found in the sections 
“Procurement” (pages 152 to 154), “Production” (pages 155 to 157), “Research and development” (pages 158 
to 163) and “Marketing and distribution” (pages 164 to 167)."
"We had also announced our intention to report key sales figures at the business area 
level, thus increasing transparency."
"Specifically, we report sales as well as nominal and organic sales growth."
"In the Consumer Brands business unit, these figures are reported for the business areas Laundry & Home 
Care, Hair and Other Consumer Businesses."
"Henkel has, moreover, optimized the organizational structure of 
its Adhesive Technologies business unit."
"The new structure comprising the three business areas Mobility & 
Electronics, Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Craftsmen, Construction & Professional was already reflected 
in the report on the first quarter of 2023."
"The company has also slightly modified its regional reporting structure to better reflect the allocation of 
management responsibilities."
"Since the first quarter of 2023, we have been commenting on business per-
formance in the regions of Europe, IMEA (India, Middle East, Africa), North America, Latin America and 
Asia-Pacific."
"Accordingly, the prior-year figures included in this report for the Consumer Brands business unit, for the 
business areas within the two business units, and for the regions Europe, IMEA and Asia-Pacific, reflect in 
each case the new structure."
"With this strategic framework, we place a clear focus on purposeful growth."
"This means: We aim to create 
superior value for customers and consumers to outgrow our markets, to strengthen our leadership in 
sustainability, and to help our employees to grow both professionally and personally at Henkel."
"At the
same time, Henkel places a continuous focus on free cash flow expansion."
"
For the Adhesive Technologies business unit, we are aiming for organic sales growth of 3 to 5 percent
and adjusted return on sales (adjusted EBIT margin) in the high-teens percentage range."
"
For the Consumer Brands business unit, we are aiming for organic sales growth of 3 to 4 percent and
adjusted return on sales (adjusted EBIT margin) in the mid-teens percentage range."
"This is why we are consist-
ently evolving our brands and businesses as part of our active portfolio management – not least in light of 
the creation of our integrated business unit Consumer Brands (for more details, see pages 99 to 101)."
"At the 
same time, M&A activities in both business units remain an integral part of our strategy, supported by our 
strong balance sheet."
"Accelerate impactful innovations 
We want to accelerate impactful innovations and also adopt an enhanced innovation approach, for example 
by utilizing digital applications and data to gain faster and better insights into consumer behavior and market 
trends."
Decision-making across the organization occurs close to the market.
"In our collaboration with external 
partners, we are also increasingly leveraging the potential of open innovation, using agile methods and 
continuing to invest in innovation centers."
"We consistently invest in innovations and brands in core catego-
ries and regions."
"Sustainability is essential to create a 
competitive edge, enable business growth and generate value for our customers, consumers and all of our 
stakeholders."
"To drive sustainable development, we have set ourselves ambitious goals as part of our 2030+ Sustainability 
Ambition Framework that build on our progress to date and which we are rigorously pursuing."
"We have 
included different ESG dimensions and defined key areas of focus:  

Regenerative Planet: We strive to achieve a circular economy, a climate-neutral future and the regeneration
of nature."
"To this end, we are further developing our business activities to drive solutions in the areas of
climate, circularity and nature."
"
Thriving Communities: We actively contribute to people being able to lead a better life through our
business and brands."
"To this end, we focus on equity, education and wellbeing."
"
Trusted Partner: We are committed to product quality and safety while ensuring business success with
integrity, focusing on performance, transparency and collaboration."
"We build on our particular strengths, such as the innovation capabilities of our business units and the com-
prehensive knowledge of our employees, as well as various contact points of our products with customers 
and consumers."
"Assessments in the relevant sustainability ratings provide important and independent con-
firmation and acknowledgment of our achievements and progress."
"Please refer to our Sustainability Report 2023 for a detailed discussion of our sustainability strategy and 
progress."
"Enhance value creation for customers and consumers through digitalization  
We take advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization to increase the value added for our custom-
ers and consumers, interacting directly with our consumers and striving to grow our digital sales."
"In the 
process, we are building a pool of digital talents, which we support in a targeted manner."
"Ultimately, we want 
to strengthen our digital business focus and increase efficiency."
"In this respect, our digital unit Henkel dx, 
which was created in 2019 to bring together the digital and IT teams at Henkel, is of key importance."
"We want to step up customer and consumer proximity, 
establish faster decision-making processes and realize further efficiency gains."
"Strengthen our collaborative culture  
A strong corporate culture, shared values and a clear understanding of collaboration as a strong team are 
essential to continue to successfully drive our growth agenda."
"Important cornerstones of this are our pur-
pose – Pioneers at heart for the good of generations – and our Leadership Commitments uniting all employees 
worldwide."
"We believe that cultural transformation is an ongoing process in which we focus on collaboration 
and empowerment, foster the upskilling of our employees for future capabilities and enable them to constantly 
develop further."
"Integration of the Consumer Brands business unit 
At the start of 2022, Henkel announced its plans to merge the two former business units Laundry & Home 
Care and Beauty Care."
"The creation of the integrated business unit Consumer Brands – which we continued 
to drive in 2023 – represents the most significant transformation of our company in recent decades."
"With the Consumer Brands business unit, which has been operating worldwide under the new structure 
since the beginning of 2023, we are creating a multi-category platform with a focus on the global categories 
Laundry & Home Care and Hair, and which represents more than 10 billion euros in sales."
"The business unit 
brings together all consumer brands across all categories under one roof – including many iconic brands 
such as Persil and Schwarzkopf – and also incorporates the Hair Professional business."
"This step lays the 
foundation for further profitable growth of our entire consumer goods business."
"Through the merger, we want to raise the profitability of our consumer goods business and thus of the 
Group as a whole."
"Furthermore, we want to create additional positive growth stimulus."
"To this end, we are 
focusing the Consumer Brands portfolio on strategic core brands and businesses with attractive growth and 
margin potential."
"The integration will allow us to realize significant synergies, which in part will be used to 
facilitate, for example, targeted investment in strategic priorities such as innovation, sustainability and 
digitalization, and to strengthen our attractive and leading brands."
"To achieve this, we are focusing the portfolio on attractive growth potential 
and high gross margins, and are aligning investments to core platforms in relevant markets."
"At present, our 
Consumer Brands portfolio comprises the global categories Laundry & Home Care and Hair, together with 
the business area Other Consumer Businesses which is present in selective body care markets."
"The combined size of our consumer businesses offers improved opportunities for further reducing complexity 
and for even more rigorous implementation of portfolio measures."
"These include the divestment or discon-
tinuation of brands and businesses that do not meet our expectations – in respect of growth prospects, 
gross margin or market appeal, for example."
"Henkel had announced plans to review businesses and brands 
representing a total sales volume of up to 1 billion euros."
"Accordingly, we had already fundamentally 
changed our portfolio of consumer businesses back in 2022 with our global exit from the Oral and Skin Care 
categories and our exit from selective Body Care markets."
"As a multi-category platform, there are also additional opportunities for targeted acquisitions – in existing 
core categories or in other new consumer goods categories."
"This will be our approach in optimizing the 
portfolio and in further strengthening the growth dynamics in our consumer businesses as we move forward."
"Creating advantages of scale: Significant synergies and efficiency gains 
The Consumer Brands business unit will enable Henkel to leverage scale, allowing us to substantially increase 
efficiency."
It will also help us to act faster and become more flexible in a highly volatile environment.
"Based 
on consistent implementation, which we were able to drive forward faster than originally planned in the past 
fiscal year, we have raised our expectations in respect of the savings to be generated from the merger."
"In the mid-term, we are now striving to generate significant gross savings (before reinvestment) totaling 
around 650 million euros (previously around 500 million euros)."
"These savings will emerge primarily from 
optimizing both our sales and administrative structures and our supply chain (production and logistics)."
"A 
part of these savings will be reinvested."
"Net savings are now expected to total around 525 million euros on 
an annualized basis (previously around 400 million euros)."

Implementation is taking place in two phases."
"In the first phase, we implemented measures up to the end 
of 2023 that are now expected to lead to net savings of around 275 million euros on an annualized basis 
(previously 250 million euros) – with full impact on earnings expected from 2024 onward."
"Related to this, 
Henkel had announced that, among other effects, around 2,000 jobs globally – mainly in sales and admin-
istration – would be affected."
"The second phase of integration is focusing on optimizing the supply chain, i.e."
"the production and logistics 
network."
"Here, Henkel plans to improve the efficiency and regional footprint of its own production and to 
optimize its network of toll/contract manufacturers and its procurement costs."
"In addition, we plan to drive 
commercial integration with optimized logistics processes in line with the 1-1-1 principle – one order, one 
shipment, one invoice."
"Measures in this second phase are expected to be mostly implemented by the end of 
2025."
"Henkel now anticipates additional annual net savings from these measures of around 250 million euros 
(previously at least 150 million euros), which are expected to fully materialize from 2026 onward."
"The targeted efficiency and cost advantages arising from these two phases will increasingly enable higher 
and more targeted investments in innovations and in more sustainability and digitalization, enabling us to 
further extend our competitive edge."
"Moreover, they facilitate focused and strong marketing support to 
further strengthen our attractive and leading brands."
"Integrated approach: Leaner structures and faster decision-making processes  
The new business unit places a particular focus on customer and channel centricity – with an integrated 
approach for trade partners across all consumer categories."
"Under one leadership, the team focuses on 
advancing the entire consumer business, with leaner structures and faster decision-making throughout the 
entire integrated organization."
"A detailed discussion of the major progress relating to the ongoing integration of the Consumer Brands 
business unit in fiscal 2023 can be found on pages 130 to 132."
We continued to resolutely evolve our portfolio in both business units in 2023.
"Since announcing the merger of our consumer businesses, we have divested or discontinued brands and 
activities representing total sales of around 650 million euros in the Consumer Brands business unit."
"For 
example, we exited our North American air freshener business in 2023."
"At the same time, Henkel strengthened 
its portfolio by acquiring the sustainable Laundry & Home Care brand Earthwise in New Zealand."
"In January 
2024, Henkel also signed an agreement to acquire the Vidal Sassoon brand and the related consumer hair 
care business in China from Procter & Gamble."
"The acquisition strengthens our Consumer Brands business 
in China and expands our hair care portfolio in an attractive market."
"The business generated sales of more 
than 200 million euros in Procter & Gamble's 2022/2023 financial year."
"In addition, our Adhesive Technologies business unit has underpinned its more pronounced focus on growth 
through M&A and has added an attractive acquisition to its maintenance, repair and overhaul portfolio."
"Following Russia’s war on Ukraine, Henkel had announced in 2022 to exit its business activities in Russia."
"Effective April 21, 2023, Henkel sold its business activities in Russia to a consortium of local financial investors, 
resulting in a cash inflow of 615 million euros."
We also made advancements in the area of innovations.
"Our innovation and customer centers play a key 
role in this respect."
"In 2023, the Adhesive Technologies business unit opened a new innovation center in 
Bridgewater in New Jersey, USA, and a battery center at the Inspiration Center Düsseldorf (ICD), which will 
serve to strengthen collaboration with automotive and battery manufacturers."
"The Consumer Brands business 
unit likewise enhanced its innovation strength."
"For example, the research and development center in Shanghai, 
China, was expanded."
"We also opened a J-Beauty Innovation Hub for our Professional business in Tokyo, 
Japan, where we are pooling the expertise of Schwarzkopf and the Shiseido Professional business in the 
Asia-Pacific region that we acquired in 2022."
"Major innovations 
are showcased on pages 124 (Adhesive Technologies) and 133 (Consumer Brands)."
"In 2023, we continued to integrate sustainability within our business operations."
"As part of our 2030+ 
Sustainability Ambition Framework, we worked on a more sustainable product portfolio, for example by 
increasing the use of renewable and recycled raw materials."
"We systematically track our progress in this 
field."
"For example, we evolved the methodology used in our Adhesive Technologies business unit to assess 
the sustainability of the product portfolio."
"By further expanding our use of renewable energies, we also came a step closer to achieving our ambition of 
a climate-positive greenhouse gas balance in production by 2030: In 2023, Henkel converted additional 
plants to carbon-neutral production."
Our work likewise focused on the circular economy.
"We further increased the share of recycled materials in 
our plastic packaging, and entered into a partnership with the Circular Valley Foundation which allows us to 
engage with startups and academics around the globe and to further expand our own local networks."
"We are steadily expanding our communication efforts in order to make our advancements tangible for 
customers and consumers."
"For example, last year we launched “It starts with us” – a joint campaign with our 
retail customers in different countries, through which we are supporting our consumers with targeted com-
munication that also includes advice on the responsible use of our products."
"We have continued to drive the 
strategic alignment of our digital unit Henkel dx by steadily optimizing internal structures, strengthening the 
development of digital expertise and promoting a culture of innovation."
"The acceleration of digital innova-
tions, our platform strategy and the close collaboration of all business units and functions enabled us to further 
improve our efficiency in IT last year and to create new business opportunities for Henkel."
"The use of artificial 
intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly important role in this field."
"For example, we have further developed 
Schwarzkopf SalonLab."
"Here, an AI-based technology enables real-time analysis of consumers’ hair at a salon 
so that hyper-personalized products can be offered tailored to the exact needs of the individual."
"We use AI 
in Adhesive Technologies, for example, in our global research labs to predict the chemical and physical 
properties of new formulas – with the aim of substantially shortening the time needed for product devel-
opment while at the same time enhancing the performance of the new solutions."
"To establish future-ready operating models, our focus in 2023 was on further integrating the Consumer 
Brands business unit."
Details of the progress in this respect can be found on pages 130 to 132.
"In addition, Henkel has optimized the organizational structure of the Adhesive Technologies business unit, 
for which Mark Dorn has been the responsible Executive Vice President since February 1, 2023."
"As a result, 
the business unit with its three business areas Mobility & Electronics, Packaging & Consumer Goods and 
Craftsmen, Construction & Professional can make more efficient use of scale and leverage competencies 
while at the same time ensuring close customer and market proximity."
"We have also further strengthened our corporate culture, building on our purpose – Pioneers at heart for 
the good of generations – and our Leadership Commitments."
"To support our employees in fostering our 
cultural change, we launched the “Accelerate Cultural Transformation” (ACT) initiative in 2023."
"The aim is to 
encourage engagement across teams and to define specific action points."
"A further area of focus was the 
implementation of our integrated Smart Work concept that provides the global framework for topics such 
as mobile working, digital workplaces or employee health, together with further global diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) initiatives."
"The key performance indicators are organic sales growth, adjusted return on sales, and 
growth in adjusted earnings per preferred share at constant exchange rates."
These performance indicators are represented in both the annual and medium-term plans of Henkel.
"A regular 
comparison of these plans with current developments and the regular reporting of expected figures enable 
focused management of the company based on the described performance indicators."
"The performance indicators of relevance for management at Henkel – for which we have also defined mid- 
to long-term ambitions – are discussed below."
" Organic sales growth 
Organic sales growth is defined as the increase in sales after adjustment for the effects of acquisitions, 
divestments and foreign exchange."
"As such, it serves to quantify growth from within the company."
"In 
addition, organic sales growth is one of the metrics used to determine the annual variable remuneration 
(Short Term Incentive) payable to the Management Board."
" Adjusted return on sales 
Adjusted return on sales describes the ratio of adjusted operating profit (adjusted EBIT) to sales."
"As such, 
adjusted return on sales is indicative of the company’s profitability."
Calculation is based on IAS 33 (Earnings per share).
"Calculation of this earnings metric as a performance
indicator is based on adjusted earnings per share compared to the prior-year figure."
"Furthermore, growth
in adjusted earnings per preferred share at constant exchange rates is one of the metrics used to determine
the annual variable remuneration (Short Term Incentive) payable to the Management Board."
"Moreover, we regularly disclose other key financials and non-financial metrics."
"
Other key financials
Other key financials include adjusted earnings per preferred share, net working capital as a percentage of
sales, adjusted return on capital employed (adjusted ROCE), Economic Value Added (EVA®) and free cash
flow."
These key financials are explained in the glossary.
"Furthermore, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) targets count
among of the metrics to determine the long-term variable share-based remuneration (Long Term Incentive)
payable to the Management Board."
We regularly review our cost of capital in order to reflect changing market conditions.
"Moreover, we apply 
different WACC rates depending on the business unit involved."
"These are based on business-unit-specific 
beta factors determined from a peer group benchmark."
The following table indicates the WACC rates before and after tax for the Henkel Group and each business unit.
"This also constitutes the separate, combined non-financial report for the  
Henkel Group and Henkel AG & Co."

conjunction with 289b to 289e HGB, and similarly contains the information required by the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation."
"Overview: 
Global economy with continued modest growth 
In 2023, the global economy again recorded modest growth in the face of a persistent overall inflationary 
environment with higher interest rate levels."
"While the economic environment was also impacted by geopolitical 
uncertainties, the gradual reduction of logistics bottlenecks and material shortages, and slightly easing 
inflationary pressure compared to the previous year, had a positive impact on overall economic growth."
"As was also the case in the previous year, the global economy recorded gross domestic product growth of 
around 3 percent in 2023."
"For the year under review, economic growth in Europe was approximately 1 percent, with North America 
recording an increase of around 2 percent."
"Both the IMEA and Asia-Pacific regions posted economic growth 
of approximately 4 percent."
Economic output in Latin America increased by approximately 2 percent.
"Unemployment: 
Global unemployment rate at constant levels 
The global unemployment rate was on a par with the previous year at approximately 7 percent."
"Unemployment 
remained at approximately 5.5 percent in Europe and was unchanged year on year in North America at 
approximately 4 percent."
"The unemployment rate was around 11 percent in the IMEA region, approximately 
6.5 percent in Latin America, and around 4 percent in the Asia-Pacific region."
"Inflation: 
Slight decline in global inflation rates 
Global inflation in 2023 was approximately 5.5 percent and thus lower year on year overall (2022: approxi-
mately 7.5 percent)."
"Prices in Europe and North America rose by approximately 6 percent and approximately 
4 percent respectively – inflation therefore remained high but was significantly lower year on year."
"At around 
16 percent, inflation in the IMEA region was slightly below the prior-year level."
"In Latin America, prices

increased significantly year on year by approximately 22 percent."
"Inflation in the Asia-Pacific region was 
around 2 percent."
"Direct materials: 
Slight increase versus prior year 
Year on year, prices for direct materials (raw materials, packaging, and purchased goods and services) increased 
by a low single-digit percentage on average in 2023."
"Following substantial increases in prior years, raw 
material prices remained high overall but recorded an increasing downward trend over the course of the 
year, due among other things to continued high uncertainty in the marketplace and to lower industrial 
demand."
"The year-on-year increase in prices for direct materials was caused particularly by rising labor costs 
and by in part still elevated logistics and energy costs."
"Currencies: 
Mainly negative trend in currencies 
The US dollar depreciated slightly versus the euro on average over the year."
"At year-end, the exchange rate 
of US dollar to euro was 1.11."
"Most of the currencies of relevance for Henkel in the emerging markets depre-
ciated on average over the year – with a few exceptions."
"The Mexican peso appreciated, whereas the Turkish 
lira depreciated by a double-digit percentage."
"Development by sector 
Consumption and retail:  
Continued slowdown in global consumption 
The increase in global private consumption spending in 2023, at approximately 3 percent, was less pronounced 
year on year."
"Private spending increased by approximately 1 percent in Europe and by approximately 2 percent in North 
America."
"In the IMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, private consumption rose by approximately 5 percent, while 
Latin America recorded an increase of approximately 2.5 percent."
"Industrial production index: 
Persistently muted development 
At around 1 percent globally, the increase in the industrial production index (IPX) was significantly lower 
year on year."
"Industrial production contracted by approximately -1 percent in Europe in 2023 and stagnated in North 
America."
"The IMEA region recorded growth of approximately 1.5 percent and Latin America of approxi-
mately 1 percent."
Industrial production in the Asia-Pacific region increased by approximately 2 percent.
"Growth in the Mobility & Electronics business area – due to 
strong automotive business – and in the Craftsmen, Construction & Professional business area, in particular, 
had a positive impact on the performance of our Industrial business."
"The Consumer business benefited 
particularly from positive performance in the Laundry & Home Care and Hair business areas."
"Results of operations of the Group 
Sales 
Sales in fiscal 2023 totaled 21,514 million euros, down -3.9 percent year on year in nominal terms."
"Foreign 
exchange effects had a negative impact of -4.3 percent on sales.3 Adjusted for these foreign exchange 
effects, sales growth was 0.4 percent."
"At -3.9 percent, acquisitions/divestments also had a negative impact 
on sales, which was mainly due to the divestment of our business activities in Russia."
"Organic sales growth, 
i.e."
"adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments, was very strong at 4.2 percent, driven by
price increases in the high single-digit percentage range, whereas volumes declined."
"2 Proposal to shareholders for the Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2024."
3 Including the impacts of the mandatory application of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies for Türkiye.
This note also applies to the remainder of the management report.
"The Consumer 
Brands business unit achieved very strong organic sales growth of 6.1 percent, driven particularly by the 
Laundry & Home Care and Hair business areas."
"In the IMEA region, 
Henkel generated substantial double-digit organic sales growth of 24.7 percent that was driven in particular 
by strong price developments in both business units."
"Organic sales growth was 2.4 percent in the North 
America region."
We achieved organic sales growth of 11.7 percent in the Latin America region.
"In contrast, 
organic sales development in the Asia-Pacific region was negative at -1.5 percent, mainly due to the challenging 
market environment in China."
"Operating profit 
Operating profit in fiscal 2023 came in at 2,011 million euros after 1,810 million euros in the previous year, 
which corresponds to an increase of 11.1 percent."
"The operating expense and income items leading to the 
operating profit result were impacted by one-time expenses and income, and by restructuring expenses."
"The figure for one-time expenses also includes 36 million euros relating 
to the merger of the former Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units into the combined 
Consumer Brands business unit."
"This expenditure is essentially attributable to external consultancy services 
and project management costs."
"A further 31 million euros relates to impairment losses in connection with 
the discontinuation of a brand in our North American consumer goods business."
One-time income of 4 million euros resulted from smaller divestments during the period under review.
"In order to adapt our structures to our markets and customers, we spent 267 million euros on restructuring 
(previous year: 405 million euros)."
"A significant portion of this amount is attributable to the ongoing merger 
of our consumer goods businesses."
"Restructuring expenses were also incurred for the optimization of our 
production, logistics and sales and distribution structures."
"Please refer to pages 332 and 333 for additional 
disclosures relating to the restructuring expenses, and to the one-time expenses and income."
"Adjusted operating profit (adjusted EBIT) increased by 10.2 percent to 2,556 million euros (previous year: 
2,319 million euros)."
"Adjusted return on sales (adjusted EBIT margin) in fiscal 2023 was significantly higher 
year on year at 11.9 percent (2022: 10.4 percent)."
"Adjusted return on sales increased for both business units, reaching 14.7 percent in the Adhesive Technologies 
business unit (2022: 13.6 percent) and 10.6 percent in the Consumer Brands business unit (2022: 8.3 percent)."
"Expense items 
The following explanations relate to our operating expenses adjusted for one-time expenses and income, 
and for restructuring expenses."
"The reconciliation statement and the allocation of the restructuring charges 
between the various expense items of the consolidated statement of income can be found on pages 332 
and 333."
"Gross profit increased by 3.9 percent to 9,842 million euros."
"Adjusted 
gross margin increased by 3.4 percentage points versus prior year, to 45.7 percent."
"By contrast, the ratio to sales increased to 26.3 percent, due largely to an 
increase in the Consumer Brands business unit."
"We spent a total of 580 million euros for research and devel-
opment."
"The ratio to sales, at 2.7 percent, increased slightly year on year."
"Administrative expenses totaled 
1,056 million euros in fiscal 2023 following 1,010 million euros in the previous year."
"At 4.9 percent, adminis-
trative expenses as a percentage of sales were slightly higher year on year."
"Other operating income and expenses 
At 11 million euros, the balance of adjusted other operating income and expenses decreased year on year 
(2022: 77 million euros)."
"The change compared to the previous year was essentially due to lower proceeds 
from the disposal of various business activities, higher currency losses from operations, and lower proceeds 
from the reversal of provisions."
"Due to higher interest rates, increased US dollar financing costs in particular had a 
negative impact here, countervailed primarily by higher interest income in other currencies."
"Income before tax, net income and earnings per share (EPS) 
Income before tax increased from 1,689 million euros in the previous year to 1,888 million euros."
"Taxes on 
income amounted to 549 million euros (2022: 436 million euros)."
"The tax rate of 29.1 percent was higher 
year on year (2022: 25.8 percent)."
"At 25.5 percent, the adjusted tax rate was slightly above the prior-year level 
(2022: 25.2 percent)."
"Net income increased by 6.9 percent to 1,340 million euros (2022: 1,253 million euros)."
"After allowing for 22 million euros attributable to non-controlling interests, net income attributable to share-
holders of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA amounted to 1,318 million euros, 4.7 percent above the prior-year figure 
(2022: 1,259 million euros)."
"Adjusted net income after deducting non-controlling interests was 1,819 million 
euros compared to 1,664 million euros in fiscal 2022, representing an increase of 9.3 percent year on year."
"A condensed version of the annual financial statements of the parent company of the Henkel Group – Henkel 
AG & Co."

Free cash flow totaled 2,603 million euros, representing a significant increase compared to the previous year 
(2022: 653 million euros)."
"This was due in particular to the much higher cash flow from operating activities 
resulting from higher operating profit and lower net working capital."
"As a result, the net financial position 
improved significantly to 12 million euros (December 31, 2022: -1,267 million euros)."
"Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) 
Return on capital employed adjusted for one-time income and expenses, and for restructuring expenses 
(adjusted ROCE) increased significantly year on year from 10.5 percent to 12.0 percent, mainly as a result of 
higher adjusted operating profit."
"Economic Value Added (EVA®) 
Economic Value Added (EVA®) decreased to 141 million euros (2022: 267 million euros), with the improved 
operating profit not fully offsetting the higher cost of capital in the wake of globally higher interest rates."
"In 
addition, EVA was impacted by the loss from the divestment of our business activities in Russia in April 2023 
and the resulting lack of a positive contribution to earnings."
"Comparison between actual business performance and guidance  
In light of business performance and evolving assumptions regarding further business development, the 
Management Board of Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA updated its guidance for fiscal 2023 over the course of the year.
"The results for fiscal 2023 are compared below against the guidance that was last updated on Novem-
ber 9, 2023."
"At 4.2 percent, organic sales growth of the Henkel Group was in the upper half of our forecast range of 3.5 to 
4.5 percent."
"Organic sales growth in the Adhesive Technologies business unit was 3.2 percent, also in the 
upper half of the forecast range of 2.5 to 3.5 percent."
"At 6.1 percent, organic sales growth in the Consumer 
Brands business unit was slightly above the forecast range of 5.0 to 6.0 percent."
"Adjusted return on sales in Adhesive Technologies was 
14.7 percent and therefore in the upper half of our forecast range of between 14.0 and 15.0 percent."
"In 
Consumer Brands, adjusted return on sales, at 10.6 percent, was also in the upper half of the forecast range 
between 10.0 and 11.0 percent."
"Adjusted earnings per preferred share at constant exchange rates increased by 20.0 percent, which was in 
the middle of the expected bandwidth of +15.0 to +25.0 percent."
"Beyond these key indicators, we had forecasted restructuring expenses in 2023 of around 300 million euros."
"At 267 million euros, restructuring expenses were slightly lower than expected."
"Cash outflows from invest-
ments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets were predicted to be around 650 million euros."
"At 613 million euros, this spend was also slightly lower than expected."
"As experts for industrial applications in more than 800 industries, we 
work closely with our customers and partners."
"Our strong technology 
portfolio results in customized solutions in our Mobility & Electronics, 
Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Craftsmen, Construction & Pro-
fessional business areas."

"In fiscal 2023, Henkel optimized the organizational structure within its Adhesive Technologies business unit 
in order to use scale and competence benefits even more efficiently, while at the same time ensuring close 
customer and market proximity."
"The new structure comprising the three business areas Mobility & Electronics, 
Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Craftsmen, Construction & Professional was already reflected in the 
reporting on the first quarter of 2023 and is fully established."
"In the Mobility & Electronics business area, we offer our international customers tailor-made solutions and 
specialized technical services in the automotive and electronics industries as well as for industrial key accounts."
"In doing so, we create added value for our customers at the interface of technology, semiconductors, auto-
mobiles and industrial goods."
"With our technology portfolio and market expertise, we deliver responses to 
global trends such as electrification, connectivity and autonomous driving."
"We also enable our customers in 
achieving their sustainability goals by ensuring that our solutions require fewer fossil raw materials during 
further processing."
"In the Packaging & Consumer Goods business area, we distribute innovative solutions for manufacturers 
of consumer goods and branded products around the globe."
"Building on strong, long-lasting and trusting 
business relationships, our high-impact solutions add value to branded and customer products."
"With our 
technology portfolio and market expertise, we address global consumer trends such as sustainability and 
promotion of a circular economy, while striving to achieve the maximum possible levels of food safety."
"In the Craftsmen, Construction & Professional business area, we offer high-impact solutions for private 
consumers and craftsmen, the construction sector, and for manufacturing and professional maintenance in 
more than 800 industry segments."
"We develop innovations for transformative products and customer 
solutions on strong global brand platforms."
"In doing so, we shape global trends, such as sustainability and 
digitalization – from sustainable construction and DIY to predictive maintenance and smart production 
processes."
"In addition to optimizing its organizational structure, the Adhesive Technologies business unit – which has 
been under leadership of Mark Dorn as the responsible Executive Vice President since February 2023 – further 
developed its portfolio."
"In recent years, Henkel has steadily expanded its portfolio of maintenance, repair and 
overhaul (MRO) solutions."
"This transaction represents an important step toward significantly strengthening 
our existing MRO portfolio with the addition of innovative solutions in adjacent applications in a dynamically 
growing market."
"Our aim is to create a new platform for adding further adjacent businesses, stimulating 
growth and strengthening our position as global leader in adhesive technologies."
"At the same time, we have optimized our portfolio and divested our European impregnation, sealants and 
adhesives business for cast and electronic components.1 
We also drove forward relevant innovations under our largest brands in the year under review."
"Fiscal 2023 
thus saw us realize more than 75 percent of all sales with our five technology-based brand clusters for 
industrial customers and our four biggest brands for consumers."
"The proportion of Adhesive Technologies 
sales from products successfully launched onto the market in the last five years was around 25 percent."
"Here, 
the innovation centers operated by the business unit played a key role."
"Our Inspiration Center Düsseldorf (ICD), 
opened in 2022, has enhanced the innovative strength of Henkel."
"In 2023, we launched a state-of-the-art 
application center for electric vehicle battery technologies at this center."
"At the same time, we opened a 
further innovation center in Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA, and made good progress in the construction 
of our innovation center in Shanghai, China, in order to further expand our approach of customer-oriented 
development."
"1 This divestment had no material impact on the net assets, financial position or results of operations of the Henkel Group."
"Optimization of solvent-free 
adhesive for sustainable 
packaging 
The optimized packaging adhesive 
makes it easier for manufacturers 
to switch to a more sustainable 
solvent-free alternative while 
maintaining quality and a sophis-
ticated appearance."
"At the same 
time, a high standard of food safety 
is guaranteed."
"First bio-based polyurethane 
adhesives for load-bearing 
timber construction 
The two new solutions for load-
bearing timber construction have 
been developed using bio-based 
materials, aiming to significantly 
reduce CO2-equivalent emissions 
compared to their fossil alternatives."
"By using bio-based solutions, 
Henkel is helping to drive transfor-
mation in the construction industry."
"Year on year, the global industrial production index (IPX) gained 
around 1 percent, a less dynamic performance compared to what was expected at the start of the year."
"By 
contrast, automotive production increased significantly year on year, exceeding the growth forecast from the 
beginning of the year."
"For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, production volumes in the 
automotive industry exceeded the pre-crisis level of 2019."
"In these volatile economic conditions, the Adhesive Technologies business unit delivered a good performance 
in 2023 overall."
"Sales performance 
Sales in the Adhesive Technologies business unit totaled 10,790 million euros in the year under review, 
-4.0 percent below the prior year in nominal terms."
Exchange rate effects had a negative impact of -4.3 percent.
Acquisitions/divestments reduced sales by a further -2.9 percent.
"adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments), sales increased by 3.2 percent."
This sales growth was driven by a very strong price development compared to prior year.
"Volumes declined 
overall, mainly due to demand remaining muted in some key end markets."
"As the year progressed, however, 
volume development showed a sequential recovery, recording a stable level in the fourth quarter."
"This development was backed in particular 
by automotive production levels that increased as the year progressed."
"We generated growth stimulus in 
particular in the field of electromobility."
"The Industrial business demonstrated strong sales performance 
throughout fiscal 2023."
"The Electronics business, by contrast, showed a declining development due to con-
tinued muted demand – not least as a result the market environment in China that remained strained."
"The Packaging & Consumer Goods business area recorded a negative organic sales development of 
-2.4 percent."
"In both businesses, this performance was due to high comparison figures from the previous
year and to weaker market development."
"Especially in the Packaging business, the fact that the prior year
had been characterized by above-average demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic was noticeable
throughout the reporting period."
"Sales in the Consumers & Craftsmen business grew strongly over 
both halves of the year, whereas the General Manufacturing & Maintenance business recorded a weakening 
development as the year progressed, although still posting a strong sales increase for fiscal 2023 as a whole."
"The Construction business also generated strong organic sales growth despite continued soft market devel-
opment."
"Sales by business area 2023 
Organic sales development by region 
From a regional perspective, the Adhesive Technologies business unit generated good organic sales growth 
in Europe."
"Over the course of the year, the Mobility & Electronics business area was able to offset the nega-
tive development in the Packaging & Consumer Goods business area."
"The North America region generated 
positive organic sales growth that was also driven by the Mobility & Electronics business area."
"In the IMEA 
region, the Adhesive Technologies business unit achieved double-digit organic sales growth, to which all 
business areas contributed."
"Latin America also posted double-digit organic sales growth, with the Mobility 
& Electronics business area as the biggest contributor."
"In contrast, organic sales development in the Asia-
Pacific region was negative across all business areas, mainly due to the strained market environment in China."
"Adjusted return on sales 
increased year on year by 110 basis points to 14.7 percent."
"The significant increase in gross margin was 
driven mainly by higher prices combined with measures to reduce costs and increase efficiency in order to 
continue offsetting persistently elevated material prices."
"At 11.9 percent, net working capital as a percentage of sales was lower compared to prior year."
"Adjusted 
return on capital employed (adjusted ROCE) increased to 16.4 percent, mainly as a result of the higher 
adjusted operating profit."
"Economic Value Added (EVA®) decreased to 359 million euros, mainly due to the 
significantly higher cost of capital against the background of globally higher interest rates compared to the 
prior year."
"Our focus is on 
the two global business areas Laundry & Home Care and Hair, and on 
the business area Other Consumer Businesses, which is present in selec-
tive markets."
"Our portfolio comprises laundry detergents and household 
cleaners, and hair styling, hair coloring, and hair care products for both 
the Consumer and Professional businesses, together with body care 
products."
"In all business areas, we offer relevant innovations that create 
added value for our customers and consumers."
"We distribute our 
products through brick-and-mortar stores, hair salons and digital 
channels."

"In all business areas, we hold leading positions in numerous 
markets and categories, and feature a strong brand portfolio."
"In the Laundry & Home Care business area, we operate globally, offering a broad product portfolio."
"The 
Laundry Care business is comprised of the fabric cleaning and fabric care products, plus laundry additives."
"Our 
products address a wide range of consumer needs, from deep cleaning and sensitive product variants to 
fabric care across different price tiers."
"The portfolio in our Home Care business covers a range of catego-
ries – from dishwashing and hard surface cleaners to toilet cleaners."
Our Hair business area is also represented globally – both in the Consumer and Professional businesses.
"We 
are active with various brands covering hair care, hair colorants and hair styling products, and appeal to a 
broad base of consumers."
"We offer comprehensive expertise and innovative technologies that are employed 
in both the Consumer and Professional businesses."
"In the business area Other Consumer Businesses, we are primarily active in the Body Care category in 
selective markets, such as North America and Europe."
"By merging our consumer goods businesses and driving the further integration of the Consumer Brands 
business unit, we are laying the foundation for further profitable growth."
"We are focusing the portfolio on 
strategic businesses and brands with attractive growth and margin potential."
"In the course of the integration, 
we aim to leverage significant synergies to enhance profitability, with some of the savings being used for 
reinvestment into innovations, sustainability and digitalization, and also to strengthen our brands."
"Details on 
the strategic objectives associated with the creation of the integrated business unit Consumer Brands can be 
found on pages 99 to 101."
"In 2023, we continued driving the integration of our consumer businesses and 
were able to implement numerous measures at a faster pace than anticipated."
"In 2023, we consistently pushed ahead with streamlining our 
portfolio: Since announcing the merger of our consumer businesses, we have divested or discontinued busi-
nesses and brands representing total sales of around 650 million euros."
"For example, last year, we divested 
our air freshener business in North America and also smaller brands in Europe."
"At the same time, we strength-
ened our portfolio by acquiring the sustainable Laundry & Home Care brand Earthwise in New Zealand."
"In 
January 2024, Henkel also signed an agreement to acquire the Vidal Sassoon brand and the associated con-
sumer hair care business in China from Procter & Gamble."
"The acquisition strengthens our Consumer Brands 
business in China and expands our hair care portfolio in an attractive market."
"The business generated sales 
of more than 200 million euros in Procter & Gamble’s 2022/2023 financial year."
"Henkel had also announced that the merger of the consumer businesses would affect around 2,000 jobs 
globally – mainly in sales and administration."
"Corresponding agreements covering this number had been 
concluded by year-end 2023."
We now expect net savings totaling around 275 million euros by the end of 2024.
"At the same time, we 
have invested in our businesses, further strengthening our brands and innovations."
"For example, we signifi-
cantly increased our marketing, selling and distribution spend in the Consumer Brands business unit in 2023."
"The effect of the stronger focus of our portfolio and the enhanced marketing support for our brands is already 
visible, for example, in improved growth momentum."
"In the Hair business area, for example, where the 
portfolio measures have already progressed further, volume development was positive in 2023."
"We were 
also able to expand market shares in the Hair Styling category globally."

The second phase of integration is focusing on optimizing the production and logistics network."
"Here, too, 
we were resolute in implementing corresponding measures in 2023, including the consolidation of the 
production network for the European Hair and Body Care businesses."
"In North and Latin America, we have 
consolidated our logistics structures and have driven forward the insourcing of toll/contract manufacturing."
"In addition, we rolled out the 1-1-1 principle in initial countries: Applying this “one face to the customer” 
approach, we are driving commercial integration with optimized logistics processes based on one order, one 
shipment, one invoice."
"Of the previously announced annual net savings target of at least 150 million euros by the end of 2026, 
around 80 million euros had already been realized by the end of 2023."
"Due to the implementation of the 
savings measures, which exceeded original expectations, we now anticipate annual savings of around 
250 million euros by the end of 2026 (previously at least 150 million euros)."
We also fostered relevant innovations under our strong brands – such as Persil or Schwarzkopf.
"In 2023, the 
business unit generated around 50 percent of its sales with its top 10 brands."
"The proportion of sales from 
products successfully launched onto the market in the last three years was around 55 percent."
"It not only removes 
stubborn stains, it also gives a hy-
gienic freshness to the washing 
machine by removing unpleasant 
odors."
"Relaunch of the  
got2b hair styling brand  
We totally revamped our styling 
brand got2b, which focuses on 
young consumers, in more than 35 
countries."
"In addition to a modern-
ized and sophisticated design, the 
products now feature vegan for-
mulas, natural ingredients and  
more sustainable packaging."
"This market growth continued to 
be characterized by considerably higher consumer prices in response to overall inflationary pressure, with 
volumes declining."
"The global laundry detergents and household cleaners market of relevance for the Laundry & Home Care 
business area showed significant growth year on year."
"Growth in the laundry care area was very strong, 
driven mainly by double-digit market growth in the fabric care category."
"The home care market recorded 
significant growth driven primarily by a double-digit increase in the dishwashing category."
The consumer markets of relevance for the Hair business area demonstrated very strong growth overall.
"This

care categories also showed a very strong performance."

significant growth in 2023."

"Sales performance 
Sales in the Consumer Brands business unit totaled 10,565 million euros in the year under review, and was thus 
-3.3 percent below the prior year in nominal terms."
Foreign exchange effects reduced sales by -4.4 percent.
"Acquisitions/divestments also had a negative impact of -5.1 percent on sales, mainly due to the disposal of
our business activities in Russia."
"adjusted for foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestments), sales increased by 6.1 percent."
"This sales growth was driven by double-digit price increases, while volumes declined, due in part to continued 
portfolio optimization measures."
"Volume development did, however, show a significant sequential improvement 
in the second half of the year."
"The very strong organic sales growth in the Laundry Care business was driven 
particularly by double-digit growth in the Fabric Care category and very strong growth in the Fabric Cleaning 
category."
"Our brands Perwoll and Persil made a substantial contribution to this growth, boosted by relevant 
innovations such as Persil Deep Clean, by the expansion of Perwoll and by strong media support."
"Our North 
American brands all and Purex also achieved very strong sales growth."
"The very strong organic sales growth 
in the Home Care business was driven mainly by a double-digit increase in the Dishwashing category."
"Our 
core brand Pril made a substantial contribution to this growth, posting a significant double-digit increase."

The Hair business area achieved significant organic sales growth of 8.9 percent."
"The Consumer business 
generated double-digit growth that was mainly driven by the Hair Colorants and Hair Styling categories fea-
turing our core brands got2b, Palette and Taft."
"Here, again, we reaped the benefits of innovative products, 
particularly in the Hair Styling category."
The Hair Care category achieved strong organic growth.
"The Profes-
sional business was able to continue its positive performance from the previous year and delivered very

an improved formula."
"At 0.2 percent, the business area Other Consumer Businesses recorded a flat organic sales development 
overall."
"The North America region achieved very strong growth, driven by the Dial brand."

unit."

increased our marketing and advertising spend versus prior year, aimed at strengthening our brands and 
businesses."
"Adjusted return on sales reached 10.6 percent, representing an increase of 220 basis points com-
pared to the previous year – despite the lack of the positive contribution to earnings from the business 
activities in Russia, which were divested in April 2023."
Net working capital as a percentage of sales improved year on year to -6.5 percent.
"At 9.6 percent, adjusted 
return on capital employed (adjusted ROCE) increased significantly versus prior year, due mainly to improved 
adjusted operating profit."
"Economic Value Added (EVA®) was -116 million euros following -363 million euros 
in the previous year."
"The positive impact of the improved operating profit was offset by the higher cost of 
capital due to globally high interest rate levels."
"Expenses (including restructuring expenses) relating to the 
further integration of our consumer businesses continued to have an adverse impact, albeit to a much lesser 
degree compared to 2022."
"Effective November 1, 2023, we acquired in our Adhesive Technologies business unit all the shares in 
the US-American company Composite Technology Intermediate, Inc."

"(formerly: OOO Henkel 
Rus), which was responsible for the operations of both business units in Russia."
"In fiscal 2022, Russian business 
contributed about 5 percent to Group sales."
"At the time of completion, the transaction produced a cash 
inflow of 615 million euros, which was mainly attributable to the purchase price received for the transaction."
The cash inflow also included a deferral for the use of trademark rights.
"The divestment resulted in a net loss 
before taxes of 210 million euros."
Henkel has the option of buying back the business.
"The call option can be 
exercised for the first time in 2026 and expires in ten years."
"Active portfolio management continues to be an essential element in determining the future strategic 
direction of the Henkel Group."
"Both the acquisition and sale of trademark rights and businesses are integral 
to our strategy."
"In fiscal 2023, Henkel disposed of some of its small local and regional consumer goods busi-
nesses in its Consumer Brands business unit."
"In addition, on November 1, 2023, we sold all shares in our 
German subsidiary Henkel Loctite-KID GmbH and the associated European impregnation, sealant and adhe-
sives business for cast and electronic components that was part of the Adhesive Technologies business unit."

not have any material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Henkel Group."
"Acquisitions and divestments in the year under review did not result in any material changes in the business 
and organizational structure of the Henkel Group."

In the reporting period, capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) amounted to 613 million euros (previous 
year: 600 million euros)."

euros) in the Adhesive Technologies business unit, and 264 million euros (previous year: 299 million euros) 
in the Consumer Brands business unit."
"We invested 53 million euros in intangible assets (previous year: 
51 million euros)."
"Most of the expenditure was channeled into expansion projects, innovations and streamlining measures, 
which included, for example, increasing our production capacity, introducing innovative product lines and 
optimizing our supply chain."
"The acquisitions resulted in additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the amount 
of 507 million euros."
"Details of these additions can be found on pages 242 to 254 of the notes to the consol-
idated financial statements."
"In 2023, the

the consolidated financial statements."
"Under non-current assets, intangible assets decreased by 117 million euros in total to 16,991 million euros."
"Additions of 549 million euros from acquisitions and capital expenditures were offset primarily by negative 
currency effects (453 million euros), scheduled amortization (117 million euros) and impairment (56 million 
euros)."
"At 3,732 million euros, property, plant and equipment was below the level at year-end 2022 
(3,911 million euros)."
"Current assets totaled 9.3 billion euros, a decrease compared to year-end 2022 (10.4 billion euros)."
"Invento-
ries and other current financial assets decreased by 737 million euros and 283 million euros respectively."
"The development of inventories was caused by various factors, such as negative currency effects, efficiency 
measures in inventory management, and portfolio measures."
"The change in other financial assets was pre-
dominantly due to lower receivables both from Henkel Trust e.V."
"and from external pension funds, and also 
to lower fair values in respect of derivatives."
"In addition, income tax refund claims decreased by 137 million 
euros and other assets by 155 million euros."
"The development in other assets was primarily due to lower tax 
receivables compared to the previous year."
"Countervailing this, cash and cash equivalents increased by 
863 million euros."
"Details on the development of cash and cash equivalents are discussed in the section on 
our financial position on pages 144 and 145."
"In addition, the assets held for sale in current assets decreased 
by 631 million euros due in particular to the divestment of the business activities in Russia in fiscal 2023."
"For 
further discussion of the assets held for sale, please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on pages 261 to 263."
"Equity including non-controlling interests totaled 20.0 billion euros, slightly down compared to year-end 
2022 (20.2 billion euros)."
"The net income of 1,340 million euros increased equity, whereas dividend pay-
ments in particular, as well as the currency translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries, had the 
countervailing effect of reducing equity by 783 million euros and 409 million euros respectively."
"Following 
purchases under our share buyback program in fiscal 2023, the value of our treasury shareholdings has 
increased by 186 million euros."
"The individual components influencing equity development are shown in 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity in tables on pages 214 and 215."
"Non-current liabilities totaled 4.0 billion euros as at December 31, 2023, and were thus on a par with the 
level at year-end 2022."
The composition of same was comparable to that of the previous year.
"Compared to year-end 2022, current liabilities decreased by 1.4 billion euros to 7.8 billion euros in total."
"Other provisions increased by 165 million euros, whereas current borrowings decreased by 652 million euros, 
due mainly to the repayment of a bond with a nominal volume of 330 million Swiss francs and to the reduc-
tion of our commercial paper liabilities."
"In addition, trade accounts payable and income tax liabilities both 
decreased – by 546 million euros and 120 million euros respectively."
"Liabilities held for sale in an amount of 
177 million euros at year-end 2022 were derecognized following divestment of the business activities in 
Russia in fiscal 2023."
"The higher cash flow was primarily due to the 
higher operating profit, lower income tax payments and a reduction in net working capital1."
"Cash flow from 
operating activities in fiscal 2022 was impacted by an increase in net working capital resulting mainly from a 
higher value of inventories due to higher prices."
"Year on year, the ratio of net working capital to sales decreased 
by 1.9 percentage points to 2.6 percent in fiscal 2023."
"In fiscal 2023, cash flow from investing activities showed a cash outflow of -684 million euros, while in the 
prior-year period the Henkel Group recorded a cash outflow of -200 million euros."
"Further discussion of the acquisitions and divestments in 2023 can be found 
in the “Acquisitions and divestments” section on page 138."
"Moreover, cash flow in fiscal 2022 included pro-
ceeds from realized gains on current cash deposits recognized under other current financial assets."
"At -1,754 million euros in fiscal 2023, the cash outflow in cash flow from financing activities was lower 
year on year (2022: -1,905 million euros)."
"Payments made to reduce our commercial paper liabilities were 
higher in the year under review than in the previous year."
"Cash and cash equivalents increased compared to December 31, 2022 by 863 million euros to 
1,951 million euros."
"At 2,603 million euros, free cash flow was significantly up year on year (2022: 653 million euros), due in 
particular to the higher cash flow from operating activities in the period under review."
"1 Inventories plus payments on account, trade accounts receivable and receivables from suppliers, less liabilities to customers, 
trade accounts payable and current sales provisions."
"Financing and capital management 
The financing of the Group is centrally managed by Henkel AG & Co."
"Funds are, as a general rule, 
obtained centrally and distributed within the Group."
"Our financial management is based on the financial 
ratios defined in our financial strategy (see table of key financial ratios on page 146)."
"We pursue a conserva-
tive and flexible investment and borrowings policy with a balanced investment and financing portfolio."
"The pri-
mary goals of our financial management are to secure the liquidity and creditworthiness of the Group, to-
gether with ensuring access at all times to the capital market, and to generate a sustainable improvement in 
shareholder value."
"Measures deployed in order to achieve these aims include optimization of our capital structure, adoption of 
an appropriate dividend policy, equity management and long-term debt reduction."
"Our capital needs and 
capital procurement activities are coordinated to ensure that requirements with respect to earnings, liquidity, 
security and independence are taken into account and properly balanced."
"In fiscal 2023, Henkel paid the same dividends as in 2022 on both ordinary and preferred shares."
"Cash flows 
not required for capital expenditures, dividends and interest payments were used to acquire treasury shares 
under our share buyback program, and to fund acquisitions."
"We covered our short-term financing requirement 
primarily through commercial paper."
"Our multi-currency commercial paper program is additionally secured 
by a syndicated credit facility."
"The Henkel Group had access to confirmed credit lines of 1.6 billion euros that 
remained unutilized as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 1.6 billion euros)."
"Our credit rating is regularly assessed by the rating agencies S&P, Moody’s and Scope Ratings."
"As in previous 
years, our ratings remain within the “single A” target corridor."
"This is a good rating in the prime investment 
grade segment."
"Our 
short-term ratings are on the highest possible level in each case."
"This ensures our continued unrestricted 
access to the money and capital markets and to favorable financing terms and conditions."
"As of December 31, 2023, our borrowings totaled 2,269 million euros (previous year: 2,907 million euros)."
They mainly comprised bonds issued and commercial paper.
"Henkel’s financial risk management activities are explained in the risks and opportunities report on pages 
177 to 203."
"Further detailed information on our financial instruments can be found in the financial instru-
ments report on pages 286 to 319 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Key financial ratios 
Leverage in fiscal 2023 was 0.3 compared to 0.8 in 2022."
"The interest coverage ratio in the year under review 
was 26.3, following 35.0 in fiscal 2022."
"The equity ratio as at December 31, 2023 was 63.0 percent (previous 
year: 60.8 percent)."

Employees 
Our employees shape our company through their commitment, knowledge and skills."
"They are crucial for 
driving our long-term success."
"This is why strengthening a corporate culture characterized by close collabo-
ration and empowered people is an integral element of our strategic framework for purposeful growth."
"Open and appreciative leadership culture 
Building on shared values, our Leadership Commitments form the basis defining the conduct of our employees 
for bringing our purpose – “Pioneers at heart for the good of generations” – to life."
"The Leadership Commit-
ments are at the center of our initiatives and are firmly anchored in our HR processes and systems."
"We strongly believe that cultural change requires the commitment of all our people, which is why we support 
them by offering various learning formats – such as the “Iceberg Learning Module” – to help them to reflect 
on, and modify, their behavior."
"At the same time, cultural change requires greater transparency across all 
areas of leadership development."
"Hence, we have been guiding our top executives through a 360-degree 
coaching process that supports them as role models in creating an inspiring and modern work environment."
"To support our employees in fostering our cultural change, we launched the “Accelerate Cultural Transfor-
mation” (ACT) initiative in 2023."
"The aim is to encourage engagement across teams and to define specific 
measures."
"Development of employee numbers 
As of year-end 2023, around 47,750 people were employed at Henkel."
"The decline year on year is mainly 
due to the sale of our business activities in Russia and to the creation of our integrated Consumer Brands 
business unit."
"As part of the merger of the two former business units Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care, Henkel had 
announced back in 2022 that around 2,000 jobs globally would be affected in the first phase of integration."
Corresponding agreements covering this number were concluded by year-end 2023.
"In this process, we 
worked closely with the employee representative organizations in each country to identify socially responsible 
solutions."
"At all times during the entire change process, our support was based on open exchange with the 
relevant employees."
"We are convinced that a diverse workforce as well as an open and appreciative corporate 
culture are important success factors in a globalized world."
"Our ambition is to promote a culture of integra-
tion and to create equal opportunities in order to leverage the full potential of our diversity."
"We thus pursue a 
holistic approach encompassing different dimensions of diversity."
"To strengthen diversity, we pursue a clearly defined DEI strategy that is based on three main pillars: Firstly, we 
raise awareness for the various dimensions of diversity using different formats, such as campaigns and events."
"Secondly, we offer training programs for managers and employees to foster inclusive behavior."
"And thirdly, 
we are continuously improving the general structural conditions, for example through offerings to promote 
work-life balance in order to eliminate structural barriers, with clear targets defined for progress tracking."
One of our strategic diversity dimensions is gender diversity.
"We have set ourselves the goal of steadily in-
creasing the proportion of women at all levels of the company, and are pursuing the ambition of achieving 
gender parity across all management levels by 2025."
"In 2023, the proportion of women in management in-
creased to 39.5 percent."
"Internationality is also a natural part of the world of work at Henkel: We are represented by 124 nationalities 
operating in 76 countries."
More than 80 percent of our workforce operate outside Germany.
"Energized and empowered teams 
We enhance our employees’ skills and knowledge and help them to reach their full potential – on the basis 
of regular development meetings, transparent feedback and individual development plans."
"This enables us 
to systematically identify and develop talents within the company and ensure internal succession planning."
"Individual upskilling measures and possible career steps are also discussed as part of our globally standardized 
assessment process."
"Digital learning programs and the development of digital skills also play a key role – 
by year-end 2023, we had reached more than 44,300 employees through our digital learning platform."
"Our holistic Smart 
Work concept forms the global framework for mobile working, and shows how our office landscapes might 
better support collaboration among our people, what improvements our health program can bring and 
which additional opportunities are offered by digitalization."
"An online program developed in 2023 gives all 
employees the chance to not only embrace Smart Work as a concept but also to put it into the best possible 
practice, both as individuals and in teams."
"As part of our global campaign entitled “Dare to make an 
impact?” we offer authentic insights into our working world on our Careers webpage, on social media and 
face-to-face at events."
The positive response is reflected by our position in employer rankings and ratings.
"We give due consideration to locally different training paths for in-house training and the professional 
development of our people."
We offer 26 apprenticeship and five dual-track study programs in Germany.
"In 2023, we welcomed 131 new apprentices and dual-track students as they began working toward a profes-
sional qualification at Henkel."
We also offer a range of trainee programs in selected emerging markets.
"Hence, we provide manifold development opportunities for our employees."
These items all fall under the general category of direct materials.
"Examples include 
washing-active substances (surfactants), adhesive components, cardboard boxes and external bottling services."
"Aside from supply and demand, the prices of direct materials are mainly determined by the prices of the 
input materials used to manufacture them."
"In 2023, prices for direct materials rose by a low single-digit 
percentage on average compared to the previous year."
"The year-on-year increase in prices for direct 
materials was mainly attributable to rising labor costs and in parts still elevated logistics and energy costs."
Our direct material spend was down significantly year on year at 8.2 billion euros (2022: 10.7 billion euros).
"The decrease versus prior year is primarily due to declining volume development in 2023 and to the disposal 
of our business activities in Russia."
"In addition, savings from our global procurement strategy, measures 
to reduce costs, and improvements in production and supply chain efficiency helped to offset both persistently 
high direct material prices and negative currency effects."
These account for 37 percent of all direct material expenditures.
Our five largest suppliers represent 14 percent of purchasing volume in direct materials.
"At 6.4 billion euros, the spend for indirect materials and services in 2023 was slightly below 
the prior-year level (2022: 6.7 billion euros)."
"We continuously optimize our value chain to further improve our level of quality and efficiency and to secure 
material supplies."
"In addition to negotiating new, competitive contract terms and conditions, our ongoing 
measures to reduce total procurement expenditures is a major factor in the success of our global purchasing 
strategy."
"We enter into long-term business relationships with selected suppliers to foster the development 
of innovations, and to optimize manufacturing costs and logistics processes."
"We also agree and implement 
individual targets with our strategic suppliers aimed at optimizing the supply of both direct and indirect 
materials and services."
"Risk management is an important component of our purchasing strategy, especially 
against the backdrop of persisting uncertainties on the procurement markets."
"The emphasis here is on 
reducing price and supply risks while maintaining consistently high quality."
Sustainability plays a major role in our procurement strategy.
"As 
part of this initiative, we regularly perform sustainability assessments and audits of our strategic suppliers."

Production 
In 2023, Henkel manufactured products at 161 sites in 55 countries."
"Our largest production facilities are 
located in Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA, and in Düsseldorf, Germany."
"In Bowling Green, we manufacture 
laundry detergents and household cleaners."
"In Düsseldorf, we produce not only laundry detergents and 
household cleaners but also adhesives for consumers and craftsmen, and products for our industrial customers."

(at December 31) 
In 2023, we further aligned the global production network of our Adhesive Technologies business unit to 
the continuously changing requirements of the markets."
"Our current 122 production sites around the globe 
use cutting-edge manufacturing technologies to secure cost and quality benefits in production and to meet 
the requirements of our customers."
"We invest in improving our manufacturing and warehouse footprint in 
line with market development in all regions."
"While the acquisition of Critica Infrastructure in 2023 added further 
production sites, the total number decreased slightly compared to the previous year due to the divestment 
of our business activities in Russia and the consolidation of other production sites."
"Mid-2023, Henkel broke ground for a new Adhesive Technologies production site in the Asia-Pacific region 
with an investment volume of around 120 million euros."
"The plant will serve the demand from fast-growing 
industry sectors, such as electronics, medicine, appliance manufacturing and aviation."
"In 2023, the 
global production network of the Consumer Brands business unit comprised a total of 39 sites."
"Also here, the 
decrease versus prior year (42 sites) is essentially due to the divestment of the business activities in Russia."
"As the merger of our consumer businesses progresses, the second phase of integration is concentrating on 
optimizing our production and logistics network."
"This also encompasses 
transitioning formerly specific logistics and order management processes and systems to a shared customer-
oriented end-to-end structure."
"In line with the 1-1-1 principle – one order, one shipment, one invoice – 
products from the previously separate business units are to be captured in shared customer orders, prepared 
for shipment and shipped from shared warehouses."
"This principle had already been successfully implemented 
in initial countries in Europe by the end of 2023."
"In addition, the Consumer Brands business unit again launched relevant capital expenditure projects in 2023."
"These include the expansion of the production facilities for innovative detergent capsules in Serbia and the 
construction of a plant for compacting liquid detergents in the USA."
"In 2023, we continued fostering sustainability and digitalization as major cornerstones in both business 
units to ensure a future-ready production and logistics network."
"We made further progress toward our ambition of achieving a climate-positive greenhouse gas balance in 
production by 2030: By expanding our usage of renewable energies, Henkel converted additional plants to 
carbon-neutral production in 2023."
"These included, for example, our production sites in Shanghai, China, 
Montornès, Spain, Hannover, Germany, and Cairo, Egypt."
"Our plants also encompass comprehensive operating data 
acquisition, enabling us to ensure their operational efficiency and environmental compatibility."
"We have the 
environmental management systems at numerous sites externally certified."
"As of the end of 2023, around 
87 percent of our production volume was from sites certified to ISO 14001, the internationally recognized 
standard for environmental management systems."
We are also driving various Industry 4.0 initiatives in both business units.
"To this end, site-specific measures 
have been put in place to standardize, digitalize and link processes and components."
"Our aim is to ensure a 
continuous data exchange along the entire value chain – as the basis for optimized planning and resource 
provision, and for production and logistics efficiency."
"The ratio of R&D expenses to sales amounted 
to 2.7 percent (previous year: 2.5 percent)."
"Adjusted R&D expenditures totaled 580 million euros, following 
543 million euros the year before."
"The ratio of adjusted expenditures to sales was 2.7 percent (previous 
year: 2.4 percent)."
"In 2023, R&D expenditures were mainly attributable to internal personnel expenses."
"Our research and devel-
opment costs were fully expensed; in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), no 
product- or technology-related development costs were capitalized."
"On an annual average, around 2,750 employees worked in research and development (previous year: around 
2,700)."
This corresponds to approximately 6 percent of the total workforce.
"Our teams are composed of 
natural scientists – predominantly chemists – as well as material scientists, engineers and technicians."
"The capabilities of our employees and our investments form the foundation on which the success of our 
R&D activities is built."
"We continue to focus on highly efficient innovations and steadily reducing our 
resource consumption, while maintaining or improving performance."
"Strengthening research and development together 
The research and development experts in both business units align their project portfolios to the specific 
needs of their individual businesses."
"They work together on fundamental processes, basic innovations, 
evaluation of partners for innovation, and on sustainability."
"The Research and Development Committee is 
responsible for Group-wide coordination."
"The business units continually exchange on innovations in 
common areas of knowledge."
"As in previous years, activities in 2023 focused on the areas sustainability 
and digitalization."
"Contributing to sustainability 
Worldwide, growth and quality of life need to be decoupled from resource use and emissions."
"Our contribu-
tion here lies in the development of innovative products and processes that consume ever less resources 
while offering the same or better performance."
"It is therefore our ambition to ensure that each new product 
contributes to sustainable development."
"We want to offer consistently better solutions, products and services that also have a positive impact on the 
environment and society and thus contribute to creating value."
"Our focus in this respect is on three goals: 
In collaboration with our suppliers, we want to continuously improve the sustainability profile of the raw 
materials we use."
"We want to help our customers and consumers reduce their energy consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions through our innovations."
"And we want to ensure that our packaging fulfills con-
sumers’ performance expectations yet uses the least possible quantity of materials and the most sustainable 
solutions, and that it can be recycled once the product has been used."

In our innovation process, we use various tools to systematically analyze, measure and evaluate new prod-
ucts."
"Life cycle analyses, profiles of potential raw materials and packaging materials, and our many years of 
sustainability expertise enable us to identify and utilize improvement potential right from the start of the 
product development process."
"Open innovation and corporate venture capital 
Our innovations come from both internal and external sources and evolve from long-standing, successful 
partnerships."
The concept of open innovation therefore holds great significance for us.
"Accordingly, we 
constantly strive to intensify our efforts to involve customers, suppliers and other partners such as research 
institutes, universities or startups."
"By partnering with and investing in startups with digital or technological expertise, we are striving to gain 
access to strategically relevant new technologies, applications and business models."
"In 2023, we further 
expanded our activities in this field and strengthened our expertise base by investing in startup companies 
and venture capital funds."
"Research and development worldwide 
In addition to its central research laboratories, Henkel maintains research and development sites in all regions 
around the world as hubs for innovative problem-solving."
"Worldwide research and development activities 
are managed globally by the business units."
"Research-intensive base technologies are developed at a central 
location with optimal access to external resources."
"These base technologies are then applied in the regional 
research and development sites in the creation of customer- and market-specific innovations."
"At the same 
time, the research and development staff in the regional sites obtain information about specific problems for 
the next generation of innovations, while working in close contact with customers and consumers."
"The new 
base technologies needed for the relevant solutions are, in turn, developed centrally."
"Also in 2023, we focused our innovation activities and resources on further developing technologies and 
expanding partnerships aligned to key megatrends."
"These trends include sustainability, digitalization and 
mobility, as well as connectivity and urbanization."
"In addition to the existing innovation centers – our Inspiration Center Düsseldorf (ICD) in Europe 
and our innovation center Mumbai, India, in the IMEA region – we opened a new innovation center in 2023 
in Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA, to further enhance our innovation strength."
"At these innovation centers, the 
Adhesive Technologies business unit showcases its entire technology portfolio of adhesives, sealants and 
functional coatings and collaborates with customers from more than 800 industries to develop new, innovative 
and sustainable solutions."
"For 2024, the phased opening of the Inspiration Center Shanghai (ICS) is planned."
"With a floor area of 33,000 square meters, the ICS will accommodate more than 30 labs, a 300-square-meter 
customer center and more than 500 Henkel experts."
"In addition, we strengthened our development and 
application expertise in innovative battery technologies in 2023 – for example, in the field of e-mobility."
"Our 
new Battery Center at the Inspiration Center Düsseldorf incorporates two high-tech facilities: the application 
center for battery technologies in electric vehicles, and the battery test center."
"Building on this, we plan to 
establish a global network of application centers for battery technologies with future facilities located in the 
USA and China."
"Based on a shared digital platform, the network will aim to further foster seamless collabo-
ration between the global teams and automobile and battery manufacturers across regions."
"Across all business areas, the Adhesive Technologies business unit again launched relevant innovations onto 
the market in 2023."
Selected innovations are presented on page 124.
"In the Consumer Brands business unit, as part of the further integration of the former Laundry & Home 
Care and Beauty Care business units, the research and development activities were further merged in 2023."
"Against this backdrop, we further leveraged, in particular, the technological synergies, and increased the 
focus of our research and development activities on our global consumers – based on an optimized strategy."
"Our ambition is to be “Technological pioneers for tomorrow’s consumers.”  
To achieve this, we are continuing to drive the expansion of our research and development centers in the 
various regions."
"The latter enable an even better understanding of the needs of our 
consumers so that we can tailor our product developments and innovations to them."
"We also opened a 
J-Beauty Innovation Hub in Tokyo, Japan."
"This innovation center for the Professional business brings together
the expertise of Schwarzkopf and the Shiseido Professional business in Asia-Pacific, which was acquired in
2022."
"Cutting-edge research labs enable the development of products focusing on hair care and color
development for the Asian market."
We also drove innovations under our strong brands in the year under review.
"For example, we further devel-
oped our premium laundry detergent Persil."
"Thanks to an innovative enzyme-based technology, it is now 
also possible to minimize residues and the associated unpleasant odors in washing machines."
"This tech-
nology has been incorporated into liquid detergents and pre-dosed discs, as well as in powder detergents."
"At the same time, we have further improved the sustainability of our packaging portfolio for consumer 
products in the Consumer Brands business unit by increasing the proportion of recycled plastic."
Selected innovations in the Consumer Brands business unit are also presented on page 133.
"Patents and registered designs 
We hold around 10,500 patents to protect our technologies around the world."
"Approximately 4,800 patents 
are currently pending."
"And we have registered around 2,700 design patents to protect our intellectual property."

Marketing and distribution 
We put our customers and consumers at the center of what we do."
"We offer them superior benefit, quality 
and service, as well as attractive innovations of our brands and technologies."
"In doing so, we create 
sustainable value."
"The Adhesive Technologies business unit offers a broad and globally leading portfolio of adhesives, sealants 
and functional coatings."
"The success of our business is founded on groundbreaking innovations, tailor-made 
products and strong brands."
"Working closely with our customers and partners, we combine our innovation 
and technology leadership to create high-impact and sustainable solutions that are indispensable components 
in innumerable industrial and consumer goods around the world."
We develop global and regional marketing strategies for our brands and technologies.
"The resulting 
measures are implemented locally."
"Our branding strategy is strictly aligned to our five technology-based 
brand clusters for industrial customers – Loctite, Technomelt, Bonderite, Teroson and Aquence – and our 
four global core brands for consumers and craftsmen (Pritt, Loctite, Ceresit and Pattex)."
"With our team of more than 6,500 technical experts, we foster close, long-term relationships with our more 
than 100,000 customers and partners from more than 800 manufacturing and processing industry segments."
"We are thus able to obtain an in-depth understanding of an exceptionally wide range of applications across 
all markets."
"Since many of our solutions and technologies are integrated into technically highly complex 
processes and products, excellent technical customer service and thorough user training worldwide are of 
key importance."
"Retail customers and distributors serve the needs of private users, craftsmen and smaller industrial customers."
"We are 
also implementing this successful concept at other sites around the world."
"Henkel is, moreover, a founding member of Cofinity-X – a joint venture for accelerating the 
operation and introduction of applications developed by automotive network Catena-X."
"This enables, for 
example, a standardized approach to be used for the calculation of the carbon footprint of products and for 
the associated data exchange along the value chain."
"Not only through personal exchange but also in digital interaction, we aim to ensure outstanding customer 
experiences at all contact points around the globe."
"We have further expanded our virtual offerings and tech-
nologies."
"These include not just digital remote analysis and troubleshooting by our customer service experts, 
but also a growing program of online training courses and seminars, as well as other interactive formats."
"We 
have also further increased the range of products offered by our digital marketplace “Adhesives e-shop” to 
give customers from meanwhile more than 60 countries a user-friendly option for ordering online from our 
broad portfolio of specific product solutions tailored to their needs."
"We strive to optimize our approach to consumers and craftsmen through the continued use of classic adver-
tising campaigns coupled with measures to attract customers at the point of sale and with digital marketing 
formats."
"Leveraging our close customer relationships and our comprehensive technical expertise, we continue 
to offer tailored solutions and innovative branded products with sustainable added value for our customers."
"Our diverse and strong brand portfolio features several 
consumer goods categories focusing on laundry and home care products and hair products."
"We are concen-
trating on those markets, categories and brands in which we have strong expertise and where we see clear 
growth opportunities."
"With our innovation process consistently focused on our consumers, we launch relevant innovations under 
strong brands such as Persil, Schwarzkopf or all onto the market."
"We strive to ensure the systematic and 
early identification of consumer trends – for which we also evaluate digital data – and to translate them into 
relevant new products."
"In doing so, we concentrate on strengthening the brand equity and responding to 
consumer demand for products offering functional use and emotional added value."
"Here, we specifically 
cater to regional and local market conditions and consumer needs."
A particular focus area is on communication and hence marketing and advertising support.
"In fiscal 2023, we 
significantly increased our marketing spend in the Consumer Brands business unit in order to reach a broad 
consumer base, further strengthen our brands, and communicate the added benefits of our innovations."
"We 
managed these marketing expenditures on the basis of a detailed analysis aligned to our strategic priorities."
"We use a wide range of distribution channels to offer products to our consumers: in brick-and-mortar stores, 
for example, such as supermarkets, discount stores, drugstores and hypermarkets, but also on e-commerce 
channels and in hair salons."
"Data-based understanding of our customers and consumers that we gain 
through surveys and data compilation enables us to craft customized solutions and to create shared value-
adding potential for our partners across all distribution channels."
"On the basis of our leading market positions 
and global customer and consumer expertise, we serve as a strong partner for both brick-and-mortar and 
online retailers."
"These centers enable us to further 
deepen our relationships with customers both in brick-and-mortar retail and in the field of e-commerce, and to 
showcase our expertise to retail partners from around the globe."
"In our globally established Schwarzkopf 
Academies, we offer hairdressers value-adding services in the form of customer-focused seminars and continuous 
professional upskilling programs, which are used by numerous professionals around the world every year."
"The importance of sustainability in our relationships with customers and consumers continues to grow in 
both business units."
"Our customers expect their suppliers – and that includes Henkel – to ensure compliance 
with global environmental, safety, and social standards."
"Our standards and management systems, our many 
years of experience in sustainability reporting, and our leading positions awarded by external rating agencies 
all help us to convince our audience of our credentials in this domain."
"At the same time, the consistent 
implementation of our sustainability strategy strengthens both our brands and the reputation of our company 
in the marketplace."
"With our many years of experience in the field of sustainability, we are able to position 
ourselves as a leading partner for our customers in industry and commerce, to offer them solutions fit for 
the future and thereby to support them in achieving their own sustainability goals."

"KGAA 
(CONDENSED VERSION 
ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN 
COMMERCIAL CODE [HGB])1 
The annual financial statements of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA have been prepared in accordance with the rules 
and regulations of the German Commercial Code [HGB] and the German Stock Corporation Act [AktG]."
"Deviations from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) applicable to the Group arise particularly 
with respect to the methods of recognition and measurement of intangible assets, financial instruments and 
provisions."
"Operational activities  
Following the merger of the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business units into the new Consumer 
Brands business unit, Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA was operationally active in the two business units Adhesive 
Technologies and Consumer Brands in fiscal 2023, and in the Corporate segment."
"KGaA is 
also the parent company of the Henkel Group."
"As such it is responsible for defining and pursuing Henkel’s 
corporate objectives and also for the management, control and monitoring of Group-wide activities, including 
risk management and the allocation of resources."
"As of year-end 2023, some 8,600 people were employed 
at Henkel AG & Co."
The operating business of Henkel AG & Co.
"Only the Group approach can 
provide complete insight into these key financials (see the discussion of the management system and 
performance indicators applicable to the Henkel Group on page 105)."
1 The full financial statements of Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA with the auditor’s unqualified opinion are filed with the commercial register 
and accessible on the internet at www.henkel.com/reports."
"KGaA with its declared aim to ensure the reasonable 
participation of its shareholders in the net income of the Henkel Group."
The profit generated by Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA is dictated by its own operations, which are reflected in the 
sales figures, among other metrics."
"Profit levels are also influenced to a large degree by the operations of its 
subsidiaries."
Income from subsidiaries is a substantial contributor to the financial result of Henkel AG & Co.
Thus the financial situation of Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA generally corresponds to that of the Group as a whole, 
which is discussed in the section “Review of overall business performance” on page 111."
"Results of operations 
Performance of key financial performance indicators 
At 3,756 million euros, sales of Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA in 2023 declined compared to the previous year.
"Given the difficult economic and geopolitical environment, it was not possible to achieve the forecast of flat 
or slightly lower sales."
This was essentially due to lower sales in the Corporate segment.
"While gross profit 
improved in the fiscal year just ended, the balance of other operating income and expenses (other operating 
result) decreased, mainly as a result of higher pension expenses and costs relating to the divestment of the 
business activities in Russia."
"These latter expenses were offset by financial income from the disposal of the 
shares in the Russian subsidiary."
"Moreover, the profits transferred by affiliates increased, enabling us to 
exceed the forecast of an unchanged financial result."
"The higher financial result resulted overall in a higher 
unappropriated profit of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA, which thus exceeded the forecast of flat performance."
This flat sales performance was due to higher prices being negated by decreasing volumes.
"In fiscal 2023, the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business units were merged into the new 
Consumer Brands business unit."
"The Consumer Brands business unit achieved sales of 1,437 million euros in 
2023 (previous year equivalent: 1,422 million euros)."
"This sales growth was driven by positive price increases 
while volumes declined due, not least, to ongoing portfolio optimization measures."
"Sales in the Corporate segment decreased to 1,159 million euros in 2023 (previous year: 1,272 million euros)."
"This decline was mainly due to lower income from supply services rendered to external third parties in Düsseldorf 
and to lower licensing revenues from affiliates."

The operating result of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA decreased year on year by 100 million euros to -384 million 
euros."
"Gross profit improved, whereas the balance of other operating income and expenses (other operating 
result) decreased."
"Higher pension expenses in connection with payments into an external pension fund and 
expenses relating to the divestment of the business activities in Russia, in particular, had the effect of reduc-
ing profit."
"Expense items 
Compared to 2022, cost of sales decreased by 197 million euros to 2,635 million euros, due mainly to lower 
cost of materials in the wake of declining volumes."
"Gross margin increased year on year by 3.3 percentage 
points to 29.8 percent."
"At 811 million euros, selling and distribution expenses came in above the prior-year figure of 775 million euros."
"Their ratio to sales increased year on year by 1.5 percentage points to 21.6 percent, due mainly to higher 
advertising expenditure in the Consumer Brands business unit."
"Compared to 2022, general administrative expenses rose by 38 million euros to 346 million euros."
"The increase 
was mainly due to higher expenses relating to infrastructure services and to higher consulting and payroll 
costs."
The ratio to sales increased by 1.2 percentage points to 9.2 percent.
Expenditures for research and development increased by 8 million euros to 540 million euros.
"The ratio to 
sales rose compared to 2022 by 0.6 percentage points to 14.4 percent."
"On average, approximately 1,250 employees worked in research and development at Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA 
in 2023, supporting the development of innovative solutions for global application."
"The activities are managed 
globally by the business units."
"For an overview of the research and development activities, please refer to 
the information relating to the Henkel Group on pages 158 to 163."
"Restructuring expenses of 42 million euros, included in the expense items mentioned above, came in lower 
versus 2022 (109 million euros)."
"Restructuring expenses in 2022 had been impacted by personnel measures 
and external consultancy services relating particularly to the merger of the Laundry & Home Care and Beauty 
Care business units to create the new Consumer Brands business unit."
Other operating income decreased in 2023 by 7 million euros year on year to 440 million euros.
"The decline 
is due among other things to lower gains from disposals of assets and businesses."
"These were partially 
countervailed by higher proceeds from costs recharged to affiliates."
"At 247 million euros, other operating expenses in 2023 were up on the prior-year figure of 139 million euros."
"The increase was mainly due to higher pension expenses in connection with payments into an external pension 
fund, and expenses relating to the divestment of the business activities in Russia."
"Financial result 
Financial result rose from 1,021 million euros in 2022 to 1,635 million euros in 2023."
"The increase was essen-
tially due to a higher investment result stemming from the disposal of the shares in the Russian subsidiary and 
higher income from profit transfers from affiliated companies."
"In addition, the result was also affected by 
higher securities prices and the resulting higher income from financial investments held as plan assets."
"These 
effects were partially offset by a lower interest result compared to the previous year."
"Taxes on income 
Taxes on income amounted to -42 million euros in 2023, compared to -13 million euros in 2022."
The increase was mainly attributable to the higher financial result.
"In light of the higher net income for the year, the unappropriated profit increased by 439 million euros year 
on year to 2,181 million euros."
"Condensed balance sheet in accordance with the German Commercial Code [HGB] 
in million euros 
Dec."
"KGaA decreased compared to year-end 2022 by 113 million euros 
to 17,965 million euros."
"Non-current assets decreased by 342 million euros to 15,535 million euros, mainly due to a reduction in 
financial investments following, in particular, the redemption of a loan and the disposal of the shares in the 
Russian subsidiary."
The decrease was partially offset by the addition of shares in an affiliated company.
"Substantial capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2023 related to replacement and 
expansion investments."
"Current assets increased year on year from 2,137 million euros to 2,378 million euros in 2023, due mainly to 
higher short-term time deposits as of the reporting date."
"A decrease in receivables from affiliated companies 
and from Henkel Trust e.V."
had a countervailing effect.
"The latter relate to pension payments made by Henkel 
AG & Co."
KGaA to retirees for which reimbursement can be claimed from Henkel Trust e.V.
"The assets arising from the overfunding of pension obligations were 4 million euros lower year on year at 
9 million euros and essentially reflect the netting of the partial retirement obligations and associated plan 
assets."
The decrease was due to higher obligations on the reporting date.
"Equity increased from 6,368 million euros to 6,624 million euros due to the higher net income for the year."
"The increase was partially offset both by the dividend distribution and by the share buyback program that 
ended on March 31, 2023."
"In fiscal 2023, Henkel repurchased preferred shares for a total amount of 164 million 
euros and ordinary shares for a total amount of 24 million euros."
"The equity ratio increased by 1.7 percentage 
points to 36.9 percent."
The decrease is due to the obligation of Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA to make 
an additional contribution to the external pension fund in the event of a shortfall in pension obligations."
"For details of issued capital and treasury stock, please refer to the disclosures in the notes to the statutory 
financial statements of Henkel AG & Co."
"Year on year, liabilities and deferred income decreased overall in 2023 by 461 million euros to 10,246 million 
euros, as a result, among other things, of a smaller commercial paper commitment and also lower financial 
liabilities to affiliated companies."
"These items are also affected by the cash pool management function performed 
by Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA within the Henkel Group.
"The use of cash pools allows largely centralized manage-
ment of the Group’s liquidity, thus facilitating a high degree of financial flexibility."
"The repayment of the SFR-
denominated bond with a total volume of 330 million Swiss francs in April 2023 also had a decreasing effect."
"On the reporting date, Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA had six bonds on its books with a total volume of 1,864 million 
euros."
For an overview of the financing and capital management of Henkel AG & Co.

Risks and opportunities 
The business performance of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA is essentially subject to the same risks and opportunities 
as that of the Henkel Group."
"With respect to the risks affecting its subsidiaries, Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA is 
generally exposed in proportion to its shareholding in each case."
"Due to the different accounting and measurement methods for pension obligations under the German 
Commercial Code [HGB] and IFRSs, the conclusion drawn from the risk assessment for the annual financial 
statements of Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA differs from that of the Group.
"The Group risk assessment refers to the 
effect on equity whereas we see a risk for the income statement."
"We assess the potential financial impact of 
this risk for Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA as “high.” 
Additional information regarding risks and opportunities and the internal control and risk management system 
can be found on the following pages 177 to 203."
"Forecast 
The performance of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA in its function as an operating holding company is influenced 
primarily by the development and dividend distributions of the companies in which it has shareholdings."
"For 2024, we forecast sales at or slightly above the level of 2023 due to an expected slight increase in revenues 
in the Adhesive Technologies and Consumer Brands business units."
The performance for the Group also impacts Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA through dividend payments from 
subsidiaries."
"Assuming steady development of the financial result, we expect the unappropriated profit gener-
ated in 2024 by Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA to be higher year on year.
"This will enable our shareholders to 
participate to a reasonable extent in the Group’s net income, with retained earnings also available for 
utilization if necessary."
The forecast for the Henkel Group can be found on pages 204 to 207.
"We deploy an array of effective 
monitoring and control systems aligned to identifying risks at an early stage, evaluating the exposure, and 
introducing effective countermeasures."
"Entrepreneurial activity also involves identifying and exploiting opportunities as means of securing and 
extending the company’s competitiveness."
"The reporting aspect of our risk management system, however, 
does not encompass entrepreneurial opportunities."
"Early and regular identification, analysis and exploitation 
of opportunities are performed at the Group level and within the individual business units."
"This is a funda-
mental component of our strategy."
"We perform in-depth analysis of the markets and our competitors, and 
study the relevant cost variables and key success factors."
"Risk management system 
Our risk management system incorporates all organizational rules and measures for identifying, assessing, 
managing and communicating risks, including system monitoring."
"The risk management system at Henkel is 
integrated into the comprehensive planning, controlling, and reporting systems used in the subsidiaries, in 
the business units, and at Group level."
"Furthermore, within the corporate governance framework, our internal 
control and compliance management systems support our risk management capability."
"The interaction 
between the individual governance systems at Henkel and our assessment of the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the risk management system and the internal control system are discussed in the corporate 
governance statement on pages 60 to 65."

Within our risk strategy framework, the assumption of calculated risk is an intrinsic part of our business."
"However, risks that endanger the existence of the corporation must be avoided."
"When it is not possible to 
avoid these critical risks, they must be reduced or transferred, for example through insurance."
"Risks are 
controlled and monitored at the level of the subsidiaries, the business units, and the Group."
"Risk manage-
ment is thus performed with a holistic, integrative approach to the systematic handling of risks."
"The Group-
wide risk management process also includes relevant environmental and social risks."
"Our risk management 
system is continuously developed and adjusted to changing requirements."
Our Corporate Audit function regularly reviews the quality and efficiency of our risk management system.
"Risk reporting procedures 
The risk reporting system encompasses the systematic identification, evaluation, documentation and com-
munication of risks."
"We have defined the principles, processes and responsibilities relating to risk manage-
ment in a corporate standard that is binding on the Henkel Group."
"With the continuous development of our 
corporate standards and systems, we take into account updated findings."
"In 2023, we adjusted the evaluation 
categories for the short-term risks in respect of probability of occurrence and potential financial impact."
"We understand short-term risks as potential future developments or events that could lead to negative 
deviations from our earnings guidance."
"As a rule, we estimate risks for the one-year forecast period."
"Risks 
with a probability of occurrence of over 50 percent are taken into account in our guidance and short-term 
planning."
"Risk reports therefore include risks that are not included in – or which extend beyond – short-term 
planning."
"The annual short-term risk reporting process begins with identifying material risks using checklists 
based on defined risk categories."
"We evaluate the risks according to the probability of occurrence and potential 
loss after effective countermeasures (net), and collect additional information about the measures."
"Included 
in the risk report are risks with a loss potential of at least 1 million euros or 10 percent of the net external 
sales of a country, where the probability of occurrence is considered greater than zero."
"This also includes tail 
event risks where the likelihood of occurrence is judged to be very low but which could potentially cause 
huge damage."
"The first step entails determining gross risk to the extent that 
this is possible."
"We then calculate the net risk, taking countermeasures into account."
"Initially, risks are com-
piled on a decentralized, per-country basis, with the assistance of regional coordinators."
"The locally collated 
risks are then analyzed by experts in the business units and corporate functions."
"In particular areas such as 
Group Treasury, risks are determined with the support of sensitivity analyses including value-at-risk (VaR) 
computations."
"Risk analyses are then prepared for the respective executive committees of the business units 
and corporate functions, and finally assigned to an area-specific risk inventory."
"For the Henkel Group, we then 
aggregate the risks on the inventory using Monte Carlo simulation."
"For the purpose of determining resilience, 
we compare the VaR with our risk-bearing capacity."
"To supplement our short-term risk reporting process, we conduct strategic risk analysis for long-term risks 
with an analysis period of ten years."
"We understand long-term risks as possible future developments or 
events outside the forecasting period of one year which – separately or in combination – could potentially 
jeopardize the continued existence of the corporation as a going concern."
"Once a year, long-term risks are 
identified, subjected to qualitative assessment, and reviewed by selected in-house experts."
"The risks are 
then analyzed as a whole and assessed against our long-term risk-bearing capacity, keeping in mind the risk 
environment that is specific to Henkel."
"The risk situation is subsequently reported to our Compliance & Risk Committee, the Management Board 
and the various oversight bodies."
"Material unforeseen changes are reported immediately to the CFO and the 
Compliance & Risk Committee."
"Corporate Accounting is responsible for coordinating the overall risk reporting 
process and analyzing the inventoried exposures."
"A distinction is made between (geo-)political, (macro-)economic, 
social, technological, environmental, legal, and business-/industry-specific risks."
"As macroeconomic risks 
impact both our business-/industry-specific risks and our financial risks, we divide these influencing factors 
into two different risk categories."
"Long-term risks are compiled separately from the short-term risks and 
subjected to qualitative assessment."
"Short-term risks affecting our one-year forecast period are recorded 
and quantitatively assessed as part of the short-term risk reporting process, based on the following evaluation 
categories."
"Short-term risks are presented from a net perspective, i.e."
"with their respective mitigation measures taken 
into account."
"The probability of occurrence of legal and regulatory risks, which would have been classified as low in the 
2022 annual report if the adjusted evaluation categories had been used, has decreased to very low."
"In the following presentation of the risk categories, long-term risks are dealt with separately where they give 
rise to additional relevant assertions."
"In the short-term forecast period, Henkel as a globally operating Group is exposed to the risk of major 
political incidents in certain countries or regions resulting in a loss of assets."
"These risks could have a substantial impact on our sales and procurement 
markets and are therefore classified as business-/industry-specific risks."
"Measures: We closely monitor the countries concerned, taking external ratings into account, and ensure 
risk-optimized funding and the repatriation of liquidity that is not needed at present."
"Planned investments 
are also analyzed with regard to potential political risks, and appropriate requirements specified for the 
return on investment."
"If a major political incident occurs, early and targeted risk analysis is performed and 
mitigation measures are put in place."
"Here we make a distinction 
between procurement market risks, production risks, sales risks and markets risks."
"Macroeconomic risks – 
such as global economic and industry-specific developments – influence these risks to a substantial extent 
and are therefore classified under this risk category unless they tend to have a greater impact on our financial 
risks."
"Procurement market risks 
Description of risk: We expect prices for direct materials in our procurement markets to remain stable 
compared to the annualized average in 2022."
"Weak economic growth, higher inflation year on year, high 
rates of interest and signs of recessionary market trends in some regions could subdue demand in 2024."
"The 
war in Ukraine is expected to have a long-term impact on economic stability in Europe."
"Energy and gas 
price volatility, especially in Europe, could force manufacturers to throttle or cease production."
"The war in 
the Middle East is causing additional uncertainty in the marketplace."
"In 2023, the prices of most raw materials 
trended downward, mainly as a result of lower energy prices."
"This had positive effects along the supply chain – 
on the purchase of energy-intensive input products, for example, or indirectly through our toll/contract manu-
facturers."
"With energy costs remaining high, our suppliers are also facing increased operating costs."
"However, 
since the higher cost of energy is meanwhile incorporated into the first stages of the value chain, a higher 
risk is expected in respect of the raw materials, packaging materials and goods we purchase."
"The segments 
in the industrial goods sector are affected to a greater extent by price risks inherent in the performance of 
the global raw materials markets than the individual segments in the consumer goods sector."
"Prices differ 
among the various regional markets, with Europe being exposed to additional price and supply risks due to 
the war in Ukraine."
"Additional price and supply risks exist due to possible demand- or production-related shortages in the 
procurement markets, and may also have long-term impacts."
"The development of new business models may 
also produce shortages in the supply chain over the long term."
"In order to minimize the risk of supplier 
default, we perform detailed risk assessments of suppliers to determine their financial stability, and stipulate 
supplier default clauses."
"With the aid of an external, independent financial services provider, we continuously 
monitor important suppliers whose financial situation is regarded as critical."
"If a high risk of supplier default 
is identified, we systematically prepare back-up plans in order to ensure uninterrupted supply."
"Furthermore, 
we work in interdisciplinary teams within Research and Development, Supply Chain Management and Pur-
chasing on devising alternative formulations and packaging forms so as to be able to respond flexibly to 
unforeseen fluctuations in raw material prices."
"Supplier diversification also represents a key element in our risk 
management to prevent dependence on individual suppliers and ensure our ability to source at all times the 
goods and services we require."
"Finally, close collaboration with our strategic suppliers plays an exceptionally 
important role."
"The basis for our risk management approach is provided by a comprehensive procurement 
information system aimed at ensuring permanent transparency with respect to our purchasing volumes."
"Over 
the long term, we continually adapt our structures in response to developments on the procurement markets 
and the requirements of new business models, as well as in order to avoid shortages and bottlenecks along 
our supply chains."
"Production risks 
Description of risk: Henkel faces production risks in the event of low capacity utilization due to volume 
decreases and unplanned operational interruptions, especially at our single-source sites."
"Risks from unsched-
uled disruptions to operations could arise in the wake of cyber attacks on IT systems, extreme weather events, 
energy shortages or a regionally specific shortage of labor."
"In light of regional conflicts and aspirations to 
reduce economic ties between different economic areas, risks may still arise in the shape of disruptions to 
our supply chains, regional and national restrictions on production workflows and a reduced availability of 
labor."
The risk of insolvency among key suppliers could also impair our production processes in the short term.
"The development of new business models may also produce shortages and bottlenecks in the production 
chains over the long term."
"Production risks are minimized 
by ensuring high employee qualification, clearly defined safety and hygiene standards, and regular plant 
and equipment maintenance."
"Capital expenditure decisions on property, plant and equipment are made in 
accordance with defined, differentiated responsibility procedures and approval processes."
"They incorporate 
all relevant specialist functions and are regulated in an internal corporate standard."
"Investments are analyzed 
in advance on the basis of detailed risk aspects."
"Further audits accompanying projects provide the foundation 
for project management and risk reduction."
"In terms of production, too, we continually adapt our structures 
in response to the requirements of new business models, as well as to avoid shortages."
"Moreover, we have 
formed interdisciplinary task forces – in connection with a possible shortage of energy in Europe, for exam-
ple – to enable early identification and specific mitigation of the risks – with the aid of alternative procurement 
strategies, for example."
"Sales and markets risks 
Description of risk: We are exposed to further sales and markets risks emanating from the uncertainties of the 
current geopolitical and economic environment."
"Geopolitical risks have significantly heightened, especially 
as a result of the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East."
"The impacts of global trade conflicts are also jeop-
ardizing the global economic climate."
"Supply bottlenecks and temporary failures of critical infrastructure also 
represent the potential fallout from the current geopolitical environment."
"Risks arise for our business espe-
cially in connection with any long-term adverse effect on economic development."
"A slowdown in production 
at our industrial customers could lead to less demand for our solutions."
"In the consumer goods businesses, 
declining volumes in the wake of changing purchasing habits or weaker demand – as a result of inflation 
dampening purchasing power, for example – could pose a risk for our sales."
"A further significant risk is posed 
by an increasingly competitive environment, as this could result in stronger price and promotional pressures 
in the consumer goods sector."
"As consolidation in the retail sector continues and private labels occupy a 
growing share of the market, crowding-out competition in the consumer goods sector could further intensify."
"Moreover, the risk of product substitution could, in principle, affect all business units."
"Technological change 
associated with digitalization may involve risks for the success of our products and processes."
"Acquisitions, 
and the integration of same, could also pose risks for our businesses."
"During the integration of our consumer 
businesses, temporary delays in the performance of necessary structural adjustments and process or system 
alignments may occur in places."

The risks described above are also relevant when analyzing long-term trends."
"Long-term economic develop-
ments, in particular – such as recessions in China or within the EU – could impact our future business per-
formance."
"New business models, new competitors or changing demand behavior could also pose risks for 
our business."
"Measures: Our focus is on continuously monitoring the market environment to enable flexible adjustment 
of our portfolio and our cost structures to dynamic trends."
"In addition, we concentrate on strengthening our 
brands (see separate risk description on page 192) and on consistently driving the development of further 
innovations."
"We consider innovative products and processes to be a significant success factor for our company, 
enabling us to differentiate ourselves from competitors."
"We also pursue specific marketing and sales initia-
tives, for example advertising and promotional activities."
"Another central aspect is the advancement of dig-
italization, for example through the targeted marketing of our products via a dedicated e-commerce platform 
for our industrial customers."
"In our consumer goods business we are also striving to strengthen and expand 
our ratios of e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business."
"In addition, we have the capability to react 
quickly to potential sales declines through flexible production control."
"We respond to the emergence of new 
business models or new competitors, or changing demand behavior by taking strategic measures such as 
adapting our structures and portfolio, as well as through acquisitions and divestments."
"We mitigate the risks 
associated with acquisitions and integration by performing economic feasibility analyses and ensuring com-
prehensive project and integration management."
"The Henkel Group is exposed in particular to the risk of default by its customers 
in the course of its operating activities and to the risk of non-performance by a contracting party in the context 
of financial investments."
"Furthermore, depending on economic developments, defaults may increase, particularly 
on trade receivables."
"Risk-mitigating instruments include credit insurance cover such as global excess-of-loss credit 
insurance, letters of credit for the export business, plus for example sureties, guarantees and cover notes."
"Default risks from financial investments are mitigated by selecting counterparties with good credit ratings 
and by capping investment amounts."
"Credit ratings and investment limits are continuously monitored so as to 
enable intervention in the event that fixed thresholds for ratings and credit default swaps (CDS) are exceeded."
Our financial investments are broadly diversified across various counterparties and various financial assets.
"In addition, netting arrangements are in place to offset bilateral receivables and obligations, and collateral 
agreements are entered into with key banking partners."
"Measures: We mitigate this risk through our long-term management strategy of using financing instruments 
in the form of bonds issued with variously staggered terms and in different currencies."
"Supported by our 
existing debt issuance program and our “Sustainable Finance Framework” for issuing sustainable financing 
instruments, this is also possible on a short-term and flexible basis."
"Our credit rating is regularly assessed by 
the rating agencies S&P, Moody’s and Scope Ratings."
"We intend to maintain our ratings within a “single A” 
target corridor."
"We predominantly invest cash in financial assets traded in a liquid market in order to ensure 
that they can be sold at any time to receive liquid funds or to manage liquidity in the short term."
"We also 
use our US dollar and euro commercial paper program for short-term liquidity management."
"In order to 
ensure the financial flexibility of Henkel at any time, the liquidity within the Group is largely centralized in 
cash pools and managed across the Group using a liquidity reserve approach."
"In addition, the Henkel Group 
has at its disposal confirmed credit lines."
"Currency risks 
Description of risk: Because of the global nature of our business, we are exposed to two types of currency 
risk."
"Transaction risks arise from possible exchange rate fluctuations causing changes in the value of future 
foreign currency cash flows."
"Translation risks arise from changes caused by foreign exchange fluctuations to 
items on the statement of financial position and the income statement of a subsidiary, and the effect these 
changes have on the translation of individual company financial statements into Group currency."
"We anticipate 
continued high volatility in the currency markets in 2024."
"Residual transaction risks on the operating 
side are proactively managed by Group Treasury."
"This includes the overall assessment of the currency risk 
and the development of appropriate hedging strategies."
"The objective of currency hedging is to ensure pro-
tection from future adverse fluctuations in exchange rates."
"Because we limit our potential losses, any negative 
impact on profits is restricted."
"The transaction risk from significant operating receivables and liabilities 
recognized in the balance sheet and from financial receivables and liabilities is hedged as far as possible."
"In 
order to manage these risks, we primarily utilize currency forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps."
"The risks arising from the translation of the earnings results of subsidiaries in foreign currencies and from 
net investments in foreign operations are only hedged in exceptional cases."
"Interest rate risks 
Description of risk: Interest rate risk encompasses all potentially negative influences on profits, equity or 
cash flow in current or future reporting periods arising from changes in interest rates."
"The financing and cash 
investment activities of the Henkel Group mainly take place on international money and capital markets."
"The 
resultant financial liabilities and cash deposits are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates."
"Measures: The aim of our centralized interest rate management is to mitigate the risk by choosing fixed or 
floating interest rate contracts and by using interest rate derivatives."
"Henkel’s interest management strategy 
is essentially aligned to optimizing the net interest result for the Group."
"The decisions made in interest 
management relate to the bonds, liabilities to banks and commercial paper put in place to secure Group 
liquidity, the securities and time deposits used for cash investments, and other interest-bearing financial instru-
ments."
"Depending on forecasts with respect to interest rate developments, Henkel issues fixed- or floating-rate 
notes or enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in order to optimize the 
interest rate lock-down structure."
"The risks relate primarily 
to changes in market interest rates, inflation, and life expectancy."
"The risks to which the plan assets are 
exposed are general market price risks."
"Measures: We counteract these risks by managing the funding level and the structure of pension commit-
ments."
"Our internal pension risk management function monitors the risks of all pension plans Group-wide 
in compliance with local legal regulations."
"As part of the monitoring process, guidelines on the control and 
management of risks are adopted and continuously developed; these guidelines mainly govern funding 
levels, portfolio structure and actuarial assumptions."
"We also consider sustainability criteria when selecting 
external asset managers."
"The funds earmarked for covering pension obligations are invested in line with an 
asset-liability study based on the respective expected cash flows of the country-specific pension obligations."
"The objective of the financing strategy within the Group is to ensure that plan assets cover 90 to 100 percent 
of the present value of the funded pension obligations."
"Social risks  
Social risks are risks arising from population trends or changes in lifestyles that are reflected, for example, in 
competition for labor, changes in consumer behavior or increasing pressure on healthcare and pension systems."
They also include reputational risks.
"Personnel risks 
Description of risk: The motivation and the qualification of our employees are key drivers of Henkel’s business 
success."
"Therefore, it is strategically important to attract highly qualified professionals and executives and 
ensure they stay with the corporation."
"When it comes to selecting and recruiting talent, we are facing increased 
global competition for the best candidates – especially over the long term – and we are noticing the effects 
of demographic change in many of our markets."
"These developments expose us to the risk of losing valuable 
employees or of being unable to recruit relevant qualified professionals and executives."
"Over the long term, 
these risks could adversely affect our ability to compete and thus business performance at Henkel."
"Supporting this is an established, thorough annual review process 
from which we derive individually tailored and future-viable qualification and upskilling programs as well as 
performance-related remuneration systems."
"The Leadership Commitments form the focal point of our efforts 
to advance our leadership culture and to drive our cultural change."
"In addition to an appreciative corporate culture, the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are 
firmly anchored in Henkel’s corporate strategy."
"Striving for enhanced gender diversity is a key element in a 
holistic DEI strategy that also incorporates further dimensions such as internationality and ethnicity, sexual 
orientation, people with disability and inter-generational collaboration."
"Henkel is striving to make significant 
progress in all these dimensions."
"The corporation has established a Group-wide DEI network to anchor and 
implement these efforts in all business units and regions."
"Further areas of our personnel management focus include a global health management system and support 
for flexible work models to ensure better work-life flexibility."
"We create a positive and supportive work 
environment where our employees feel appreciated and respected."
"All these aspects are united in our Smart 
Work approach."
"These could lead to a negative 
impact on sales or the pace of growth."
"Measures: We minimize these risks through the measures described under legal and regulatory risks (see 
pages 196 to 198)."
"On the one hand, this is to ensure that our production facilities and products remain safe; 
on the other, our active communications work strengthens the reputation of the corporate brand and our 
product brands."
"These measures are supported by a global communication network and international and 
local crisis management systems with regular training sessions."
"Technological risks (IT and cyber risks)  
Technological risks arise, in particular, from increasing digitalization."
Description of risk: Information technology (IT) has strategic significance for Henkel.
"Our business processes 
rely to a great extent on internal and external IT services, applications, networks, and infrastructure systems."
"The failure or disruption of key IT services and the manipulation or loss of data – as a result of unauthorized 
access, for example, constitute material risks for Henkel."
"We analyze different potential in-house and exter-
nal perpetrators and types of threat, such as intent, error or natural phenomena."
"The failure or disruption of 
important IT services can impair critical business processes."
"The loss of confidential data, for example formu-
lations, customer information or price lists, could put us at a disadvantage with our competitors or give rise 
to legal consequences."
Henkel’s reputation could also be damaged by such loss.
"Measures: The technical and organizational safeguards for assuring information and cyber security at Henkel 
are based on the international standards ISO 27001 and 27002."
"Major components include the classification 
of information and IT applications with respect to confidentiality, availability, integrity and data protection 
requirements, as well as commensurate measures for mitigating risk."
"In addition, Henkel has put technical 
and organizational measures in place to prevent, discover and defeat cyber attacks."
"Henkel maintains regular 
contact with other major corporations, associations and specialized service providers in order to enable the 
early detection of threats and implementation of effective countermeasures."

Our critical business processes operate through redundantly configured systems designed for high availability."
Our data backup procedures reflect best engineering practice.
"We regularly review our restore and disaster 
recovery processes."
"Access to buildings and areas containing IT systems, as well as user authorizations for our information systems, 
are limited to the minimum level necessary."
"For critical business processes, the required segregation of 
duties is enforced by technological means."
Our IT services are protected against unauthorized external access and are consistently kept up to date.
"We 
develop our systems using proven project management and program modification procedures."
"We instruct and train our employees in the proper and secure use and operation of information systems as 
part of their regular duties."
"We require our IT service providers to maintain a comparable level of IT and 
cyber security."
"The implementation of our security measures is continually reviewed by our Corporate Audit function, other 
internal departments, and independent third parties."
"For example, soil contamination and 
the associated remediation expense, as well as leakage or other technical failures, could give rise to direct 
costs for the company."
"Furthermore, indirect costs such as fines, claims for compensation or reputational 
damage may also be incurred."
"We assign the highest priority to the health and safety of our customers, 
consumers and employees."
"Long-term risks arise in particular from accelerated climate change, water scarcity and restrictions on disposable 
and, in particular, non-recyclable plastic packaging and product ingredients."
"In addition to physical risks, this develop-
ment may also give rise to socioeconomic, so-called “transition” risks, for example as a result of political 
measures such as regulations and taxes."
"A more detailed discussion of relevant potential climate-related risks 
can be found in our Sustainability Report 2023 on pages 36 and 37."
"The information is aligned to the recom-
mendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)."
"Population and economic growth, and also, potentially, climate change impacts, can exacerbate water scarcity 
in various regions."
"An acute, local water shortage or legal restrictions on the use of water can have a direct 
impact on the activities of our suppliers, our own operations, and our customers and consumers."
"Regulations 
to protect water resources, as well as changes in customer and consumer expectations, could have an impact 
on our raw material and product portfolio."
"Measures: We take specific measures to minimize these risks (see the measures described under legal and 
regulatory risks on pages 196 to 198), and organize appropriate auditing, advisory and training activities."
"We 
continually update these preventive measures in order to properly safeguard our assets and reputation."
"We 
ensure compliance with high technical standards, rules of conduct, and relevant statutory requirements as a 
further means of preserving our assets, and make sure that our corporate values – one of which is sustainability 
– are put into practice."
"We have established comprehensive monitoring systems and a global holistic crisis
management system to manage extreme weather incidents or other crises, with defined protection strate-
gies in place at all our sites and for all employees."
"Protecting the physical and mental health of our employ-
ees is integral to securing our workflows."
"We achieve high uptake through extensive communication, infor-
mation and support programs."
"Targeted measures to protect and promote health are implemented on the
basis of employee surveys."
"For example, Henkel has defined science-
based emission reduction targets for both its own greenhouse gas emissions and the greenhouse gas emis-
sions of purchased goods and services."
"Our targets for our operational greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 
and 2) are in line with the reductions required to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius."
"Our target for 
value chain emissions (Scope 3) is in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria for ambitious 
value chain targets."
This means it corresponds to best practice.
"We are reducing the carbon footprint of our 
own sites in particular by continuously improving our energy efficiency and switching to electricity pur-
chased from renewable sources."
"In addition, we are increasingly replacing the fossil fuels used at our sites 
with lower-carbon or carbon-free alternatives."
"Where relevant, weather and 
geohazard management procedures have been established."
"Clear specifications in our standards for safety, 
health and the environment, as well as comprehensive programs in the business units, serve to improve the 
environmental compatibility of our products."
"With a comprehensive packaging strategy, we promote the 
circular economy in particular by improving the recyclability of our packaging, increasing the use of recycled 
plastics and developing new packaging concepts."
"By focusing on the central challenges of sustainable devel-
opment in our research and product development, we are creating an important foundation for the future 
viability of our corporation."
"These risks arise, in particular, 
in the fields of product liability, product deficiency, competition and cartel law, infringement of proprietary 
rights, data protection, patent law, tax law, environmental protection and legacy remediation."
"We also have 
a valuable portfolio of industrial property rights, patents and trademarks that can be the target of attacks 
and infringements."
"We cannot rule out the likelihood of negative rulings on current litigations and further 
litigations being initiated in the future."
"Even in the case of completed proceedings, it cannot be ruled out 
that we will still be confronted with claims by third parties on the basis of the same facts due to long or, in 
some cases, absent statutory limitation periods."
"In addition, uncertainty in the legal environment in some 
regions could cause us to lose our rights with or without adequate compensation, or limit our ability to 
enforce our rights."
"As a company with global operations, we are particularly exposed to various environmental, health or prod-
uct-/safety-related regulations, laws and guidelines that affect our business activities and processes."
"Our 
business is subject to various national rules and regulations and – within the EU – increasingly to harmo-
nized laws applicable throughout the EU."
"These regulations change constantly due to political requirements 
and can also be tightened."
"In addition, some of our activities are subject to rules and regulations derived 
from approvals, licenses, certificates or permits."
"Our manufacturing operations are bound by rules and regu-
lations with respect to the registration, evaluation, usage, storage, transportation and handling of certain 
substances and also in relation to emissions, wastewater, effluent and other waste."
"The construction and 
operation of production facilities and other plant and infrastructure are governed by framework rules and 
regulations, including those relating to legacy remediation."
"Product-specific regulations of relevance to us 
relate in particular to ingredients and input materials, safety in manufacturing, the handling of products and 
their contents, and the packaging and marketing of these items."
"The control mechanisms include statutory 
material-related regulations, usage prohibitions or restrictions, procedural requirements (test and inspection, 
identification marking, provision of warning labels, etc.), and product liability law."
"Violation of such regulations 
may lead to legal proceedings or compromise our future business activities."
"Consequently, major losses may 
also result from litigations and proceedings that exceed the insurance amounts or are not covered by our 
insurance policies or provisions."
"Potential damage to our reputation is not covered by insurance, nor is there 
any guarantee that Henkel will acquire adequate insurance cover at economically reasonable terms and con-
ditions in future."
"Such changes might involve import 
and export controls, customs or other trade regulations – including sanctions – or pricing and foreign 
exchange restrictions."
"There is also a risk that our corporate values and our ethical, compliance and sustainability requirements are 
not adequately mirrored by our contractual partners."
"Even if corresponding requirements exist for our part-
ners in the supply chain, violations that may lead to claims by third parties or damage our reputation cannot 
be ruled out."
"Equally, as a globally active company, we maintain business relations with customers in countries that are 
subject to export control legislation, embargoes, economic sanctions, exclusion policies or other forms of 
trade restriction."
"We see long-term risks, for example, in tax law developments and requirements arising from the increased 
focus on human rights."
"Measures: Our internal standards, guidelines, codes of conduct, and training measures are geared to ensur-
ing compliance with the aforementioned statutory requirements and, for example, safeguarding our manu-
facturing facilities and products."
"These precepts have also been incorporated into our management systems 
and are regularly reviewed."
"This includes the early monitoring and evaluation of relevant statutory and regu-
latory requirements and changes."

Ensuring compliance with laws and regulations is an integral component of our business processes."
"This 
includes the early monitoring and evaluation of relevant statutory and regulatory requirements and changes."
"Current proceedings and pending litigations are continuously recorded and monitored in a separate 
reporting system."
"Our Corporate Legal department maintains constant contact with local counsel for this 
purpose."
Regular reports are submitted to the Management Board and oversight bodies.
"We conduct our 
own analysis and assessments – or obtain external legal opinions, if necessary – to assess risks and determine 
any need for provisions."
"This risk assessment is based predominantly on estimating the probability of 
occurrence and bandwidths of the potentially ensuing claims for damages."
"This risk assessment and 
potential accrual of provisions is conducted in collaboration between the business units with operational 
responsibility and the legal and finance departments."
"Appropriate provisions are accrued based on probability 
of occurrence."
"For certain legal risks, we have concluded insurance policies with coverage that we consider 
to be appropriate and standard for the industry."
"However, predicting the outcome of proceedings is fraught 
with considerable uncertainty, especially if a claimant is seeking substantial or unspecified damages."
"In view 
of this, we are unable to predict what obligations may arise from such litigations."
"With our comprehensive approach to responsible procurement, we already promote sustainable practices 
and respect for human rights in our supply chain."
"Using this process to check and 
assess the sustainability performance of our suppliers, we currently cover more than 90 percent of our pro-
curement volume in the areas of packaging, raw materials, and toll/contract manufacturers."
"We understand the opportunities 
presented in the following as potential future developments or events that could lead to a positive deviation 
from our guidance."
"We also assess the probabilities of price-related procurement market and financial 
opportunities."
"Procurement market opportunities 
Description of opportunities: Countervailing the procurement market risks listed on pages 183 and 184, 
opportunities may also arise in which the influencing factors described in this section develop in a direction 
that is advantageous to Henkel."
"Impact: Very low probability rating, possible significant impact on our earnings guidance."
"Sales and markets opportunities 
Description of opportunities: Additional business opportunities would arise if the uncertain geopolitical 
and macroeconomic situation in some regions, or the economic conditions in individual sectors, develop 
substantially better than expected."
Impact: The opportunities described could have a high impact on our earnings guidance.
"They allow us to grow 
more strongly in promising markets or to gain access to new markets and technologies."
"In the process, we 
reap the benefits of both earnings and cost synergies in most cases."
Impact: Large acquisitions could have a high impact on our earnings guidance.
"Research and development opportunities 
Description of opportunities: Opportunities arising from our extensive, continuous innovation process are 
a key component of our strategy and are already accounted for in our guidance."
"There are additional oppor-
tunities in the event of product introductions that exceed our expectations of market acceptance, and in the 
development of exceptional innovations that have not yet been taken into account."
"They include key areas 
of action for sustainable development, such as climate protection and circular economy."
"Impact: Innovations arising from future research and development could have a high impact on our 
earnings guidance."
"Accordingly, it extends beyond the internal 
accounting control system (for a discussion of the internal control system, please refer to the corporate govern-
ance statement on pages 60 to 65)."
"The following describes the main features of the internal control and risk 
management system in relation to our accounting processes, in accordance with Section 315 (4) German 
Commercial Code [HGB]."
"The internal control system’s function is to implement relevant principles, procedures 
and controls so as to ensure the financial statement closing process is regulatory compliant."
"At Henkel, the 
design of the internal control system is aligned to COSO – the internationally acknowledged internal control 
framework – and the German audit code IDW PS 982."
"Within the organization of the internal control system, 
the Management Board assumes overall responsibility at Group level."
"The duly coordinated subsystems of 
the internal control system lie within the responsibility of the Corporate Accounting, Controlling Group Treasury, 
Compliance and Regional Finance functions."
"Within these functions, there are a number of integrated moni-
toring and control levels."
"These are assessed by regular and comprehensive effectiveness tests performed by 
our Corporate Audit function and by our newly established corporate unit Internal Control Systems."
"Of the 
multifaceted control processes incorporated into the accounting process, several are important to highlight."
This corporate standard is binding on the entire Group and is regularly updated and approved by the CFO.
"The local Presidents and Heads of Finance of all consolidated subsidiaries must confirm their compliance 
with this corporate standard on an annual basis."
"Documentation 
relating to the operational accounting and closing processes ensures that important tasks – such as the 
reconciliation of receivables and payables on the basis of account balance confirmations – are clearly assigned."
"Additionally, binding authorization regulations exist governing the approval of contracts, credit notes and 
the like, and the principle of dual control is a mandatory requirement for all material transactions."
"This is also 
stipulated in Group-wide corporate standards."
"To prevent possible data losses and system failures, we regularly 
back up our relevant IT systems."
"Our security concept also includes technical system checks, manual spot 
checks by experienced employees, and individually aligned authorizations and access restrictions."
"The 
significant risks for Henkel and the corresponding controls with respect to the regulatory preparation of 
our annual and consolidated financial statements are collated in a central documentation pack."
"This docu-
mentation is reviewed and updated annually by the respective process owners."
"The established systems are 
also regularly reviewed to determine their improvement and optimization potential."
"We consider these systems 
to be appropriate and effective."
"The accounting activities for subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are performed 
locally by the subsidiary or through a shared service center, taking the aforementioned corporate standards 
into account."
"The individual subsidiaries’ financial statements are transferred to our central consolidation 
system and checked at corporate level for correctness."
"After all consolidation steps have been completed, 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared by Corporate Accounting in consultation with the special-
ist departments."
"Preparation of the combined management report is coordinated by Investor Relations in 
cooperation with each business unit and corporate function."
"The Management Board then draws up the 
consolidated financial statements and annual financial statements of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA, and the com-
bined management report for Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA and the Group, and subsequently presents these 
documents to the Supervisory Board for approval."
"KGaA, or a material 
subsidiary included in the consolidation, or the Group, as a going concern."
"In the short-term, we expect moderate growth in global economic output."
"There is, however, huge uncertainty, 
particularly surrounding the war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict."
"Compared to the quantitative eval-
uation of short-term risks in our Annual Report 2022 and based on the adjustment of evaluation categories, 
the probability of occurrence of legal and regulatory risks has been changed from low to very low."
"Although 
the assessment of some risks may have decreased somewhat, there has been no fundamental change to the 
overall risk and opportunities situation."
"The system of risk categorization adopted by Henkel continues to 
indicate that the most significant exposure currently relates to the impact of procurement market, and also 
sales, market and financial risks, to which we are responding with the countermeasures described above."
"Equally, none of the identified long-term risks within the ten-year risk horizon is classified as posing a threat 
to the continued existence of Henkel as a going concern."
"The Management Board remains confident that the earning power of the Group forms a solid foundation for 
future business development and provides the necessary resources to leverage our opportunities."
"Overview:  
Gross domestic product growth of around 2 percent 
Following the continued muted growth momentum over the course of 2023, moderate growth (around 2 per-
cent) is again forecasted for global economic output in 2024."
"Global economic development is likely to 
continue to be characterized by overall still elevated inflation rates and by persisting geopolitical uncertain-
ties – not least against the background of the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East."
Gross domestic product is expected to grow by around 1 percent in Europe.
"An increase of approximately 
1.5 percent is forecasted for both North America and Latin America."
"Economic output in the IMEA and Asia-
Pacific regions is expected to expand by around 4 percent."
"Inflation:  
Globally declining inflationary pressure 
S&P Global Market Intelligence expects global inflation to be approximately 4.5 percent in 2024 – which 
would be lower than the previous year (approximately 5.5 percent) but still high on average."
"Inflation is 
forecasted to be around 3 percent in Europe and North America."
"Prices in the IMEA region are expected to 
increase by approximately 12.5 percent."
"Significant double-digit inflation of approximately 29.5 percent is 
forecasted for Latin America."
"In the Asia-Pacific region, prices are expected to increase by around 2 percent."
"Energy and labor costs are expected to remain elevated – 
accompanied by continued high uncertainty surrounding future global economic and geopolitical development."
"Currencies:  
Continued high volatility 
We anticipate continued high volatility in the currency markets."
"On average for 2024, we anticipate a largely 
negative trend in the major emerging market currencies of relevance for Henkel compared to 2023."
"We 
expect the US dollar to remain relatively stable versus the euro."
"Development by sector 
Consumption and retail:  
Growth of approximately 2.5 percent 
S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts that global private consumption will increase by approximately 
2.5 percent in 2024."
"Private spending is expected to grow by around 1 percent in Europe and by around 
2 percent in North America."
"S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts that private consumption will increase 
by approximately 4.5 percent in the IMEA region and by approximately 1 percent in Latin America."
"Growth 
of approximately 5 percent is expected in the Asia-Pacific region."
"Industrial production index:  
Increase of approximately 2 percent 
S&P Global Market Intelligence expects the industrial production index (IPX) to increase by approximately 
2 percent worldwide."
"Moderate growth of approximately 1 percent and 0.5 percent is forecasted for Europe 
and North America respectively."
"For the IMEA region, an increase of approximately 2.5 percent is predicted."
"Industrial production is expected to increase by around 2 percent in Latin America and by approximately 
4 percent in the Asia-Pacific region."
"This assumes a moderate increase in both industrial demand and consumer demand in key areas 
of the consumer goods business for Henkel."
"According to current estimates, global inflation is also forecasted 
to be lower in fiscal 2024 than in the previous year, although it will remain at a high level overall."
"In addition, 
interest rates are expected to remain higher than in previous years."
"We anticipate that the divestments made in 2023, including the divestment of our business activities in Russia, 
will have a negative impact in the low single-digit percentage range on the growth of the Henkel Group’s 
nominal sales."
"We expect the translation of sales in foreign currencies to have a negative impact in the mid-
single-digit percentage range."
We expect prices for direct materials to remain flat versus the annual average for 2023.
"We also expect energy 
and labor costs to remain at elevated levels."
"We will counteract these headwinds in both business units 
through innovations and selective price increases combined with strict cost discipline."
"We also anticipate 
further savings from the merger of our consumer businesses."

30 to 40 percent of net income after non-controlling interests and adjusted for exceptional items."

The functional currency of Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA and the reporting currency of the Group is the euro.
"Unless 
otherwise indicated, all amounts are shown in million euros."
All individual figures have been rounded.
"Addition 
may therefore result in deviations from the totals indicated."
"Scope of consolidation 
In addition to Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA as the ultimate parent company, the consolidated financial statements 
at December 31, 2023 include 17 German and 179 non-German companies in which Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA 
has a dominating influence over financial and operating policies, based on the concept of control."
"The Group 
controls a company when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the 
company and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the company."
"Companies in which 
the stake held represents less than half of the voting rights are fully consolidated if Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA 
controls them, as defined in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, through contractual agreements or 
the right to appoint corporate bodies."
"KGaA prepares the consolidated financial statements for the largest and the smallest groups 
of companies to which Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA and its subsidiaries belong.
"For simplification purposes, investments in 
these subsidiaries are recognized at cost less any impairment."
"The total assets of these companies represent 
less than 1 percent of the Group’s total assets; their total sales and income (net of taxes) are also less than 
1 percent of the Group totals."
"Acquisitions and divestments 
Acquisitions 
Effective July 1, 2023, Henkel in its Consumer Brands business unit completed the acquisition of the sustainable 
laundry detergents and household cleaners business sold under the Earthwise brand in the Asia-Pacific region."
The purchase price was 31 million euros and was paid in cash.
"Effective November 1, 2023, we acquired in 
our Adhesive Technologies business unit all the shares in the US-American company Composite Technology 
Intermediate, Inc."
"whose subsidiaries operate worldwide under the name Critica Infrastructure and are 
specialized in repair solutions for composite piping carrying water, gas and chemical substances in industrial 
and civilian infrastructures."
"The purchase price, including external liabilities redeemed on the transaction 
date, was 475 million euros and was paid in cash."
"Several smaller acquisitions also took place in the year 
under review."
Their total purchase price amounted to 12 million euros.
"The acquisitions did not have any 
material effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Henkel Group."
"The provisional goodwill acquired through the acquisitions represents the growth potential of the acquired 
businesses, as well as both offensive and defensive synergies resulting from acquisition."
"Most of the goodwill 
is not tax deductible."
"that were acquired in the period under review, is provisional."
"Also and above all, determination 
of the fair value of the other intangible assets, provisions and deferred taxes and the resulting goodwill 
from the acquisition has not yet been finalized."
"The process of determining fair values requires discretionary 
judgments when making corresponding assumptions and estimates."
"The provisional fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities were determined by the contracts and available 
opening balances on the relevant acquisition date."
"The recognition and measurement principles adopted by 
the Henkel Group were applied."
"The actual contributions of the business were 4 million euros to sales 
and 0.4 million euros to net income."
Incidental acquisition costs amounted to 0.2 million euros.
"If Henkel had completed the acquisition of Composite Technology Intermediate, Inc."
"effective January 1, 2023, 
sales of the Henkel Group for the reporting period January 1 to December 31, 2023 would have been higher 
by 93 million euros and net income would have been lower by 16 million euros after deduction of acquisition-
related incidental costs."
"The actual contributions of the company in 2023 were 15 million euros to sales and 
2 million euros to net income."
Incidental acquisition costs amounted to 3 million euros.
"Divestments 
Effective April 21, 2023, Henkel sold all shares in its subsidiary LAB Industries Ltd."
"(formerly: OOO Henkel Rus), 
which was responsible for the operations of both business units in Russia."
"At the time of completion, the 
transaction produced a cash inflow of 615 million euros, which was mainly attributable to the purchase price 
received for the transaction."
The cash inflow also included a deferral for the use of trademark rights.
"The 
loss of control over the subsidiary resulted in the derecognition of cash and cash equivalents of 173 million 
euros."
Henkel has the option of buying back the business.
"The call option can be exercised for the first time 
in 2026 and expires in ten years."
"This figure includes a loss of 46 million euros from the loss of control over the Russian 
subsidiary, and a loss of 156 million euros from the reclassification of currency translation and hedge reserves 
relating to the Russian business (reclassification amounts)."
"A summary of the assets and liabilities disposed 
of can be found in Note 9 on pages 261 to 263."
"Active portfolio management continues to be an essential element in determining the future strategic direction 
of the Henkel Group."
"Both the acquisition and sale of trademark rights and businesses are integral to our 
strategy."
"In fiscal 2023, Henkel disposed of some of its small local and regional consumer goods businesses 
in its Consumer Brands business unit."
"In addition, on November 1, 2023, we sold all shares in our German 
subsidiary Henkel Loctite-KID GmbH and the associated European impregnation, sealant and adhesives business 
for cast and electronic components that was part of the Adhesive Technologies business unit."
"These divestments, 
which formed part of our active portfolio management regime, did not have any material effect on the net 
assets, financial position and results of operations of the Henkel Group."
"Consolidation methods 
The financial statements of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA and of the subsidiaries included in the consolidated 
financial statements were prepared on the basis of uniformly valid principles of recognition and measurement, 
applying the standardized year-end date adopted by the Group."
"Such entities are included in the consolidated 
financial statements as of the date on which the Group obtained control."
"All intragroup receivables and liabilities, sales, income and expenses, as well as intragroup profits on transfers 
of non-current assets or inventories, are eliminated on consolidation."
The purchase method is used for capital consolidation.
"Any difference arising between the acquisition cost and the (share of) net assets after 
purchase price allocation is recognized as goodwill."
"The goodwill attributable to subsidiaries is measured in 
the functional currency of the subsidiary."
"Contingent 
consideration is recognized at fair value as of the date of first-time consolidation."
"Subsequent changes in 
value do not result in an adjustment to the valuation at the time of acquisition."
"Incidental costs relating to 
the acquisition of participating interests in entities are not included in the purchase price."
"Instead, they are 
recognized through profit or loss in the period in which they occur."
"In the recognition of acquisitions of less than 100 percent of the shares in a company, non-controlling interests 
are measured at the fair value of the proportion of net assets that they represent."
"The Henkel Group uses 
the present access method to recognize put options granted on non-controlling interests, unless the acqui-
sition of the outstanding non-controlling interests has already been realized from an economic viewpoint."
"This method requires the recognition of a financial liability, remeasured through equity, for the commitment 
associated with the put option granted."
"The non-controlling interests continue to be recognized in the 
statement of financial position and the statement of comprehensive income."
"Minority interests that have 
already been economically acquired are recognized using the anticipated acquisition method."
"Unlike the 
present access method, non-controlling interests are in this case not recognized in the statement of financial 
position and the statement of comprehensive income."
"Changes in the shareholdings of subsidiary companies resulting in a decrease or an increase in the partici-
pating interests of the Group without loss of control are recognized directly in equity as transactions with 
shareholders."
"As soon as the control of a subsidiary is lost, all the assets and liabilities and the non-controlling interests, 
and also the accumulated currency translation gains or losses, are derecognized."
"In the event that Henkel 
continues to own non-controlling interests in the non-consolidated entity, these are measured at fair value."
The result of deconsolidation is recognized under other operating income or expenses.
"Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds 
20 percent or more of the voting rights."
"Where a Group company conducts transactions with an associate, 
the resulting profits or losses are eliminated in accordance with the share of the Group in that company."
"As a rule, shares in associates are recognized using the equity method."
"For simplification purposes, investments 
in associates that are less relevant for the Group and for the presentation of a fair view of its net assets, 
financial position and results of operations, are recognized at cost less any impairment."
"As of December 31, 2023, the Henkel Group did not hold any shares in associates that were accounted for 
using the equity method."
"The functional currency is the currency in which a foreign company predominantly 
generates funds and makes payments."
"The functional currency of the Group companies is generally the local 
currency of the company concerned."
"Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries whose functional currency is not 
the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are translated at closing rates, while income and expenses are 
translated at the average rates for the year as an approximation of the actual rates at the date of the trans-
action."
Equity items are recognized at historical exchange rates.
"The differences arising from using average 
rather than closing rates are taken to equity and shown as other components of equity, or as non-controlling 
interests, and remain neutral in respect of net income until the shares in the Group company are divested."
"Financial assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are measured at 
closing rates through profit or loss."
Monetary items are not restated.
"Corresponding gains and losses on the net monetary position 
resulting from the adjustment to current purchasing power are recognized in financial result."
"After restatement to current purchasing power, all items on the statement of financial position and all income 
and expenses on the consolidated statement of income are translated to the functional currency of the 
Group (euros) at the closing rate on the reporting date."
"When performing consolidation, Henkel recognizes 
changes resulting from the restatement to current purchasing power of the equity of its subsidiaries in the 
currency translation reserve."
"On this basis, the Henkel Group has classified Türkiye as a hyperinflationary economy for the current 
and the previous reporting period and has applied IAS 29 accordingly."
"For the purpose of preparing the 
consolidated financial statements, a change of 67.5 percent in general purchasing power was assumed, with 
input from experts, as the actual inflation rate for the month of December 2023 was not yet available when 
the financial statements were being prepared."
"The price index published by TURKSTAT, the Turkish office of 
statistics, was 1,859 as of December 31, 2023."
"The price index stood at 1,128 as of December 31, 2022, and 
at 687 as of December 31, 2021."
"In fiscal 2023, a loss on the net monetary position from the adjustment to 
current purchasing power was recognized in the other financial result in an amount of 53 million euros 
(previous year: 42 million euros)."
"IAS 29 was not applied to subsidiaries in other economies classified as hyperinflationary due to their imma-
terial impact on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Henkel Group."
"Changes to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) that were applied for the first time in the year 
under review are discussed in the section entitled “New international accounting regulations according to 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)” on pages 235 to 239."
"Changes in the methods of recog-
nition and measurement arising from revised and new standards are applied retrospectively, provided that 
the effect is material and there are no alternative regulations."
"The consolidated statement of income from the 
previous year and the opening balance for this comparative period are amended as if the new methods of 
recognition and measurement had always been applied."
"Accounting estimates, assumptions and discretionary 
judgments 
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements is based on a number of accounting estimates and as-
sumptions."
"These have an impact on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at 
the reporting date and the disclosure of income and expenses for the reporting period."
"The actual amounts 
may differ from these estimates."
"The accounting estimates and their underlying assumptions are based on past experience and are continually 
reviewed."
"Changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the change takes place 
where such change exclusively affects that period."
"A change is recognized in the period in which it occurs 
and in later periods where such change affects both the reporting period and subsequent periods."
"This is especially true 
of estimates of any possible impairment of non-financial assets, such as goodwill and other intangible assets, 
and of financial assets."
"Put options granted on non-controlling interests require estima-
tion as to whether the Henkel Group is already the beneficiary of these shares or not, and hence, whether 
the present access method is to be applied."
"Recently, in fiscal 2023, discretionary judgments were needed 
when accounting for the divestment of our business activities in Russia."
"They mainly revolved around assessing 
whether a loss of control over the subsidiary had occurred, and allocating the cash inflow to the purchase 
price received and a payment received for the use of trademark rights."

Climate disclosures 
Climate change poses one of the biggest global challenges of our day."
"We see it as a factor that exacerbates 
existing risks, but also offers opportunities."
"Even though we do not assume that risks will arise from climate 
change that could jeopardize the survival of our business activities, such aspects do produce additional 
uncertainty when accounting for estimations, and have been considered accordingly."
"This holds particularly 
true, in Henkel’s case, when determining the possible impairment of non-financial assets such as goodwill 
and other intangible assets."
"The corporate planning figures used for impairment testing therefore also 
incorporates climate aspects (see Note 1 on pages 242 to 249)."
"For many years now, Henkel has included sustainability as an integral part of its corporate strategy, incorpo-
rating a large number of measures aimed at mitigating climate risks and adjustment to them."
"The costs and 
benefits of these measures are embedded in the company’s cost structures."
"In addition, climate and sustain-
ability aspects are considered when making investment and financing decisions."
"based in Tokyo, Japan, was finalized."
The prior-year figures have been amended accordingly.
"Amendments to the consolidated statement of financial position 
in million euros 
Dec."
"31, 2022
reported
Amendments
Dec."
"IAS 1 (Amendment) 
Compared to the previous version of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, companies are no longer 
required to disclose all significant accounting policies, but only their material accounting policies."
"Supple-
mentary guidance and examples are provided for the identification of material accounting policies, i.e."
"the policies that users of financial statements need to be aware of in order to understand other material 
information in the financial statements."
"It is also clarified that the interpretation of materiality should not 
only be quantitative."
"Based on their characteristic features, methods can also be material."
"IAS 8 (Amendment) 
With the amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, the Inter-
national Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has included a positive definition of accounting estimates in 
the standard."
"Accordingly, monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement 
uncertainties are considered to be accounting estimates."
"An accounting policy may require items in the 
financial statements to be determined using valuation techniques and inputs that give rise to measurement 
uncertainty."
"It is clarified that new information or new developments that lead to an adjustment of an account-
ing estimate do not constitute correction of an error."
"The same applies to changes in input parameters or 
valuation techniques underlying an accounting estimate where these do not result from the correction of 
errors from prior periods."
"This means that changes in an accounting estimate only affect the result for the 
current period or future periods."
"Thus, for example, deferred tax assets 
and liabilities must be recognized upon initial recognition of assets and liabilities from leases."
"IAS 12 (Amendment II) 
The amendments to IAS 12 represent the response by the standard-setter to the Pillar Two Model Rules 
governing minimum taxation worldwide, which were published back in 2021 by the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD)."
"The changes include temporary exemption from the recognition of 
deferred taxes resulting directly from the application of the OECD rules."
"Also, disclosures must be made in 
the notes to the financial statements that allow in particular readers of companies’ financial statements in 
jurisdictions that have not yet implemented the OECD rules to estimate the future impact of the Pillar Two 
Model Rules on income tax payments."
"IFRS 17 (including Amendments) 
IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts represents a comprehensive new approach for insurance companies when 
accounting for insurance contracts."
The standard replaces the formerly applicable IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts.
"IFRS 17 (Amendment) 
The minor amendment to IFRS 17 relates to the presentation of comparative information when applying 
IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments for the first time."
"If the covenants 
relate to the future, they are irrelevant for determining the settlement date on the reporting date."
"However, 
special recognition and disclosure rules apply to such liabilities whose settlement date is dependent on the 
compliance with covenants in the twelve months following the reporting date."
"IFRS 16 (Amendment) 
With the amendments to IFRS 16 Leases, the IASB has incorporated into the standard new rules governing 
the remeasurement of a lease liability in the case of a sale and leaseback transaction."
"IFRS 16 contains specific 
rules for the initial measurement of the liability from a sale and leaseback, but there are no specific rules for 
the remeasurement of this liability, so that questions of interpretation arose, particularly in the case of sub-
sequent modifications of the leaseback."
"According to the amendments to IFRS 16, the lease liability is to be 
measured in such a way that no profit or loss is realized in the remeasurement insofar as this relates to the 
retained right of use."
"The amendments aim to make it possible for readers 
of financial statements to assess the influence of supplier financing on a company’s liabilities and cash flows, 
as well as the liquidity risk to which the company is exposed."
"IAS 21 (Amendment) 
The amendments to IAS 21 incorporate extended guidelines for determining the relevant spot rates when 
recognizing foreign exchange transactions and converting foreign business operations if one currency is 
only convertible into another to a limited extent."
"In such instances, additional disclosures are required in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Here, the standard-setter has provided a more precise defini-
tion of the exchangeability of a currency and clarifies the need to examine exchangeability on the reporting 
date for each specific type of transaction."
"If one currency cannot be exchanged for another, IAS 21 specifies 
that either an observable spot rate must be adopted unchanged, or a rate estimated on the basis of another 
methodology must be used for conversion."
"If the functional currency of a foreign business operation is not exchangeable, summa-
rized financial details of the foreign business operation must be included in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements in addition to disclosures about the relevant business."
"Non-current assets 
All non-current assets with definite useful lives are depreciated or amortized exclusively using the straight-
line method on the basis of their estimated useful lives."
The useful life estimates are reviewed annually.
"If 
facts or circumstances indicate the need for impairment, the recoverable amount is determined."
"It is measured 
at the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use."
"Impairment losses are recognized if the 
recoverable amounts of the assets are lower than their carrying amounts."
"Impairment and scheduled amorti-
zation and depreciation are allocated to the functions in the statement of income."
"Given the consistency and strength of the brands, 
indefinite useful lives are assumed, and these intangible assets are not subject to scheduled amortization."
"Instead, they are subjected to impairment testing once a year and as indicated, as is also the case with 
goodwill."
"Impairment of trademarks and other rights is recognized in selling expenses, whereas goodwill 
impairment is included under other operating expenses."

"Goodwill represents the future economic benefit of assets that are acquired through business combinations 
and are not individually identifiable and separately recognized, together with expected synergies."
"Goodwill 
upon first-time consolidation constitutes a positive difference between the cost of acquiring the entity and 
the amount of acquired identified assets and assumed liabilities existing at the time of acquisition and 
measured as specified in IFRS 3."
"Trademarks and other rights acquired for valuable consideration are stated 
at purchase cost, while internally generated software is stated at development cost."
"Additions to intangible assets under development mostly reflect investments in digitalizing and consolidating 
our IT system architecture."
"The item also includes a portion attributable to software for digitalizing sustaina-
bility data and reporting requirements."
"The change in goodwill resulting from acquisitions made in the fiscal 
year is presented in the section “Acquisitions and divestments” on pages 223 to 226."
"Goodwill as well as trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives are subjected to an impairment 
test once a year and also when indicators of impairment are present at the level of the cash-generating units 
(impairment-only approach)."
Testing is based primarily on fair value less costs of disposal.
"A discounted cash 
flow method is used to determine fair value (before deduction of costs of disposal), which is allocated to 
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 23 on pages 290 and 291)."
"The estimated future cash flows are 
derived from the budget approved by the management bodies responsible, with the budgeted figures form-
ing the basis for the impairment test."
"The assumptions upon which the essential budgeting and planning 
parameters are based reflect experience gained in the past, aligned to current information provided by ex-
ternal sources."
"The relevant impairment tests 
determined that no write-downs were necessary."
"The cash-generating units defined per the reporting dates 
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023 are listed in the tables below, together with the carrying 
amounts of the goodwill allocated to each one."
"Further details can be found in the segment report in Note 37 
on pages 341 to 345 and in the combined management report on pages 121 to 137."
"The composition of the cash-generating 
units Craftsmen, Construction & Professional and Packaging & Consumer Goods has not changed to any 
material degree compared to the previous year."
"In the newly created Consumer Brands business unit, the 
cash-generating unit Consumer business, identified as of December 31, 2023, encompasses the former units 
Consumer (Beauty Care), Laundry Care and Home Care (Laundry & Home Care)."
The planning horizon on which impairment testing is based is four years.
"Planning assumptions included 
the potential adverse effects on business of the continued geopolitical tensions, such as those arising from 
the ongoing war in Ukraine and as a result of the Middle East conflict, although they themselves are subject 
to great uncertainty."
"Average 
sales growth of the cash-generating units in the Consumer Brands business unit ranges from 3 to 4 percent 
annually over the four-year planning horizon (previous year: 1 to 7 percent for Beauty Care and 3 percent for 
Laundry & Home Care)."
"For the period after the four-year detailed planning horizon, a growth rate in cash flows of between 1 and 
2 percent (previous year: 1 to 2 percent) is assumed for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing."
"This 
assumption includes, in particular, the passing-on of expected long-term inflation to our customers."
"The increase in capital costs 
for the Adhesive Technologies business unit is mainly due to rising interest rates."
"As was also the case last year, impairment of trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives is assessed 
at the level of either global cash-generating units (Adhesive Technologies) or regional cash-generating units 
(Consumer Brands)."
"As of December 31, 2023, most of the trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives are attributable 
to two cash-generating units."
"The carrying amount of the trademarks and other rights allocated to the regional 
cash-generating unit Consumer North America in the Consumer Brands business unit was 1.6 billion euros 
as of December 31, 2023."
"For impairment testing purposes, a cost of capital of 6.23 percent after taxes and a 
terminal growth rate of 1.0 percent were applied."
"The average annual increase in sales in the cash-generating 
unit during the four-year detailed planning period is 0 percent."
"This forecast is based essentially on the 
continued management of our portfolio in the 2024 planning year, which represents an integral part of the 
further development of the Henkel Group and contributes toward continuous improvements in profitability."
"As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the trademarks and other rights allocated to the cash-
generating unit Professional North America in the Consumer Brands business unit was 338 million euros."
"For impairment testing purposes, a cost of capital of 6.22 percent after taxes and a terminal growth rate of 
1.0 percent were applied."
"The average annual increase in sales during the four-year detailed planning period 
is 2 percent."
"As of December 
31, 2022, the carrying amounts of the trademarks and other rights allocated to these cash-generating units 
totaled 1.3 billion euros and 361 million euros respectively."
"For impairment testing purposes, a cost of capital 
of 5.75 percent after taxes and a terminal growth rate of 1.0 percent were applied in each case."
"The average 
annual increase in sales in the cash-generating units during the four-year detailed planning period was 
3 percent (Laundry Care North America) and 6 percent (Professional North America)."
"In the 2024 planning year, we expect moderate growth in global economic output characterized by inflation 
rates that are still high but declining, with continued high uncertainty surrounding future world economic 
and geopolitical developments."
"We expect prices for direct materials to remain flat versus the average for 
2023."
Energy and labor costs are expected to remain high.
"We will counteract these headwinds in both busi-
ness units through innovations and selective price increases combined with strict cost discipline."
"We also an-
ticipate further savings from the consolidation of our consumer businesses."
"The corporate planning process 
also incorporates the potential impacts of climate change."
"For example, budgeted procurement prices re-
flect the transition risk of a rising CO2 charge."
"The budget also considers climate-related opportunities, 
such as the progressing trend toward electromobility accompanied by increased demand for our adhesives 
for use in batteries."
"Neither an increase in the weighted average 
cost of capital that Henkel regards as realistic nor a reduction in either the long-term growth rate or free 
cash flow would result in any goodwill impairment requirement for the cash-generating units."
"In fiscal 2023, goodwill impairment amounted to 1 million euros (previous year: 88 million euros)."
"Impairment 
of 55 million euros was recognized on other intangible assets in the year under review (previous year: 
97 million euros)."
"These losses relate primarily to trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives and 
concern the write-down of discontinued trademarks allocable to the Consumer Brands business unit."
"The trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives with a net carrying amount totaling 2,921 million 
euros (previous year: 2,980 million euros) are established in their markets and will continue to be intensively 
promoted."
"Moreover, there are no other statutory, regulatory or competition-related factors that limit the 
usage of our brand names."
"The company also intends to continue using the trademarks and other rights disclosed as having definite 
useful lives."
"In fiscal 2023, these assets required recognition of impairment in an amount of 4 million euros 
(previous year: 6 million euros)."

"As of December 31, 2023, investment grants of 70 million euros (previous year: 44 million euros) 
were deducted from purchase and manufacturing costs."
"Some of the grants are contingent upon certain 
terms and conditions being met, such as location guarantees."
"Henkel is sufficiently confident that these 
terms and conditions can be satisfied."
"Acquisition-related incidental costs incurred in order to make the 
asset ready for the intended use are capitalized."
"An overview of the primary investment projects undertaken 
during the fiscal year can be found on pages 139 and 140 in the combined management report."
"At December 31, 2023, no property, plant and equipment had been pledged as collateral for existing liabilities, 
as was also the case in the previous year."
"Exiting our business in Russia resulted in impairment in fiscal 2022 of 82 million euros on property, plant and 
equipment, with all business units affected."
"This impairment was recognized on reclassification to assets held 
for sale as of June 30, 2022."
"As of December 31, 2022, a complete write-up of the original impairment was 
recognized in assets held for sale following adjustments to purchase price expectations (Note 9 on pages 
261 to 263)."
"The impairment on property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2023 was essentially due to portfolio 
measures in the Consumer Brands business unit."
"The depreciation and impairment charges are included in the cost of sales, selling and administra-
tive expenses and research and development expenses in a ratio equivalent to the use of the asset."
"Write-
ups are recognized in other operating income."
"Additional disclosures regarding leases 
In the course of its business operations, Henkel enters into various lease agreements as a lessee."
"The under-
lying assets primarily include office buildings and fixtures, production facilities and warehouses – all of which 
are recognized under land, land rights and buildings – as well as plant and machinery, and the vehicles and 
IT inventory classified as factory and office equipment."
"Right-of-use assets are recognized initially at the value of the lease liability plus any lease payments made at 
or prior to provision of the leased asset, less any lease incentives received."
"Furthermore, additions include 
all initial direct costs incurred by the lessee together with the estimated cost of dismantling or returning the 
leased asset to the condition, and similar, required by the lease agreement at the end of the lease term."
"In 
the case of short-term leases and leases involving assets of low value, the Henkel Group exercises the option 
not to recognize a right-of-use asset or a lease liability."
"In fiscal 2023, the Henkel Group recognized additions to right-of-use assets in property, plant and equipment 
of 99 million euros in total (previous year: 204 million euros), attributable mainly to land, land rights and 
buildings."
Acquisitions accounted for additions of 4 million euros (previous year: 3 million euros).
"The additions 
were offset by scheduled depreciation and impairment of 149 million euros (previous year: 153 million euros)."
"As of December 31, 2023, right-of-use assets amounted to 554 million euros (previous year: 605 million euros)."
"The Henkel Group uses the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments when measuring its lease 
liabilities."
"This rate is based on country-specific interest rates that are observable in the market and which 
are adjusted with regard to duration and credit risk."
"If no interest rates are observable for the relevant durations, 
they are derived from linear interpolation."
"An analysis of the maturities of the lease liabilities of the Henkel Group is included with the disclosures on 
financial instruments in Note 23 on pages 286 to 319."
"Some of Henkel’s leases for land, land rights and buildings include optional lease periods."
"Contractually 
agreed payments in these optional lease periods are in the mid-triple-digit million euros range, as was also 
the case in the previous year."
"They are not included in the measurement of the lease liability because there 
is insufficient certainty that the option on the lease periods will be exercised."
"Of the receivables from non-consolidated subsidiaries and associates, 0 million euros is attributable to 
non-consolidated subsidiaries, as was also the case in the previous year."
The receivables from Henkel Trust e.V.
"and external pension funds relate to pension payments made by 
Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA to retirees for which reimbursement can be claimed from Henkel Trust e.V.
"and 
external pension funds."
"In addition, the shares in investment funds are never used for liquidity 
management purposes and are therefore not classified as readily monetizable."
"As of December 31, 2023, the carrying 
amount of these non-current financial assets was 22 million euros (previous year: 16 million euros)."
"Sundry 
non-current financial assets include, among others, receivables from insurance companies."
"This also 
applies to temporary differences in valuation arising through acquisitions, with the exception of deferred 
tax liabilities relating to goodwill."
"Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences related to shares in subsidiaries are recognized to 
the extent that a reversal of this difference is expected in the foreseeable future, or cannot be controlled."
"Changes in the deferred taxes in the statement of financial position result in deferred tax expenses or income 
unless the underlying item is directly recognized in other comprehensive income."
"For items recognized directly 
in other comprehensive income, the associated deferred taxes are also recognized in other comprehensive 
income."
"The valuation, recognition and breakdown of deferred taxes in respect of the various items in the statement 
of financial position are disclosed under Note 32 “Taxes on income” on pages 325 to 331."
"Payments on account for purchasing inventories are like-
wise disclosed under the inventories heading."
"When accounting for cash flow hedges under IFRS 9, the measurement effects from hedging instruments for 
acquiring non-financial assets are initially recognized in equity in the hedge reserve, and included as part of 
the cost upon acquisition of the assets."
"The IFRS 9 basis adjustment shown under inventories relates to the 
results of currency hedges for the procurement of inventories in a foreign currency and of hedging certain raw 
materials purchases against market price risks."
"Further information can be found in the financial instruments 
report in Note 23 on pages 286 to 319."
"The overhead add-ons are calculated on the 
basis of average capacity utilization."
"Not included, however, are interest expenses incurred during the manu-
facturing period."
"The net realizable value is determined as an estimated selling price less costs yet to be incurred through to 
completion, and less necessary selling and distribution costs."
"Write-downs to the net realizable value are 
made if, at the measurement date, the carrying amounts of the inventories are above their realizable market 
values."
"The resultant valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023 amounted to 212 million euros (previous 
year: 225 million euros)."
"The carrying amount of inventories recognized at net realizable value amounted to 
597 million euros (previous year: 914 million euros)."

"Of this figure, 1,855 million euros (previous year: 1,028 million euros) relates to cash 
and 96 million euros (previous year: 60 million euros) to cash equivalents."
"The change in cash and cash 
equivalents is shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows."
"Disposal must be expected within one year from the time of reclassification as held for 
sale."
"Disposal groups include a group of assets earmarked for sale or otherwise disposal together in a single 
transaction, together with the liabilities that are directly linked to these assets and transferred as part of the 
transaction."
"Immediately before the reclassification of any assets and liabilities to the held-for-sale category, the relevant 
measurement rules for the balance sheet item are applied for the last time."
"For non-financial assets, this also 
implies performing an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36."
"Any impairment recognized in this context 
is reported in the consolidated statement of income in accordance with the rules formulated for the balance 
sheet item."
"After reclassification, scheduled amortization/depreciation is no longer recognized for the assets."
"Instead, the assets and disposal groups are recognized at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs 
of disposal (level 3)."
"The fair value less costs of disposal is generally determined by current price negotiations 
with potential buyers."
"The expense from any write-down to fair value less costs of disposal is recognized 
under other operating expenses."
"Cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable are carried at 
amortized cost."

Year on year, assets held for sale decreased from 731 million euros to 100 million euros."
"As of December 31, 
2023, the Henkel Group held no liabilities for sale, compared to 177 million euros of liabilities held for sale 
at the end of the previous year."
"The disposals connected with the assets and liabilities held for sale in fiscal 
2023 relate substantially to assets and liabilities of the business in Russia, which was divested during the 
period under review."
"They were comprised of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (281 million 
euros), current assets (444 million euros), non-current liabilities (3 million euros) and current liabilities 
(208 million euros)."
"Further disposals of assets held for sale related to assets sold in connection with the other divestments in 
the fiscal year which are explained in more detail on pages 225 and 226."
"The assets that were disposed of 
essentially comprised trademark rights and proportionate goodwill."
"Some of these assets were only reclassi-
fied to assets held for sale in fiscal 2023."
Active portfolio management is a key element of the Henkel Group’s approach to the future.
"The reclassifi-
cations of assets to assets held for sale in this context in fiscal 2023 mainly relate to the planned disposal of 
a business in the Adhesive Technologies business unit and primarily comprise goodwill, technologies and 
property, plant and equipment."
"In fiscal 2023, impairment losses of 1 million euros were recognized on assets already classified as held for 
sale due to a fair value less costs of disposal that was below the carrying amount (previous year: no impair-
ment losses)."
"In connection with the sale of the business in Russia, write-ups of valuation allowances for as-
sets to a higher fair value less costs of disposal were recognized in an amount of 184 million euros in fiscal 
2022."
"They are included in the cost of sales, selling and distribution costs, and in other operating expenses."
"In 
fiscal 2022, they thus had the effect of reducing impairment losses recognized before the assets were clas-
sified as held for sale."
No write-ups were performed in fiscal 2023.
The company still plans to dispose of these businesses.

"16 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations 
Description of the pension plans 
Employees in companies included in the consolidated financial statements have entitlements under company 
pension plans which are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans."
"These take different forms 
depending on the legal, financial and tax regimes of each country."
"The level of benefits provided is based, as 
a rule, on the length of service and on the income of the person entitled."
"Details of pension benefits for 
members of the Management Board are provided in the explanatory notes to the remuneration policy and 
in the remuneration report."
"In defined benefit plans, the liability for pensions and other post-employment benefits is calculated at the 
present value of the future obligations (projected unit credit method)."
"This actuarial method of calculation 
takes future trends in wages, salaries and retirement benefits into account."
The majority of the beneficiaries of these pension plans are located in Germany and the USA.
"The pension 
obligations are primarily financed via various external trust assets and pension funds that are legally inde-
pendent of Henkel."
"Active employees of Henkel in Germany participate in a defined contribution system, “Altersversorgung 2004 
(AV 2004),” which was newly formed in 2004."
"AV 2004 is an employer-financed pension plan that reflects 
the personal income development of employees during their career at Henkel and thus provides a performance-
related pension."
Henkel guarantees a return on the company’s contributions.
"The benefit essentially consists 
of an annuity payable upon attainment of the statutory retirement age plus a lump-sum payment if the 
annuity threshold is exceeded in the employee’s service period."
"In addition to retirement and disability 
pensions, the plan benefits include surviving spouse and surviving child benefits."
"Henkel assures its employ-
ees that a lump-sum amount is available upon retirement which is at least equivalent to the level of principal 
contributions made by Henkel."
"Henkel pays the pension contribution into an investment fund established 
for the purpose of the company pension plan."
"Upon attaining statutory retirement age, employees can choose in both pension plans between an annuity 
through transfer of the superannuation lump sum to a pension fund, or a one-time payment, or payment in 
installments."
"To provide protection under civil law of the pension entitlements of future and current pensioners of Henkel AG & 
Co."
"KGaA in Germany against insolvency, we have transferred the proceeds of the bond issued in 2005 and 
certain other assets to Henkel Trust e.V."
"The trustee invests the cash with which it has been entrusted in the 
capital market in accordance with investment policies laid down in the trust agreement."
"In fiscal 2021, we 
transferred the entitlements of most Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA pensioners and their surviving dependents in 
Germany to an external pension fund."
Plan assets were correspondingly transferred from Henkel Trust e.V.
to the external pension fund.
"This did not have any effect on the recognition of pension obligations in Germany 
under IFRSs."
"The only changes were in the primary funding of pension obligations and the way in which 
benefits are provided."
"The non-insurance pension fund is subject to the German Insurance Supervision Act 
and thus falls under the control of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)."
"In addition, we also subsidize medical benefits for active and retired employees resident mainly in the USA."
"Under these programs, retirees are reimbursed a certain percentage of their refundable medical expenses."
"We recognize provisions during the employees’ service period and pay out the promised benefits when they 
are claimed."
"The subsidies paid to active employees for medical services are recognized as a current expense 
and are therefore not included in the provisions for pensions and similar obligations."
"The contributions for defined contribution plans, excluding 
multi-employer plans, for the reporting period amounted to 134 million euros (previous year: 132 million euros)."
"Multi-employer plans  
Henkel provides defined pension benefits that are financed by more than one employer."
"Within the Henkel 
Group, benefits from multi-employer plans are provided for employees in the USA."
"The multi-employer plan 
in the USA is treated as a defined contribution plan because, due to the limited share of the contribution 
volume in the plan, the information available for each of the financing companies is insufficient for defined 
benefit accounting."
"Withdrawal from the multi-employer plan at the present time would incur a one-time 
expense of around 23 million euros (previous year: around 20 million euros)."
"Payments into the multi-employer 
plan in fiscal 2023 amounted to 1 million euros (previous year: 1 million euros)."
"We expect contributions of 
around 2 million euros in fiscal 2024."
Henkel’s share in the overall plan is less than 1 percent.
"Assumptions 
Group-wide, the obligations from our pension plans are valued by an independent external actuary at the 
end of the fiscal year."
"The calculations at the end of the fiscal year are based on the actuarial assumptions 
below."
These are given as the weighted average.
"The mortality rates used are based on published statistics 
and experience relating to each country."
"In Germany, the assumptions in both the fiscal year and the previ-
ous year were based on the Heubeck 2018 G mortality table."
"In the USA, the assumptions in each case were 
based on the modified Pri-2012 mortality table."
"The valuation of pension obligations in Germany was based 
essentially on the assumption of a 2.0-percent increase in retirement benefits (previous year: 2.0 percent)."
"This effect is recognized under 
actuarial losses as a change in the financial assumptions."

of plan assets."
"Payments of 176 million euros recognized in the previous year for plan settlements resulted primarily from the 
transfer of pension obligations in the USA to an external insurance company."
"The pension obligations of 180 mil-
lion euros were settled with pension assets valued at 176 million euros, producing a gain of 4 million euros."
"The other changes in 2022 related to developments in the volume of obligations and the fair value of plan 
assets result primarily from the derecognition of a pension obligation in Switzerland."
"This did not have any 
effect on the net obligation."
"Of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) amounting to 4,143 million euros (previous year: 3,849 million euros), 
3,775 million euros (previous year: 3,484 million euros) is fully or partially covered by plan assets."
"101 million 
euros (previous year: 103 million euros) is covered by reimbursement rights."
"The average weighted duration of pension obligations is 11 years (previous year: 11 years) for Germany, 
7 years (previous year: 6 years) for the USA and 14 years (previous year: 13 years) for other countries."
"In determining the net obligation, we take into account amounts that are not recognized due to asset ceiling 
restrictions."
"If the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the obligations arising from the pension benefits, an 
asset is recognized only if the reporting entity can also derive economic benefit from these assets, for example 
in the form of return flows or a future reduction in contributions (asset ceiling)."
"In the reporting period, we 
recorded an amount of 21 million euros as an asset ceiling (previous year: 25 million euros)."
"Within our consolidated statement of income, current service costs are allocated on the basis of cost of sales 
to the respective function."
"Only the balance of interest expense for the defined benefit obligation and interest 
income for the plan assets and asset ceiling is reported in financial result."
"All gains/losses from the termination, 
curtailment and amendment of plans are recognized in other operating income/expenses."
"Employer contribu-
tions to state pension insurance are included as “Social security contributions and staff welfare costs” under 
Note 35 on page 334."
"In 2023, additions to plan assets totaled 58 million euros (previous year: 45 million euros)."
Payments into pension funds in fiscal 2024 are expected to total 50 million euros.
"The reimbursement rights covering a portion of the pension obligations in the USA are assets that are not 
protected against insolvency and therefore are not classified as plan assets under IAS 19 Employee Benefits."
"The reimbursement rights indicated are available to the Group in order to cover the expenditures required 
to fulfill the respective pension obligations."
"Reimbursement rights and the associated pension obligations 
must, according to IAS 19, be shown unnetted in the statement of financial position."

Analysis of plan assets 
 
Dec."
KGaA from the assumption of pension payments for Henkel Trust e.V.
and external pension funds.
"The objective of the investment strategy for the global plan assets is the long-term security of pension 
payments."
"This is ensured by comprehensive risk management that takes into account the asset and liability 
portfolios of the defined benefit pension plans."
"Henkel pursues a liability-driven investment (LDI) approach 
in order to achieve the investment objective."
"This approach takes into account the structure of the pension 
obligations and manages the cover ratio of the pension plans."
"To improve this ratio, Henkel invests plan 
assets in a diversified portfolio for which the expected long-term yield is above the interest costs of the 
pension obligations."
"The target portfolio structure of the plan assets is essentially determined in 
asset-liability studies."
"These studies are conducted regularly with the help of external advisors who assist 
Henkel in the investment of plan assets."
"They examine the actual portfolio structure, taking into account current 
capital market conditions, investment principles and the obligation structure, and can suggest adjustments 
to be made to the portfolio."
"Risks associated with pension obligations 
Our internal pension risk management function monitors the risks of all pension plans Group-wide in 
compliance with local legal regulations."
"As part of the monitoring process, guidelines on the control and 
management of risks are adopted and continuously developed; these guidelines mainly govern funding 
levels, portfolio structure and actuarial assumptions."
"The objective of the financing strategy within the Group 
is to ensure that plan assets cover at least 90 to 100 percent of the present value of the funded pension 
obligations."
"The contributions and investment strategies are intended to ensure complete coverage of the 
plans for the duration of the pension obligations."
Henkel’s pension obligations are exposed to various market risks.
"These risks are counteracted by ensuring the 
required funding level and the structure of pension benefits."
"The risks relate primarily to changes in market 
interest rates, inflation, and life expectancy, as well as general market fluctuations."
"Pension obligations 
based on contractual provisions in Germany generally entail lifelong benefits payable when the employee 
reaches retirement age or in the case of incapacity or death."
"Newly hired employees 
since 2011 receive a commitment based primarily on the lump-sum benefit."
"In principle, lump-sum benefits 
may also be paid out as an annuity through a pension fund."
"All benefits in Germany are financed through a 
provident fund (Vorsorgefonds) established for the purpose of the occupational pension plan."
"Benefits for 
new employees since 2011, as well as a portion of the entitlements vested since 2004, are linked to the perfor-
mance of this provident fund, resulting in a reduction in overall risk to the corporation."
"The described adjust-
ments within the pension structure reduce the financial risk arising from pension commitments in Germany."
"By linking the benefit to the capital investment, the net risk is also largely eliminated."
"An increase in the 
long-term inflation assumption would mainly affect the expected increase in pensions and the expected 
trend in pension-eligible salaries."
New employees receive pension benefits based on a defined contribution plan.
"The pension 
benefits generally have a lump-sum option which is usually exercised."
"When a pension becomes payable, 
the amount granted is determined on the basis of current market interest rates."
"As a result, the impact of a 
change to the interest rate used in the calculation is low compared to pension commitments entailing life-
long benefits."
"Additionally, in the USA, pensions paid once are not adjusted by amount, thus there are no 
direct risks during the pension payment period arising from pending annuity adjustments."
"Inflation risks 
therefore result mainly from the salary adjustments awarded."
"The effects of changes to assumptions with respect to medical benefits for employees and retirees in the 
USA are shown in the sensitivity analysis."
The analysis of our Group-wide pension obligations revealed no extraordinary risks.
"Companies based in Germany and the USA account for 81 percent 
(previous year: 80 percent) of our pension obligations."
"The medical costs incurred after retirement by former 
employees of our subsidiaries in the USA are also recognized in the pension obligations for defined benefit 
plans."
"The rate of increase assumed in respect of such medical costs in fiscal 2023 is 6.8 percent (previous 
year: 5.9 percent)."
"We expect this rate of increase to fall gradually to 4.0 percent by 2049 (previous year: 
4.0 percent by 2047)."
"In the USA, an extension of life expectancy by one year would 
increase the present value of pension obligations by 2 percent (previous year: 2 percent)."
"Thus the percentage increases and decreases do not vary 
with the same absolute amount."
Each sensitivity is independently calculated with no scenario analysis.
"Provisions are recognized for obligations toward third parties where the outflow of resources is probable 
and the expected obligation can be reliably estimated."
"Provisions are measured to the best estimate of the 
expenditures required in order to meet the current obligation as of the reporting date."
"Price increases ex-
pected to take place prior to the time of performance are included in the calculation."
"Provisions in which the 
interest effect is material are discounted to the reporting date at a pre-tax interest rate."
"For obligations in 
Germany, we have applied interest rates of between 3.3 and 3.7 percent (previous year: 3.8 and 4.2 percent)."
"Provisions are recognized in respect of restructuring measures, on condition that work has begun on the 
implementation of a detailed, formal plan or such a plan has already been communicated."
"Additions to the 
restructuring provisions relate to the optimization of our production, logistics and sales and distribution 
structures."
"The figure was impacted in particular by expenditure relating to the merger of the former business 
units Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care into the integrated Consumer Brands business unit."
Sales provisions cover expected refunds to customers and risks arising from pending transactions.
"Commit-
ments to customers result in cash outflows in the following period."
"Personnel provisions essentially cover expenditures likely to be incurred by the Group for variable, perfor-
mance-related remuneration components."
"Sundry provisions include, for example, provisions for warranties in production and engineering."
"Also in-
cluded are provisions to cover the risk arising from legal disputes and proceedings, representing not just the 
cash outflows for the probable amount but also the anticipated cost of legal – for example civil-law – pro-
ceedings."
"The pending judicial and arbitration court proceedings or public authority proceedings relate in 
particular to issues of product liability, product deficiency, competition law, infringement of proprietary 
rights, patent law, tax law, environmental protection and legacy remediation."
"Predictions of the course and outcomes of legal disputes are inherently problematic and subject to high un-
certainties."
"Based on the knowledge currently available, no material future impact on the net assets, financial 
position and results of operations of the corporation is expected."

"2 Cross-currency interest rate swaps and currency forwards are in place to convert the interest and principal payments on the bonds denominated in British pounds, Swiss francs and US dollars into 
euro payments."
The hedge of the bond with a nominal value of 250 million US dollars was discontinued in December 2023.
"Instead, the bond has been designated as a hedging instrument within a

borrowings."
"The coupons on these bonds are fixed in principle and dependent on the achievement of certain 
sustainability performance targets relating to the sustainability of our packaging and to the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions."
"Failure by Henkel to meet these targets on the respective fixed date would result 
in a prospective increase in the coupon payable on the bonds from said fixed date onward until maturity."
"In the case of the US dollar bond, the capital surcharge at maturity would be 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points, 
depending on whether one or both targets are missed."
"The surcharge on the coupon of the two euro-
denominated bonds would be 0.375 or 0.75 percentage points respectively, for the residual term after the 
fixed date."
"In April 2023, Henkel repaid as scheduled the bond denominated in Swiss francs with a nominal amount of 
330 million Swiss francs."
"Further changes in current borrowings resulted from the decrease in commercial paper liabilities from 
516 million euros at the end of 2022 to 275 million euros as of December 31, 2023."
"Liabilities to banks include financial collateral received from banks, in addition to loans and borrowings."
"Said 
collateral amounted to 88 million euros as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 162 million euros)."
"For further details of lease 
liability measurement, please refer to Note 2 on pages 250 to 254."
"contract liabilities 
as defined in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers) in the amount of 88 million euros (previous 
year: 4 million euros)."
"On December 31, 2023, non-current contract liabilities also included a deferral for the 
use of trademark rights (see section “Acquisitions and divestments” on pages 223 to 226)."
"The reduction of 
this liability resulted in the recognition of revenues totaling 13 million euros in fiscal 2023."
"21 Trade accounts payable 
Trade accounts payable decreased from 4,621 million euros to 4,075 million euros."
"In addition to purchase 
invoices, they also relate to accruals for invoices outstanding in respect of goods and services received."
"They 
are all due within one year."
"As part of its strategic supplier management concept, Henkel offers selected 
suppliers around the world the option to join its supplier financing programs."
Henkel pays the invoice amount to the bank or platform operator when it is due.
"Payment 
terms are within the customary limits for the industry."
"Henkel has evaluated these programs, based on vari-
ous indicators, and has concluded that the respective liabilities continue to bear the characteristics of trade 
accounts payable."
"Accordingly, the associated payments to the bank/platform operator are presented as 
cash outflows from operating activities."
"As of December 31, 2023, suppliers had so far received payments of 
0.5 billion euros under this program (previous year: 0.8 billion euros)."
"22 Income tax liabilities 
Income tax liabilities include tax obligations and uncertain tax positions."
"The tax treatment of certain items 
and transactions is, in part, dependent on future recognition by the tax authorities or tax judiciary."
"Insofar as 
it is deemed likely that the tax authorities will not accept a tax position, this is taken into consideration when 
determining the income tax liabilities and other tax items, with the most probable or expected amount then 
being applied (per IAS 12 and IFRIC 23)."
"The same assumptions are applied to both current and deferred 
taxes when accounting for uncertain tax positions."
"Uncertain tax positions can arise when new tax regulations are applied or interpretations of existing tax 
regulations are amended."
"In relation to deferred income tax assets, this results in a tax risk in the mid- to 
high double-digit million euros range as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: low to mid-double-digit million 
euros range)."
Occurrence of the underlying risk is not deemed to be particularly likely.
"Within the Henkel Group, financial instruments are reported in the statement of financial position under 
trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, borrowings, other financial assets, other financial liabilities, 
and cash and cash equivalents."
"Financial instruments are recognized once Henkel becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial 
instrument and thereby acquires rights or enters into comparable obligations relating to same."
"The recognition 
of financial assets takes place at the settlement date, with the exception of derivative financial instruments, 
which are recognized at the trade date."
All financial instruments are initially reported at their fair value.
"Only 
those trade accounts receivable without any material financing component are recognized at transaction 
price as defined in IFRS 15."
"Transaction costs are only capitalized if the financial instruments are not subse-
quently measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Financial assets in respect of which cash flows occur at specified times and represent 
solely interest and principal payments are classified depending on the business model under which they are 
held."
"If the business model essentially requires the assets to be held – albeit with their sale remaining possible 
where necessary to cover liquidity needs, for example – said assets are recognized at fair value through 
other comprehensive income."
"Financial instruments in respect of which cash flows are comprised entirely of interest and principal pay-
ments but which are not held within one of the two aforementioned business models, are recognized at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"In addition, a risk provision must be accrued in the amount of expected credit losses for financial assets that 
are measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"For more details, 
please refer to the notes relating to trade accounts receivable on page 259 and relating to credit risk on 
pages 306 to 312."
"Financial assets in respect of which the cash flows are not comprised entirely of interest and principal pay-
ments are always recognized at fair value through profit or loss."
"At Henkel this is the case with derivative 
financial assets and shares in investment funds."
"As a rule, Henkel exercises its right to choose to recognize 
equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"This approach is commensurate with 
the fact that, generally, the corporation does not plan to sell the assets to benefit from short-term changes 
in their fair value."
"If these equity instruments are, nevertheless, sold or derecognized for some other reason, 
the valuation effects accumulated up to then in other comprehensive income are reclassified to retained 
earnings rather than the consolidated statement of income."
"Exceptionally, derivative financial liabilities and the virtual power purchase agreements included under sundry 
financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Hedge accounting is applied in individual cases – where possible and economically sensible – in order to avoid 
profit and loss variations arising from fair value changes in derivative financial instruments."
"Fair value and 
cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are designated within the Group depend-
ing on the type of underlying and the risk being hedged."
"Details relating to the hedging contracts transacted 
within the Group and how the fair values of the derivatives are determined are provided on pages 297 to 305."
"The carrying amounts of borrowings recognized in connection with a fair value hedge are adjusted for the 
valuation effect from the hedged risk."
"Henkel currently exercises the fair value option in selected instances for financial assets if this reduces an 
accounting mismatch between the assets and the corresponding derivative financial instruments hedging 
material market risks of said assets."
"In the case of already contracted future purchases of non-financial assets 
containing embedded derivatives, Henkel exercises the option on a case-by-case basis to recognize the 
entire contract at fair value through profit or loss."
"Valuation parameters as close to market reality as possible must be used as input factors to determine 
fair value."
"The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the input factors used in the valuation methods in three descend-
ing levels, depending on market proximity: 
 Level 1: Fair values which are determined on the basis of quoted, unadjusted prices in active markets."
" Level 2: Fair values which are determined on the basis of parameters for which either directly or indirectly 
derived market prices are available."
"The fair value of securities and time deposits, and bonds, classified as level 1, is based on the quoted market 
prices on the reporting date."
"Observable market data are used to measure the fair value of level 2 securities, 
time deposits and cash equivalents."
"If bid and ask prices are available, the mid price is used to determine the 
fair value."
"When measuring derivative financial instruments, the credit risk is determined by netting all financial 
assets, liabilities, collateral received and collateral provided for each counterparty to determine the net 
credit exposure."
"An explanation of the method used to determine the fair values of derivative financial instru-
ments can be found on pages 297 to 305."
"In the absence of forward quotes in the market, the fair value is determined on the basis of bids 
obtained from several banks for new contracts involving similar products."
"Changes in the fair values determined using this procedure are recognized in full in other comprehensive 
income and are presented in the hedge reserve."
"Reclassification of the corresponding amounts to the cost 
of hedged inventories is performed when the derivatives are realized."
"This occurs when the hedged invento-
ries are recognized."
"A 10-percent higher (lower) forward price of the derivatives on the reporting date would 
have resulted in other comprehensive income increasing (decreasing) by 0 million euros."
"Other investments and securities include shares in companies and in investment funds that are currently not 
intended for sale."
"The fair value of other investments and securities is based either on information derived 
from recent financing transactions, on a cost-based method, or on valuation using the discounted cash flow 
method taking into account the free cash flow of the share or fund investment."
"Appropriate risk-adjusted 
costs of capital are applied when using the discounted cash flow method."
"If any conceivably realistic changes were to 
occur in the valuation parameters, the change in the fair values revealed by sensitivity analysis would not 
exceed in total a euro range in the mid-single-digit millions."
"Such changes are attributable virtually entirely 
to other investments and would be included in other comprehensive income."
"Changes in the fair values of 
securities are recognized in other financial result."
"No valuation results recognized in equity were reclassified 
to retained earnings in the year under review, nor in the previous year."
"As part of our sustainability strategy to achieve our climate targets, we have entered into virtual power purchase 
agreements in the USA and Europe."
"The renewable energy generation facilities underlying the agreements 
are managed by their respective operators."
"Henkel has no rights of determination or control over the use of 
the facilities."
"The benefits to the contract partners come in the form of two components: a cash flow that 
depends, among other things, on the development of the respective spot electricity price, and certificates 
that Henkel receives as proof of origin for electricity from renewable energies."
"The cash flow between Henkel 
and the operator serves to settle, on a monthly basis, the difference between the contractually fixed price 
per MWh of electricity produced and the respective spot electricity price when the electricity is fed into the 
grid."
"The agreed compensation payments between Henkel and the operator are limited to a maximum 
differential amount for Henkel, so that fluctuations in value arising from the agreements are limited."
"The annual 
production volume forecast under the virtual power purchase agreement in the USA is 300,000 MWh."
"The 
agreement in Europe is for an annual production forecast of 200,000 MWh."
"The respective contract terms from 
start of operation of the wind farm/solar park are 10.5 years in the USA and 10 years in Europe."
"Due to the 
derivatives embedded in the agreements, each contract is accounted for at fair value through profit or loss."
"The fair value allocated to level 3 is derived from the present value of the expected cash flows from the 
agreement."
"In addition to 
the expected electricity prices, a primary parameter for valuation of the virtual power purchase agreement 
executed in Europe in fiscal 2022 is the euro interest rate used for discounting."
"A change of 10 percent in the 
expected electricity prices or of 100 base points in the discount rate would result in a change in the fair 
value of the virtual power purchase agreement concerned of 0 million euros."
"At the time of initial recognition, the fair values of the virtual power purchase agreements were higher than 
the transaction price."
"The respective differences were deferred and will be recognized pro rata temporis as 
earnings in the statement of income over the term of the agreement, once operations commence at the 
wind farm or solar park on which the respective virtual power purchase agreement is based."
"The deferred 
difference is recognized in the statement of financial position, together with the positive or negative fair 
value of the agreement, under other financial assets or other financial liabilities."
"Changes in the fair value 
and deferred amount are recognized in other operating income or other operating expenses in the state-
ment of income."
"On January 1, 2023, the deferred difference recognized for the virtual power purchase 
agreement in the USA was 13 million euros (previous year: 13 million euros)."
"In the reporting period, 1 million 
euros was recognized as other operating income (previous year: 1 million euros)."
"The difference remaining 
as of December 31, 2023, after allowing for currency effects, was 11 million euros (previous year: 13 million euros)."
"The deferred difference for the agreement in Europe, which was executed in the second half of 2022, 
amounted to 4 million euros on both January 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023."
"Since the solar park has not 
yet started operating, no income was recognized in the year under review."
"No reclassifications between the valuation categories or classes per IFRS 7, nor within the fair value hierarchy, 
were performed during the reporting period or in the comparable prior period."
"Recognition of the 
gains and losses arising from fair value changes of derivative financial instruments is dependent upon 
whether hedge accounting rules are applicable."
"The Group ensures that its hedge accounting is consistent 
with the Group risk management objectives and strategy, and that a qualitative and forward-looking approach 
is adopted when assessing the effectiveness of its hedging transactions."
"Hedge accounting is not applied for derivative financial instruments as long as their valuation is offset by direct 
compensatory changes in the fair values of the hedged items or the requirements for hedge accounting are 
not fulfilled."
"We recognize directly in the statement of income the fair value changes in these derivatives 
which, in economic terms, represent effective hedges within the framework of the Group strategy."
"In deroga-
tion from the above, hedges of intragroup financing arrangements in US dollars where valuation effects 
cannot be fully eliminated in the consolidated financial statements are accounted for as cash flow hedges."
"When 
closing the transaction, Henkel documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, together with the risk management objectives and strategies of the hedging transactions."
"All derivatives 
classified as hedging instruments are tied to specific committed and planned transactions."
"Henkel uses 
acknowledged methods – such as the dollar offset method or the hypothetical derivative method – to deter-
mine the effective portion of the hedges and any ineffective portions."
"In the previous year, there were no hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation."
2 Fair values including accrued interest and excluding valuation allowance for counterparty credit risk of 0 million euros (previous year: 0 million euros).

"The adjustment 
relating to fiscal 2023 amounts to 0 million euros (previous year: 0 million euros)."
"Changes in credit risk are 
recognized through profit or loss in financial result."
"Depending on their fair value and their remaining term on the reporting date, derivative financial instruments 
are included in current or non-current financial assets (positive fair value) or in current or non-current financial 
liabilities (negative fair value)."
"Most of the currency forwards served to hedge risks arising from trade accounts receivable and payable, and 
those pertaining to Group financing."
"Fair value hedges 
A fair value hedge hedges fluctuations in the fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or unrecognized 
firm commitments which arise from a specific risk."
"The changes in the fair values of the hedging instruments 
and of the hedged items resulting from the hedged risk are simultaneously recognized through profit or loss 
in other financial result."
To hedge the fair value risk of a fixed-rate bond issued by Henkel AG & Co.
"KGaA in September 2022 with a 
nominal volume of 650 million euros, interest rate swaps with identical nominal volumes and the same term 
were used in both fiscal 2023 and the previous year as fair value hedges."
"The hedged underlying is recognized 
under non-current borrowings."
"The Henkel 
Group uses this instrument to hedge currency, interest rate, and commodity price risks."
"The effective portion 
of the change in fair value of the cash flow hedge is initially recognized in equity under cash flow hedge 
reserve."
"The ineffective portion of the change in value is recognized directly through profit or loss in financial 
result or operating profit, depending on the hedged item."
"Amounts recognized in the 
reserves are released through profit or loss in the same period in which the hedged item impacts profit or 
loss."

The reserves disclosed in equity essentially relate to currency hedges for past acquisitions, anticipated sales, 
planned inventory purchases, and for our foreign currency bonds."
"The cash flow hedge reserve of -205 mil-
lion euros as of December 31, 2023, (previous year: -205 million euros) was attributable to results from 
hedges that were no longer subject to hedge accounting."
"Currency risk 
As part of its risk management, the Henkel Group hedges fluctuations in cash flows of planned sales and 
inventory purchases in foreign currencies against currency risk."
"Currency forwards or recognized receivables 
and payables are used as hedging instruments."
They are all due within one year.
"In the case of currency 
forwards, no ineffective portions arise since the Group only designates the spot component as the hedging 
instrument."
"Changes in the non-designated components of the derivatives over the term of the hedge are 
recognized in the hedging cost reserve."
"The hedge ratio is determined individually, depending on the 
relevant strategy for each currency."
"The 
positive and negative fair values of the derivatives contracted as a currency hedge of planned inventory pur-
chases and as a currency hedge of budgeted sales amounted to 25 million euros (previous year: 62 million 
euros) and -9 million euros (previous year: -12 million euros) respectively."
"The cash flows from these currency 
derivatives, like the cash flows from the hedged inventory purchases and the hedged sales, are expected to 
occur and affect operating profit in the next fiscal year when the inventories are used and the sales revenue 
is realized."
"In addition to the currency derivatives, foreign currency trade accounts payable are designated as hedging 
instruments for planned sales."
"The carrying amount of the liabilities designated as hedging instruments 
amounted to 472 million euros (previous year: 675 million euros)."
"The cash flows from these liabilities and 
the cash flows from the hedged sales are expected to occur, and affect operating profit, in the next fiscal 
year."
The hedge transactions did not produce any ineffective portions.
"In addition, hedges of existing and planned intragroup financing arrangements in US dollars are recognized 
as cash flow hedges if their valuation effects cannot be fully eliminated in the consolidated financial state-
ments."
"The hedges do not contain any ineffective portions since the Group only designates the spot compo-
nent as the hedging instrument."
"Changes in the non-designated components of the derivatives over the 
term of the hedge are recognized in the hedging cost reserve."
"In the year under review, these hedges re-
sulted in an addition to the reserves (net of deferred taxes) of 12 million euros (previous year: 24 million eu-
ros)."
"Additions to the cash flow hedge reserve in the reporting year and the previous year were reclassified 
in full in each respective year to profit or loss."
"In fiscal 2023, gains of 14 million euros (previous year: gains of 
35 million euros) were reclassified to other financial result, where the corresponding valuation effects from 
intragroup financing arrangements are also recognized."
"In the year under review, losses of 7 million euros 
(previous year: losses of 1 million euros) were reclassified through profit or loss from the hedging cost reserve 
to the interest result."
"As of December 31, 2023, the positive fair values of the respective derivatives totaled 
34 million euros (previous year: 21 million euros)."
"The cash flows from these currency derivatives, like the 
cash flows from the hedged intragroup financing arrangements, are expected to occur within the next four 
years."
"Fixed payments in foreign currencies are converted into fixed-rate payments in euros through cross-currency 
interest rate swaps."
"Changes in the non-designated foreign currency basis spreads over their duration are 
recognized in hedging cost reserve."
"The cash flows from the cross-currency interest rate swap that are at-
tributable to the interest payments were recognized proportionately for the reporting period through profit 
or loss as an interest expense."
"The term of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is matched to the term of 
the respective bond."
"In fiscal 2023, Henkel hedged part of the sale price for its Russian business with currency forwards to hedge 
the currency risk of the Russian ruble."
"When recognizing the cash flow hedge of the highly probable receipt 
of payment, only the spot component of the derivatives was designated as a hedge."
"As such, no ineffective 
portions required recognition."
"The non-designated components of the currency forwards were recognized 
over the term of the hedge in the hedging cost reserve."
"In the year under review, a gain of 23 million euros 
(net of deferred taxes) was recognized for this hedge in the cash flow hedge reserve and a loss of -5 million 
euros in the hedging cost reserve for cash flow hedges."
"Upon receipt of payment, the amounts were reclas-
sified to other operating expenses and included in the net loss from the divestment."
"Interest rate risk  
As was also the case in fiscal 2022, we hedged part of the risk of interest rate changes in connection with our 
commercial paper program using interest rate swaps with a nominal volume of 300 million US dollars (previous 
year: 300 million US dollars) in the year under review."
"The swaps were designated as hedging instruments in 
cash flow hedges."
"Because of the revolving nature of our commercial paper borrowings, the interest payments 
in US dollars are variable and were converted into fixed-interest payments through the interest rate swap."
"The interest rate 
swaps were designated as hedging instruments used in a fair value hedge."
"The interest rate swaps were used 
to convert the interest payments on the bond to variable payments."
"Commodity price risk 
Payments for planned commodity purchases are selectively hedged against fluctuations due to changes in 
the purchase prices of raw materials."
Commodity forwards are used to hedge this risk.
"They are all due within 
one year."
The Group only designates the commodity price component of the planned raw material purchases.
"Other price components, such as transportation costs, are not designated."
"Accordingly, there are no ineffec-
tive portions."
"During fiscal 2023, the Henkel Group hedged exposures to clearly identifiable palm kernel oil, kerosene, 
benzene and natural gas components."
"In accounting for designated hedging relationships, the losses arising 
from the derivatives designated as hedging instruments amounting to 1 million euros net of deferred taxes 
(previous year: losses of 2 million euros) were recognized as additions to the reserve for cash flow hedges."
"On expiry of the hedging relationships, losses of 2 million euros (previous year: losses of 1 million euros) 
recognized in equity in the fiscal year were reclassified directly to the cost of the hedged inventories (basis 
adjustment)."
"As of December 31, 2023, contracts hedging the risk of commodity prices had a negative fair 
value of -1 million euros (previous year: -1 million euros)."
"Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The accounting treatment of hedges of net investments in foreign operations against translation risk is similar 
to that applied to cash flow hedges."
"The gain or loss arising from the effective portion of the hedging 
instrument is recognized in the reserve for hedges of net investments in foreign operations, with the ineffective 
portion recognized directly through profit or loss."
"A bond issued by Henkel with a nominal volume of 
250 million US dollars, which is included under non-current borrowings, and also the spot components of 
currency forwards, were used as hedging instruments."
"The positive and negative market values of these 
currency forwards amounted to 1 million euros and -1 million euros respectively as at December 31, 2023."
"In 
the previous year, there were no hedges of net investments in a foreign operation."
"The design of the hedging 
relationships ensured there were no ineffective portions."
"For the non-designated forward component and 
the currency basis spreads of the currency forwards used as hedging instruments, Henkel exercises its right 
to also recognize these in equity in the hedging cost reserve insofar as they relate to the hedged item."
"The changes in non-designated components of 
hedges that are recognized in equity are reclassified pro rata temporis to the statement of income over the 
term of the hedge."
"The reserve for hedges of net investments in foreign operations relates essentially to translation risks arising 
from net investments in Swiss francs, US dollars, Chinese yuan, Thai baht and British pounds."
"As of Decem-
ber 31, 2023, an amount of 30 million euros (previous year: 36 million euros) of the reserve was attributable 
to the results from hedges for which the associated contracts expired in previous years."
"In fiscal 2023, a gain of 
6 million euros was reclassified to other operating income in connection with the sale of our Russian business."

"The purpose 
of financial risk management is to restrict the exposure arising from operating activities through the use of 
selective derivative and non-derivative hedges."
"Henkel uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for 
the purposes of risk management."
"Without these instruments, Henkel would be exposed to higher financial 
risks."
"These variations in fair value should not be regarded in isolation from 
the hedged items, as derivative and hedged item constitute a unit in terms of countervailing fluctuations."
"Management of currency, interest rate and liquidity risks is based on the treasury guidelines introduced by 
the Management Board, which are binding on the entire corporation."
"These guidelines define the targets, 
principles and competencies of the Group Treasury unit."
"They also describe the fields of responsibility and 
establish the distribution of these responsibilities between Group Treasury and Henkel’s subsidiaries."
"The 
Management Board is regularly and comprehensively informed of all major risks and of all relevant hedging 
transactions and arrangements."
"A description of the objectives and fundamental principles adopted in capital 
management can be found in the combined management report on pages 145 and 146."
"There were no major 
risk clusters in the reporting period."
Appropriate details are provided in the description of the individual risks.
"Credit risk 
In the course of its business activities with third parties, the Henkel Group is inherently exposed to global 
credit risk arising from both its operating business and its financial investments."
"This risk derives from the 
possibility of the contractual party not fulfilling its obligations."
"Other financial assets include 176 million euros (previous year: 271 million euros) representing 
receivables from Henkel Trust e.V."
"and an external pension fund, which constitutes the largest of all the financial 
assets."
Given the investment structure and rules of Henkel Trust e.V.
"and of the external pension fund, the 
credit risk is very minor."
Further details of risk concentrations are discussed in the following.
IFRS 9 provides a three-level method for this purpose.
"Valuation allowances are accrued on the basis either 
of the 12 months expected losses (level 1), or of the lifetime expected losses if the credit risk has increased 
significantly since initial recognition (level 2), or if the asset is credit-impaired (level 3)."
"The simplified approach 
is adopted, however, for most of the financial assets, including trade accounts receivable with no material 
financing component."
"As such, the expected credit losses are always determined for the full lifetime of the 
financial instruments."
"To calculate the expected credit losses, counterparties are grouped by similar credit default risks."
"Individual 
valuation allowances are made on a case-by-case basis in response to specific circumstances and risk indica-
tors."
"Both empirical data, such as historical default rates, and forward-looking information, such as individual 
and macroeconomic circumstances, are considered when determining the amounts of the valuation allowances."
"If a counterparty’s credit rating is deemed to be impaired – following noticeable changes in payment behavior 
or application for bankruptcy, for example –, all outstanding amounts relating to that counterparty are subjected 
to a valuation allowance."
The level of expected loss is determined on the basis of individual assessment.
Valuation allowances and increases thereto are always recognized through profit or loss.
"If the expected 
credit losses decrease, a corresponding amount of the risk provision is released through profit or loss."
"A financial asset is derecognized if it is reasonably judged to be unlikely that the corresponding cash flows 
will be recoverable in part or in whole, for example after completion of insolvency proceedings or after 
consideration of other local law circumstances."
"If an outstanding receivable is judged to be unrecoverable, 
the valuation allowance already in place is utilized and the remaining net amount outstanding is stated as 
an expense and derecognized."
"As of December 31, 2023, the USA, 
China and Germany represented the highest risk concentration at country level."
"Of the total trade accounts 
receivable, customers based in the USA accounted for 19 percent as at the reporting date."
"Customers based 
in China accounted for 12 percent and customers based in Germany for 11 percent of all trade accounts 
receivable."
The risk concentration was much lower at individual customer level.
"Receivables from customers 
with a high credit risk rating accounted for about 6 percent of all trade accounts receivable as at the reporting 
date."
"These risks are monitored regularly at the global and regional level and steps are taken to mitigate 
exposure."
"Our credit risk management system operating on the basis of a globally applied corporate standard entitled 
“Customer Credit Management” ensures that credit risks are constantly monitored and bad debts minimized."
"We monitor our key customer relationships at global, regional and local levels."
"In addition, risk-mitigating 
measures (such as trade credit insurance) are put in place for most countries and customers worldwide."
"Collateral received and other safeguards include country-specific and customer-specific protection afforded 
by credit insurance, letters of credit in the export business and, for example, sureties, guarantees and cover 
notes."
"The credit risk associated with trade accounts receivable is, moreover, reduced globally through excess-
of-loss credit insurance."
"The insurance covers trade accounts receivable starting at a specific amount and 
includes an aggregate first loss deductible as well as a small percentage deductible."
"These probabilities were determined on the basis of expert assess-
ments regarding the economic impacts of the current developments and with reference to in-house and 
external information about the financial status of individual customers and customer groups."
"Of this figure, 1,645 million euros (previous year: 1,543 million 
euros) relates to collateral received, and 210 million euros (previous year: 267 million euros) to refundable 
value-added tax."
"Accordingly, the net base for determining valuation allowances was 1,563 million euros 
(previous year: 1,663 million euros)."
"The carrying amount of trade accounts receivable of which the term was renegotiated because they would have 
otherwise been more than 30 days overdue, was 13 million euros (previous year: 6 million euros)."
"Receivables 
of 64 million euros (previous year: 59 million euros) were written off in full, but not yet derecognized as they 
are still subject to ongoing collection proceedings."
"Apart from financial receivables from third parties amounting to 29 million euros (previous year: 18 million 
euros), no valuation allowances exist in respect of other financial assets in our operating business because 
the credit risk is considered to be very low."
"A valuation allowance of 18 million euros exists for financial 
receivables from third parties (previous year: 18 million euros)."
"Such exposure is limited by our Group Treasury specialists through the selection of counter-
parties with strong credit ratings, and limitations on the amounts allocated to individual investments."
"In financial 
investments and derivatives trading with German and international banks, we only enter into transactions 
with counterparties of high financial standing."
"We invest primarily in securities from issuers with an investment 
grade rating."
Our cash deposits can be liquidated at short notice.
"Our financial investments are broadly 
diversified across various counterparties and various financial assets."
"Credit ratings and investment limits are 
continuously monitored and steps taken if fixed thresholds for ratings and credit default swaps (CDS) are 
exceeded."
"To minimize the credit risk, we agree netting arrangements with counterparties to offset bilateral 
receivables and obligations involving those counterparties."
"We additionally enter into collateral agreements 
with selected banks, on the basis of which reciprocal sureties are established at least twice a month to 
secure the fair values of contracted derivatives and other claims and obligations."
"The netting arrangements 
only provide for a contingent right to offset transactions conducted with a contractual party."
"Accordingly, 
associated amounts can be offset only under certain circumstances, such as the insolvency of one of the 
contractual parties."
"Thus, the netting arrangements do not meet the offsetting criteria under IAS 32 Financial 
Instruments: Presentation."
These limits are monitored and adjusted regularly.
"When 
determining the limits, we also apply certain other indicators, such as the pricing of credit default swaps by 
the banks."
"A valuation allowance of 0 million euros exists to cover the remaining credit risk relating to the 
positive fair values of derivatives (previous year: 0 million euros)."
"Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk of an entity failing to meet its financial obligations at any given time."
"We 
mitigate this risk through our long-term management strategy of using financing instruments in the shape 
of bonds issued in different currencies with variously staggered terms."
"Supported by our existing debt issuance 
program comprising a total volume of 10 billion euros, this is also possible on a short-term and flexible basis."
"We predominantly invest cash in financial assets traded in a liquid market in order to ensure that they can 
be sold at any time to receive liquid funds or to manage liquidity in the short term."
"We also use our US dollar 
and euro commercial paper programs for short-term liquidity management."
"In order to ensure the financial 
flexibility of Henkel at any time, the liquidity within the Group is largely centralized and managed across the 
Group through the use of cash pools."
"In addition, the Henkel Group has at its disposal a confirmed syndicated 
credit line of 1.5 billion euros with a term that extends up to December 2025."
"Additionally, Henkel has access 
to bilateral loans of 0.1 billion euros with a revolving term of up to one year."
"Our credit rating is regularly 
assessed by the rating agencies S&P, Moody’s and Scope Ratings."
"We intend to maintain our ratings within 
a “single A” target corridor."
"As part of its strategic supplier management concept, Henkel offers selected suppliers around the world the 
option to join its supplier finance programs."
Further details are discussed in Note 21 on pages 284 and 285.
"The payment targets agreed with suppliers for the relevant trade accounts payable are not contractually tied 
to the existence of a supplier finance program."
"They are used to finance suppliers and do not therefore 
expose Henkel to any material liquidity or concentration risk."
"Overall, the liquidity risk of the Group is therefore very low."

"Market risk 
Market risk exists where the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument may fluctuate due to 
changes in market prices."
"Market risks primarily take the form of currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity 
price risk."
"Group Treasury manages currency exposure and interest rates centrally for the Group and is therefore respon-
sible for all transactions involving financial derivatives and other financial instruments."
"Trading, Treasury 
Controlling and Settlement (front, middle and back offices) are separated both physically and in terms of 
organization."
"The parties to the contracts are German and international banks which Henkel monitors regularly, 
in accordance with Group-wide corporate treasury guidelines, for creditworthiness and the quality of their 
quotations."
"Financial derivatives are used to manage currency exposure, interest rate and other price risks in 
connection with operating activities and the resultant financing requirements, again in accordance with the 
corporate treasury guidelines."
Financial derivatives are entered into solely for hedging purposes.
"In this 
context, “integrated” means that the entire process from the conclusion of financial transactions to their entry 
in the accounts is covered."
"Much of the currency trading takes place on internet-based, multibank trading 
platforms."
The foreign currency transactions concluded are automatically transferred into the treasury system.
"The currency exposure and interest rate risks reported by all subsidiaries under standardized reporting pro-
cedures are likewise integrated into the treasury system by data transfer."
"As a result, it is possible to retrieve 
and measure at any time all currency and interest rate risks across the Group and all derivatives entered into 
to hedge the exposure to these risks."
The treasury system supports the use of various risk concepts.
Market risk is monitored on the basis of sensitivity analyses and value-at-risk computations.
"We use sensitivity 
analyses in the Henkel Group because they enable reasonable risk assessments to be made on the basis of 
direct assumptions (e.g."
an increase in interest rates).
"Value-at-risk analyses reveal the maximum potential 
future loss of a certain portfolio over a given period based on a specified probability level."
"Currency risk 
The global nature of our business activities results in a large number of cash flows in different currencies."
"This transaction risk arises from possible exchange rate fluctuations causing changes in the value of future 
foreign currency cash flows."
"The hedging of the resultant exchange rate risks forms a major part of our 
central risk management activity."
"Transaction risks arising from our operating business are partially avoided 
by the fact that we manufacture our products in those countries in which they are sold."
"Residual transaction 
risks on the operating side are proactively managed by Group Treasury."
"This includes the ongoing assessment 
of the overall currency risk and the development of appropriate hedging strategies."
"The objective of currency 
hedging is to fix prices based on hedging rates so that we are protected from future adverse fluctuations in 
exchange rates."
"Because we limit our potential losses, any negative impact on profits is restricted."
"The 
transaction risk arising from major financial payables and receivables is extensively hedged."
"In order to manage 
these risks, we primarily utilize currency forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps."
"The derivatives are 
designated as cash flow hedges and recognized accordingly in the financial statements or measured at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"The currency risk that exists within the Group in the form of transaction risk initially 
affects equity in the case of cash flow hedges, while all changes in the value of the other derivatives are 
recognized directly in the statement of income."

The following table shows the risk exposure for Henkel’s major currencies."
"The risk arises mainly from imports 
and exports by Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA and its foreign subsidiaries.
"Due to the international nature of its 
activities, the Henkel Group has a portfolio of more than 50 different currencies."
"The value-at-risk pertaining to the transaction risk of the Henkel Group as of December 31, 2023 amounted 
to 55 million euros after hedging (previous year: 53 million euros)."
"The value-at-risk shows the maximum 
expected risk of loss in a year as a result of currency fluctuations."
"Our value-at-risk analysis within the internal 
risk reporting system assumes a time horizon of one year and a one-sided confidence interval of 95 percent, 
as it comprehensively reflects the risk associated with one fiscal year."
"We adopt the variance-covariance 
approach as our basis for calculation."
Volatilities and correlations are determined using historical data.
"The 
value-at-risk analysis is based on the operating book positions, the derivative financial instruments and the 
planned positions in foreign currency, with a forecasting horizon of up to twelve months."
"In the case of fixed-interest financial instruments, 
changing capital market interest rates result in a fair value risk, as the attributable fair values fluctuate 
depending on those capital market interest rates."
"In the case of floating-interest financial instruments, a cash 
flow risk exists because the interest payments may be subject to future fluctuations."
"The financing and cash investment activities of the Henkel Group mainly take place on international money 
and capital markets."
"The resultant financial liabilities and cash deposits are exposed to the risk of changing 
interest rates."
"The aim of our centralized interest rate management is to reduce this risk by choosing fixed or 
floating interest rate contracts and by using interest rate derivatives."
"Only those derivative financial instruments 
that can be modeled, monitored and assessed in the risk management system may be used to hedge the 
interest rate risk."
"Henkel’s interest management strategy is essentially aligned to optimizing the net interest result for the 
Group."
"The decisions made in interest management relate to the bonds, liabilities to banks and commercial 
paper put in place to secure Group liquidity, the securities and time deposits used for cash investments, and 
other interest-bearing financial instruments, such as intragroup financing arrangements."
"The financial instru-
ments exposed to interest rate risk are primarily denominated in euros and US dollars."
"Depending on forecasts with respect to interest rate developments, Henkel enters into derivative financial 
instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, in order to optimize the interest rate lock-down structure."
"In the 
event of an expected rise in interest rate levels, Henkel protects its positions by transacting additional 
interest rate derivatives as effective hedging instruments."
"In addition to interest obligations arising from the 
fixed-rate US dollar bond, Henkel enters into cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the bond denom-
inated in British pounds into fixed-rate euro obligations."
"Financial instruments with interest rates pegged for 
less than twelve months are included in the calculation on a time-weighted basis."
"Interest rate swaps were used 
to convert the interest on the euro bond issued in September 2022 to floating interest."
"All other financial 
instruments bear floating interest rates."
"The US dollar interest rate risk of intragroup financing arrangements 
was mitigated by a long-term currency hedge with a nominal volume of 400 million US dollars."
"When analyzing fair value risk, we calculate the hypothetical 
fair value loss or gain of the relevant fixed-interest financial instruments as of the reporting date."
"The risk of interest rate fluctuations with respect to the earnings of the Henkel Group per the basis point 
value (BPV) analysis as described above is shown in the following table."
"Failure by Henkel to meet these targets would result in a prospective increase in the interest rate on 
the bonds (see Note 18 on pages 282 and 283)."
"Commodity price risk 
Uncertainty with respect to commodity price development impacts the Group."
"Purchase prices for raw materials 
can affect the net assets, financial position and results of operations of Henkel."
"The risk management strategy 
put in place by the Group management for safeguarding against procurement market risk is described in more 
detail in the risks and opportunities report on pages 183 and 184."
"As a small part of the risk management 
strategy, cash-settled commodity forwards are entered into on the basis of forecasted purchasing requirements 
in order to hedge future uncertainties with respect to commodity prices."
"Cash-settled commodity forwards 
are only used by Henkel where there is a direct relationship between the hedging derivative and the physical 
underlying."
"Henkel uses hedge accounting for these hedging transactions, thus limiting the temporary 
exposure to price risks related to holding commodity forwards."
"Developments in fair values and the resultant 
risks are continuously monitored."
"Sales encompass the consideration received for the transfer of goods and services less direct sales deductions 
such as customer-related rebates, credits and other benefits paid or granted."
"Sales revenues are recognized 
once control of the goods has been transferred, or the service provided."
"The timing of transfer of control of 
the goods to a customer is determined by the underlying contract and the terms and conditions of supply 
stipulated therein, or by international trade rules."
"Sales represent the consideration that Henkel will likely receive in exchange for transferring the goods or provid-
ing the service."
"Sales revenues may only be recognized when no substantial adjustments to the cumulative 
recognized revenue is expected."
"Pursuant to IFRS 15, Henkel does not recognize sales revenues for products that it expects to be returned."
"In 
addition, empirical experience has shown that customers are justified in expecting invoice amounts to be 
reduced in certain instances."
The amounts of these expected refunds are also not recognized as sales.
"Henkel 
draws on past return and refund statistics to quantify the expected returns and refunds; these are separated 
by business unit and legal entity, and are subject to ongoing calculation and adjustment."
"Mathematical 
estimates and assumptions are made with regard to the underlying analysis period for determining, among 
other factors, the return and refund rates and the amount of sales to be adjusted by such rates, and also 
with regard to observable volatilities."
"Warranty obligations do not constitute a separate performance obligation and are recognized as provisions 
in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets."
"Services are generally provided in conjunction with the sale of goods, and recorded once the service has 
been performed."
"The amount of sales revenues relating to the provision of services is less relevant than that 
attributable to the transfer of goods."
"For information on opening and closing balances of, and valuation allowances on receivables from contracts 
with customers in fiscal 2023, please refer to our discussion of trade accounts receivable in Note 7 on page 259."
"A breakdown of sales by business unit and region can be found in the Group segment report by business 
unit on pages 218 and 219 and the key financials by region on page 220."
"Henkel exercises its right to choose to refrain from disclosing transaction prices relating to any remaining 
performance obligations, since the respective prerequisites are fulfilled."
"Interest income is recognized on a time-proportion basis that takes into account the effective yield on the 
asset and the interest rate in force."
"Dividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders’ 
right to receive payment is legally established."
"25 Cost of sales 
Cost of sales amounted to 11,853 million euros (previous year: 13,030 million euros)."
It comprises the cost of products and services sold and the purchase cost of merchandise sold.
"Cost of sales 
includes the directly attributable cost of materials and primary production cost, plus indirect production over-
heads including the production-related amortization/depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment."
"In addition to marketing organization and distribution expenses, this item comprises, in particular, advertising, 
sales promotion and market research expenses."
"Also included here are the expenses of technical advisory 
services for customers, valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable and amortization charges and 
impairment losses on trademarks and other rights."
"27 Research and development expenses 
At 587 million euros, research and development expenses were higher year on year (previous year: 570 million 
euros)."
The capitalization of research expenses is not permitted.
"Development expenditures are recognized as an 
asset if all the criteria for recognition are met, the research phase can be clearly distinguished from the devel-
opment phase, and the expenditures can be attributed to distinct project phases."
"Currently, the criteria set 
out in IAS 38 Intangible Assets for recognizing development expenditures are not all met with respect to 
product and technology developments."
"This is due to a high level of interdependence within these develop-
ments and the difficulty of assessing which products will eventually be marketable."
"28 Administrative expenses 
Administrative expenses in both the year under review and the previous year totaled 1,102 million euros."
"Administrative expenses include personnel and material costs relating to the Group Management, Human 
Resources, Purchasing, Accounting and IT functions, as well as the costs of managing and administering the 
business units."
"Further details can be found in the “Acquisitions and divest-
ments” section on pages 223 to 226."
"Sundry operating expenses include a number of individual items arising 
from ordinary operating activities, such as fees, provisions for litigation and third-party claims, other taxes, 
and similar expenses."
"In fiscal 2022, other operating expenses also included a reversal of impairment losses 
on assets held for sale."
"The forward component of 
a currency forward reflects the interest rate differential between two currencies at the time the transaction is 
entered into and thus has the character of interest."
"The results from the development of the fair value of the 
other components of the currency forwards, in particular the spot component, are shown as currency gains 
or losses in other financial result."
"Losses from adjustments to current purchasing power of the non-monetary assets and liabilities and of the 
equity of our subsidiary in Türkiye of -53 million euros (previous year: -42 million euros) are recognized in 
other financial expenses."
"Please see pages 295 and 296 in Note 23 for information on the net results of the 
financial instruments by measurement category per IFRS 7, and the reconciliation of same to financial result."
"This 
shows how the expected tax charge, based on the tax rate applicable to Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA of 31.2 per-
cent, is reconciled to the effective tax charge disclosed."
"In Germany, there is a uniform corporate income tax rate of 
15 percent plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5 percent."
"After taking into account trade tax, this yields an overall 
tax rate of 31.2 percent."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted where they involve the same tax authority 
and the same tax creditor."
"The deferred tax assets relating to provisions in the financial statement of 823 million euros (previous year: 
750 million euros) result primarily from recognition and measurement differences with respect to pension 
obligations."
"The deferred tax liabilities of 1,097 million euros (previous year: 1,062 million euros) relating to 
intangible assets are mainly attributable to business combinations."
"Deferred tax liabilities of 85 million euros 
(previous year: 47 million euros) relating to the retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries have been recognized 
due to the fact that these earnings will be distributed in the future."
"An excess of deferred tax assets is only recognized insofar as it is likely that the company concerned will 
achieve sufficiently positive taxable profits in the future against which the deductible temporary differences 
can be offset and unused tax losses and other carry-forwards can be used."
"Deferred taxes have not been 
recognized with respect to unused tax losses of 862 million euros (previous year: 694 million euros), as it is 
not probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which they may be utilized."
"Of these 
unused tax losses, 656 million euros (previous year: 579 million euros) is solely attributable to unused US state 
tax losses (tax rate 5.3 percent; previous year 5.9 percent)."
"Of the unused tax losses for which no deferred 
tax assets have been recognized, 43 million euros (previous year: 2 million euros) expires within one year, 
with no further amounts expiring (previous year: 403 million euros) within two or three years."
"A valuation allowance of 31 million euros for deferred tax assets arising 
from temporary differences was reversed in the reporting year."
"We have summarized the expiry dates of unused tax losses and tax credits in the following table: 
Expiry dates of unused tax losses and tax credits

Dec."
"In some countries, different tax rates apply to losses on the disposal of assets than to operating profits, and 
in some cases losses on the disposal of assets may only be offset against gains on the disposal of assets."
"Tax 
loss carry-forwards in the amount of 705 million euros (previous year: 618 million euros) are attributable to 
our US subsidiaries."
"Of this amount, 686 million euros (previous year: 604 million euros) relate exclusively to 
state taxes."
"The tax credits of 47 million euros (previous year: 36 million euros) that can be carried forward 
are attributable to US subsidiaries."
"In addition to the unused tax losses listed in the table above, interest of 
99 million euros (previous year: 68 million euros) has been carried forward, of which 61 million euros (previous 
year: 37 million euros) is solely attributable to state taxes affecting our US subsidiaries."
"No deferred tax assets 
were recognized in respect of interest carry-forwards of 61 million euros (previous year: 68 million euros)."
"For one company in Germany that generated tax losses in the previous year, an excess of deferred tax assets 
totaling 741 million euros (previous year: 708 million euros) was recognized on temporary differences, other 
carry-forward expenses, and tax loss carry-forwards."
"In addition, a total of 130 million euros (previous year: 
106 million euros) was recognized as an excess of deferred tax assets on unused tax losses and temporary 
differences for a company in the Netherlands that suffered tax losses in the previous year."
"For a company in 
China that generated tax losses in the previous year, excess deferred tax assets totaling 54 million euros 
(previous year: 59 million euros) were recognized on temporary differences, other carry-forward expenses 
and tax loss carry-forwards."
"Where necessary, measures have been taken to ensure the availability of sufficient 
taxable income in future, so that our current position is that the deferred tax assets can be realized."
"Other comprehensive income includes income from deferred taxes amounting to 78 million euros (previous 
year: expenses of 67 million euros)."
"These deferred taxes resulted in income of 65 million euros (previous 
year: expense of 35 million euros) from actuarial gains and losses on pension obligations."
"Deferred taxes 
from the hedging of currency and interest rate risks gave rise to income of 13 million euros in other compre-
hensive income (previous year: expense of 32 million euros)."
"As an international corporation, Henkel is tax domiciled in around 80 countries and subject to the OECD’s 
“Pillar Two” model rules."
"Germany has already adopted “Pillar Two” legislation, which came into force on 
January 1, 2024."
"Henkel’s response to this requirement is to ensure that the structure of its internal processes will allow it to 
honor its international statutory obligations in full from fiscal 2024 onward."
"Since the legislation was not yet 
applicable in the year under review, the Group was not subject to any associated tax charges."
"In addition, Henkel will observe the obligatory exception to temporary non-recognition of deferred taxes per 
IAS 12 Amendment of May 23, 2023, so that any future associated tax burdens/tax relief will not produce any 
deferred tax effect."
"33 Non-controlling interests 
The amount shown here represents the proportion of net income and losses attributable to other shareholders 
of consolidated subsidiaries."
Their share of the net income in fiscal 2023 was 22 million euros (previous year: loss of -5 million euros).
"The non-controlling interests included in the Henkel Group at the end of fiscal 2023 had no material impact 
on our net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"The Group has no joint operations or unconsol-
idated structured entities."

"One-time expenses in fiscal 2023 of 210 million euros relate to the losses arising from divestment of the 
business activities in Russia."
"The figure for one-time expenses also includes 36 million euros relating to the 
merger of the former Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units to create the Consumer Brands 
business unit."
"This expenditure is essentially attributable to external consultancy services and project manage-
ment costs."
"A further 31 million euros relates to impairment in connection with the discontinuation of a brand 
in our North American consumer goods business."
"The other expenses amounting to 4 million euros are 
essentially attributable to incidental costs relating to acquisitions and divestments (previous year: 15 million 
euros)."
"The figure was also impacted in particular by expenditure 
relating to the merger of the former Laundry & Home Care and Beauty Care business units into the Consumer 
Brands business unit."
"In fiscal 2023, 181 million euros was recognized in cost of sales (previous year: 106 mil-
lion euros) and 48 million euros in marketing, selling and distribution expenses (previous year: 203 million 
euros)."
"A further 6 million euros is attributable to research and development expenses (previous year: 26 mil-
lion euros), while 32 million euros is attributable to administrative expenses (previous year: 69 million euros)."
"Taxes on income amounting to 630 million euros (previous year: 563 million euros) reflect the tax effects of 
the adjustments to operating profit (EBIT)."
"It 
comprises a four-year forward-looking performance period divided into a three-year period for measuring 
target achievement (performance measurement period) and a subsequent one-year lock-up period."
"The LTI 
is a rolling program."
"As such, a new LTI tranche with a four-year performance period is issued every year."
"At the start of each LTI tranche, a certain number of virtual shares are awarded provisionally to begin with."
"This number is calculated by dividing the LTI target amount by the average price of Henkel preferred shares 
over the last 30 stock exchange trading days immediately prior to the start of the performance period."
"Separate targets are set at the beginning of each year for each of the three years in the performance 
measurement period."
"The ultimate number of virtual shares is subject to a subsequent lock-up period of 
one year."
"The final payment amount at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the 
number of ultimately awarded virtual shares by the average price of Henkel preferred shares over the 
last 30 stock exchange trading days immediately prior to the end of the performance period."
"In addition, 
Management Board members receive a dividend equivalent to the aggregate of the dividends paid over the 
respective four-year performance period for each virtual share that is ultimately awarded."
"The remuneration 
payable under an LTI tranche is capped."
"Further details regarding the LTI as a part of Management Board 
remuneration can be found in the remuneration report, which is published separately."
"To avoid non-payment of an LTI in 2026 due to extending the performance period of the LTI from three years 
to four years, the LTI tranche 2023 has been split into two sub-tranches for purposes of transitioning to the 
new remuneration system."
Additions to the provision are made pro rata temporis over the course of a year.
"At the end of the 
first year and on each subsequent reporting date during the performance period, the provision is reviewed 
on the basis of the fair value per virtual share."
"All changes to the measurement of this provision are reported 
under payroll cost."
"As of December 31, 2023, the measurement of the provision was based on 122,006 provisionally awarded 
virtual shares."
"The addition to the provision for the share-based LTI as part of Management Board remu-
neration recognized in payroll cost in fiscal 2023 totaled 9 million euros, equivalent to the carrying amount 
of the provision as of December 31, 2023."
The provision only applies to vested entitlements.
"However, the obligation to purchase and hold shares 
(Share Ownership Guideline) remains a key element of the remuneration policy for Management Board 
members."
"The shares are placed in a blocked custody account with correspond-
ingly restricted access and must be held by the Management Board members for the entire duration of their 
tenure."
"Management Board members can opt to invest more each year or can add existing shares to their 
portfolio."
"The purchase price at the time of the respective acquisition is decisive for fulfillment of the share 
acquisition and holding obligation."
"To the extent that the Share Ownership Guideline is fulfilled through purchases made from STI and LTI 
payouts in a fiscal year, the relevant parts of both remuneration components represent equity-settled share-
based remuneration per IFRS 2."
"Instead, they remain part of the provision 
accrued for the variable components of remuneration."
"For purposes of presentation in the consolidated 
financial statements, such share acquisitions are presumed to be paid primarily from the STI and only after-
wards from the LTI."
A discussion of share acquisition can be found in Note 44 on pages 354 to 358.
"Global Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI Plan) 2020+ 
The Global Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan 2020+ was introduced effective January 1, 2017 to replace the 
previous Global LTI Plan 2013."
"The Global LTI Plan 2020+ provides for share-based remuneration settled with preferred shares of Henkel AG 
& Co."
"The treasury shares are granted on condition that members of the plan are employed for four 
years by Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA or one of its subsidiaries in a position senior enough to qualify for participation, 
and that they are not under notice during that period."
"This minimum period of employment pertains to the 
calendar year in which the treasury shares are granted and the three subsequent calendar years."
"A perfor-
mance-related investment amount is pledged to eligible employees at the start of each four-year cycle."
"Target 
achievement is determined, and the investment amount for the cycle specified, at the end of the first 
calendar year."
"At the start of the second calendar year, this investment amount – after deduction of taxes 
and social security contributions, where applicable – is used to purchase treasury shares on the stock exchange, 
which are then transferred to the employees."
"The number of shares transferred to each employee on the 
basis of the investment amount is determined by the actual market price (stock exchange price) of the shares 
at the time of purchase."
"The shares are subject to a lock-up period that ends upon completion of the relevant 
four-year cycle."
"During this time, the employees participate in all share price developments."
"Once the lock-up 
period has expired, the employees may dispose of the shares as they wish."
"Employees who do not become 
eligible to participate in the Global LTI Plan 2020+ until after the start of the respective cycle participate on a 
pro-rata basis in the cycles already in progress."
"The dividends attributable to the shares during the lock-up 
period are reinvested in preferred shares."
"The investment amount specified in the first year of the cycle based on target achievement is recognized as 
a proportionate payroll cost spread over the four-year performance period."
"As the Global LTI Plan 2020+ 
provides for settlement using treasury shares, the allocations are recognized in equity."
"If treasury shares are 
granted at the end of the performance measurement period, equity is reduced accordingly with no effect 
on profit or loss."
"Additional employer contributions and other payments that do not constitute part of the 
investment amount and are not settled with treasury shares are recognized under other provisions."

The Global LTI Plan 2020+ was replaced by the Global LTI Plan 2023 from January 1, 2023 onward."
"The cycles 
within the new plan now only run for three years."
"As such, due to the switch to the Global LTI Plan 2023, no 
further cycle relating to the Global LTI Plan 2020+commenced in fiscal 2022."
"The Global LTI Plan 2020+ there-
fore acted as an incentive for the last time in the cycle 2021–2024."
"Global Long Term Incentive Plan (Global LTI Plan) 2023 for employees 
The Global LTI Plan 2023 was introduced on January 1, 2023, to replace the Global LTI Plan 2020+."
"The Global 
LTI Plan 2023 provides for variable cash remuneration over a performance and measurement period of three 
years."
The LTI is a rolling program.
"As such, a new cycle with a three-year performance measurement period 
commences every year."
"At the start of each cycle, beneficiaries are awarded an opportunity defined as a 
fixed percentage derived from their individual base salary."
"At the end of the three-year cycle it is multiplied 
by the average target achievement over the measurement period of defined performance indicators and 
paid out to the employees."
"Exceptionally, employees moving to different positions in other countries may be 
eligible for premature payment at the time of the change."
"One exception from these general conditions relates to eligible employees at the highest level of the hierarchy, 
to whom 45 percent of the opportunity is awarded as virtual shares."
"The value of a virtual share on the settlement date equates to the average price of Henkel preferred shares 
over the first 15 stock exchange trading days in January of the year following the three-year performance 
measurement period."
"At the end of the three-year performance measurement period, the 
virtual shares are paid to the employees in cash."
"The remuneration under the Global LTI Plan 2023 is payable on condition that members of the plan were 
employed for three years by Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA or one of its subsidiaries in a position senior enough to 
qualify for participation and that they were not under notice during that period."
"This minimum period of 
employment pertains to the calendar year of the award and the two subsequent calendar years."
"The performance indicators of relevance for the current fiscal year for all current cycles are specified by the 
Management Board at the start of the fiscal year."
"For fiscal 2023, LTI remuneration is dependent on the 
weighted target achievement of three performance criteria – adjusted return on capital employed (adjusted 
ROCE), relative total shareholder return (TSR) and ESG targets."
"Given the dependence on relative TSR and 
the award to beneficiaries at the highest level of the hierarchy of virtual shares as part of the opportunity, 
the Global LTI Plan 2023 constitutes a long-term cash-settled share-based remuneration program per 
IFRS 2 for all beneficiaries."
Appropriate provisions are accrued.
"All changes to the measurement of 
this provision are reported under payroll cost."
"The addition to the LTI 2023 provision for all hierarchy levels recognized in payroll cost totaled 16 million euros 
in fiscal 2023, while an amount of 0 million euros was withdrawn for payout to employees."
"The carrying amount 
of the provisions was 15 million euros as at December 31, 2023."
"The measurement of the provision on the 
reporting date was based on 11,369 virtual shares with a fair value each of 72.86 euros (closing price of Henkel 
preferred shares on December 29, 2023) for eligible senior executives."
"All virtual shares were awarded in 
fiscal 2023."
"As was also the case last year, in 2023 Henkel rewarded each euro invested by employees with a bonus of 
33 eurocents, which was also invested in Henkel preferred shares."
"Employees can dispose freely of these bonus 
shares after a lock-up period of three years on condition that they remain employed by Henkel AG & Co."
KGaA or one of its subsidiaries without being under notice during that period.
"The employee share plan con-
stitutes a equity-settled share-based remuneration program as defined in IFRS 2."
"Under the plan, the Henkel Group paid its employees a bonus of 8 million euros in Henkel preferred shares 
in fiscal 2023 (previous year: 8 million euros)."
"Because of the revolving nature of the plan, this bonus was 
recognized directly as a payroll cost for reasons of simplification."
"The sale of bonus shares forfeited by 
employees lowered the payroll cost by 1 million euros in 2023 (previous year: 1 million euros)."
"The following 
table summarizes the outstanding entitlements of employees from bonus shares in fiscal 2023 and the 
previous year."
"Effective from the start of fiscal 2023, the former 
Beauty Care and Laundry & Home Care business units were merged into the Consumer Brands business 
unit."
"As such, the Consumer Brands business unit constitutes a multi-category platform featuring our consumer 
goods brands and businesses."
"The new organizational structure is also reflected in the Group segment 
report."
"In keeping with the requirements of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the two business units – Adhesive 
Technologies and Consumer Brands – were identified as operating segments in fiscal 2023."
"The operating 
segments also constitute the reportable segments."
"The segment report corresponds to the way in which the 
Henkel Group managed its operating business internally in fiscal 2023, and the Group’s internal reporting 
structure."
"The company has also slightly modified its regional reporting structures to better reflect the allo-
cation of management responsibilities."
"From fiscal 2023 onward, Henkel will be commenting on its business 
performance in the regions of Europe, IMEA (India, Middle East, Africa), North America, Latin America and 
Asia-Pacific."
Prior-year figures reflect the new structure.
"Reportable segments 
Adhesive Technologies 
The operating segment Adhesive Technologies offers a broad and globally leading portfolio of high-impact 
solutions in adhesives, sealants and functional coatings."
"It is made up of three business areas – Mobility & 
Electronics, Packaging & Consumer Goods, and Craftsmen, Construction & Professional."
"In the Packaging & Consumer Goods business area, we offer innovative solutions for manufacturers of 
consumer goods and brand products around the globe."
"We use our technology portfolio and market expertise 
to address global consumer trends, such as the demand for more sustainable products and for a circular 
economy, and the requirement to ensure the maximum possible levels of food safety."
"We develop innovations for transformative products and customer solutions on 
strong global brand platforms and respond to global technology trends, such as sustainable construction, 
DIY, smart production processes and preventive maintenance."
"Consumer Brands 
The Consumer Brands business unit operates worldwide in the Laundry & Home Care and Hair business 
areas."
Both business areas have focused brand portfolios and offer consumer-relevant innovations.
"In the Hair business area, we offer hair care, hair coloring and hair styling products."
"In our 
Other Consumer Businesses area, Henkel is represented in selective markets primarily in body care products."
"Principles of Group segment reporting 
In determining the assets and liabilities, we apply essentially the same principles of recognition and measure-
ment as in the consolidated financial statements."
"We have valued net operating assets in foreign currencies 
at average exchange rates."
"The reportable segments account for 4 million euros (previous year: 32 million euros) of the one-time income 
and for 278 million euros (previous year: 120 million euros) of the one-time expenses."
"Of the restructuring 
expenses, 249 million euros (previous year: 393 million euros) is attributable to the reportable segments."
"Of 
these restructuring expenses, 95 million euros (previous year: 58 million euros) is attributable to Adhesive 
Technologies and 154 million euros (previous year: 335 million euros) to the Consumer Brands business unit."
"For reconciliation with the pre-tax earnings of the Henkel Group, please refer to the consolidated statement 
of income and the financial result reported therein."
"Proceeds transferred between the segments only exist to a negligible extent and are therefore not separately 
disclosed."
"Operating assets, provisions and liabilities are assigned to the segments in accordance with their usage or 
origin."
"Where usage or origin is attributable to several segments, allocation is effected on the basis of 
appropriate ratios and keys."

"The cash and cash equivalents attributable to these countries amounted to 131 million euros as of Decem-
ber 31, 2023 (previous year: 70 million euros)."
"Cash flows of subsidiaries whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy are presented at 
current purchasing power."
"They are therefore adjusted using the relevant conversion factors from the date 
on which each respective transaction took place."
"Cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the indirect method by adjusting the operating profit 
for non-cash items and adding cash inflows and outflows not reflected in the operating profit."
"In addition, payments for income taxes are 
included in cash flows from operating activities."
"This item also includes cash inflows and outflows from other financial 
assets."
"Moreover, since fiscal 2023, interest received on cash and cash equivalents and on other financial 
assets has been recognized in cash flow from investing activities and no longer in cash flow from financing 
activities."
Prior-year figures have been amended accordingly.
"Interest received of 57 million euros (previous 
year: 17 million euros) is recognized in cash flow from investing activities."
"In the previous year, the cash flow 
from investing activities increased by this amount while the cash flow from financing activities decreased 
accordingly."
"In interest paid, incoming payments from forward components were recognized in an amount 
of 17 million euros (previous year: 18 million euros) and outgoing payments in an amount of 20 million euros 
(previous year: 27 million euros)."
"The cash flow from financing activities, which is also determined directly, mainly comprises dividends paid, 
interest paid, the change in financial funds from borrowings and the repayment of financial liabilities, and 
the changes in pension obligations resulting from funding activities."
"Other changes in pension obligations include payment receipts of 210 million euros in 
fiscal 2023 constituting the refund of pension payments to retirees for which a right of reimbursement exists 
with respect to Henkel Trust e.V."
and an external pension fund.
"The prior-year reimbursement recognized in 
cash flow from financing activities amounted to 250 million euros."
"Further explanation of the development of the individual cash flows can be found in the discussion of the 
financial position of the Henkel Group in the management report on page 144."

performance-related emoluments, an annual variable remuneration (Short Term Incentive, STI), and a variable 
cash remuneration based on the long-term performance of the company (Long Term Incentive, LTI)."
"Manage-
ment Board members are also granted pension benefits under a defined contribution plan or can opt for lump-
sum pension payments."
"The non-performance-related emoluments include fringe benefits and benefits in 
kind that are commensurate with market conditions and directly related to Management Board activity."
"The performance-related STI provides for remuneration in line with achievement within a one-year perfor-
mance measurement period of targets set for the performance of both the corporation and the individual 
Management Board members."
"The performance of the corporation is measured in terms of organic sales 
growth (OSG) and adjusted earnings per preferred share (EPS) at constant exchange rates, which are equally 
weighted in the determination of target achievement."
"EPS for remuneration calculation purposes was addition-
ally adjusted in the reporting year for the one-time effect of the share buyback program."
A separate target was set for each of the three years in the performance measurement period.
"The LTI 
tranche that is due for payment also considers the functional factors of the individual Management Board 
members, which reflect the complexity and significance of the business units for which they are responsible."

payable including other emoluments and pension contributions."

preferred shares and to hold them for their entire tenure on the Management Board."

month following the 2024 Annual General Meeting at the then prevailing market price."

2,830 Henkel preferred shares in total."
"In the previous year, the members of the Management Board were 
obligated to invest a total of 1,835,193 euros in preferred shares from the (net) amount paid under the 
STI 2022 based on the Share Ownership Guideline in force at the time."

"BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in 
accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014, referred to subsequently as “EU 
Audit Regulation”) in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our respon-
sibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the 
Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our 
auditor’s report."
"We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European 
law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f)

"KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"In our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill and trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives
2."
"Recognition and measurement of pension provisions

Hereinafter we present the key audit matters: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill and trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives
1."
In the consolidated financial statements of Henkel AG & Co.
"Goodwill and trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment by the
Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need
for write-downs."
"The impairment tests are performed at the level of the cash-generating units or groups
of cash-generating units to which the respective goodwill and trademarks and other rights with
indefinite useful lives are allocated."
"In the financial year 2023, the merger of the former Beauty Care
and Laundry & Home Care business units into the new Consumer Brands business unit and the
reorganisation of the Adhesive Technologies business unit led to a change in the groups of cash-
generating units."
"The carrying amount of the relevant (group of) cash-generating units, including
the respective allocated goodwill and trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives, are com-
pared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test."
"The recoverable
amount is generally determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal."
"Expectations relating to future market
developments and country-specific assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors,
as well as the effects of geopolitical and economic upheavals on the business activities of the
Henkel Group are also taken into account."
"Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow
models."
"The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-
generating unit."
The impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.
"The outcome
of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors
of the future cash flows of the cash-generating units, and on the respective discount rates, rates of
growth and other assumptions employed."
"The valuation is therefore, among others also against the
background of the effects of geopolitical and economic upheavals, subject to considerable uncertainty."
"Against this background and due to the underlying complexity of the valuation, this matter was of
particular significance in the context of our audit."

2."
"As part of our audit we assessed, among other things, the methodology used for the purpose of the
impairment tests and evaluated the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital."
"We assessed
the changes to the cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units on the basis of the
underlying reporting structures, contractual agreements and organisational changes in sales and
marketing structures and evaluated the appropriateness of these changes."
"In addition, we assessed
whether the future cash inflows underlying the valuation together with the weighted average cost of
capital used represent an appropriate basis for the impairment tests overall."
"In addition, we assessed the executive directors’ assessment of the effects
of the geopolitical and economic upheavals on the business activities of the Henkel Group and under-
stood their consideration in the determination of future cash flows."
"In this context, we also assessed
the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions in the respective cash-generating unit."
"Furthermore, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company in order to assess
any impairment risk (lower recoverable amount versus carrying amount) relating to any potential
change in a material assumption underlying the valuation."
"Overall, the valuation parameters and
assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within
the ranges considered by us to be reasonable."
"The Company’s disclosures on goodwill and trademarks and other rights with indefinite useful lives
are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the section entitled “Notes to
the consolidated balance sheet”, note “(1) Goodwill and other intangible assets”."

"Recognition and measurement of pension provisions 
1."
"Pension provisions amounting to € 0.5 billion are reported in the consolidated financial statements 
of Henkel AG & Co."
"KGaA under the balance sheet item “Provisions for pensions and similar obliga-
tions.” The pension provisions comprise pension obligations amounting to € 4.1 billion, plan assets 
of € 3.8 billion and a reported surplus of plan assets over benefit obligations of € 0.2 billion."
"The 
obligations from defined benefit pension plans are measured using the projected unit credit method."
"This requires assumptions to be made in particular about long-term rates of growth in salaries and pen-
sions, average life expectancy and staff turnover."
"The average life expectancy is calculated for Germany 
as at 31 December 2023 based on the mortality tables published by Heubeck-Richttafeln GmbH 
(Heubeck-Richttafeln RT 2018 G)."
"Country-specific mortality tables are used to calculate obligations 
outside of Germany."
"The discount rates must be determined by reference to market yields on high-
quality corporate bonds with matching currencies and consistent maturities."
"This usually requires the 
data to be extrapolated, since sufficient long-term corporate bonds do not exist."
"The plan assets are 
measured at fair value, which in turn involves estimation uncertainties."
"From our point of view, these 
matters were of particular significance in the context of our audit because the recognition and meas-
urement of this significant item in terms of its amount are based to a large extent on estimates and 
assumptions made by the Company’s executive directors."
"As part of our audit, we firstly assessed whether the criteria for recognition as defined benefit or 
defined contribution pension commitments were met and evaluated the actuarial expert reports 
obtained and the professional qualifications of the external experts."
"We also examined the specific 
features of the actuarial calculations and assessed the numerical data, the actuarial parameters and 
the valuation methods on which the valuations were based for compliance with the standard and 
appropriateness, in addition to other procedures."
"In addition, we analyzed the development of the obli-
gation and the cost components in accordance with actuarial expert reports in the light of changes 
occurring in the valuation parameters and the numerical data, and assessed their plausibility."
"For the 
audit of the fair value of the plan assets, we obtained bank and fund confirmations and assessed 
the methods on which the respective valuation was based and the valuation parameters applied."
"Based on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions 
made by the executive directors are substantiated and sufficiently documented."
"The Company’s disclosures relating to the pension provisions are contained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements in the section entitled “Notes to the consolidated balance sheet” 
in note “(16) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations”."

The executive directors are responsible for the other information."
"The other information comprises the state-
ment on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB as an unaudited part of the group 
management report."
"1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance 
with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial 
performance of the Group."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going 
concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or 
there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of 
users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report."
"We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance engage-
ment."
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one 
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or 
the override of internal controls."
" Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonable-
ness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to 
the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, 
if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based 
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
" Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
group management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
" Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its 
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
" Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the 
significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and 
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express 
a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is 
a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters."
