market OTCQX International Premier 
(ticker symbol: IFNNY)."
"On the one hand, electro­
mo­
bility and renewable energy and the applications associated with them have ensured 
a continuing high level of demand."
"On the other hand, demand for consumer applica-
tions, such as PCs and smartphones, has fallen in the wake of the Covid pandemic."
"In this challenging market environment, your company has set new records for both 
revenue and profitability."
"Our revenue rose to €16.3 billion, and we achieved a Segment 
Result Margin of 27.0 percent."
"Both figures exceeded our original annual forecast and are an initial confirmation  
on the more ambitious course we have adopted as a company."
"A year ago, we raised  
our long-term financial targets through the semiconductor cycle."
"Now we have proven 
that we are also delivering at this higher level of expectation."
"In our target markets, we are expecting strong growth drivers to continue and we  
are anticipating big opportunities for Infineon."
"We want to grow and be sustainably 
profitable, advance at a rapid rate, and make full use of strategic investments to lay 
the important groundwork for Infineon’s future."
"I would like to express my gratitude to all the 58,600 people working for Infineon for 
their exceptional commitment in the past fiscal year."
"I would also like to thank you, 
our shareholders, for your continuing confidence in our company."
"At our forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, we will propose an increase in the dividend payment to 
€0.35 per share."
"Thus, we would like to ensure that you participate appropriately in 
Infineon’s success while at the same time retaining the financial headroom we need 
for the future development of your company."
"On behalf of the Management Board, I would like to express my sincere 
thanks to the long-standing Chairman, Dr. Wolfgang Eder, for the good working rela-
tion we have enjoyed over the past few years."
"Particular highlights include reorga­
nizing the Management Board team, setting higher financial targets and ­
preparing  
for the expansion of our manufacturing facilities on our site in Dresden (Germany)."
"Dr. Wolfgang Eder was always a trusted guide and support to the ­
Management Board."
"With Dr. Herbert Diess, his successor as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Infineon 
has gained a proven expert in the major topics affecting the future of our business."
"Our working relation with Dr. Herbert Diess is also respectful, constructive and built 
on trust, which is very important to Infineon maintaining its successful course."
"Having successfully established the Management Board position for Digital Trans­
formation, our colleague Constanze Hufenbecher decided not to renew her expiring 
contract and has handed over the baton to Elke Reichart on 1 November 2023."
"­
Constanze Hufenbecher contributed significantly to the good progress made by 
Infineon in the areas of digitalization and sustainability."
"She has laid important 
­
foundations with the Digital Agenda and the Sustainability Strategy."
"Moreover, she 
established a culture of cross-departmental collaboration at Infineon."
"I would like  
to express my sincere personal gratitude for her achievements."
Digitalization is a crucial lever for our company.
"I am very much looking forward to 
working together with Elke Reichart."
"She will bring new perspectives and impetus to 
the Management Board team and use her extensive experience to help lead Infineon 
into an even more successful future."
"We are driving decarbonization and digitalization with our partners 
Efforts to tackle the climate crisis are being intensified worldwide."
"At the same time, 
we are seeing rapid development in the area of digitalization."
"Semiconductors are 
essential in order to overcome the energy challenges of our time and help shape the 
digital transformation."
"They are the building blocks of technological progress and  
the engine of sustainable global development."
"At Infineon, we are actively doing 
everything possible to drive forward decarbonization and digitalization."
"We are a 
global leader in power systems and IoT."
"Together with our partners, we enable game-­
changing solutions in three growth areas: green and efficient energy, clean and safe 
mobility, and a smart and secure IoT."
"Five core applications are particularly strong drivers for our business: electromobility, 
renewable energy, automated driving, data centers – propelled by the ever-increasing 
use of artificial intelligence – and IoT."
"These applications will account for around 
60 percent of our expected revenue growth over the coming years."
"So that Infineon 
can make the most of these major growth opportunities, we are setting the course 
and laying the groundwork early on."
"Investments in manufacturing capacities and security of supply  
will set Infineon up for long-term growth 
Our manufacturing strategy is based on clear principles."
"We focus on expanding our 
in-house manufacturing in those areas in which added value for our customers  
and differentiation for Infineon is created."
"This is the case, for example, for power 
semiconductors and sensors."
"However, in the case of highly integrated digital 
­
products such as microcontrollers and connectivity and security components, we 
prefer to work together with contract manufacturers, as the design and software  
are the main sources of differentiation in those areas."
"We also pursue this strategy 
when ­
making our investment decisions."

Letter to shareholders
The groundbreaking ceremony for our “Smart Power Fab” at the Dresden site took 
place at the beginning of May 2023."
"This factory will link our two major growth areas, 
decarbonization and digitalization."
"We are strengthening our manufacturing base  
for both analog mixed-signal technologies and power semiconductors."
"Analog mixed-­
signal components are used in power supply systems (such as those in energy-efficient 
chargers), in small motor control units for cars, in data centers and in IoT applications."
"The interaction between power semiconductors and analog mixed-signal compo-
nents makes particularly energy-efficient and intelligent system solutions possible."
"We therefore want to use our in-house manufacturing to create some of these prod-
ucts in the future, from both a differentiation and a resilience perspective."
"Support provided by the 
German Federal Government as funding body and the European Chips Act is giving 
our project a tailwind."
"The additional capacity provided by the fab will enable us to 
meet increasing demand from our customers in the second half of the decade and 
will reinforce our position as a world-leading supplier of power systems."
"Silicon chips of the type we make in Dresden will be the technically appropriate and 
economically viable solution in many applications in the long term."
"Compound 
­
semiconductors based on silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) expand the 
options presented by silicon-based solutions."
"They enable particularly efficient, 
fast-switching and compact system solutions that consume less power."
"We see rising 
demand for these, especially for use in electric cars, charging stations and solar ­
systems."
"We want to lead the way across the whole range of power semiconductors – for ­
silicon 
chips as well as for technologies based on SiC and GaN."
"We are therefore ­
constantly 
expanding our portfolio for different application areas."
"We are also increasing our 
manufacturing capacity for both types of technology, while adopting an entrepreneur-
ial and long-term approach."
"In August 2023, we therefore announced that we would be significantly increasing  
the scope of the ongoing expansion of our manufacturing facilities on our Kulim site 
(Malaysia)."
"In a second expansion phase, we want to build the world’s largest and 
most competitive SiC power semiconductor factory based on 200-millimeter manufac­
turing technology there."
"Together with the planned conversion to 200-millimeter  
production of our existing SiC manufacturing lines at the sites in Villach (Austria) and 
Kulim, this investment offers Infineon annual revenue potential of around €7 billion 
by the end of the decade."
"Our investment decision is backed by numerous long-term agreements with high-­
profile customers in the automotive sector and in the field of renewable energy."
"­
Additional design wins worth €5 billion and associated advance payments of around 
€1 billion are evidence of the great confidence our customers place in Infineon as  
a reliable partner and driver of innovation."
"In the global competition for the leading position in SiC technologies, certain strengths 
differentiate Infineon from its competitors."
"First of all, the trench architecture we use 
in chip manufacture has advantages in terms of performance and productivity."
"­
Second, 
we offer all markets the most comprehensive product and packaging port­
folio."
"Third, 
we score with our excellent systems understanding and first-class access to customers."
"However, we see few opportunities for differentiation in manufacturing the SiC base 
material used in chip production, so this we buy in."
"We ensure access to this material 
through a broad and regionally diversified supplier network."
"Infineon’s own laser-
based cold split technology enables particularly efficient use of the base material."
"Your company has all the key factors at its disposal for sustainable success with SiC 
solutions."
"We are therefore very well placed to benefit from similar economies of 
scale with SiC as has previously been the case with silicon – both in manufacturing 
and in research and development."
"We are very confident that we will be able to 
achieve a market share in SiC of 30 percent by the end of the decade."
"Especially against the backdrop of geopoliti-
cal uncertainty, we want to make our supply chain even more resilient in the future."
"Together with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s 
largest silicon contract manufacturer based in Taiwan, and the companies Bosch and 
NXP Semiconductors, we want to invest in a joint company."
"As we and our partners 
announced in August, the European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) 
in Dresden is to build an ultra-modern fab for semiconductors with small feature  
sizes of 12 to 28 nanometers."
TSMC is to operate the fab for the entity.
"The project is 
planned under the framework of the European Chips Act."
The planned fab is an ideal complement to our own manufacturing landscape.
This investment will bring the first FinFET fab to Europe.
"FinFET is a transistor techno­
logy used in state-of-the-art digital chips."
"Even more transistors can be housed on  
the smallest three-dimensional structures."
"As a result, the semiconductors are even 
more powerful and energy-efficient."
"FinFET technology is becoming increasingly 
important for our high-performance microcontrollers."
"With this fab, we are ensuring 
Infineon will have direct access to this technology in Europe, and we are strengthen-
ing the European semiconductor ecosystem in the long term."
"We are continuing to enhance our competence in power systems  
and IoT with targeted acquisitions 
In addition to SiC, GaN is developing into a key material for power semiconductors."
"It 
has advantages especially at higher switching frequencies."
"In particular, for applications 
such as mobile charging, power supplies for data centers, solar inverters for private 
households, and onboard chargers for electric vehicles, GaN is on the brink of a break­
through and promises very strong market growth."
"We therefore want to continue to 
enhance our technical skills in the field of GaN."
"In October 2023, we completed the acquisition of the company GaN Systems."
"The 
company, which is headquartered in Ottawa (Canada), brings with it a broad port­
folio of GaN-based solutions for power conversion as well as first-class application 
know-how."
"We are delighted that the team from GaN Systems, comprising more than 
200 employees, is now part of Infineon."
"The strengths of both companies in terms of intellectual property and application 
understanding ideally complement each other."
"Together, we now have over 450 GaN 
experts, as well as more than 350 GaN patent families and a large number of highly 
promising customer projects in the pipeline."
"This puts our company in an outstand-
ing position, opening up huge opportunities in various high-growth markets."
"This  
will significantly accelerate our development roadmap for GaN solutions and further 
strengthen our leading position in power systems."
Another exciting key topic for Infineon is artificial intelligence (AI).
"Machine learning is 
being used in more and more IoT applications and enables new functionalities."
"In May 2023, we acquired the company Imagimob."
"The startup, based in Stockholm 
(Sweden), is a leading platform provider for machine learning solutions for energy-­
efficient edge devices."
"Imagimob’s platform enables a variety of applications, such as 
audio event detection, voice control, gesture recognition, predictive maintenance, 
signal classification and material detection."
"This will 
enable us to transfer the capabilities of machine learning, which have until now been 
used mainly in large server farms, to our microcontrollers."
"Artificial intelligence also offers Infineon huge growth potential in the area of power 
systems."
"More and more data are being recorded, processed, stored and linked."
"To 
make the data usable for different applications, the major cloud computing providers 
are increasingly employing generative AI."
"As the example of ChatGPT shows, large 
language models (LLMs) have the potential to take digitalization to a completely new 
level."
"In the coming years, AI will be used in more and more application areas."
"The volume  
of data to be processed and the computing power required as a result will mean  
a significant increase in the quantity and value of the semiconductors needed in  
the data center servers."
"Energy-efficient power stages help reduce power losses and 
cooling efforts This allows operators to significantly reduce their costs – and avoid 
CO2."
Demand is growing strongly.
"We offer highly energy-efficient power solutions  
for the entire supply chain, from the grid to the central processor (GPU), making a 
broader use of AI possible."
Green computing is an ideal application area for Infineon.
"This is a good example of how decarbonization and digitalization are closely linked 
with one another."
"Networks, data centers, servers and the IT infrastructure form the backbone of digi­
talization."
"Another crucial element of the IoT is wireless connectivity between end 
devices."
"In October 2023, we acquired the company 3db Access, a move designed to 
enhance our skills in this area as well."
"The startup based in Zurich (Switzerland) is  
a pioneer in energy-efficient ultra-wideband (UWB) technology."
"UWB technology can 
be used to precisely determine positions and distances while being robustly protected  
against signal interference."
This makes it extremely attractive for many IoT applications.
"These include secure access to vehicles and buildings, indoor navigation and pres-
ence detection of people in rooms."
"UWB complements our connectivity technologies 
(Wi-Fi, Bluetooth®/ Bluetooth® Low Energy and NFC) and offers Infineon additional 
opportunities in an interesting growth market."
"Besides the targeted enhancement of our technological skills through acquisitions, 
we are rapidly advancing with the company’s research and development activities."
The focus here is the benefit provided to customers.
"Our aim is to roll out differentiat-
ing solutions at an even faster rate."
"It is therefore crucial that we recognize product 
and customer requirements at an early stage and that we understand our customers’ 
systems."
"Our “from product thinking to system understanding” approach, which  
we have applied for many years, has proved its worth."
"Given the growing number of 
applications served by Infineon, this approach is now more important than ever."
"Particularly in application areas that are new to Infineon, we work closely together 
with key customers on development."
"Our teams develop new solutions in tandem 
with customers in an iterative process."
"By exchanging ideas directly, they learn to 
understand customer and market requirements even better and more quickly and 
can therefore offer tailor-made system solutions within a short period of time."
"We are making Infineon CO2-neutral by 2030
At Infineon, as a leading manufacturer of semiconductors, our objective is not only to 
be a technological leader but also a pioneer in sustainability."
"Infineon will become 
CO2-neutral by the end of the 2030 fiscal year."
"Our target includes all direct emissions 
(scope 1) as well as indirect emissions from purchased electricity and heat (scope 2)."
"By the end of the 2025 fiscal year, we want to have reduced our emissions by 70 percent 
compared with 2019."
"To achieve these targets, we are working in particular on avoid-
ing direct emissions."
"Infineon  |  Annual Report 2023

Here we are making good progress."
"At the end of the 2023 fiscal year, our scope 1 and 
scope 2 emissions were around 56.8 percent below the emissions of the base year 2019."
"The installation of new PFC abatement systems in our frontend manufacturing in 
Kulim (Malaysia) has already enabled us to reduce our scope 1 emissions by 21 percent."
"In the past fiscal year, we also launched a similar project at our site in Austin (Texas, 
USA)."
"This means that we will have equipped all our prime manufacturing facilities 
with highly efficient PFC abatement systems."
"The new manufacturing facilities 
referred to above will of course be equipped with such systems right from the start, 
so that they are in line with our CO2 neutrality goal."
"In addition to avoiding direct emissions, other key levers for reducing CO2 are energy 
conservation and the use of green electricity."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we were able  
to use green electricity to meet over three quarters of our electricity requirements."
"We are continuing to develop our corporate culture 
Infineon is seeing strong growth."
"Over the past few years, our business has become 
bigger and, at the same time, more complex."
"We therefore make adjustments in the 
company, adapt our processes and, last but not least, continue to develop our corpo-
rate culture."
Crucial to our success is not only what we do but how we do it.
"When I assumed my role as CEO, we launched the SPIRIT project."
"This is designed to 
deliberately promote three behaviors in the company."
"We set ourselves ambitious 
targets at all levels."
We are accountable for our results and clarify our responsibilities.
We make timely decisions that are implemented consistently.
"Whether you are setting ambitious targets or clarifying responsibilities, you need to 
begin at the corporate level."
"We therefore made a decision in the summer that, in the 
future, we would combine accountability with functional management roles across 
the Group."
"This will make us significantly faster, because it will reduce the complexity 
in our organization and create strong global functions – with local teams, where this is 
expedient."
"Furthermore, we promote a sense of responsibility and purposefulness as 
elements of our corporate culture."
All this makes us even more attractive as an employer.
"A challenging market environment in the 2024 fiscal year
At the beginning of the 2024 fiscal year, we are operating in an environment that con-
tinues to present challenges."
"The mobility of the future and renewable energies  
are currently the strongest growth drivers for our business."
"In all other areas, we see  
a temporarily difficult, cyclical market environment."
"Overall, we are expecting revenue growth to continue in the 2024 fiscal year but at  
a lower rate."
We are assuming an increase in revenue of 4 percent.
"Hence, after the 
two boom years of 2022 and 2023, we anticipate growth will be below the target we 
have set ourselves of average revenue growth of “more than 10 percent per year” 
over the semiconductor cycle."
"However, the sequence of different growth phases is 
nothing unusual in the semiconductor market and as a company we know how to 
deal with this situation."
"With regard to structural growth opportunities, we are continuing to implement our 
strategy consistently and we are reinforcing our leading position in power systems 
and IoT with long-term investments in our manufacturing landscape and technological 
leadership."
"Decarbonization and digitalization remain the foundations of our busi-
ness."
"With our solutions, we are driving forward the green and digital transformation, 
thus providing our customers and you, our shareholders, with tangible added value."

The Management Board
The times we live in are being affected by so much change."
"What sets us apart at 
Infineon is that we see this as an opportunity and are actively working to shape that 
change."
"Our forward-looking technologies and products are making an important 
contribution towards halting (or at least slowing down) climate change and towards 
using digitalization with human beings in mind."
"I can see how Infineon employees 
around the world are playing their part with enthusiasm, skill and a positive mindset."
"This is not only making us an innovative high-tech company but also ensures sustain-
able economic success."
The 2023 fiscal year has demonstrated this once again.
"We 
want you, dear shareholders, to be able to participate in this success in the usual way 
and will therefore submit a proposal jointly with the Management Board to the Annual 
General Meeting for another increase in the dividend to €0.35 per share entitled  
to a dividend."
"For many years, Infineon’s success story has been built on outstanding 
technological and business performance combined with added value for society  
as a whole, and I would be delighted if you continued to accompany us on our way."
"Its work was based in particular on 
reports presented by the Management Board at Supervisory Board and committee 
meetings regarding all issues relevant to Infineon."
"For the most part, the focus was 
again on corporate strategy, current business performance and the economic situa-
tion, financial and investment planning, and the risk profile, as well as issues relating 
to risk management and compliance."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board addressed 
the replacement of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and other personnel 
changes on the Supervisory Board, as well as preparing for the appointment of a new 
Management Board member responsible for digital transformation."
"Between quarterly reports, the Management Board also 
provided the Supervisory Board with additional information in the form of monthly 
reports on current business performance and developments."
"As Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I was also in regular contact with both the Chief 
Executive Officer and other members of the Management Board between meetings."
The CEO kept me well-informed at all times of other key events for Infineon.
"My work-
ing relationship with the CEO was respectful, constructive and based on trust."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the full Supervisory Board convened nine times, holding  
six ordinary meetings and three extraordinary meetings."
"Additionally, two resolutions 
were passed on the basis of written communication."
"The attendance rate at Super­
visory Board meetings was just under 98 percent; Diana Vitale was excused from attend­
ing one meeting and Dr. Manfred Puffer from two meetings."
"The attendance rate at the 
Supervisory Board’s committee meetings was 100 percent."
"Details of the individual 
attendance record of Supervisory Board members at full Supervisory Board and com-
mittee meetings are provided in a table in the Statement on Corporate Governance."
"Of the six meetings of 
the Executive Committee, two were virtual."
"One of the five meetings of the Investment, 
Finance and Audit Committee and four of the six meetings of the Nomination Com-
mittee were in a virtual format."
"All the meetings of the Strategy and Technology Com-
mittee, without exception, were face-to-face meetings."
"In preparation for ordinary Supervisory Board meetings, separate preliminary meet-
ings were held for both the shareholder representatives and the employee representa-
tives."
"The Supervisory Board and the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee also 
convened regularly without the presence of the Management Board."
"Like the 
­
Management Board, the Supervisory Board is convinced that decarbonization and 
digitalization will ensure structurally increasing demand for semiconductors and 
that, thanks to its strategic focus, Infineon will benefit disproportionately from this 
development."
"Infineon is therefore creating the production capacity required to reliably meet 
growing demand from its customers over the long term."
"Moreover, the investment 
in Dresden is an important milestone that will reinforce the European semicon­
ductor ecosystem and strengthen supply chain resilience in Europe."
"Accordingly, 
the Supervisory Board was satisfied that these investments were necessary for  
the business and made economic sense and approved the plans."
"›	 
Finally, the Supervisory Board examined measures relating to the Group’s inorganic 
growth in promising new fields and granted its approval for the acquisition of  
the Canadian company GaN Systems, the technological leader in the development 
of GaN-based solutions for power conversion."
"The acquisition will significantly 
strengthen Infineon’s leading position in power systems."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, separately from the examination of specific strategic projects, 
the Supervisory Board also considered various aspects of Infineon’s corporate strategy 
at a daylong strategy meeting that took place on the Dresden site."
"Topics discussed 
included strategic fundamentals, portfolio management, parameters for organic and 
inorganic growth, geopolitical issues, financial targets and, last but not least, Infineon’s 
sustainability strategy."
"Personnel matters relating to the Management Board 
In the course of the fiscal year, Constanze Hufenbecher, Management Board member 
and Chief Digital Transformation Officer (CDTO), informed the Supervisory Board  
of her intention not to renew her contract which was due to expire in April 2024."
"The 
Supervisory Board accepted her decision with regret."
"Immediately thereafter, the 
Supervisory Board initiated the process of finding a replacement for the CDTO position 
on the Management Board."
"Based on the Supervisory Board’s continuous succes-
sion planning and with the support of a human resources consultant, an extensive 
search process was launched."
"Infineon was eventually able to recruit Elke Reichart, 
an experienced digitalization expert."
"Elke Reichart was appointed as a member of the 
Management Board for three years with effect from 1 November 2023."
"Constanze 
Hufenbecher resigned from the Management Board with effect from 31 October 2023."
"The Supervisory Board thanks Constanze Hufenbecher for her achievements and 
­
personal commitment and wishes Elke Reichart a successful start in her new role."
"This created a remuneration structure with higher variable 
remuneration components, whereby the Management Board remuneration will in  
the future be even more closely linked with the success of the business."
"Moreover, 
the maximum remuneration for longer-serving Management Board members will  
be increased, giving the Supervisory Board more scope to offer experienced Manage-
ment Board members competitive remuneration."
"The restriction of the STI modifier  
to extraordinary developments brought the system more in line with the provisions 
set out in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the German Corporate Gover-
nance Code."
"Finally, the opportunity was provided to weight ESG targets in the long-
term variable remuneration even more heavily in the future."
"At the Annual General 
Meeting in February 2023, this new remuneration system for the Management Board 
was approved by a large majority."
"It was thereupon implemented in all Management 
Board employment contracts as of 1 April 2023."
"Further information on Management Board remuneration is available in the detailed 
Remuneration Report."
"As in the previous year, the Management Board and the Super-
visory Board decided to ask the auditors to perform an additional review of the 
­
content of the Remuneration Report in addition to their formal audit of the report."
KPMG issued an unqualified audit opinion on the Remuneration Report.
"Litigation 
The Supervisory Board was regularly provided during the 2023 fiscal year with in-depth 
information regarding major legal disputes, which it then discussed at length with 
the Management Board."
"These included, in particular, the legal dispute with the insol­
vency administrator of Qimonda AG pertaining to alleged residual liability claims, 
which has been ongoing for years."
"Supervisory Board topics
Personnel matters relating to the Supervisory Board 
Dr. Wolfgang Eder and Hans-Ulrich Holdenried resigned from the Supervisory Board 
with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting on 16 February 2023."
"Based 
on a proposal by the Supervisory Board, Klaus Helmrich and I were newly elected to 
the Supervisory Board."
"At its meeting immediately after the Annual General Meeting, 
the Supervisory Board elected me as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board,  
as a member and the Chairman of the Strategy and Technology Committee, and as 
the Chairman of the Nomination Committee."
"I am grateful for this vote of confidence 
from Infineon’s Supervisory Board and would like to take the opportunity here to 
thank once again Dr. Wolfgang Eder and also Hans-Ulrich Holdenried for their success­
ful work over the past years."
"Following the resignation of Géraldine Picaud from the Supervisory Board at the 
beginning of 2023, Ute Wolf was appointed as a member of the Supervisory Board by 
court order in April 2023 and elected by the Supervisory Board as a member of the 
Investment, Finance and Audit Committee."
"Until shortly before her appointment by 
Infineon, Ute Wolf was the Chief Financial Officer of a public limited company listed  
in Germany."
"In addition, she has already spent several years as the Chair of audit 
committees of listed companies."
"She therefore increases the level of financial expertise 
on the Supervisory Board."
"At the Annual General Meeting to be held in February 2024, 
the Supervisory Board will propose that Ute Wolf be elected to the Supervisory Board 
for a regular four-year term of office."
"Basic and ongoing training 
Supervisory Board members are responsible for undertaking any basic or ongoing 
training considered necessary to perform their duties, and they receive appropriate 
support from Infineon to do so."
"In-house information events are held to provide targe­
ted training."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, for example, events took place that covered the 
EU Taxonomy and governance topics as well as current regulatory developments affec­
ting the Supervisory Board."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board has delegated certain decision-making powers 
to its committees."
"The chairpersons of each committee are required to report on 
committee meetings at the next full Supervisory Board meeting."
"Mediation Committee 
The Mediation Committee did not need to convene during the reporting year."
"Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee held six meetings in total during the 2023 fiscal year."
"The topics discussed at the meetings included the replacements for Supervisory 
Board positions referred to above following the resignations of Dr. Wolfgang Eder, 
Hans-Ulrich Holdenried and Géraldine Picaud."
"Klaus Helmrich and I were elected at 
the 2023 Annual General Meeting and Ute Wolf was appointed by the court."
"The 
committee also prepared the nomination for election at the 2024 Annual General 
Meeting of Ute Wolf, as well as of Prof. Hermann Eul, an acknowledged expert in 
semiconductors."
"Executive Committee 
At its ordinary meetings, the Executive Committee focused primarily on preparing the 
Supervisory Board’s resolutions to determine the level of variable remuneration to be 
paid to Management Board members."
"The topics discussed at the extra­
ordinary meetings were the personnel and remuneration issues referred to above."
"Investment, Finance and Audit Committee
The Investment, Finance and Audit Committee held five ordinary meetings in the 
2023 fiscal year."
"The Committee also conducted an assess-
ment of the quality of the audit."
"In addition, the Committee examined Infineon’s 
financial and investment budget."
"It also received regular reports on the internal con-
trol, internal audit, risk management and compliance management systems and 
deliberated on their appropriateness and effectiveness."
"The Committee was also 
­
provided with continuous updates on additional risks and significant legal disputes."
"There were no indications of 
conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or other lack of independence on the part 
of the auditor."
"The Committee also considered the fee arrangements, issued con-
tracts for the relevant audit engagements and defined supplementary areas for audit 
emphasis."
"Representatives of the auditor attended all the meetings of the Investment, Finance 
and Audit Committee and reported in detail on the audit procedures performed."
"At 
each of the meetings, there was also a closed session involving the auditor and the 
members of the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee without the Management 
Board being present."
"This also applied to the full Supervisory Board meeting that 
considered the financial statements."
"The Committee also devoted time to the Remuneration Report and the separate 
­
combined Non-Financial Report and, in this context, considered other sustainability 
issues, including the German Supply Chain Act (LkSG)."
"The Management Board provided it with reports on a num-
ber of topics, including key aspects of the macroeconomic market and competitive 
environment and the progress of the Group’s digital agenda."
"Other areas discussed  
at committee meetings were strategic considerations with regard to the expansion of 
manufacturing capacity and the value contribution of software at Infineon."
"The actual wording of the Declaration of Compliance 2023 and all previous Declara-
tions of Compliance are available on Infineon’s website."
"www.infineon.com/declaration-of-compliance
Self-assessment by the Supervisory Board 
The Supervisory Board regularly assesses how effectively it performs its duties."
"It 
conducted such a self-assessment in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The results of the questionnaire were discussed in the course of  
a Supervisory Board meeting in August 2023 and a full-day Supervisory Board work-
shop in November 2023."
"Skills and expertise profile and list of objectives for  
the Supervisory Board/qualifications matrix
The Supervisory Board decided to make a modification to the skills and expertise 
profile and list of objectives."
"One of the reasons for this was to make explicit refer-
ence in the skills and expertise profile to sustainability expertise."
"It was also decided 
to modify the age limit of 70 previously set for Supervisory Board members to the 
extent that, in the future, it will no longer be simply a rule but a strict limit."
"Moreover, 
the Supervisory Board looked in detail at the qualifications matrix published in the 
Statement on Corporate Governance."
"Examination of potential conflicts of interest 
The members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board are required 
to disclose any conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay."
"One 
Super­
visory Board member disclosed a potential conflict of interest in respect of an 
M&A project."
"Thereafter, this Supervisory Board member was not given access to  
the ­
relevant documents and also did not participate in the meetings and decision-­
making process of the Supervisory Board in this respect."
"Prior to Management Board members assuming sideline activities, particularly super-
visory board mandates outside the Company, the German Corporate Governance 
Code requires that permission be granted by the Supervisory Board."
"No conflicts of 
interest were discernible in any of the sideline activities performed."
"In fact, they were 
all in Infineon’s best interests and were therefore approved by the Supervisory Board 
and/or Executive Committee."
"Further information on the topic of corporate governance is available in the Statement 
of Corporate Governance."
"In order to identify related party transactions that require approval and to 
treat them in accordance with the law, Infineon has implemented a procedure based 
on guidelines that apply worldwide across the Group."
"The Supervisory Board has 
­
delegated responsibility in this area to the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee, 
particularly for resolutions requiring approval."
"There were no related party trans­
actions requiring approval in the 2023 fiscal year."
The Half-Year Financial Report was also reviewed by KPMG.
"No issues were identified 
that might indicate that the condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements  
or the Interim Group Management Report were not prepared in accordance with the 
applicable provisions in all material respects."
"KPMG has audited the Separate Financial Statements of Infineon Technologies AG 
and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Infineon Group and reviewed the 
Interim Consolidated Financial Statements since the 1999 fiscal year (short fiscal year 
from 1 April 1999 to 30 September 1999)."
"Martin Schmitt, the auditor responsible for 
the engagement, signed the auditor’s report for the first time for the 2021 fiscal year 
(1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021) and Angelika Huber-Straßer, as co-signatory, 
for the first time for the 2023 fiscal year (1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023)."
"The Committee deliberated at length on the key 
audit matters disclosed in the auditor’s report as well as on the related audit proce-
dures."
"Based on the insights gained in the course of these deliberations, the Investment, 
Finance and Audit Committee resolved to suggest to the Supervisory Board that the 
financial statements drawn up and presented by the Management Board be approved 
and the proposed appropriation of profit agreed to."
"At this meeting, the Chairman of the Investment, Finance and 
Audit Committee reported in depth on the corresponding recommendations of the 
Committee."
"In addition, all material issues relevant to the financial statements and 
the audit, including the key audit matters, were exhaustively discussed with the audi-
tor and closely examined by the Supervisory Board."
"The examination also covered 
the proposal to pay a dividend of €0.35 per share entitled to dividend."
"In its opinion, the 
Combined Management Report complied with all legal requirements."
"The Supervisory 
Board also concurred with the assertions regarding Infineon’s future development 
contained therein, as well as with the results of the audit of the financial statements."
"It therefore approved the Separate Financial Statements of Infineon Technologies AG 
and the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Infineon Group for the 2023 fiscal 
year."
The Separate Financial Statements were adopted accordingly.
"The Supervisory 
Board also approved the Management Board’s proposal for the appropriation of 
unappropriated profit."
"Moreover, the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee and the full Supervisory 
Board deliberated on the combined separate Non-Financial Report for the year ended 
30 September 2023 drawn up by the Management Board and the Remuneration 
Report prepared together with the Management Board."
"KPMG performed a reason-
able assurance engagement for the Remuneration Report and a limited assurance 
engagement for some parts of the combined separate Non-Financial Report and a 
reasonable assurance engagement for other parts of that report."
"In both cases, KPMG 
issued an unqualified opinion thereon."
"The documents were carefully examined by  
the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee at its meeting on 14 November 2023, 
which was continued in a conference call on 21 November 2023, and by the Super­
visory Board at its meeting on 23 November 2023."
"The Supervisory Board approved 
the Remuneration Report and positively acknowledged the combined separate 
Non-Financial Report prepared by the Management Board."
"The Supervisory Board wishes to thank all Infineon employees and the Management 
Board for their great commitment and their excellent performance in the 2023 fiscal 
year, which has again been a challenging year."
"The Combined Management Report contains forward-looking statements 
about the business, financial condition and earnings performance of 
Infineon."
"These statements are based on assumptions and projections on 
the basis of currently available information and present estimates."
"They 
are subject to a multitude of uncertainties and risks."
"Actual business devel­
opment may therefore differ materially from what has been expected."
"Beyond disclosure requirements stipulated by law, Infineon does not 
undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements."
"With effect from 1 April 2023, the “Industrial Power Control” segment 
was renamed “Green Industrial Power”."
"Decarbonization, electrification 
and energy efficiency are important drivers of the business in this seg-
ment."
"This focus and the significant contribution made by this segment 
to CO2 reduction are reflected in its new name."
"The change of name has 
no impact on the organizational structure, strategy or scope of business."
"The content of these sections is voluntary content that has not been 
checked by the auditor but only read critically."
"In the case of cross-­
references, the information to which the cross-references refer has not 
been checked either."
"They make our everyday lives easier, safer and greener."
"With 
around 58,600 employees worldwide, Infineon is a leading global provider of semi-
conductor solutions that pave the way for green and efficient energy, clean and safe 
mobility, and intelligent and secure IoT."
"Infineon develops, manufactures and markets 
a large number of semiconductors and semiconductor-based solutions, focusing  
on the key markets in the automotive, industrial and consumer sectors."
"Its products 
range from standard components to special components for digital, analog and 
mixed-signal applications, all the way to customer-specific solutions and the appro-
priate software."
"Our core business includes power semiconductors based on silicon (Si), silicon carbide 
(SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) in the form of individual components, modules and 
system solutions."
"Over the years, Infineon has acquired in-depth knowledge about 
the use of power semiconductors in all applications and the specific challenges 
­
associated with them, developing a very broad portfolio."
"By adopting our strategic 
approach “Product to System”, we combine these power semiconductors with 
­
microcontrollers (including software and driver components), so that we can provide 
perfect solutions for energy conversion systems and enable decarbonization."
"In the area of digitalization, we have a broad portfolio of microcontrollers with hard-
ware-based security, sensors and connectivity products, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,  
supplemented by software."
"These are used in the automotive, industrial and consumer  
sectors, as well as in end applications such as mobile payment and governmental 
identity documents."
"In addition to our established core business, we also service new and adjacent busi-
ness areas."
"Links may arise between the different areas, not only in terms of products 
or technology but also in terms of markets or applications."
"Increasingly, it also provides software and other services, 
such as application-specific support for the implementation of its solutions."
"In frontend manufacturing, the wafers are processed."
"Optical, physical and chemical 
methods are used to create transistors and their interconnections, thus determining 
the function of the chip."
"The wafers are transferred from the frontend site to a back-
end site, where the remaining processing steps take place in backend manufacturing."
"These steps include sawing the wafer into individual chips as well as assembly and 
testing."
"Following the backend manufacturing, the chips are sold to customers via 
regional distribution centers."
"In order to optimize the use of capital and increase flexibility, we use external manufac­
turing partners in addition to our in-house manufacturing."
"In frontend manufacturing, 
this applies primarily to manufacturing processes with little potential for differen­
tiation and, in backend manufacturing, to standardized package types."
"More informa-
tion about our manufacturing strategy is given in the chapter “Group strategy”
."
"Each 
segment focuses on the needs of its own target markets and customers and also has 
individual responsibility for specific areas that reflect its core competencies."
"The 
Automotive segment is responsible for the semiconductor business for automotive 
electronics."
"Activities relating to IoT and 
­
traditional and new security applications are bundled within the Connected Secure 
Systems segment."
"The segments often cooperate with one another to ensure com-
prehensive coverage of the requirements of the various target markets."
"As a result, 
the sales activities of one segment are generally, but not always, focused on its  
own target market."
"Chart 
 C02 provides an overview of the core competencies of the individual segments."
"We cover all application areas in the vehicle: pow-
ertrain and energy management, connectivity and infotainment, body and comfort 
electronics, safety and data security."
"Infineon is the world market leader in semicon-
ductor solutions for cars."
"We also offer our customers innovative solutions in the areas of safety, 
digital cockpit, infotainment, comfort and lighting technology."
"In addition to sensors, 
microcontrollers, software solutions, a reliable power supply, memories for specific 
applications and power semiconductors based on Si and SiC, our product portfolio 
also comprises components for human-machine interaction and vehicle connectivity."
"GIP   Green Industrial Power 
The Green Industrial Power segment specializes in semiconductor solutions for the 
intelligent management and efficient conversion of electric energy along the entire 
conversion chain, comprising the generation, transmission, storage and use of electri­
city."
"The product portfolio comprises mainly IGBT power transistors and the driver 
ICs to control them, as well as power semiconductors based on SiC."
"We offer products 
in the Green Industrial Power segment, whether Si-based or SiC-based, in various 
form factors and with different levels of functionality."
"We use these tech-
nologies to make electronic devices like power supplies, power tools, lighting systems, 
mobile devices and industrial and consumer applications smaller, lighter and more 
energy-efficient, as well as to develop new functionalities."
"We are drawing on the 
next generation of new, innovative solutions based on Si, SiC and GaN for applications 
in the areas of 5G, data centers, power supplies and adapters, battery-powered devices, 
and renewable energy."
"Our portfolio of products for power supplies, comprising con-
trol ICs, drivers and MOSFET power transistors, addresses the two key requirements 
of the market: efficiency and power density."
"Infineon is the clear market leader in  
the global Si MOSFET market."
"Our high-precision sensor solutions give IoT devices 
“human senses”, enabling them to react intuitively to their surroundings."
"The port­
folio is rounded off with USB controllers and radio frequency products such as RF 
antenna switches, RF power transistors and low-noise amplifiers."
"CSS   Connected Secure Systems
The Connected Secure Systems segment supplies comprehensive systems for a 
secure, connected world based on reliable, game-changing microcontrollers and 
wireless connectivity and security solutions."
"These 
include devices for IoT applications, connected home appliances and smart home

as well as credit and debit cards, electronic passports and national identity cards."
"With our technologies in the areas of computing, connectivity and security, we are 
contributing significantly towards ensuring that current and future connected systems 
are reliably protected."
"Decarbonization
Decarbonization is a necessity to contain global warming and therefore the key respon­
sibility of humanity over the next decades."
"We will need to make drastic changes to 
the ways in which we generate, transport, store and use energy."
"To halt global warm-
ing, it is imperative that we waive the use of fossil fuels to a great extent and that we 
make a consistent transition to renewables and widely adopt electrification."
"Effecting 
this transition requires not only the use of wind and solar power but also of systems 
for the storage and efficient transportation of energy."
"We believe that one of the key 
tasks for Infineon is to provide semiconductor solutions for more efficient generation, 
conversion and use of electric energy."
"Our business operations are thereby making a 
significant contribution to the quality of life of generations to come."
"Digitalization
Digitalization is another key trend."
"This involves connectivity between ever-smarter 
devices with an ability to perceive their environment; devices that make life easier, 
safer and more pleasant."
"The possibilities are huge: greater convenience and security 
in the smart home, more efficiency in manufacturing, higher productivity together 
with better environmental sustainability in farming, and new services to support older 
people."
"Infineon’s products in these areas include microcontrollers with software  
and sensors that make it possible to produce connected and smart IoT devices with 
increasing performance in both the industrial sector and the end user sector."
"Infineon sees itself as a trailblazer for a carbon-neutral and digital future: “Driving 
decarbonization and digitalization."
"Together.” This applies to large parts of our 
­
portfolio."
"Software enhances the benefit to customers of our semi­
conductor solutions, allowing for more flexible adjustment."
"We thereby establish a link 
between the real world and the digital world and enable a carbon-neutral future."
"Strategic targets 
To generate value from decarbonization and digitalization for our customers, the 
company, our shareholders and society with our semiconductor solutions, we pursue 
clear and ­
measurable strategic targets."
"Profitable growth
We want to continue to grow in the markets in which we operate and to increase our 
profitability."
"Our long-term financial targets reflect this aspiration and apply over the 
semiconductor cycle."
"At the beginning of the 2023 fiscal year, we revised our target 
operating model and significantly raised our long-term financial targets."
"This reflects 
Infineon’s success over the past few years and, at the same time, is an expression  
of our greater ambitions, especially with regard to profitability and value generation."
"We want to create even more value by focusing consistently on the long-term growth 
trends of decarbonization and digitalization and implementing our strategic guidelines 
(see the chapter “Strategic guidelines”,   p."
"Our four segments focus on the 
­
long-term growth trends of decarbonization and digitalization."
"With our strategic 
approach “Product to System”, we use our extensive technological and product 
expertise to provide more comprehensive solutions and thus create more value for 
our customers."
"In the areas of electromobility, advanced driver assistance systems 
(ADAS), renewable energy, data center/AI and IoT in particular, we expect to achieve 
above-average growth, resulting in total average annual revenue growth for the 
Group over the cycle of more than 10 percent (“>10%”)."
"Target 2: Average Segment Result Margin of  
25 percent over the cycle
A key criterion for our success is sustainable profitability."
"Infineon can consistently pur-
sue its targets even in weaker market phases by engaging in economic activity that  
is sustainably profitable."
"We have set ourselves the target of achieving an average 
Segment Result Margin of 25 percent over the cycle."
"Key elements that will enable  
us to achieve our profitability target are our system solutions, which are based on our 
strategic approach “Product to System”, and generate higher value and greater cus-
tomer benefit."
"In the future, software will play a larger role."
"We enjoy economies of scale 
and cost advantages while continuing to develop our leading market position and 
innovative manufacturing technologies (such as those used to produce 300-millimeter 
thin wafers) and accelerating the expansion of silicon carbide manufacturing facili-
ties."
"At the same time, we make sure that, if we consider our overall portfolio, all our 
businesses are making an adequate contribution to Infineon’s success."
"We also aim 
to ensure that our research and development expenses as well as our selling, general 
and administrative expenses increase at a slower rate than the rate of growth in our 
revenue."
This is supported by our digitalization strategy.
"Target 3: Adjusted Free Cash Flow within a range of  
10 to 15 percent of revenue over the cycle
Looking at value generation, we include a Free Cash Flow target in our target operating 
model."
"Free Cash Flow, adjusted for large investments in frontend buildings as well  
as large M&A transactions (acquisitions and disposals), should fall within a range of 
10 to 15 percent of revenue over the cycle."
"This will be achieved by ensuring our oper-
ating cash flow grows at a faster rate in the long term than our investment expenditure."
"Capital structure targets
Our capital structure targets link together the concepts of environmental and economic 
sustainability and ensure that Infineon remains a trusted partner in the long term."
"An investment grade rating is the key element of Infineon’s conservative financial 
policy."
"From this cornerstone, we derive our long-term capital structure targets, which 
consist of a liquidity target and a leverage target."
"Our liquidity target is €1 billion, plus at least 10 percent of revenue."
"The fixed base 
amount of €1 billion provides a solid liquidity reserve for contingent liabilities and 
pension liabilities, which are unrelated to revenue."
"The additional amount of at least 
10 percent of revenue means that we always have access to sufficient cash to be  
able to finance our operating business and investment throughout all phases of the 
semiconductor cycle."
"Our leverage target is expressed as an upper limit on gross financial debt of two times 
EBITDA."
"Infineon defines EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before inter-
est, taxes, depreciation and amortization."
"This includes contributing towards more sustainable devel-
opment in society."
"With our products, solutions and systems, we are enabling greater 
efficiency and making an active contribution towards climate protection."
"Sustain­
ability is of crucial importance both within the Group and in relation to our supply 
chains."
"We manage Infineon sustainably and are committed to acting sustainably  
for the benefit of society."
"Making a contribution towards containing global warming 
forms part of our mission."
"We have therefore set ourselves the target of becoming 
carbon-neutral by the end of the 2030 fiscal year; by 2025, our emissions are to be 
reduced by 70 percent compared with 2019."
"This target relates to Infineon’s own 
greenhouse gas footprint and includes not only all direct emissions but also indirect 
emissions from electricity and heat."
"Already by the end of the 2023 fiscal year, our 
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions were 56.8 percent below the emissions for the base 
year 2019."
"The development of intelligent exhaust air abatement systems, the 
­
purchase of electricity from renewable sources and the implementation of energy 
efficiency schemes have all contributed to this reduction."
"Our other sustainability activities are described in the separate report “Sustainability 
at Infineon”."
"This report, including the summarized separate Non-Financial Report, 
which is based on the requirements set out in the German CSR Directive Implementa-
tion Act, can be downloaded from the internet at 
 www.infineon.com/csr_reporting."
"Strategic guidelines
To achieve our strategic targets, we rely on a number of strategic guidelines to ensure 
sustainable corporate governance and profitable growth."
"“Product to System” (P2S) and software
With our approach “Product to System” (P2S), we are fostering our leading positions 
in the area of power systems and IoT."
"P2S helps us to better adapt our solutions and 
products to customer requirements."
"We understand new trends early on and can 
develop innovative approaches together with our customers."
"As a result, our custom-
ers can realize sustainable benefits, among others, in terms of systems performance, 
system costs and development time."
"For this to succeed, we have to understand the environment in which our customers’ 
products are used, how these products are embedded in larger systems, with which 
other devices the products interact, what requirements they have to fulfill and what 
function they are intended to perform."
"We also have to consider which other active 
and passive components and control concepts they use and what capabilities our custo­
mers themselves contribute to the value creation process."
"Equipped with this know­
ledge, we can make the most of our competencies."
"We want to translate the technolo­
gically possible into marketable products that provide the greatest possible benefit 
to our customers."
This helps us to continue to develop leading positions in our markets.

fulfill the promise of technological leadership."
"Through close cooperation, we learn 
to understand applications better, allowing us to identify future trends at an early 
stage and develop products that are tailored accordingly."
"In this way, we can offer 
­
our customers either individual components or complete solutions, including the 
necessary software, depending on their requirements."
"We are continuing to enhance our leading technological position and expertise in our 
core markets through radical and customer-focused innovation."
"As a result, we are 
strengthening our core business and identifying long-term growth opportunities in 
adjacent business areas."
"As one of the market leaders in the field of power electronics, 
we began researching new materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride at an 
early stage, building up our expertise, and we are constantly broadening our product 
portfolio in order to generate added value for our customers."
"From a technological perspective, compound semiconductors are of particular impor-
tance."
"Whereas most semiconductor components to date have been based on pure 
silicon, silicon carbide and gallium nitride are two chemical compounds with physical 
properties, in particular a wide band gap, that make it possible to produce semi­
conductors with even greater performance."
"These compounds allow for particularly 
efficient electric switches in the smallest space; for example, they make efficient charg­
ing stations for electric vehicles much more compact, allowing them to be installed  
in more places."
"We consider a strong position in compound semiconductors essential 
to reinforcing our leading position in power semiconductors and, thereby, in power 
systems."
"The acquisition of GaN Systems Inc., which was successfully completed after 
the end of the past financial year on 24 October 2023, will make a significant contri-
bution to this."
"The Ottawa (Canada)-based company contributes a broad portfolio of 
GaN-based energy conversion solutions and first-class application expertise."
"Value creation through differentiating in-house 
manufacturing and high quality
We are continuing to expand our in-house manufacturing in areas in which we create 
added value for the customer and differentiation for Infineon."
"Thus, we manufacture 
products in our own fabs when doing so means that our customers benefit from lower 
cost, higher performance or improved availability."
"This has been the case until now, 
for example, for power semiconductors and sensors."
"Customers are increasingly recog­
nizing the competitive advantage offered by our in-house manufacturing by entering 
into long-term supply contracts and capacity reservation arrangements."
"Some cus-
tomers make multi-year advance payments that support the cashflow during times of 
investments to expand production capacity."
"However, where manufacturing in our 
own fabs offers no additional customer benefit or opportunity to differentiate our-
selves from the compe­
tition, we work together with contract manufacturers."
"To ensure and improve our delivery capability, even 
in times of scarce pro­
duc­
tion capacity in standard technologies, we have signed sup-
ply agreements with our contract manufacturers, sometimes covering a period of 
several years."
"Our 300-millimeter thin wafer manufacturing technology for power semiconductors 
is a clear indication of the value of differentiating manufacturing in our own fabs:  
As pioneers of this technology, the scale of manufacturing we have now reached 
allows us to achieve significant economies of scale."
"Compared with manufacturing 
on 200-millimeter wafers, we benefit from significantly lower costs and lower 
­
capital investment."
"This has enabled us to maintain our lead: With the factory at  
the ­
Villach site (Austria), together with our 300-millimeter manufacturing facility  
in Dresden (Germany), we have established a closely coordinated manufacturing 
­
network across the two sites."
"In line with our “One Virtual Fab” concept, we are  
using the same processes, equipment, and automation and digitalization concepts  
in Villach and in Dresden."
"This generates economies of scale, but it also benefits  
the customer, as we have the flexibility to shift production volumes between the 
sites."
"We are applying a similar concept in the area of compound semiconductors 
between our sites in Villach and Kulim (Malaysia)."
"The third module under construc-
tion in Kulim is also able to generate synergies with the existing 200-millimeter pro-
duction infrastructure."
"Expanding our capacity in line with expected market trends over the cycle has proved 
very effective and forward-thinking."
"We are also expanding our site in Dresden as planned to include an additional 
300-millimeter module for analog mixed-signal products as well as power semicon-
ductors."
"These can be used in a wide variety of applications, such as data centers, 
auto­
motive and IoT."
"The new factory combines the two growth areas, decarbonization 
and digitali­
zation, and is designed to meet demand from our customers in the second 
half of the decade."
Our supply chains and our production are both particularly resilient.
"Our manufacturing 
facilities are spread across all major regions of the world, and our contract manufac-
turer and supplier base is broadly diversified."
"High quality and reliability are key values for us, differentiating us from our competitors."
"Therefore, quality plays a key role in the lifecycle of an Infineon product – from its 
development and production to its supply and product-related services."
"Infineon is 
certified worldwide in accordance with the leading quality standards and has an 
­
efficient management system."
"In addition, clearly defined quality principles provide guidance for our employees."
"These principles have the overriding aim of honoring the pledges we have made  
to our customers relating, among other things, to product functionality and reliabil-
ity."
"To achieve this, we attach great importance to understanding our customers’ 
­
concerns and clearly defining their product requirements."
"Honoring our pledges is  
an essential guiding principle that is also reflected in the in-house cooperation we 
see at Infineon."
"Tried-and-tested processes, methods and tools, together with continuous improve-
ment programs, form the basis for the high priority Infineon attaches to quality."
Our quality departments are embedded in the global organization.
"Regular events 
such as Quality Days at our global sites promote a greater awareness of quality,  
with the result that all Infineon employees are responsible for honoring our quality 
pledge within their own sphere of responsibility."
"This enables us to target the use of our financial resources and, as a result, 
to continue to improve our profitable growth."
"We consider individual operations  
from various points of view, such as value creation, current and expected market posi-
tion, significance to the customer and risk assessment."
"On this basis, we decide the 
extent to which we will invest in or divest an operation."
"Growth prospects and prof­
itabil­
ity are mutually dependent here, with profitability enabling investment and 
ensuring sustainable innovation and growth as a result."
"We will continue to supplement our organic growth in the future with selective acquisi-
tions."
"These acquisitions will need to fulfill three criteria: a) be strategically beneficial 
based on the portfolio process, b) be financially advantageous and c) be a good cultural 
fit."
"A purchase must strengthen Infineon’s market position in accordance with our 
strategic focus, usefully complementing our range of competencies."
"The corporate 
culture of any potential acquisition must be a good fit with Infineon’s culture or must 
add valuable elements."
"A pioneer of digitalization
An important topic for us is Infineon’s digital transformation, which we are driving 
forward using a strategic roadmap."
"As a global semiconductor manufacturer, we 
­
benefit from the digital transformation in two ways: on the one hand, as a provider 
and, on the other, as a user of digital solutions."
"As a provider, we use digitization  
and efficient platforms to support our customers in the best possible way throughout 
the customer relationship and the development process."
"We are constantly optimiz-
ing and expanding our website and web content, and it is important for us that all 
product-related information and support services are easily accessible."
"The accompanying software products and digital services are increasingly being pro-
vided using appropriate licensing models via our digital customer interfaces, such  
as the Infineon Developer Center."
"A major focus is on scaling up technical support, so 
that, even in fragmented markets, we can provide support to customers during their 
product choice and design-in."
"The Infineon Developer Community offers round-the-clock 
technical support to all customers and continues to expand and improve by learning 
from customer queries and customer experience."
"With the specific usage of AI-based 
methods, we enable even better support for our customers through the use of power-
ful generative language models."
This makes access to our resources faster and easier.
We will therefore continue to expand the AI-based portion in the next few years.
"This 
is a particularly efficient way for us to ensure that customers use our products and, 
indeed, use them in a more effective and targeted way."
"As a user, we also use digitization to optimize our internal processes and make them 
as efficient and future-proof as possible."
"So, for example, we connect our sites and 
contract manufacturers in accordance with Industry 4.0 in a virtual manufacturing net­
work."
"In sales and marketing, we use applications based on methods for analyzing 
big data that enable us to provide our customers with targeted personal and increas-
ingly customized support via our digital platforms."
"In addition, we evaluate customer 
behavior and customer requirements in a structured way and incorporate these results 
into the development of our solutions and products."
"In manufacturing, we are focus-
ing to a greater extent on a high level of automation and the increasing use of artificial 
intelligence methods in order to continue to improve our productivity and quality."
"In 
all of these areas, we systematically analyze which processes can be further improved 
and optimized through the use of generative AI language models."
"As part of our digital roadmap, we are focusing on the rapid implementation of 
­
projects."
"When selecting projects, we are guided by the direct value contribution to 
improving the customer experience through efficiency or productivity gains and  
by their function as the necessary basis for future digitization initiatives."

Human resources strategy
Our human resources (HR) strategy is a key component of Infineon’s success."
"It sup-
ports us in our efforts to achieve our growth and profitability targets and enables us to 
successfully navigate our way through varying economic phases and challenges."
"Our 
HR understanding is “People create value."
Engagement drives people”.
"Our overriding 
objective is to foster our employees’ engagement and to take targeted measures to 
achieve this."
"When employees are enthusiastic about their job, have the relevant skill 
sets, and can take advantage of suitable opportunities for continuing professional 
development, the outcome is a higher level of creativity, productivity and innovation, 
as well as better results."
"We use regular pulse checks of our employees worldwide  
to measure their level of engagement and thus keep our finger on the pulse of their 
needs, enabling Infineon to make continuous progress."
We consider it our responsibility to contribute to addressing the key societal challenges.
"Decarbonization and digitalization are having an impact not only on our world but 
also on the future of work."
"From this, we derive the key action areas of our HR strategy."
"People are the main focus of our activities, as dedicated, healthy, successful employees 
are key to maintaining and improving our market-leading position, thereby creating a 
successful future for us all."
"Further information, including detailed statistics, is available in the HR Report 2023 
and the 2023 Sustainability Report."
"This increase of €187 million, or 
10 percent, was less than the increase in revenue."
"Accordingly we invested 12.2 percent 
of revenue in research and development in the 2023 fiscal year, compared with 
12.6 percent in the previous year."
"Capitalized development costs in the 2023 fiscal year 
were €214 million (previous year: €209 million)."
"The amortization of capitalized devel­
opment costs in the 2023 fiscal year was €93 million (previous year: €94 million)."
"Sub-
sidies and grants received for research and development increased from €113 million 
in the 2022 fiscal year to €130 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
"At the end of the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon employed 12,830 people (22 percent of the 
total workforce) in research and development worldwide."
"Of these, 1,645 worked on 
software."
"At the end of the 2022 fiscal year, 12,005 people were employed by Infineon 
in research and development worldwide (21 percent of the workforce)."
"The number of 
research and development sites in the 2023 fiscal year was 69 (2022: 64) in 25 countries."
"Infineon’s research and development activities are in accord with its strategy of con-
tinuing to strengthen its leading technological position through customer-focused 
innovation."
"Research and development activities therefore concentrate on continuing 
to improve our power semiconductors, with a particular focus on the use of new 
materials such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride."
"Important development goals 
are to improve efficiency and increase power density while at the same time main-
taining a high level of reliability."
"Research and development activities are also focused on the digitization of products 
and solutions as an essential prerequisite for the implementation of our P2S strate-
gic approach."
"The opportunity to offer customers all-in-one solutions is particularly 
impor­
tant and provides them with benefits in terms of system performance, system 
costs and development time."
"The main development fields here are microcontrollers, 
connectivity and security solutions, and software."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are being used in a wide variety of applications  
to improve products and processes."
"In the field of edge computing, for example,  
AI is used in combination with our smart sensors and microcontrollers to classify 
tone, key words or gestures to enable the adoption of new and innovative approaches 
in human-machine communication."
"In addition, AI supports many processes such  
as chip design, marketing and production."
"We are also addressing longer-term future-related topics in areas such as quantum 
computing and post-quantum cryptography."
"Patents 
Another indication of Infineon’s innovative power and long-term competitiveness is 
the number of our patents."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we applied for around 1,850 patents 
worldwide (previous year: around 1,700)."
"In addition to patent applications and 
­
expirations, there were changes in the portfolio due to regular strategic patent port-
folio adjustments."
"Maintenance of the patent portfolio is carried out on a regular 
basis."
"This has resulted, along with new patent applications for inventions, in a signi­
f­
icant increase in the relevance of the patents, as highlighted again by LexisNexis®  
and Clarivate® in their innovation reports."
"At the end of the 2023 fiscal year, the world­
wide patent portfolio comprised around 29,700 patents and patent applications  
(previous year: around 29,600)."
"Accordingly, performance indica-
tors are used that enable profitable growth and efficient employment of capital to  
be measured."
"Overall, the achievement of our long-term financial targets will lead to a sustainable 
increase in the value of Infineon by generating a permanent premium on the cost  
of capital."
"In this context, growth, profitability, liquidity and investments are all interdependent."
"Profitability is the prerequisite for being able to finance operations internally, which, 
in other words, means opening up potential opportunities for growth."
"Growth, in turn, 
requires continual investment in research and development as well as manufactur-
ing capacities."
"Growing at a commensurate rate enables Infineon to achieve leading 
market positions and generate economies of scale that contribute to greater profit-
ability."
"Employing financial resources efficiently is a critical factor in achieving these 
goals."
"Infineon deploys a comprehensive controlling system to manage its business with 
respect to the strategic targets it has set itself."
"The system involves the use of financial 
and operating performance indicators."
"Information for controlling purposes is derived 
from annual long-term planning, quarterly outlooks, actual monthly data and infor-
mation available with even greater frequency, such as the volume of orders received."
"This knowledge enables management to base its decisions in a timely manner on 
sound information about the current situation and future expected financial and 
operational developments."
"Sustainable business practices and the consideration of forward-thinking qualitative 
factors are important for Infineon’s long-term success."
"As an enterprise very much aware 
of its responsibilities towards society, Infineon also takes account of non-financial 
factors, mainly in relation to the environment and employee diversity."
"These financial performance indicators are also the cornerstones of the system for vari-
able remuneration."
"Most of the variable salary components pertaining to employees 
and management are directly linked to these performance indicators."
"The Segment Result Margin is the 
Segment Result expressed as a percentage of revenue and is a measure of the profit-
ability of revenue and the success of Infineon’s operating business."
"The activities  
of the segments are managed on the basis of the Segment Result Margin/Segment 
Result."
"Responsibility for optimizing the Segment Result Margin/Segment Result 
within the framework of the Group strategy (as approved by the Management Board) 
rests with the management teams of the relevant segments, acting, however, in  
close coordination with the Management Board."
"It is 
Infineon’s stated target to sustainably generate positive Free Cash Flow (for an expla-
nation of changes in Free Cash Flow during the 2023 fiscal year, see the chapter 
“Review of liquidity”,   p."
"Free Cash Flow is managed by Infineon at Group level 
only and not at segment level."
"The main factors influencing Free Cash Flow are a positive earnings trend combined 
with effective management of inventories, trade accounts receivable and payable, 
and capital expenditures."
"RoCE describes how efficiently  
a company uses its resources and, through the comparison with cost of capital, serves 
as an instrument for value-based corporate management."
"It is also analyzed by Infineon 
at Group level only and not at segment level."
"In order to analyze operating profitability in detail, the result and cost block compo-
nents of the Segment Result are considered."
"These are gross profit, research and 
development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as 
their relation to revenue."
"These indicators are analyzed both at Group level and at segment level (for changes 
in these indicators for the Group in the 2023 fiscal year, see the chapter “Review of 
results of operations”,   p."
"Liquidity performance indicators
A rolling cash flow forecast helps ensure that Infineon has appropriate levels of liquidity 
at its disposal and an optimal capital structure."
"Non-financial performance indicators
Non-financial performance indicators at Infineon include CO2 emissions and indicators 
relating to diversity."
"Already at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, Infineon announced that it wanted to 
become carbon-neutral by 2030."
"By 2025, Infineon would like to reduce its CO2 emis-
sions by 70 percent compared to the 2019 calendar year."
"The degree of target achievement for these non-financial performance indicators  
is also reflected in the remuneration of the Management Board (see the chapter  
“Remuneration Report”,   p."
"Actual and target values for performance indicators 
The chapter “Outlook”,   p."
"62, contains a table comparing the actual values achieved 
in the 2023 fiscal year for principal and selected supplementary performance indicators 
with the values forecasted and the expectations for the 2024 fiscal year."
"For the 2023 calendar year, experts at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expect a 
global economic growth of 2.5 percent ( 
 R01)."
"This would mean growth in the 2023 
calendar year would be slightly below the long-term growth trend."
"The reasons for this 
include the impact of the energy crisis, high rates of inflation, sharp increases in inter-
est rates, a drop in consumer and business confidence, and the unexpectedly slow 
recovery of the Chinese economy after the removal of pandemic-related restrictions."
"The growth figures relate to market size, translated into US dollars at market 
exchange rates."
"Review of the semiconductor market  
in the 2023 fiscal year
Worldwide semiconductor revenue totaled €480 billion in the 2023 fiscal year."
"This was 
13 percent lower than the figure for the 2022 fiscal year of €550 billion."
"Expressed in 
US dollars, the decrease was 14 percent ( 
 R02)."
"This was mainly due to the significant 
fall in demand in the computing, smartphone and consumer market segments, with  
a double-digit contraction in revenue in some areas ( 
 R03)."
"Revenue in Infineon’s reference market (i.e., the market for semiconductors exclud-
ing DRAM and NAND flash memory chips and microprocessors) was €364 billion in 
the 2023 fiscal year, 1 percent less compared with €367 billion in the 2022 fiscal year."
"Expressed in US dollars, the decrease was 2 percent ( 
 R02)."
"The relatively steady 
performance in the Infineon reference market was primarily due to the automotive 
and industrial market segments, in which growth was driven by the decarbonization 
and digitalization trends."
"Semiconductor content in vehicles increased, partly as a 
result of growing demand for electric vehicles, comfort features and efficient driver 
assistance systems."
"Growing demand for semiconductors was also evident again in 
the renewable energy sector ( 
 R03)."
"Market position
In the 2022 calendar year, Infineon was ranked in 13th place in the global semiconduc-
tor market, with a market share of 2.6 percent."
"In the Infineon reference market, 
Infineon ranked in seventh place worldwide in the 2022 calendar year, with a market 
share of 4.0 percent."
"This puts Infineon in second place among European semicon-
ductor manufacturers in both markets ( 
 R04)."
"In the first nine months of the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon achieved a market share of 
3.4 percent in the global semiconductor market and was ranked in 11th place."
"In the 
Infineon reference market, Infineon achieved a market share of 4.7 percent in the  
first nine months of the 2023 fiscal year and was ranked in sixth place."
"In the first nine 
months of the fiscal year, Infineon was ranked in second place among European 
semiconductor manufacturers in both markets ( 
 R04)."
"Data for the full 2023 fiscal 
year was not yet available at the time this report was prepared."
"The 
results are an initial confirmation of our more ambitious course we embarked on as a 
company a year ago."
"Nevertheless, we find ourselves in an environment that continues 
to present challenges."
We are seeing different trends in our target markets.
"Structural 
semiconductor growth in the areas of renewable energy, electromobility (especially 
in China) and microcontrollers for the automotive industry remains unabated."
"In con-
trast, consumer, communication, computing and IoT applications are experiencing  
a temporary period of low demand."
"Details about the performance of the segments 
can be found in the chapter “Segment performance”."
"Group revenue up by 15 percent
Infineon generated Group revenue of €16,309 million in the 2023 fiscal year, a 15 percent 
increase on the previous year’s figure of €14,218 million."
"Around half the growth in 
revenue was due to price increases and around half to higher volumes and product mix 
adjustments."
"Continuing high levels of demand for semiconductors in the automotive 
and renewable energy sectors, in particular, had a positive impact here."
"At the same 
time, manufacturing capacity is continually being expanded."
"This was also the case  
in the 2023 fiscal year at our sites in Villach (Austria), Dresden (Germany) and Kulim 
(Malaysia)."
"Production corridors of contract manufacturers also contributed to the 
increase in revenue.In addition, there were positive exchange rate effects during 
the reporting period."
"Segment Result Margin of 27.0 percent achieved
Infineon improved its Segment Result by 30 percent from €3,378 million in the 2022 
fiscal year to €4,399 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The main reasons for this were 
price increases, higher volumes and improvements in the product mix."
"Moreover, 
operating expenses rose at a lower rate than revenue."
"This was offset by higher idle 
costs and write-downs on increased inventories."
"Taking all this into account, the Segment Result Margin of 27.0 percent was signifi-
cantly higher than the figure for the previous fiscal year of 23.8 percent."
"Details about Infineon’s two other principal performance indicators, Free Cash Flow 
and RoCE, and about its other performance indicators can be found in the chapters 
“Review of results of operations”,   p."
"49 ff., “Review of financial condition”,   p."
"53 f., 
and “Review of liquidity”,   p."
"The segment contributed 51 percent of Infineon’s Group 
revenue."
"Electromobility, driver assistance systems, software-defined vehicle architecture and 
the trend towards higher levels of electronic features in vehicles continued to be the 
main drivers of our growth in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Electromobility benefited not only 
from purchase incentive schemes but also from the increasing availability of charging 
stations, the wider range of models being produced by almost all vehicle manufacturers 
and a change in attitude in society towards sustainable mobility."
Our business with microcontrollers developed particularly well.
"These include the 
AURIX™, TRAVEO™ and PSoC™ families."
"The transition to new vehicle architectures by 
many manufacturers, expanded driver assistance systems and the electrification of 
vehicles ensured above-average demand."
"Our AURIX™ family was developed specifi-
cally for embedded control systems with the highest safety requirements and is there­
fore used in addition to driver assistance systems for engine control, security and in 
high-speed onboard networks."
"Real-time capability, high computing power and low 
power consumption are the decisive characteristics."
"The TRAVEO™ family benefited 
from the trend towards digital instrument and display systems."
"In addition, the delivery 
situation at our manufacturing partners continued to improve in the past financial 
year, which also had a positive impact on sales development."
"Infineon was also able to benefit from the fact that electromobility, automated driving 
and mobility services are increasingly requiring more powerful software."
"This software 
needs to be updatable throughout the lifecycle of the vehicle."
"This flexibility, as well 
as higher safety requirements for automated driving, require a new architecture for 
onboard networks used for data transmission and power distribution."
"For the latter, in 
particular, special safety-certified semiconductor solutions are used, replacing existing  
fuses and relays."
"With PROFET™, Infineon offers an extensive portfolio of smart semi-
conductor switches."
"They enable decentralized configurable power distribution that 
at the same time complies with the highest safety standard."
"Moreover, during the reporting period, there was a further increase in comfort fea-
tures across all vehicle segments."
"Examples of these include retractable door handles, 
electrically controlled seat adjustment, sun visors and tailgates."
"All these functions 
require power switches, sometimes several per function, around a hundred on average 
per vehicle."
"As Infineon has an extensive portfolio of semiconductor switches, it 
achieved above-average growth in this area in the past fiscal year."
Higher prices also contributed to the increase in revenue.
"We were able to win additional contracts worldwide for our microcontrollers and  
power semiconductors, particularly for silicon carbide both in the power train and 
onboard chargers as well as in DC-DC converters."
"We therefore anticipate achieving 
significant increases in revenue in this area over the next few years."
"The Segment Result in the 2023 fiscal year was €2,380 million, an increase of 60 percent 
compared with the Segment Result for the previous fiscal year of €1,490 million."
"Based 
on revenue, the Segment Result Margin was 28.9 percent (previous year: 22.9 perc­
ent), 
see 
 C04."
"The increase in the Segment Result Margin was mainly due to positive price 
effects, the higher level of revenue and improvements in the product mix."
"The revenue growth was the result of higher 
volumes as well as positive price effects."
"The segment contributed 13 percent to 
Infineon’s Group revenue."
Demand in the area of renewable energy remained high.
"The generation of clean energy 
is an essential prerequisite for the achievement of global carbon emission targets."
"Thanks to its strong market position in the area of renewable energy, Infineon was 
able to benefit directly from this megatrend."
"There was an increase in revenue from products for wind power as well as from PV 
inverter products."
"In many regions of the world, solar and wind power are now the 
cheapest way of generating electricity."
"Capacity is therefore being expanded accord-
ingly, especially in the form of utility-scale installations."
"As the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix continues to grow, so too 
does the importance of storage solutions to stabilize the grids."
"The energy infrastruc-
ture business comprises the transmission, distribution and storage of energy, as  
well as the charging infrastructure for electromobility and enjoyed strong demand."
"Revenue in the fields of automation and electric drives benefited from demand in the 
area of factory equipment and automation."
Revenue in transportation grew strongly from a weak basis.
"Besides the recovery  
in trains, new business areas such as the electrification of buses, trucks and farm 
machinery contributed to the improved result."
"In home appliances, the revenue declined due to the weak construction activity in 
China."
"The trend towards inverterized motor control systems continued but could not 
compensate for the weak demand."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, the Segment Result was €662 million, an increase of 72 percent 
compared with the figure for the previous fiscal year of €384 million."
"As a result of the 
growth in volumes and positive price effects, the Segment Result Margin improved from 
21.5 percent in the 2022 fiscal year to 30.0 percent in the 2023 fiscal year, see 
 C05 ."
"In the first quarter of the fiscal year, weak 
demand in the consumer business was still partially offset by increasing demand for 
semiconductors used in servers and industrial applications."
"In the following quarters, 
demand for semiconductors used in servers also declined significantly, following high 
growth rates in previous years."
"Combined with continuing weak demand for semicon-
ductors for computers, consumer electronics and telecommunications infrastructure, 
this led to a decrease in revenue in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The segment contributed 
23 percent of Infineon’s Group revenue."
"In past years, there was significant growth in demand in the server market, mainly 
driven by high levels of investment from cloud computing service providers."
"However, 
this growth slowed considerably in the course of the 2023 fiscal year."
"Furthermore, 
investment in cloud servers was deferred, and more AI accelerators were ordered 
instead."
"AI accelerators are special parts of servers that significantly accelerate artificial 
intelligence (AI) learning."
"In principle, this deferral should be seen as a positive devel-
opment for semiconductor demand, as the power supply of an AI accelerator processor 
has a significantly higher semiconductor content than that required for the power 
supply of a processor for standard servers."
"The increase in demand for semiconductors 
for AI was not yet sufficient in the 2023 fiscal year to offset the decline in revenue in 
the area of traditional servers."
"Demand for power semiconductors in the area of tele-
communications infrastructure also slowed in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Demand for products in the consumer market also remained weak in the 2023 fiscal 
year."
"Sales figures for consumer electronic devices of all types (e.g., smartphones, PCs, 
laptops and notebooks, games consoles, as well as television) rose sharply during 
the Covid pandemic before returning to more normal levels, which led to a decrease 
in revenue in this area."
"Bucking the generally weak trend, interest in chargers, adapters 
and power supplies based on the new material GaN is continuing to grow."
"This led to 
an increase in revenue in this market segment, even if this was from a relatively low 
base."
"As a result of the acquisition of GaN Systems, the number of GaN specialists in 
our Group has virtually doubled."
"We are therefore now in a position to gain even faster 
access to the market of various GaN applications."
"Demand in our industrial business and for applications in the automotive sector 
­
continued on an upward trend."
"The growing number of electric vehicles being sold 
resulted in steadily increasing demand for charging stations and onboard chargers."
"In addition, the number of vehicles with in-cabin USB-C ports for charging mobile 
devices is continuing to rise."
"Good revenue growth was also to be seen in the compo-
nents business for light electric vehicles such as eBikes, eScooters and forklift trucks."
"Demand for microinverters for roof-top solar systems remained steady, although it 
began to weaken towards the end of the fiscal year."
Our software business becomes more important year to year.
"For a variety of products, 
software offers an additional benefit and helps us to differentiate via the enhance-
ment of our product portfolio."
"We provide software either directly to complement the 
firmware already integrated into the end product or as an additional service."
"In both 
cases, software enables us to augment our revenue, either by selling a greater number 
of higher-quality products at correspondingly higher prices or by producing additional 
revenue with our software services."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we generated increasing 
revenue from software, primarily related to USB-C chargers."
"Turnkey products that can 
still subsequently be configured and programmed by the customer were particularly 
in demand in this product area."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, we generated our first revenue from ion traps for quantum 
computing."
"Together with the German firm eleQtron GmbH, a pioneer in quantum 
computers, Infineon is now manufacturing quantum processors based on ion-trap 
technology and supplies continuously improved generations of ion traps for eleQtron 
to incorporate into its quantum computers."
"Several other partnerships have already 
been established with regard to the manufacture of quantum computers."
"One example 
of these is the English company Oxford Ionics."
"These collaborations with partners in 
the quantum industry will continue to be expanded in the future."
"As a result of the decrease in revenue described above, there was also a decline in  
the Segment Result and the Segment Result Margin."
"The Segment Result in the 2023 
fiscal year was €861 million, compared with €1,137 million in the 2022 fiscal year, a 
decrease of 24 percent."
"The Segment Result Margin was 22.7 percent, compared with 
27.9 percent in the 2022 fiscal year, see 
 C06."
"
Review of the Connected Secure Systems segment 
in the 2023 fiscal year
In the Connected Secure Systems segment, Infineon generated revenue in the 2023 
fiscal year of €2,046 million, an increase of 12 percent compared with the figure  
for the previous fiscal year of €1,822 million."
"The segment contributed 13 percent of 
Infineon’s Group revenue."
"The growth in revenue was driven by higher prices, an improved product mix and 
­
volume growth in dedicated applications."
"The security solutions business in particular 
benefited from the stabilization of the supply situation in the past fiscal year, which 
meant it was possible to meet the outstanding demand, especially for payment and 
ID solutions."
"Moreover, demand for eSIM solutions for automotive and industrial 
applications remained high."
"Demand for connectivity solutions and microcontrollers was adversely impacted by  
a worsening macroeconomic climate, which had a dampening effect on consumer 
spending."
"Despite macroeconomic obstacles, the digitalization of applications in the 
context of IoT remains one of our principal long-term growth areas."
"This growth is 
driven primarily by an increase in the penetration rate of end devices, especially in 
the area of industrial and consumer applications."
The trend towards cashless and contactless payment is continuing.
"There was strong 
demand for our solutions across all regions."
"Around the world, there was a significant increase in travel in the past fiscal year."
"In addition to this trend, other major ID projects contributed significantly to strong 
revenue growth in this business area."
Progress with Industry 4.0 applications is also leading to growing demand for eSIMs.
"Manufacturing machinery, tools and other technical devices are becoming more and 
more connected and can therefore be monitored, serviced and maintained remotely."
"Given the growth in revenue, both the Segment Result and Segment Result Margin 
were higher than in the 2022 fiscal year."
"Higher prices, a better product mix and 
­
volume growth in dedicated applications led to this improvement."
"The Segment 
Result in the 2023 fiscal year was €488 million, an increase of 29 percent compared 
with the prior-year figure of €378 million."
"Based on revenue, the Segment Result 
­
Margin was 23.9 percent (previous year: 20.7 percent), see 
 C07."
"Around half the growth in revenue was due to price 
increases and around half to higher volumes and product mix adjustments."
"Conti­
nuing high levels of demand for semiconductors in the automotive and renewable 
energy sectors, in particular, had a positive impact here."
"At the same time, manu­
facturing capacity is continually being expanded."
"This was also the case in the 2023 
fiscal year at our sites in Villach (Austria), Dresden (Germany) and Kulim (Malaysia)."
"Pro­
duction corridors released by contract manufacturers also contributed to the 
increase in revenue."
"In addition, there were positive exchange rate effects during the reporting period."
"A significant proportion of revenue in the 2023 fiscal year was earned in foreign 
­
currencies, primarily in US dollars."
"The average euro/US dollar exchange rate was 
around 1.08 in the 2022 fiscal year and 1.07 in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Revenue by segment is disclosed below:
Details on the performance of the segments can be found in the chapter “Segment 
performance”."
"The decrease in the proportion of revenue generated in the Greater China region is 
primarily due to the decline in revenue from consumer applications such as PCs  
and smartphones."
"The increase in the 
cost of goods sold was therefore less than the increase in revenue."
"This was primarily 
due to positive price effects and improvements in the product mix."
"The increase in idle 
costs and inventory write-downs had an opposite effect."
"These expenses 
include the amortization of fair value adjustments of €250 million (previous year: 
€278 million) identified in the course of purchase price allocations and other acquisi-
tion-related expenses."
"Gross profit (revenue less cost of goods sold) in the 2023 fiscal year was €7,413 million, 
21 percent higher than the prior-year figure of €6,131 million."
"The gross margin 
improved accordingly, from 43.1 percent in the 2022 fiscal year to 45.5 percent in the 
2023 fiscal year."
"The 
increase reflects the higher volume of business and results mainly from the intensi­
fication of research and development activities and the higher headcount in this 
area."
"A total of 12,830 employees were engaged in research and development as of 
30 September 2023, an increase of 7 percent over the figure for 30 September 2022  
of 12,005."
"Expressed as a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses comprised 
12.2 percent of revenue in the 2023 fiscal year, which was lower than the prior-year 
figure of 12.6 percent."
"Expressed as  
a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses comprised 
9.8 percent of revenue in the 2023 fiscal year, which was lower than the prior-year 
­
figure of 11.0 percent."
"The impact on earnings of the purchase price allocations and 
acquisition-­
related expenses included in Infineon’s selling, general and administrative 
expenses in the 2023 fiscal year was €168 million (previous year: €177 million)."
"Increase in net amount of other operating income and expenses 
The net amount of other operating income and expenses improved in the course of 
the 2023 fiscal year to €119 million (previous year: €77 million)."
"This includes income 
from the sale of Infineon’s HiRel DC-DC converter business to Micross Components, 
Inc."
and from the sale of the Temecula site (USA).
"Improvement in financial result 
The financial result in the 2023 fiscal year was a net loss of €54 million (previous year: 
net loss of €161 million)."
"The improvement in the financial result arose mainly from 
higher interest income due to increased interest rates and from positive valuation 
effects."
"In contrast, interest expenses relating to financial liabilities were subject to 
almost no fluctuations due to contractually agreed fixed interest rates."
"In addition,  
in June 2023, a bond with a nominal volume of €750 million was repaid on schedule."
Further information is provided in note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
"Based on the profit from continuing operations before income 
taxes of €3,921 million (previous year: €2,723 million), the tax rate for the reporting 
year was 19.9 percent (previous year: 19.7 percent)."
"Further details regarding the income tax expense are provided in note 6 to the 
­
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Profit for the period and earnings per share up on previous year 
After deducting income taxes and adjusting for the profit/loss from discontinued 
operations, Infineon recorded a profit for the period of €3,137 million in the 2023 
­
fiscal year (previous year: €2,179 million)."
"The higher profit for the period resulted in a corresponding increase in earnings  
per share."
"Both basic and diluted earnings per share stood at €2.38 for the 2023 fiscal year 
(­
previous year: €1.65)."
"The calculation of earnings per share in accordance with IFRS is presented in detail  
in note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"115
Increase in adjusted earnings per share 
Earnings per share in accordance with IFRS is influenced by amounts relating to pur-
chase price allocations for acquisitions (in particular Cypress) and other exceptional 
items."
"To enable better comparability of operating performance over time, Infineon 
­
calculates adjusted earnings per share (diluted)."
"Adjusted profit (loss) for the period 
and adjusted earnings per share (diluted) should not be seen as a replacement or as 
superior performance indicators, but rather as additional information to the profit (loss) 
for the period and earnings per share (diluted) determined in accordance with IFRS."
2	The calculation of the adjusted earnings per share is based on unrounded figures.
"Additions of €2,729 million significantly exceeded depreciation 
of €1,143 million."
"The main focus of Infineon’s investing activities in the 2023 fiscal 
year was on the expansion of its frontend manufacturing facilities in Villach (Austria) 
and Dresden (Germany), as well as the development of the frontend manufacturing 
site in Kulim (Malaysia)."
"This increase is mainly attributable to our Automotive 
­
segment, where delivery reliability is a key factor in winning and retaining orders."
"Currency-related decrease in goodwill 
Goodwill decreased by €536 million to €6,547 million as of 30 September 2023."
"The decline was almost exclusively due to currency effects, in particular the weaker 
US dollar compared to the euro as of the reporting date."
"Decrease in other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets decreased by €506 million to €2,977 million as of  
30 Sep­
tember 2023."
"Amortization of €531 million significantly exceeded additions  
of €255 million."
Currency effects of €208 million also contributed to the decline.
"Repayment of financial debt 
Financial debt decreased by €929 million to €4,733 million, mainly as a result of the 
repayment of a €750 million bond."
"Exchange rate effects of €182 million arising  
from financial debt denominated in US dollars also contributed to the reduction in 
financial debt."
"More detailed information on financial debt is provided in note 16 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"Equity up mainly due to profit for the period 
Equity increased by €2,100 million to €17,044 million as of 30 September 2023."
"The 
main contributory factor was the profit for the period of €3,137 million."
"Exchange rate 
effects recognized in other comprehensive income of €718 million and the dividend 
of €417 million paid out for the 2022 fiscal year had an opposite effect."
"The equity ratio as of 30 September 2023, based on total assets of €28,439 million, 
was 59.9 percent (30 September 2022: 55.5 percent)."
"Improvement in RoCE due to higher operating profit 
In the 2023 fiscal year, operating profit from continuing operations after tax increased 
significantly by €920 million to €3,237 million (previous year: €2,317 million) and 
therefore at a faster rate than capital employed."
"Adjustments made to volumes, prices 
and the product mix, as well as exchange rate effects, contributed to the increase in 
operating profit (see the chapter “Review of results of operations”,   p."
"Capital 
employed rose by €1,151 million to €19,510 million as of 30 September 2023."
"Consequently, Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) increased from 12.6 percent to 
16.6 percent."
"Set against a significant improvement in profit from 
continuing operations before income taxes of €1,198 million were negative effects, 
principally in relation to the change in other assets and other liabilities and the 
change in working capital."
"Cash outflows from investing activities decreased by €177 million compared with  
the previous fiscal year to €2,264 million."
"The improvement resulted mainly from  
the €643 million increase in net cash inflow from the purchase and sale of financial 
investments."
"Cash inflows totaling €200 million from the sale of the HiRel DC/DC 
­
converter business and the sale of the Temecula site (USA) also contributed to the  
improvement."
"This was offset by the €686 million increase in payments for property, 
plant and equipment."
"Further information about investments made in the 2023 fiscal 
year can be found in the chapter “Review of financial condition”."
"Cash outflows from financing activities decreased by €568 million compared with the 
previous fiscal year."
"The main effects for this decline are the reduction of €640 million 
in net repayment of financial debt which was offset by a €66 million higher divi-
dend payment."
"The net cash outflows from financing activities thus amounted to 
€1,301 million in the 2023 fiscal year."
"More information about financial debt is provided in note 16 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements."
"Free Cash Flow serves as an additional performance indicator since Infineon holds 
part of its liquidity in the form of financial investments."
"This does not mean that  
the Free Cash Flow calculated in this way is available to cover other disbursements, 
because dividends, debt-servicing obligations and other fixed disbursements have 
not been deducted."
"Since the 2023 fiscal year, adjusted Free Cash Flow has become part of Infineon’s 
­
target operating model (see the chapter “Group strategy”,   p."
"28) and is defined  
as Free Cash Flow adjusted for cash outflows for investments in large ­
frontend build-
ings, for cash inflows for related investment subsidies and for major M&A transactions 
(acquisitions and disposals) adjusted for cash acquired or disposed of."
"Gross cash position and net cash position
The following table shows the gross cash position and the net cash position."
"Since 
some liquid funds are held in the form of financial investments, which for IFRS pur-
poses are not classified as cash and cash equivalents, Infineon reports on its gross 
and net cash positions in order to provide investors with a better understanding of  
its overall liquidity situation."
"123 ) – Infineon assumes that it will be able to cover 
those capital requirements for the 2024 fiscal year that are currently expected."
"These 
include the repayment of financial debt on its due date."
"Forecast capital requirements 
also include other financial obligations, such as orders already placed for initiated  
or planned investments in property, plant and equipment (see note 23 to the Consoli-
dated Financial Statements,   p."
"Investments planned for the 2024 fiscal year 
are described in the chapter “Outlook”."
"Infineon is party to two financing agreements that contain a number of standard 
­
covenants, including a debt coverage ratio that provides for a certain relationship 
between the size of debt (adjusted) and earnings (adjusted) (see note 21 to the 
­
Consolidated Financial Statements,   p."
"Its primary goal is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to 
finance operating activities and planned investments throughout all phases of the 
business cycle."
"We aim to achieve a gross liquidity level of €1 billion, plus at least 
10 percent of revenue."
"As a general rule, debt should only constitute a modest proportion of the financing mix 
to ensure that sufficient headroom is available at all times."
"The key objective is to 
maintain an investment grade rating."
"In February 2023, S&P Global Ratings confirmed 
Infineon’s BBB investment grade rating and changed the outlook from “stable” to 
“positive”."
"For further information on the nature, maturity, currency and interest rate 
structure of Infineon’s gross financial debt, see note 16 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"In accordance with our treasury principles, we adopt a highly centralized approach."
"Group Finance & Treasury is the department responsible for all major tasks and 
­
processes worldwide relating to financing and treasury matters."
"In the context of centralized liquidity management and, to the extent that this is per-
mitted by law and economically justifiable, cash pooling structures are in place to  
ensure the best possible allocation of liquid funds within the Group and reduce its  
external financing requirements."
"Liquidity accumulated at Group level is invested 
centrally by the Group Finance & Treasury department based on a conservative 
investment strategy, in which preserving capital is prioritized over maximizing returns."
"Group Finance & Treasury is also responsible for managing currency and interest rate 
risks and hedging against commodity price risks."
"Derivative financial instruments  
are not used for trading or speculation purposes."

comprises the CFO and representatives from the Finance & Treasury, Accounting, 
Controlling and Tax departments."
2	Calculation of market capitalization: (“shares issued” – “own shares”) x share price.
The calculation is based on unrounded figures.
This was up 38 percent on the closing price of €22.71 at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.
"On 3 October 2022, right at the beginning of the fiscal year, Infineon shares fell to their 
lowest price for the year of €23.09."
"Subsequently, the share price climbed relatively 
steadily, reaching its year high for the 2023 fiscal year of €40.00 on 31 July 2023."
"With 
an increase in value of 38 percent during the fiscal year, Infineon shares rose at a 
faster rate than the DAX, which was up 27 percent."
"The US benchmark indices, the 
Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) and Dow Jones US Semiconductor Index, 
rose even faster, mainly as a result of a surge in the price of some technology shares 
at the end of May due to a wave of interest in artificial intelligence."
"The SOX improved 
by 49 percent compared with the previous year and the Dow Jones US Semiconductor 
Index by 79 percent."
"With a closing price for Infineon shares of €31.36, its market capi-
talization as of 30 September 2023 was €40,879 million, compared with €29,574 million 
at the end of the 2022 fiscal year when the share price was €22.71."
"Shareholder structure
As of 30 September 2023, the company BlackRock Inc."
"held more than 5 percent of 
the Infineon shares issued."
"The share capital held by retail investors increased slightly 
to 9.50 percent at the end of the 2023 fiscal year, compared with 9.47 percent at the 
end of the 2022 fiscal year."
"The dividend payout for the 
2021 fiscal year was increased by €0.05 per share compared with the previous year."
"The dividend payout for the 2022 fiscal year was then increased again by €0.05, to 
€0.32 per share."
"It is now planned to put forward a proposal at the Annual General 
Meeting in February 2024 for a further increase in the dividend of €0.03."
"The reason 
for this is Infineon’s even better business performance in the 2023 fiscal year compared 
with the previous year while at the same time retaining the financial headroom of  
the Company for profitable growth."
"If the planned proposal is approved at the Annual 
General Meeting, the dividend for the 2023 fiscal year would rise to €0.35 per share."
"The number of shares issued remained unchanged as of 30 September 2023 at 
1,305,921,137."
"This figure now includes 2,171,026 shares owned by the Company  
that are not entitled to a dividend."
"The total amount to be distributed to shareholders 
is therefore anticipated to rise to €456 million, compared with €417 million one  
year earlier."

"Our target markets developed correspondingly 
differently."
"On a positive note, structural demand for many of our semiconductors for electro­
mobility applications remains unbroken."
"We saw a similarly healthy demand picture 
for renewable energy applications as well as for power and charging infrastructure, 
supported by government decarbonization initiatives."
"By contrast, demand for end 
consumer applications such as PCs and smartphones declined following the corona-
virus pandemic."
"Consumers and companies were reluctant to spend in a persistently 
inflationary and uncertain environment."
"Despite the challenging conditions, Infineon was very successful in the 2023 fiscal year."
"This is also reflected in our current figures, see the chapters “Group performance”,

"Comparison of original outlook with actual figures 
for the 2023 fiscal year
Revenue for the 2023 fiscal year was originally forecast in November 2022 to be  
€15.5 billion, plus or minus €500 million."
"In light of Infineon’s positive business  
performance, this outlook was raised incrementally in the following quarters to an 
expected revenue of around €16.2 billion."
"The actual amount of revenue generated in 
the 2023 fiscal year was €16,309 million."
"This figure was within the projected range  
of the final forecast on 3 August 2023 and significantly above the original forecast in 
November 2022."
"The good level of demand and price increases both had a positive 
impact on revenue."
"In conjunction with the adjustments to the revenue forecast, the expected Segment 
Result Margin was also adjusted upwards in the course of the fiscal year."
"Originally,  
a Segment Result Margin of around 24 percent was forecast for the 2023 fiscal year."
The most recent forecast was a figure of around 27 percent.
"The actual figure was 
27.0 percent, so the forecast was met."
"According to the original forecast in November 2022, Free Cash Flow was expected to 
reach around €0.8 billion."
"As a result of the ongoing adjustments to the revenue and 
earnings forecasts, adjustments were also made on a regular basis to the expected 
figure for Free Cash Flow."
"The final forecast for Free Cash Flow of around €1.2 billion 
was made in August 2023."
"The actual figure for Free Cash Flow in the 2023 fiscal year 
was €1,158 million."
"This was in line with the most recent forecast and was significantly 
higher than the figure originally forecast of €0.8 billion."
"As a result of Infineon’s positive earnings performance, the actual figure for Return  
on Capital Employed (RoCE) in the 2023 fiscal year was 16.6 percent, exceeding the 
forecast made in November 2022 of “around 12 percent” respectively in March 2023 
of “around 15 percent”."
"The actual figure for investments in the 2023 fiscal year of €2,994 million was in line 
with the forecast figure of €3.0 billion."
"It also incurs expenses in 
US dollars and, to some extent, in currencies correlated with the US dollar, such as 
the Singapore dollar, the Malaysian ringgit and the Chinese renminbi."
"The impact of 
non-euro-denominated revenue and expenses does not always balance out."
"For this 
reason, fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the euro and the US dollar, 
influence the amounts reported for revenue and earnings."
"A stronger US dollar against 
the euro has a positive effect, whereas a weaker US dollar against the euro has an 
adverse effect on revenue and earnings."
"These figures are calculated on the assumption 
that the exchange rates of currencies – in which costs arise for Infineon – change in 
line with the euro/US dollar exchange rate."
"In terms of revenue, the impact of exchange 
rates is limited primarily to the euro/US dollar rate, where a deviation of 1 US cent  
in the actual exchange rate compared to the forecast rate would have an impact on 
revenue of around €25 million per quarter or around €100 million per fiscal year."
"Planning for the 2024 fiscal year is based on an assumed exchange rate of US$1.05  
to the euro."
"External growth prospects for the global economy  
and the semiconductor market
In the course of the 2023 fiscal year, the global economy continued to be affected  
by the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and high inflation."
"Due to  
significant rises in interest rates and difficult financing conditions as a result, economic 
activity slowed down considerably compared with the previous year."
"However, most 
countries have so far avoided going into recession."
"According to the forecasts of the  
International Monetary Fund (IMF), global economic growth in the 2023 calendar year 
 
 
will be around 2.5 percent, a somewhat higher figure than the 2.1 percent forecast  
in autumn 2022."
"Growth of 2.4 percent is forecast for the 2024 calendar year (
 R01)."
"This means that current growth rates for the global economy are remaining more  
or less stable, although they are below their historical average."
"Risks of a further 
weakening in the global economy also remain."
"Market analysts at Omdia expect Infineon’s reference market (i.e., the semiconductor 
market excluding DRAM and NAND flash memory chips and microprocessors) to see  
a slight decline of 1 percent in revenue in US dollar terms in the 2023 calendar year  
(
 R03)."
"Demand for semiconductors for automotive and industrial applications is 
again higher than average, whereas revenue from semiconductors in the consumer 
market segment and in the area of cellular infrastructure will decrease significantly."
"The experts at Omdia expect the Infineon reference market to grow by 6 percent in the 
2024 calendar year (
 R03)."
"The long-term trends decarbonization and digitalization 
are continuing to drive demand for semiconductors, especially in the automotive  
and industrial sectors."
"In the areas of consumer electronic goods and cellular infra-
structure, the forecast is for a noticeable recovery in revenue in the 2024 calendar 
year following the decline in revenue in the 2023 calendar year."
"Outlook for the 2024 fiscal year
The following outlook is based on current business developments and internal  
forecasts."
"This is equivalent to a 4 percent 
increase in revenue compared with the prior year."
"Revenue growth in the Automotive 
segment is expected to be in the low double-digit percentage range."
"Segment Result Margin of around 24 percent of revenue expected
If the middle of the range for the revenue forecast is reached, the Segment Result 
Margin is expected to be around 24 percent in the 2024 fiscal year."
"Free Cash Flow from continuing operations
For the 2024 fiscal year, Infineon is forecasting Free Cash Flow of around €0.4 billion."
"This figure includes net cash outflows for investments in the expansion of frontend 
manufacturing facilities in Dresden (Germany) and Kulim (Malaysia) and net cash  
outflows for the acquisition of GaN Systems."
"RoCE
For the 2024 fiscal year, Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) is forecast to reach 
around 13 percent."
"Investments and depreciation/amortization
Investments (defined by Infineon as the sum of investments in property, plant and 
equipment, investments in other intangible assets and capitalized development 
costs) are planned at around €3.3 billion for the 2024 fiscal year."
"Most of the investment relates to the construction and expansion of frontend  
manufacturing facilities."
"The main focus is on the completion of Phase 1 and the 
commencement of Phase 2 of the third fabrication facility at the Kulim site, which is 
designed to manufacture compound semiconductors, as well as on the construction 
of the fourth module in Dresden."
"Considerable funds are also being invested in acquiring equipment for the production 
of products based on silicon carbide and gallium nitride."
"Further amounts invested  
in frontend facilities will be used to implement structural measures, optimize product 
quality, increase the degree of automation and promote innovation."
"A significant amount of investment is also planned in order to expand capacity and 
implement structural measures at backend facilities, albeit at a much lower level 
than for frontend facilities."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, investments totaled €2,994 million, comprising €2,739 million 
for property, plant and equipment and €255 million for capitalized development 
costs and other intangible assets."
"In the 2024 fiscal year, investments in capitalized 
development costs and other intangible assets are expected to be at a slightly higher 
level than in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Depreciation and amortization are predicted to be around €2.1 billion in the  
2024 fiscal year."
"Approximately €0.4 billion relates to the amortization of purchase 
price allocations, mainly in connection with the acquisition of Cypress."
"Overall statement on expected developments  
at Infineon
Based on forecasts for the development of the global economy and the semicon­
ductor market in the 2024 calendar year, Infineon expects Group revenue to grow  
to €17 billion, plus or minus €500 million."
"The Segment Result Margin is forecast, at 
the middle of the range for the revenue forecast, to be around 24 percent of revenue."
Investments are expected to be at around €3.3 billion.
"Depreciation and amortization 
are expected to total about €2.1 billion."
"Free Cash Flow from continuing operations 
should reach around €0.4 billion."
"Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) is forecast to be 
around 13 percent."
"Competition to gain an 
innovative edge also occurs at the legal level, as evidenced, for example, by patents."
"Against this background, Infineon’s risk policy is aimed at quickly realizing the  
opportunities that arise in a way that increases its enterprise value."
"It also focuses  
on identifying risks early and actively mitigating them – particularly those risks that 
might pose a threat to Infineon’s going-concern status – by adopting appropriate 
countermeasures."
"Risk management at Infineon is therefore closely linked to corporate 
planning and the implementation of our strategy."
"The ultimate responsibility for  
risk management lies with the Infineon Management Board."
"Coordinated risk management and control system elements are in place that enable 
us to implement our risk policy."
"In addition to the Risk and Opportunity Management 
System (ERM) and the Internal Control System (ICS) described below, these elements 
include, in particular, the related forecasting, management and internal reporting 
processes as well as our Compliance Management System (CMS)."
"ERM and ICS systems 
The new IDW Auditing Standard 340 on the audit of the early risk detection system 
came into force on 1 January 2021."
"We therefore adapted our Risk and Opportunity 
Management System in the 2022 fiscal year to the methodology of the new standard."
"Significant changes involved implementing a risk-bearing capacity concept based on 
shareholders’ equity and improving risk aggregation by using Monte Carlo simulations."
"Furthermore, in addition to categorizing risks (classifying risk events into various  
thematic blocks) and setting threshold levels for risk tolerance, the review period for 
risk reporting (with regard to the degree of impact of the risks and opportunities) was 
amended."
"The review period is divided into three time segments: the impact in the 
current fiscal year, in the coming fiscal year, and a trend statement for years three to 
five."
"This adjustment of the risk assessment now enables us to calculate the risk-bearing 
capacity for the individual fiscal years."
"Infineon’s centralized ERM system is based on a Group-wide, management-oriented 
ERM approach, which aims to cover all relevant risks and opportunities."
"This approach 
is based on the “Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and Per­
formance” (2017) framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organi­
zations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)."
"The objective of the system is the early 
identification, assessment and management of risks and opportunities that could 
have a significant influence on Infineon’s ability to achieve its strategic, operational, 
financial, legal and compliance targets."
"Infineon’s Internal Control System is also 
based on a framework developed by COSO (“Internal Control – Integrated Framework” 
(2013))."
"This framework describes the various elements in a control system (the control 
environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, 
and monitoring) and sets out the basis for the evaluation of the appropriateness and 
effectiveness of the ICS."
"Responsibility for the identification, measurement, 
management and reporting of risks and opportunities, as well as for their mitigation 
and control, lies with the management of the organizational unit concerned."
"The Manage-
ment Board, in turn, reports regularly to the Supervisory Board’s Investment, Finance 
and Audit Committee on the developments and results of the ICS and ERM."
"Where 
necessary, standard processes are supplemented by ad hoc reporting of any major 
risks identified between the regular reporting dates."
"We define a risk or an opportunity as the occurrence of future uncertainties that 
could result in either a negative or a positive variance from the business plan."
"We 
incorporate all relevant organizational units within the Group in this analysis, thus 
covering all divisions, significant corporate functions and regions."
"Risks and opportunities under ERM are measured on a net basis by taking into 
account any existing management and mitigation measures."
"The time periods and 
measurement categories used are closely linked to our short-term and medium-term 
business planning and entrepreneurial targets."
"All relevant risks and opportunities are assessed uniformly across the Group in  
quantitative or qualitative terms, based on two factors: degree of impact on  
the Segment Result and/or on business objectives, reputation, compliance, and  
likelihood of occurrence."
"The scales used to measure these two factors (degree of impact and likelihood of 
occurrence) and the resulting risk assessment matrix for the presentation of risks  
for impact years 1 and 2 are depicted in chart 
 C13."
"The scale used to measure the 
degree of impact on the Segment Result has been adjusted in comparison with the 
previous year for the measurement of risks in the coming years to take account of the 
profitable growth and the increased size of Infineon’s business."
"Based on the potential degree of impact as well as the estimated likelihood of  
occurrence, a risk is classified as “very high”, “high”, “medium” or “low”."
1 Relating to a planning year.
"Interdisciplinary work-
shops held at division, corporate and regional levels support our risk and opportunity 
analysis and enhance our risk and opportunity management culture."
"Important  
information relevant for Infineon’s ICS and ERM is available to all employees via  
our intranet system, including access to our guidelines containing job descriptions 
for all functions involved in the process as well as all the information required for 
reporting purposes."
"Risk and Opportunity Managers are designated at appropriate hierarchy levels to 
manage and monitor identified risks and opportunities according to their relevance."
"They are responsible for formally determining a set of appropriate risk and opportunity 
management strategies (in the case of risks: avoidance, mitigation, control, transfer 
or acceptance)."
"Working closely with corporate functions and individual managers 
responsible for measures, the Risk and Opportunity Managers are also responsible 
for defining and monitoring the measures aimed at implementing the management/
control strategy."
"The active and specific management and monitoring of risks and 
opportunities are critical to the success of our system."
"Compliance with the ICS and ERM approaches is monitored by the corporate function 
responsible for risk management and ICS using procedures incorporated into business 
processes."
"Group Internal Audit also performs tests for compliance with certain legal 
requirements and Infineon guidelines and, where appropriate, rules relating to the 
ICS and ERM and recommends corrective measures."
"The Supervisory Board’s Investment, Finance and Audit Committee monitors the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of both systems (ICS and ERM)."
"Compliance Management System
We have implemented a Group-wide Compliance Management System (CMS) to  
manage compliance-related risks in a systematic, comprehensive and sustainable 
manner."
"We are continuously enhancing the key elements of our CMS to prevent, detect 
and respond to compliance-related incidents."
"The Corporate Compliance Officer 
reports to the Chief Financial Officer and, on a quarterly basis, to the Management 
Board and the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Since that time, 
adherence to the CMS in the respective legal entities has been monitored by regular 
internal audits."
"As part of the CMS, a formal annual assessment of our risks is conducted with  
a particular emphasis on corruption and antitrust laws."
"Any necessary measures 
derived from this assessment are summarized in Infineon’s compliance program."
"The ICS with respect to the financial reporting process, aims to 
minimize the risk of misstatement in Group accounting and external reporting and to 
provide reasonable assurance that the Consolidated Financial Statements comply 
with all relevant regulations."
"For this to be the case, Group-wide compliance with 
legal and internal regulations must be ensured."
"Clear responsibilities are assigned to 
each of the processes."
"The ICS with respect to the financial reporting process is also based on the framework 
developed by the COSO “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” (2013) and is  
part of the accounting process in all relevant legal entities and corporate functions."
"The system monitors compliance with policies and procedures using preventive  
and detective controls."
"Assessment of appropriateness and effectiveness 
We systematically assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS with 
respect to the financial reporting process."
"An annual risk analysis is initially performed, 
and the defined controls are revised as and when required."
"The assessment involves 
identifying and updating significant risks relating to accounting and financial reporting 
in the relevant legal entities and corporate functions."
"The controls defined for identi-
fying risks are documented in accordance with Group-wide guidelines."
"Regular random 
tests are performed to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of these controls."
"The tests constitute the basis for assessing the appropriateness of the design and 
effectiveness of the controls."
"The results are documented and reported in a global  
IT system."
"Any deficiencies identified are remedied, with due consideration given to 
their potential impact."
"Furthermore, all legal entities, divisions and relevant corporate functions confirm in  
a Representation Letter that all business transactions, all assets and liabilities, and  
all income and expense items have been duly recognized in the financial statements."
"At the end of the annual cycle, the main legal entities review and confirm the appro-
priateness and effectiveness of the ICS with respect to the financial reporting process."
"The Management Board and the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board are regularly informed about any significant control deficiencies 
identified in the ICS with respect to the financial reporting process and about the 
effectiveness of the internal controls in place."
"In addition, an overall statement on the appropriateness and effectiveness 
of our general ICS and ERM is produced once a year."
"This overall statement is based 
on reviews conducted by Internal Audit, voluntary external reviews and audits, and 
self-assessments."
"In all material respects, on the basis of the ICS and ERM activities conducted in the 
2023 fiscal year, no factors came to our attention that would give rise to doubt as to 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS and ERM system."
"Both the general ICS and ERM and the ICS with respect to the financial reporting  
process are continuously being developed and expanded to ensure compliance with 
internal and external requirements."
"Improvements made to these systems contribute 
to the ongoing monitoring of the relevant risk areas, including the responsible  
organizational units."
"Significant risks 
In the following section, we describe risks that could have a significant or material 
adverse impact on Infineon’s Segment Result and/or its business objectives, reputation 
or compliance."
"We divide these risks into four main risk categories: “Strategic risks”, 
“Operational risks”, “Financial risks” and “Legal and compliance risks”."
"Within these 
main risk categories are risk sub-categories."
"The order in which the various risk 
sub-categories are presented reflects their materiality to Infineon."
"This means that 
the most material risk sub-category is mentioned at the beginning, and the risk 
sub-categories are mentioned thereafter in descending order of materiality."
"The 
materiality of each risk is determined on the basis of the total risk score for impact in 
years 1 and 2."
"The risk score of an individual risk for impact in years 1 and 2 is calcu-
lated in each case by multiplying the likelihood of occurrence (on a scale of 1 – 5) by 
the degree of impact of the risk (on a scale of 1 – 5)."
"Unless otherwise stated, the risks 
described within the risk sub-categories apply across the divisions."
"The additional classification in “A”, “B” or “C” in brackets behind the respective title 
of the risk sub-category results from the described materiality for Infineon and 
enables a ranking of the risk sub-categories across the main risk categories."
"The risk 
sub-categories with the bracketed addition “A” represent the first quartile of materiality 
(highest risk sub-categories), “B” describes the second and third quartiles and “C”  
the fourth quartile."
"The classification in the quartiles represents a change compared 
to the classification in the previous year (high, medium, low)."
"Our target markets are therefore exposed to the risk of 
short-term market fluctuations."
"As a result, our forecasts of Infineon’s future business 
performance are subject to uncertainties."
"The absence of hitherto projected market 
growth or an unforeseen decline in market growth (related, for example, to the expan-
sion of renewables or electromobility) would make it considerably more difficult to 
attain our own growth target."
"We are countering this by entering into long-term sales 
contracts as well as service contracts that are not dependent on the cycle."
"We also 
address the fluctuations in economic conditions and customer demand that are typical 
of the semiconductor business by continuously monitoring vital early warning indi-
cators and, as far as possible, by adopting specific mitigation strategies."
"Examples of 
these strategies include making systematic adjustments to capacity and inventories 
at an early stage, introducing cost-cutting measures and making flexible use of  
external production facilities for both frontend and backend manufacturing."
"If we were unprepared for market fluctuations or the mitigation strategy we had 
adopted proved to be inappropriate, this could have a sustained adverse impact on 
Infineon’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations."
"Risks arising from increased market competition and  
commoditization of products
The spread of new technological developments in a global market also results in 
greater replaceability of products."
"Due to the resulting price competition, we may be 
unable to achieve our long-term strategic goals of gaining and/or maintaining market 
share and of product pricing."
"Moreover, accelerating M&A (merger and acquisition) 
activities within the semiconductor industry or government subsidies restricted  
to specific regions could result in even tougher competition."
"Potential benefits for  
 
competitors in this market include improved cost structures and more effective sales 
channels."
"There is also the risk that an increased volume of previously imported 
semiconductors will be manufactured in China and that a greater volume of those 
made in that country will be exported."
"Overall, this situation could have an adverse 
impact on Infineon’s results of operations."
"Corporate strategy risks (B)
Risks arising from an uncertain political and economic environment
As a globally operating company, our business is highly dependent on global economic 
developments."
"A worldwide economic downturn – particularly in the markets we 
serve – may result in not achieving our forecasted revenue and contribution to earn-
ings."
"Risks could also arise due to political and social changes, particularly when 
those changes occur in countries in which we manufacture and/or sell our products."
"Geopolitical risks in the 2023 fiscal year continue to be seen as very high, especially  
as a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the conflict over Taiwan and the tensions  
in the Middle East, which has significantly reduced the predictability of economic 
development."
"The war in Ukraine is giving rise to risks and adverse impacts, such as 
price increases and scarcity of energy and raw materials."
"Any escalation of the con-
flict beyond Ukraine would further increase the risk of a global economic downturn."
"Rising inflation and increases in interest rates may also lead to a significant decline in 
consumption."
"Furthermore, customs disputes, export controls and export bans for advanced tech-
nology and/or critical basic materials, as well as trade restrictions such as those 
between the USA and China, may constrain global trade, thereby dampening global 
economic growth."
"This includes the risk of a decline in foreign demand from a Chinese 
perspective and hence a decline in China’s gross domestic product."
"All of this may 
have a significant impact on Infineon’s liquidity and results of operations."
"Risks arising from acquisitions and cooperation arrangements (C)
In order to develop or expand our existing business, it may be appropriate for us  
to make further acquisitions or enter into other forms of partnership with external 
companies."
"In the case of acquisitions, there is a risk that we may be unsuccessful, 
particularly regarding the integration of employees and products in existing business 
structures."
"These issues could adversely impact Infineon’s financial condition and 
results of operations."
"Operational risks
Purchasing and logistical risks (B)
We cooperate with numerous suppliers who provide us with materials and services  
or manage parts of our supply chain for whom there are not always multiple alter-
natives."
"We therefore partly depend on the delivery capability of our suppliers and the  
quality of their supplies."
"At the same time, we face price increases from our suppliers, 
and there is a risk that it will not be possible to pass on these increases in full to  
our customers."
"In addition, the current conflict over Taiwan may affect the supply  
situation for our Taiwanese partners."
"Any failure of one or more of these suppliers  
to meet their obligations to Infineon could have an adverse impact on Infineon’s 
liquidity and results of operations."
"Another risk is the limited global availability of renewable energy, which could jeop-
ardize Infineon’s declared goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2030."
"Infineon has 
adopted a variety of measures to counter this risk (such as adopting its own efficiency 
 
 
measures, evaluating the construction of its own solar plants, and forming partnerships 
with local solar and wind farm operators)."
"In general, we seek to minimize procurement-related risks through our purchasing 
strategies and the use of appropriate product and cost analyses (“Best Cost Country 
Sourcing” and “Focus on Value”), as well as through geographical diversification."
"These programs include cross-functional teams of experts who are responsible for 
standardizing procurement processes for materials and technical equipment."
"This partner risk assessment addresses Infineon’s dependence  
on its ecosystem partners."
"As a result, the high-risk ecosystem partners throughout 
the Group are identified and continuously assessed."
"Additionally, corrective risk miti-
gation measures are implemented to avoid an adverse impact on Infineon’s financial 
condition, liquidity and results of operations and/or on its business objectives, repu-
tation and compliance."
"Risks arising from manufacturing (B)
Our South-East Asian and European manufacturing sites are of great importance for 
our production."
"Furthermore, our medium-term and long-term forecasts are based on expected  
manufacturing cost trends for our products."
"The dynamic markets and the increasing customer 
need for flexibility, combined with short-term adjustments to order quantities, could 
result in rising costs due to the underutilization of manufacturing capacities, higher 
inventory levels and unfulfilled commitments to suppliers."
"In addition, frontend and backend manufacturing processes need to be optimally 
synchronized to enable Infineon to develop and manufacture competitive, high-quality 
products designed to provide new technological solutions."
"In view of the rapid pace 
of technological change and the dynamics of customer requirements, we consider 
this coordination needs to be increasingly sophisticated."
"Failure to make the required 
progress in this area could result in quality problems, delays in product development 
or market rollout, as well as higher research and development expenses, and hence 
adversely impact Infineon’s liquidity and results of operations."
"Risks that semiconductor companies operating in-house manufacturing facilities  
typically face is that of construction delays at new manufacturing sites and delays  
in the ramping up of production volumes at those sites, or delays in the transfer of 
technology."
"One good example is the Automotive division, where customers’ product 
approval and testing processes can be conducted over an extended period of time, 
thus influencing our global manufacturing strategy as well as our short-term and 
medium-term capacity utilization."
"Failure to anticipate these changes in the manu-
facturing process in good time may result in capacity shortages and hence lower  
revenue or lead to idle costs due to underutilized capacity and therefore have an 
adverse impact on earnings."
"Moreover, our dependence on energy supplies for our production, as well as on  
various components (such as wafers), raw materials (including gold and copper) and 
specialty gases, exposes us to substantial price and supply risks."
"Price risks are also 
attributable in part to the prevailing rate of inflation."
"In such a situation, if we are 
unable to offset cost increases or pass them on to our customers, it could have an 
adverse impact on our liquidity and results of operations."
"In particular, a restriction of or interruption in the supply of natural gas for manufac-
turing sites in Europe could lead to significant disruptions to production."
"In some cases, we have used derivatives to hedge price risks with respect to the 
amount of gold wire and electricity required for the 2024 fiscal year."
"Risks relating to the areas of cyber security, information security 
and IT security (C)
The reliability and security of Infineon’s data, systems and networks are of crucial 
importance."
"At the same time, the world has seen a rise in threats in cyberspace."
"This 
increasingly applies to the use of IT systems to support business processes as well as 
supporting internal and external communications."
"In addition, cyber-attacks with industrial espionage intent and any related 
potential loss of intellectual property or patents pose risks that could jeopardize our 
investment in research and development and impair our long-term competitiveness."
"Infineon has had a global cyber security program in place for many years now to 
ensure that it is suitably protected and prepared for the constantly changing cyber 
security threat situation."
"A key element of this program is our Cyber & Information 
Security Management System (CISMS)."
"This system, which takes a structured approach, 
aims to identify and evaluate risks to our data, information systems, networks, products, 
solutions and services, to constantly improve our protective measures, processes and 
tools and to adapt them to the threat situation."
"Our CISMS covers all areas of Infineon’s 
business and is certified in accordance with international standards (including TISAX)."
"The effectiveness of the CISMS is continuously monitored in the course of regular 
internal and external audits."
"Risks relating to the development process and product lifecycle (C)
The ever-increasing complexity of technologies and products, shorter development 
cycles and dynamic customer demands can cause a great deal of tension in the  
field of product development."
"Buffer times built into processes to compensate for 
potential delays are reduced accordingly."
"If we are unable to execute our development 
plans, this could result in delays and increased development costs."
"This situation is exacerbated by the fact that some of our products are highly depen-
dent on the degree of commercial success achieved by individual customers in their 
own markets."
"Furthermore, there is the risk of losing future business and design wins 
if we are unable to deliver volumes above our contractual obligations if called upon 
by customers to do so."
"These factors could have an adverse impact on Infineon’s 
liquidity and results of operations."
"A structured project management system is in place to handle development projects, 
including those of a customer-specific nature."
"To help us identify potential project 
risks at an early stage and use specific measures to counter these risks, we require 
projects to have clear project milestones, ongoing verification procedures and clearly 
defined limits of approval authority."
Product quality assurance is of crucial importance.
"Shortfalls in product quality can 
lead to product recalls at our customers and related potential costs for liability claims."
"In addition, quality risks could also damage Infineon’s reputation and thus have a  
significant adverse impact on its future business, liquidity and results of operations."
"To avoid quality risks, we have adopted various quality management strategies such 
as “FMEA” (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) and “Six Sigma” in order to prevent  
or solve problems and to continue to improve all our business processes."
"Our Group-
wide quality management system has been certified for a number of years in accor-
dance with ISO 9001 and ISO/TS 16949 and also encompasses the development  
processes of our suppliers."
"Our processes and initiatives to ensure continuous improvement are aimed, among 
other things, at identifying and eliminating the causes of quality-related problems  
at an early stage."
"Risks relating to the availability of qualified employees (C)
One of the key factors in our success is qualified employees."
"There is a general risk  
of not being able to recruit enough people or people who are sufficiently qualified  
to work at Infineon, of losing existing qualified staff or failing to provide them with 
adequate training, and of not retaining people in the business."
"A lack of technical or 
management personnel could, among other things, restrict future growth and hence 
adversely impact Infineon’s liquidity and results of operations."

To counter these risks, Infineon has set up its own work group."
"The specific remit of 
this work group is employee recruitment, retention and training."
"We counter these risks on an individual site basis with appropriate mitigation mea-
sures, business interruption insurances and other business continuity structures,  
all of which are reviewed regularly by conducting stress tests to ensure their appro-
priateness and effectiveness."
"Financial risks
Currency risks (C)
The international orientation of our business activities creates cash flows in a num-
ber of currencies other than the euro, primarily in US dollars."
"A significant share of 
revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures is denominated in US dollars and 
correlated currencies."
"For the most part, Infineon generates a US dollar surplus from 
these transactions."
"Specified currencies are hedged Group-wide by means of derivative financial instru-
ments."
"These hedges are based on forecasts of future cash flows, the occurrence  
of which is uncertain."
"Under these circumstances and despite hedging measures, 
exchange rate fluctuations could adversely impact Infineon’s results of operations."
"Risk of default of banks and financing partners (C)
The relatively high level of our holdings of liquid funds (gross cash position) exposes 
us to the potential risk of a default of one or more of the banking and financing  
partners with whom we do business."
"We mitigate this risk – which could still arise  
despite various state-insured deposit protection mechanisms – by a combination of 
risk avoidance analyses and risk-spreading measures."
"The failure of these measures 
could have a materially adverse impact on Infineon’s financial condition and liquidity."
"Further information regarding the management of financial risks is provided in  
note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Other financial risks (C)
In principle, there is a risk that a breach in the financial covenants of capital market 
instruments (such as the net debt ratio) might lead to a credit event (default) and 
potentially to a cross-default, resulting in possible changes to existing or outstanding 
debts."
"However, this risk is currently considered to be very low."
"Nonetheless, regular 
monitoring of our projected Segment Result and of our liquidity and debt enables  
us to identify any aggravation of this risk at an early stage and to apply appropriate 
countermeasures."
"Tax risks (C)
Infineon could be exposed to tax risks arising from prior assessment periods and 
changes in tax legislation or jurisdiction."
"Unforeseen tax expenses might occur relating 
to prior assessment periods that have not yet been the subject of a tax audit or are 
currently the subject of a tax audit in the various countries in which Infineon operates."
"The realization of any of these risks could result in fines and penalties and therefore 
have an adverse impact on the Group’s financial condition, liquidity and results  
of operations."
Infineon adopts a number of strategies to mitigate these risks.
"These include,  
among others, regular employee training, a Tax Compliance Management System for 
selected sites, and internal audits to ensure adherence to important compliance  
regulations in all legal entities of the Group (Framework for Internal Controls in the 
Tax Process)."
"Potential 
consequences might include heavy financial penalties, compensation claims, the 
cost of external support (such as lawyers’ fees), damage to Infineon’s reputation and 
exclusion from tendering for public contracts."
"We have therefore introduced a Group-wide Compliance Management System (CMS) 
to manage these compliance-related risks in a systematic, comprehensive and sus-
tainable manner."
We continue to refine the key elements of our CMS.
"One of the ways 
we are doing this is by providing specific employee training designed to prevent, 
detect and react to compliance-related incidents."
"The Corporate Compliance Officer 
reports on a regular basis to the Chief Financial Officer, the Management Board as  
a whole and the Investment, Finance and Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"This could have an impact on 
Infineon’s results of operations or could influence the availability of export permits."
"The central Export Control department is responsible for the implementation of 
effective measures relating to export control legislation and foreign trade to avoid 
sanctions and fines being imposed on Infineon."
"To prevent divergence from the  
relevant regulations, Infineon has introduced organizational measures (such as  
appointing local managers responsible for export control) and implemented training  
measures for all the employees concerned."
"It is also using Group-wide approval  
routines in all relevant processes, conducting internal audits of export control and 
implementing other control measures."
"Data protection risks
In principle, there is a risk that there could be a violation of laws and regulations 
relating to the processing and use of personal data, which could lead to data breaches, 
resulting in severe penalties and/or reputational damage."
"The Data Protection  
Management System (DPMS) established by Infineon to mitigate this risk sets out 
rules and standards for the Group-wide processing of personal data and monitors 
compliance with these rules and standards."
"Other legal risks (C)
Risks arising from the Qimonda insolvency
The insolvency proceedings relating to Qimonda and the resulting actions of the 
insolvency administrator expose Infineon to potential risks, which are described in 
detail in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
Provisions are recognized in connection with these matters as of 30 September 2023.
"The provisions reflect the amount of those liabilities that management believes are 
probable and can be estimated with reasonable accuracy as of that date."
"There can 
be no assurance that these provisions will be sufficient to cover all liabilities that may 
be incurred in conjunction with the insolvency proceedings relating to Qimonda."
"Risks relating to intellectual property rights and patents
As with many other companies in the semiconductor industry, allegations are made 
against us from time to time that we have infringed upon other parties’ protected 
rights."
"Regardless of the prospects of success of such claims, substantial legal defense 
costs can arise."
"Any such outcome could, in turn, have an adverse impact on Infineon’s 
financial condition, liquidity and results of operations."
"One of the ways in which we counter patent-related risks is by adopting a specific 
patent strategy."
"This includes patent searches in relation to development projects, 
the systematic registration of our own patents and patent cross-licensing arrange-
ments with major competitors."
"However, no such opportunities exist to safeguard 
against risks of this nature in the case of companies specializing in the exploitation  
of patent rights."
"Further information regarding litigation and government inquiries is provided in  
note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Risks arising from our global operations
Our global business strategy requires the maintenance of research and development 
locations and manufacturing sites throughout the world."
"The location of such facilities 
is determined by market entry hurdles and by technology and cost factors."
"Risks 
could therefore arise if economic and geopolitical crises were to impact our regional 
markets and if country-specific legislation and regulations were to influence invest-
ment activities and the ability to trade freely."
"Differing practices in the way tax, judicial 
and administrative regulations are interpreted could also restrict business activities."
"In addition, we could also be exposed to the risk of fines, sanctions and reputational 
damage."
Asian markets are particularly important to our long-term growth strategy.
"Our  
operations in China are influenced by a legal system that may be subject to change."
"One example is the fact that local regulations could make it mandatory to enter into 
partnerships with local companies."
"Overall statement by Group management  
on the risk situation 
The overall risk assessment is based on a consolidated view of all significant  
individual risks."
"The risk situation as a whole remains essentially unchanged from  
the previous year."
"We are currently not aware of any individual risks capable of  
jeopardizing Infineon’s going-concern status."
"Significant opportunities 
Opportunities arising from decarbonization, digitization and the strategic approach 
“Product to System” have already been included in the forecast report and are 
described here as additional overarching opportunities."
"The classification into “A”, “B” or “C” in brackets after the respective title of the 
opportunity is carried out in the same way as the classification for the risks."
"Opportunities arising from decarbonization and the acceleration  
of the energy transition 
With a constantly growing world population and increasing industrialization, global 
demand for energy is rising."
"Electric power is becoming the most important energy 
form of the 21st century, while renewables are playing a key role in curbing carbon 
emissions."
"The long-term objective is to achieve global decarbonization by the end  
of the century, as resolved at the Climate Change Conference held in Paris (France)  
in December 2015."
"As part of its Green Deal concept, the European Union intends to 
become carbon-neutral by 2050."
"To achieve this target, it will be necessary to develop renewable sources of energy  
at a faster rate than originally envisaged."
"This should lead to an increase in demand 
for our products, as Infineon’s semiconductors enable electric power to be generated 
more efficiently from renewable energy sources."
"Indeed, they offer efficiency gains  
at all stages of the energy industry’s conversion chain, whether in generation, trans-
mission, storage or, above all, in the use of electric power."
"They form the basis for the 
intelligent and efficient use of electric power, for instance, in industrial applications, 
power supplies for computers, consumer electronics and vehicles."
"This 
is reflected in the optimization of internal processes, such as for our interconnected 
manufacturing lines on a global scale, as well as in sales and administration."
"Further-
more, our portfolio of sensors, microcontrollers, power semiconductors, security chips 
and security solutions, as well as specific software, puts us in an excellent position  
to successfully exploit growing market potential."
"The strategic approach “Product  
to System” we have already implemented makes us very well prepared to penetrate  
and develop the markets involved."
"Good examples already apparent today include 
automated driving, the smart home and the advancing development of the IoT."
"Additional opportunities are arising from accelerated and/or broader market pene-
tration by digital products."
"In this context, the issue of “security and data integrity” 
plays a very important role."
"We are able to address this issue by offering our customers 
appropriate security chips and security solutions."
"Opportunities arising from our strategic approach “Product to System” 
With the strategic approach “Product to System”, we seek to identify additional  
benefits for our customers at a system level from within our broad portfolio of tech-
nologies and products."
"This strategy enables us to exploit further revenue growth 
potential, reduce customers’ development costs and shorten the lead times required 
to bring their products to market and thereby support our growth and margin targets."
"The principal opportunities are described in the following section, divided into  
“Strategic opportunities”, “Operational opportunities” and “Financial opportunities”, 
which are to be seen in addition to the future business prospects mentioned in the 
forecast report."
"However, these represent only a selection of the opportunities avail-
able to Infineon."
Our assessment of opportunities is also subject to continual change.
"This reflects the fact that our business, our markets and the technologies we deploy 
are constantly subject to new developments, bringing with them fresh opportunities 
and causing others to become less relevant or otherwise changing the significance  
of an opportunity from our perspective."
"Opportunities arising from the growth of semiconductor content in vehicles 
We expect semiconductor content per vehicle to continue growing."
"The primary  
driving force behind this trend is the rising demand for electromobility, active safety 
and comfort features, and driver assistance systems."
"We are convinced that current global carbon emissions targets cannot be achieved 
without further electrification."
"The need for increased efforts in this field is relevant 
not only for electromobility (i.e., hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles)  
but also for power units in vehicles with combustion engines."
"Moreover, the trend 
towards automated and assisted driving offers great potential for our sensors and 
microcontrollers."
"Opportunities arising from new technologies and materials 
We are constantly striving to develop new technologies, products and solutions and 
to improve on existing ones, both separately and in collaboration with customers."
"We therefore continually invest in areas such as research and development into  
the use of new technologies and materials."
"Those in current use may well lose their 
predominance in the foreseeable future (such as Si, which is reaching its physical  
limits in some applications)."
"We therefore see numerous opportunities for working with new materials, such as 
SiC and GaN, to develop more powerful and/or lower-cost products."
"These materials 
could well have a positive influence on our ability to attain our strategic growth and 
profitability targets."
"In particular, high rates of growth for electric-powered vehicles make 
China one of the largest markets for electromobility."
The expansion of renewable energy sources in China has also become hugely important.
"Our presence in this market, alongside our collaboration with leading companies in 
the wind and solar power sectors, will create further opportunities for long-term growth."
"Operational opportunities 
Opportunities relating to our ability to meet supply requirements 
with available capacity (C)
Our in-house manufacturing capacities, together with those of our external partners, 
provide us with a degree of flexibility to meet demand."
"Furthermore,  
additional production capacity, including external capacity, can help to meet future 
customer demand."
"Financial opportunities
Currency opportunities (B)
Just as there are risks arising from currencies, as described in the risk section above, 
there are also opportunities for Infineon in this area if exchange rates move in a way 
that is favorable to the Group."
"This may have a positive impact on Infineon’s financial 
condition, liquidity and results of operations."
"Other opportunities arising from Infineon’s liquidity situation (C)
Our current liquidity position, which is described in detail in the chapter “Review of 
liquidity”
,   p."
"55 ff., provides us with the financial headroom for organic growth and 
growth by acquisition and enables us to make use of favorable refinancing conditions, 
if necessary."
"Infineon Technologies AG is the parent company of Infineon and performs the Group’s 
management and corporate functions."
"Furthermore, it manages supply 
chain processes throughout the Group."
"Infineon Technologies AG also has its own 
manufacturing facilities, located in Regensburg and Warstein (both in Germany)."
"Unlike the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the Separate Financial Statements 
of Infineon Technologies AG are prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"The complete Separate Financial Statements are 
published separately."
"Gross profit rose accordingly by 
23 percent to €3,971 million (2022: €3,238 million)."
"Operating expenses (research  
and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses) increased 
in the 2023 fiscal year at a lower rate than revenue, by €226 million to €2,453 million 
(2022: €2,227 million), thus comprising 24.9 percent of revenue (2022: 28.1 percent)."
"The net figure for other income/expenses improved, primarily as a result of currency 
fluctuations, especially with regard to the US dollar exchange rate."
"There was also an 
improvement in the interest result, due in particular to the positive performance of 
the plan assets for pensions and similar commitments."
"The improvement in earnings 
before tax of €928 million resulted in an increase in the income tax expense of 
€154 million."
"The net profit of Infineon Technologies AG in the 2023 fiscal year was €1,420 million, 
following a net profit of €646 million in the previous fiscal year."
"After transferring a total 
of €710 million to retained earnings, unappropriated profit amounted to €710 million."
"Non-current assets rose by €1,041 million, 
mainly due to an increase in loans to affiliated companies."
"Current assets increased 
by €1,186 million as a result of the higher volume of business."
"Receivables and other 
assets rose by €627 million and inventories by €614 million."
"Offsetting these increases 
was the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of €55 million 
to €3,347 million (30 September 2022: €3,402 million)."
"Cash and cash equivalents  
and marketable securities accounted for 39 percent of current assets."
"The increase in equity of €1,048 million was mainly due to the net profit for the  
2023 fiscal year of €1,420 million, offset by the dividend paid out for the 2022 fiscal year 
of €417 million."
"Provisions for pensions and similar commitments decreased by a total of €14 million, 
due to an increase in the value of the plan assets that exceeded the increase in  
the settlement amount."
"Other provisions rose by €203 million, mainly due to the 
increase of €128 million in tax provisions."
"Liabilities increased in the 2023 fiscal year  
by €988 million to €10,608 million, mainly due to the development of liabilities  
to affiliated companies as a result of the higher volume of business."
"The equity ratio at 30 September 2023 was 47.2 percent, the same figure as of the  
end of the previous year."

"The conditions of both the Performance Share Plan and the Restricted Stock Unit Plan, 
in which Infineon managers and other selected employees worldwide participate, 
contain rules that are triggered in the event of a defined change of control."
"For the 
most part, these rules specify that the vesting periods that are envisaged by the  
relevant plans are aborted in the event of a change of control."
"Although Management 
Board members also participate in the Performance Share Plan, the rules therein 
relating to a change of control do not apply to Management Board members, given 
that their service contracts take precedence."

"2  Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements presented here include the individual financial 
statements of Infineon Technologies AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries on  
a consolidated basis."
"A subsidiary is defined as an entity, that is directly or indirectly, 
controlled by Infineon Technologies AG."
"Control exists when Infineon is subjected to variable returns arising from its engage-
ment with the subsidiary or has a right to such and has the ability to influence these 
returns as a result of its power over the subsidiary."
"Power means that Infineon has 
existing rights that give Infineon the ability to direct the relevant activities of the  
subsidiary, that is the activities that significantly affect the aforementioned returns."
"An entity is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on 
which Infineon acquires control."
"Upon first-time consolidation of an entity, the 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities are basically measured on the basis of their 
fair value at the acquisition date."
"Any excess of consideration paid (purchase price) 
over the share of the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
is recognized as goodwill."
"Any excess of Infineon’s share of the fair value of items 
acquired over consideration paid is, after re-examination, recognized as a gain."
"The financial statements of entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
are prepared using uniform valuation and accounting policies."

end of the reporting period."
"Income and expenses of these entities are translated 
using the average spot rate of the reporting period."
"All currency translation differences 
are recognized directly in equity and presented as “Other reserves”."
"Recognition and measurement principles 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and all financial resources with a maturity 
at acquisition date of three months or less."
"Cash equivalents partly include invest-
ments in money market funds."
"The valuation is recorded at amortized acquisition cost 
or at fair value through profit or loss."
"Financial instruments
Financial instruments are initially recognized at their fair value."
"Transaction costs 
directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of financial instruments are only 
included in the carrying amount if the financial instruments are not measured at fair 
value through profit or loss."
"Trade receivables are recognized based on the amount to which Infineon has an 
unconditional right to receive."
"With the exception of matters that result in a partial 
refund of the purchase price to the customer, this corresponds to the transaction 
price determined in accordance with IFRS 15."
"The subsequent measurement of trade 
receivables is carried out at amortized cost."
Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the settlement date.
"Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive payments from the 
investments have expired or have been transferred and Infineon has transferred all 
risks and rewards associated with ownership."
"Financial liabilities are derecognized 
when they are extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is discharged, 
canceled, or expired."
"This classification depends on the characteristics of  
the contractual cash flows of the financial assets and Infineon’s business model for 
managing its financial assets."
"Infineon’s business model for managing financial asset portfolios reflects how the 
company controls its financial assets in order to generate cash flows."
"Depending  
on the business model, cash flows arise from the receipt of contractual cash flows, 
the sale of financial assets or both."
"In order for a financial asset in the form of a debt instrument to be classified and 
measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
cash flows may only arise from the repayment of principal and interest payments on 
the outstanding principal amount."
"This assessment is referred to as a cash flow or 
SPPI test (“solely payments of principal and interest”) and is carried out at the level 
of the individual financial instrument."
"In subsequent periods, financial assets measured at amortized cost are  
measured using the effective interest method."
"Interest income, currency gains and  
losses, impairments, and gains or losses from the derecognition of such financial 
assets are recognized through profit or loss."
"As of the reporting date, Infineon did not hold any financial assets with the intention 
to collect contractual cash flows and sell them."
"Therefore, there was no allocation  
of financial assets in the form of debt instruments to the category “fair value through 
other comprehensive income”."
"Financial assets in the form of debt instruments that are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss include all financial assets of Infineon whose cash flows are not 
solely payments of principal and interest."
"At Infineon, financial assets in the form of equity instruments are consistently  
measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"Net gains and losses, including interest and dividend income, from financial assets 
that are measured at fair value through profit or loss (debt and equity instruments) 
are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss."
“Designated hedging instruments (cash flow hedges)” also belong to financial assets.
"›	 Impairment of financial assets
Infineon determines an allowance for expected credit losses for financial assets in  
the form of debt instruments that are measured at amortized cost or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income."
"The calculation of the expected future credit 
losses is generally determined by multiplying the probability of default by the carry-
ing amount of the financial asset (exposure at default) and the expected loss ratio 
(loss given default)."
"The 
expected credit losses are adjusted at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit 
risk since the instrument was first recognized."
"For cash and cash equivalents and financial investments measured at amortized cost, 
Infineon determines credit losses expected in the next twelve months (twelve-month 
expected credit loss) in accordance with the general approach."
"Due to their short-term 
maturity, this corresponds to the lifetime expected credit losses."
"Infineon rates the 
credit risk for cash and cash equivalents and financial investments as low."
"Infineon 
assumes that a financial asset has a low credit risk if it has an investment grade rating 
or a corresponding internal investment grade rating."
"In order to assess whether  
there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, Infineon 
considers appropriate and robust information that is relevant and available without 
disproportionately high levels of effort."
"This includes both quantitative and qualitative 
information and analyses, which are based on the company’s historical experience 
and a sound credit assessment as well as forward-looking information."
"Macroeconomic 
information is taken into account in the internal rating model (information on Infineon’s 
financial risk management is included in note 28,   p."
"Irrespective of the  
above analysis, a significant increase in credit risk is assumed if a debtor is more  
than 30 days overdue with the settlement of a contractual payment."
"For trade receivables and contract assets, Infineon recognizes lifetime expected 
credit losses using a simplified approach."
"The estimate of expected credit losses on 
trade receivables and contract assets is based primarily on the analysis of customer 
financial data, ratings, credit default spreads, past payment behavior of customers 
and forward-looking information."
"In the case of objective indications that expected future cash flows are affected, a 
financial asset is classified as credit-impaired and adjusted to its individual value."
"As 
a rule, this is the case for financial assets (unless it is a trade receivable) no later than 
90 days after the due date."
"Trade receivables are not automatically determined as 
credit-impaired in the event of a payment overdue by more than 90 days but always 
on the basis of the individual assessment of credit management."
"A default event occurs when Infineon concludes that the other party would most 
likely not be able to meet the payment obligations, or not in full."
"Financial assets are partly or completely written off, together with previously  
recognized impairments, if there is no reasonable expectation of repayment."
"This is 
generally the case when Infineon finds that the debtor does not have assets or revenue 
sources that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to 
derecognition."
"Even when financial assets are written off, Infineon continues to con-
duct enforcement measures to recover them."
"Amounts recovered are recognized in 
profit or loss."
"Financial liabilities
Infineon classifies financial liabilities into the following categories: “Financial liabili-
ties measured at fair value through profit and loss” and “Other financial liabilities”."
"Furthermore, “Designated hedging instruments (cash flow hedges)” belong to financial 
liabilities."
"Liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss by Infineon include derivatives 
to hedge currency risks for which hedge accounting is not applied."
"In subsequent periods, they are measured at amor-
tized cost using the effective interest method."
"The liabilities are derecognized when 
the contractual obligations are discharged, canceled or expired."
"Derivative financial instruments are measured at their fair value and included in 
“other current assets” or “other current liabilities”."
"The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, 
determined in accordance with IFRS 9, that are designated as cash flow hedges  
and are part of hedging relationships that meet the criteria for hedge accounting is 
recognized directly in equity."
"The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is  
recognized in profit or loss."
"Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in profit or 
loss in the periods in which the underlying hedged item affects profit or loss, or, if the 
expected transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, 
included in the acquisition cost upon initial recognition."
"When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedging relationship no  
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing at 
that time remains in equity until the underlying transaction actually occurs."
"When a 
forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that 
was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit or loss."
"Hybrid bonds
The recognition of a hybrid bond depends on the specific form of the instrument."
"A hybrid bond is measured and recognized in equity when certain conditions are 
jointly met."
"These include, but are not limited to, the fact that the hybrid bond has no 
final maturity date, the investors have no rights of termination, and the distributions 
are made at Infineon’s discretion."
"In this case, discounts, transaction costs, tax effects 
and the remuneration of hybrid investors are deducted directly from equity."
"Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of historical acquisition or fully absorbed  
production cost – calculated using the weighted-average method – and net realizable 
value."
"Net realizable value corresponds to realizable sale proceeds under normal 
business conditions less estimated expected costs to complete and sell."
"Production 
cost comprises costs of material, production wages and an appropriate portion of 
attributable overheads, along with attributable depreciation and amortization on 
property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets."
"Overhead mark-ups are 
determined on the basis of normal capacity utilization levels."
"Write-downs to net realizable value are recorded on inventories using a consistent 
approach throughout Infineon and are determined at product level for technically 
obsolete and slow-moving inventories on the basis of the amount of revenues 
expected to be generated by the relevant product."
"Inventories include an asset resulting from sales with a right of return, representing 
Infineon’s right to recover products from customers upon payment of the reimburse-
ment obligation (see “Revenue recognition”,   p."
"The valuation is made by  
reference to the previous book value of the products."
"Loss allowances for expected credit losses on contract assets are determined in 
accordance with the measurement method for trade receivables (see “Financial 
instruments”,   p."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are measured at amortized acquisition or construction 
cost, and their value is reduced by depreciation and considering any impairment."
"Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recorded using the straight-line 
method."
"Land, property rights and construction in progress are not depreciated  
on a scheduled basis."
"These assets have finite useful lives and are valued at their amortized acquisition  
or production costs, with amortization recorded using the straight-line method over 
their expected economic life."
"Regardless of whether an indication of impairment exists, goodwill and 
other intangible assets, including capitalized development costs not yet subject to 
amortization, undergo an annual impairment test (see also “Research and develop-
ment expenses”,   p."
"The impairment test for goodwill is carried out annually  
at the operating segment level."
"To the extent it is not possible to determine the recoverable 
amount of an individual asset, the book value of the cash generating unit to which 
the asset is allocated is compared to its recoverable amount."
"A cash generating unit (“CGU”) represents the smallest identifiable group of assets 
that generates cash inflows from continuing activities and that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets."
"Goodwill arising in connection with a business combination is allocated to the CGUs 
or groups of CGUs that will benefit from the synergies generated by the business 
combination and the going concern element of the business operations acquired."
"The recoverable amount of an asset is defined as the higher of its fair value less costs  
to sell and its value in use."
"The value in use is calculated based on discounted future 
cash flows."
"Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future  
cash flows."
"If an asset or CGU is considered to be impaired, the impairment recognized is measured 
as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount."
"Goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the operating segment to which 
goodwill is allocated exceeds the recoverable amount of that unit."
"If the carrying amount of the respective operating segment to which goodwill  
is allocated exceeds the recoverable amount of this CGU, the goodwill is impaired 
accordingly."
"In the case of property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets, if the recover-
able amount of a CGU is less than its carrying value, the impairment loss is allocated 
pro rata to the assets within the scope of IAS 36."
"An impairment loss recognized in 
prior periods for property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets is reversed 
insofar as, since the last impairment, a change in the underlying assumptions has 
occurred, which leads to a lower impairment requirement."
"The maximum possible 
reversal of an impairment loss is that which would lead to the carrying amount that 
would have been determined (net of scheduled depreciation and amortization) if  
no impairment loss had been recognized for that asset in prior years."
"The reversal of 
impairments recognized on goodwill in subsequent periods is not permitted."
"Leased assets
IFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to use an identifiable asset 
over a specified period of time in exchange for consideration."
"At the beginning of a lease, Infineon capitalizes a right-of-use asset at amortized 
acquisition cost and recognizes as a liability a corresponding lease liability, using the 
present value of the outstanding lease payments."
"Right-of-use assets are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life (see “Property, plant and equip-
ment”,   p."
"101), or over the duration of the contract if shorter."
"In subsequent valua-
tions, lease liabilities are measured at the current value of the outstanding lease  
payments using the effective interest method and are presented as lease liabilities 
(current and non-current)."
"As  
a general rule, leased assets with an acquisition cost of up to €5,000 are defined as  
low-value assets."
"The present value of the DBO 
and the resulting pension expense are determined annually in accordance with IAS 19 
“Employee Benefits” for each separate plan by independent, qualified actuaries 
using the projected unit credit method."
"The calculation is subject to, among other 
things, assumptions on increases in salaries, future developments in pensions as well 
as the life expectancy of the beneficiaries."
"As of the balance sheet date, the obligations 
are discounted using discount rates determined primarily on the basis of market 
yields of high-grade, fixed-interest corporate bonds from issuers carrying a very high 
credit rating."
"All items of income and expense relating to defined benefit plans, with the exception 
of the net interest result, are recognized on a net basis in the functional costs within 
the operating result."
"The net interest result arising from the multiplication of the  
net pension obligation (pension obligation less plan assets) by the discount rate is 
presented as a financial expense."
Past service costs are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
"Other provisions
Other provisions are recognized for present legal and/or constructive obligations  
arising from past events that are likely to result in a future outflow of resources, the 
amount of which can be reliably estimated."
"With regard to legal proceedings and litigation, for example, those connected with the 
Qimonda insolvency, Infineon regularly assesses the probability of an unfavorable 
outcome."
"Infineon records provisions and liabilities, including provisions for signifi-
cant legal costs, for those obligations and risks relating to legal disputes which it 
assesses at the relevant reporting date are likely to occur."
"That is where, from Infineon’s 
perspective as of the date of assessment, there is compelling evidence that indicates 
an obligation or risk, and the obligation or risk can be quantified with reasonable 
accuracy at the time of assessment."
"As soon as additional information is available, 
the affected estimates are reviewed and, where necessary, provisions for these pro-
ceedings are revised."
Other provisions are measured at their expected settlement amount.
"The amount 
recognized for a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the present obligation."
"Estimates of outcomes and financial effects are dependent 
upon the judgment of management, supplemented by experience gained from similar 
transactions and, where appropriate, the assessment of independent experts."
"If the 
circumstances to be assessed encompass a large number of possible outcomes,  
the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their associated 
probabilities (expected value method)."
"Where cash flows are expected to arise after the next twelve months, the expected 
settlement amount corresponds to the present value of the expected cash outflows."
Discounting is only carried out if the interest effect is significant.
"If the obligation decreases because of a change in the estimate, the provision is 
adjusted accordingly and the resulting income recognized in the same functional  
cost area of the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in which the original charge 
was recognized."
"Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the Statement of Financial Position, instead 
they are disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (see note 23, 
 p."
"135 f., and note 24,   p."
"Revenue recognition
Infineon generates revenues mainly from the sale of semiconductor products, related 
system solutions and relevant software."
"Revenue is recognized when control over the 
products is transferred to the customers in accordance with IFRS 15 (power of disposal), 
and where the receipt of consideration from the customer is probable."
"Typically, 
Infineon’s customer contracts only contain one performance obligation which is ful-
filled either over a period of time or at a specific point in time, with fulfillment at a 
specific point in time being the far more common case."
"For sales of customer-specific 
products with no alternative use for Infineon, for which Infineon has a legal right to 
payment for services rendered prior to delivery, revenue is recognized over time."
"Per-
formance progress is determined using an input-based method and is based on the 
ratio of costs already incurred to the estimated total cost."
"If product revenue is not 
recognized over time, then it is generally recognized upon delivery."
"The recognition 
of revenue for deliveries into consignment warehouses depends on the individual 
contractual arrangement."
"Revenue recognition at the point of delivery into the con-
signment warehouse takes place in cases where the customers gain contractual 
power of control over the products at the point of delivery."
"Accordingly, in such cases, 
a contract asset is recorded."
"Otherwise, revenue is recognized when the products are 
withdrawn by the customer."
"Invoices for sales of products are issued at the time of delivery or withdrawal by  
the customer from the consignment warehouse and have a short payment term."
"The amount of revenue corresponds to the expected transaction price to be settled 
by the customer."
The transaction price can include variable components such as rebates or discounts.
"Infineon can reliably estimate these in accordance with the contractual agreements 
and historical experience."
"Variable consideration is only taken into account in so  
far as it is highly probable that there will be no significant reversal of the revenue."
"If Infineon expects that the consideration received from the customer is to be partially 
reimbursed due to subsequent discounts, a reimbursement obligation is recognized 
as a reduction to revenue, and is disclosed within other current liabilities."
"Infineon recognizes revenue for deliveries to distributors by using the “sell in” method, 
that is, when a product is delivered, to the extent that revenue has not already been 
recognized over time."
"The transaction price for sales to distributors, in particular, 
contains variable components."
"In accordance with established business practices in 
the semiconductor industry, distributors can request price adjustments under certain 
circumstances."
"This allows distributors to receive a credit (debit) note for unsold 
products held in inventory, where Infineon has reduced (increased) the standard list 
price of certain products."
"In addition, in certain cases and for certain products, dis-
tributors may request what is referred to as a ship and debit credit note."
"As with all 
product sales, Infineon recognizes revenue based on the transaction price and records 
an obligation for the estimated consideration to be reimbursed to the customer during 
the period in which the relevant revenue is recognized."
"In the case of price adjustments 
and ship and debit, the determination of the transaction price, and thus also the 
refund obligation, is based on rolling historical price trends in the difference between 
contract prices and standard list prices to the distributors."
"The refund liability is  
disclosed as part of other current liabilities."
"The estimation of the transaction price is 
based on the expected stock returns in accordance with the contractual agreement, 
combined with historical experience."
"Distributor scrap allowances are taken into 
account based on the contractual agreement when determining the transaction price 
and, upon submission of a valid claim, are granted up to a certain maximum based 
on turnover in a given period."
"Infineon monitors such product returns on an ongoing 
basis and adjusts estimate assumptions accordingly."
"In the case of stock returns and 
scrap allowances, the consideration to be refunded to the customer is recognized as 
a reimbursement obligation within other current liabilities."
"Other returns are only 
permitted for quality defects within the ordinary warranty period."
"These obligations 
are taken into consideration through corresponding warranty provisions."
"The additional costs to obtain a contract are immediately recognized as an expense 
as soon as they arise, providing the otherwise resulting depreciation period would 
not exceed one year."
"Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized at the earliest when an 
expected, specifically identifiable contract exists."
"Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold includes the manufacturing costs of products sold during the 
reporting period."
"In addition, cost of goods sold contains idle costs, inventory risks, 
the cost of warranty cases, as well as the amortization of capitalized development 
costs."
"Recognized currency translation effects, as well as changes in the fair value of 
undesignated derivative financial instruments that are connected to the operating 
business, are recognized in cost of goods sold."
"Research and development expenses
Costs of research activities are expensed as incurred."
"Costs for development activities 
are capitalized if the results lead to a plan or design for the production of new or sub-
stantially improved products or for improved production processes."
"Capitalization 
requires that the development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process 
is technically and commercially feasible, and future economic benefits are probable."
"In addition, Infineon must intend, and have the ability, to complete development and 
use or sell the asset."
"The costs capitalized include the cost of materials, direct labor 
and directly attributable general overhead expenses that serve to prepare the asset 
for use."
"Such capitalized costs are presented as internally generated intangible assets 
within “Other intangible assets” (see note 13,   p."
"Development costs, that  
do not fulfill the criteria for capitalization, are expensed as incurred."
"Capitalized 
development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment 
charges."
"Grants
Grants are recognized when it is reasonably assured that Infineon will comply with 
the conditions attached to the grant, and it is reasonably assured that the grant  
will be received."
"Investment-related grants are deducted from the purchase and pro-
duction cost of the related asset and thereby reduce depreciation and amortization 
expense in future periods."
"Grants that are related to expenses are presented as a reduction of the related 
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss (see note 4,   p."
"Deferred taxes are calculated on temporary differences between the tax base and  
the book value of assets and liabilities and on tax losses available for carry-forward 
and tax allowances."
"By contrast, generally no deferred tax is recognized on initial  
recognition of goodwill arising in connection with a business combination."
"Similarly, 
deferred taxes are not recognized on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
connection with a transaction that is not a business combination and which, at the 
time of the transaction, affects neither the pre-tax income according to IFRS nor tax-
able profit."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using applicable tax rates 
and laws that have been enacted by the end of the reporting period or are about  
to be enacted and are to be applied when the related deferred tax asset is realized,  
or the deferred tax liability is settled."
"Infineon reviews deferred tax assets for impairment at every 
reporting date."
"The assessment requires management to make assumptions about 
future taxable profits as well as other positive and negative influencing factors."
"This 
assessment also takes into account insights from the company’s five-year plan as 
approved in the fiscal year just ended."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are netted to the extent they relate to the same tax 
authority and to the same taxpayer or a group of different taxpayers who are jointly 
assessed for income tax purposes."
"Taxes are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss, with the  
exception of taxes relating to items recognized directly in equity or in other compre-
hensive income."
"Tax liabilities are recognized as short-term as they are due immediately, and Infineon 
generally has no option of deferring their due date."
"For uncertain tax positions, a current tax liability is recorded; in the case of a tax  
loss carried forward or a tax allowance, the respective deferred tax asset is reduced 
accordingly."
"The detection 
risk for the recognition of uncertain tax positions is not relevant."
"Recognition assumes 
that the tax authorities investigate the matters in question and that they have all  
relevant information."
"Estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the presented amounts 
and the associated disclosures."
"Estimates and assumptions are subject to regular review and must be adjusted where 
appropriate."
"Climate risks and opportunities are also analyzed, reported, and evalu-
ated for their potential financial and accounting impact as part of the quarterly risk 
management process."
"They are regularly included in the review of estimates and 
assumptions for accounting purposes."
"The reference to the report “Sustainability at 
Infineon” is not audited as part of the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
but is subject to a separate audit to obtain limited assurance and for certain non- 
financial information reasonable assurance."
"Assumptions and estimates regarding cyclical market, industry, and geopolitical  
risks are made to the best of management’s knowledge based on current events  
and actions."
Actual results may deviate from these estimates.
"This is especially true 
against the backdrop of the geopolitical risks that continue to exist, particularly due 
to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the conflict over Taiwan, and tensions in the Middle 
East."
"The war in Ukraine can lead to further price increases and shortages of energy 
and raw materials."
"An extension of the conflict situation beyond Ukraine would  
further increase the risk of a global economic downturn."
"Rising inflation and higher 
interest rates could also lead to a significant decline in consumption."
"Both customs 
disputes and trade restrictions, for example between the USA and China, can affect 
global trade and thus global economic growth, and include the risk of a decline in  
foreign demand from the Chinese perspective and an accompanying decline in the 
Chinese gross domestic product."
"There is also the risk that semiconductors previously 
supplied to China will increasingly be replaced by locally manufactured products, 
and of growing exports of such semiconductors produced in China."
"These could have a sig-
nificant impact on Infineon’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows."
"Areas containing estimates and assumptions and that are consequently most likely to 
be affected when actual results vary from estimates and assumptions are the following:
›	 
valuation of inventory (see “Inventories”,   p."
"117),
›	 
recoverability of non-financial assets, in particular property, plant and equipment 
(see note 13,   p."
"118 f.) and goodwill (see note 14,   p."
"120 f.),
›	 
recognition and valuation of provisions (see “Other provisions” notes 17,   p."
"136 ff.) and
›	 
revenue where the transaction price contains a variable element (see “Revenue 
recognition”,   p."
"All assumptions and estimates are based on the circumstances and assessments  
as of the balance sheet date, taking into account the knowledge gained up to the 
approval by the Management Board of the Consolidated Financial Statements on  
21 November 2023."
"3  Acquisitions
Acquisition of 100 percent of the shares in GaN Systems Inc."
"On 24 October 2023, Infineon acquired all of the shares in GaN Systems Inc."
"(“GaN 
Systems”), which is based in Ottawa (Canada)."
"GaN Systems develops GaN-based 
power conversion solutions."
"With this acquisition, Infineon strengthens its leading 
position in the power systems sector."
"The provisional purchase price is €828 million, 
of which €825 million resulted in a cash outflow at the time of acquisition, and a  
further €3 million will be paid later to former shareholders under a terminated stock 
option program."
"According to the preliminary opening balance sheet, the net assets 
acquired by the Company amounted to €57 million."
"The acquired assets mainly relate 
to cash, inventories, rights of use under leasing arrangements, and property, plant 
and equipment."
"Acquired liabilities primarily relate to trade payables and leasing  
liabilities."
"The estimated excess of purchase price over assets acquired is around  
€771 million."
"The excess purchase price is expected to be primarily attributable 
to goodwill and, downstream, to technologies and customer relationships."
"Due to the 
proximity of the acquisition to the date of preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements and the resulting insufficient information, other disclosures required by 
IFRS 3 cannot be made."
"Acquisition of Imagimob AB and 3db Access AG
On 15 May 2023, Infineon acquired Imagimob AB in full."
"The startup, based in Stock-
holm (Sweden), is a platform provider for Machine Learning solutions for edge devices."
"Infineon further advances its position as a provider of machine learning solutions 
with this acquisition and, once again, significantly supplements its artificial intelli-
gence offering."
"On 4 October 2023, Infineon also acquired all shares in the startup 3db Access AG, 
based in Zurich (Switzerland)."
"The startup is a pioneer in secured low power 
ultra-wideband technology."
"The acquisition strengthens Infineon’s portfolio of 
secure and intelligent access control, precise localization and enhanced sensing."
"The last two acquisitions mentioned have only minor or no financial impacts during 
the reporting period, therefore no further disclosures in accordance with IFRS 3  
are required."
"4  
Notes to the Consolidated Statement  
of Profit or Loss
Revenue
Breakdowns of revenue by segments, product groups and geographic areas are  
disclosed in note 29."
"Infineon refrains from disclosing the remaining performance obligations arising  
from contracts with customers within the meaning of IFRS 15 with original expected 
durations of one year or less."
"Grants
Infineon has received grants from various governmental institutions under government 
business development programs, including grants for the construction of manufac-
turing facilities, research and development activities and employee development."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon 
received investment grants of €27 million (2022: €22 million)."
"For compliance with the conditions attached to the grants received and potential 
repayment requirements in case of nonfulfillment, see note 23."

As of 30 September 2023 and 2022, the carrying amounts of joint ventures accounted 
for using the equity method were €74 million and €56 million, respectively."
"This is based on a corporate income tax rate of 
15 percent, plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5 percent and a trade tax rate of 12 percent."
"Taxable income earned by foreign subsidiaries is determined on the basis of the  
tax laws applicable in the relevant countries and is taxed based on the respective 
country-specific tax rates."
"A write-up of deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards of €10 million was 
recorded (2022: €0 mil­
lion)."
"Within tax credits, the write-up of deferred tax assets 
amounted to €35 million in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: €10 million) and temporary  
differences amounted to €0 million (2022: €41 million)."
"The utilization of tax loss carry-forwards, tax credits and temporary differences for 
which deferred tax assets had not previously been recorded resulted in current tax 
income of €61 million in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: €1 million)."
"Based 
on the results of this assessment, considering all positive and negative factors and 
information relating to the foreseeable future based on business plans, Infineon  
recognized deferred tax assets, after netting, of €268 million as of 30 September 2023 
(30 September 2022: €527 million)."
"The income taxes recognized in other comprehensive income in the 2023 fiscal year 
comprise mainly actuarial gains and losses arising from pension commitments of  
€15 million (2022: €25 million)."
"7  Disposals and discontinued operations
Qimonda – discontinued operations
On 23 January 2009, Qimonda AG (“Qimonda”), a majority-owned company, filed  
an application at the Munich local court to commence insolvency proceedings."
"On  
1 April 2009, the insolvency proceedings formally opened."
"Insolvency proceedings 
were also opened for further domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Qimonda."
"Some  
of these insolvency proceedings have already been completed."
"The impacts of these 
proceedings are reported as discontinued operations in Infineon’s Consolidated 
Statement of Profit or Loss and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to the extent 
that the underlying events occurred before the commencement of insolvency pro-
ceedings."
"The current risks and provisions relating to Qimonda’s insolvency are described in 
note 24 “Proceedings in relation to Qimonda”."
"In the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, adjustments to individual provisions arose as a 
result of recent developments in connection with the insolvency of Qimonda, which 
resulted in a loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of €2 million  
and €7 million, respectively."
"The calculation of the diluted earnings per share is based on the assumption that  
all potentially dilutive instruments are converted into ordinary shares, resulting  
in a corresponding increase in the number of shares."
"The hybrid bond issued in the 2020 fiscal year is classified as equity (see note 20, 
 p."
"The related hybrid investors’ remuneration (after tax) represents payments 
for a component of equity that reduces the earnings available to shareholders for  
distribution and was therefore taken into account in determining earnings per share 
(basic and diluted)."
2	The calculation of earnings per share is based on unrounded figures.
"Fixed-term deposits with banks are categorized as financial assets and mea-
sured at amortized cost."
"Investment funds are categorized as financial assets and 
measured at fair value through profit or loss (see also note 2,   p."
"10  Trade receivables
Trade receivables result from contracts with customers that are due within one year."
"As of 30 September 2023 and 2022, finished goods and merchandise included an asset 
of €22 million and €16 million, respectively, which resulted from sales with a right  
of return."
"Inventory write-downs as of 30 September 2023 and 2022 amounted to €414 million 
and €282 million, respectively."

The previous year’s figures for “VAT and other receivables from tax authorities” and “Grants receivables” have been adjusted."
Further information on Infineon’s financial assets can be found in note 27.
"Amortization of intangible 
assets is mainly presented in cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative 
expenses."
"Impairments on property, plant and equipment and other intangible 
assets are reported under other operating expenses."
"Infineon determines the recoverable amount of a particular cash generating unit to 
which goodwill has been allocated on the basis of its value in use."
"The value in use is 
measured by estimating the present value of future cash flows that will be generated  
by the continuing operations of the CGU discounted using an appropriate discount rate."
"Cash flows over 
a five-year period are used to derive the value in use."
"The derivation of the terminal 
value is based on a stable business state, reflecting synergies resulting from the 
acquisition of Cypress."
"Investments to increase 
capacity for which no cash outflow has taken place are not taken into account."
"Cash 
flows for periods beyond the planning horizon are estimated using a terminal value."
"The discount rate for future cash flows is based on the after-tax weighted-average 
cost of capital (“WACC”) for the CGU in question."
"The Capital Asset Pricing Model 
(“CAPM”) is used to calculate the cost of equity."
"The relevant pre-tax WACC used to 
discount future pre-tax cash flows in line with IAS 36 is derived from estimated future 
after-tax cash flows and the after-tax WACC using a typical tax rate for each operating 
segment."
"The risk-free interest rate is derived using the Svensson method taking  
into account risk premiums, the beta factor and debt ratio are derived from a group 
of companies comparable to the operating segment."
"In this way, the discount rate 
derived reflects the current market rate of return as well as the specific risks attached 
to the respective operating segment."
"As a result of the impairment tests carried out, Infineon concluded that none of the 
operating segments gave rise to an impairment of goodwill in the year under report."
"Business planning is affected, among other things, by uncertainties regarding the 
assessment of markets and the macroeconomic environment."
"Therefore, sensitivity 
analyses were carried out at operating segment level, taking into account changes  
considered possible in the main assumptions."
"Even taking these changes into  
account, no impairment on goodwill was observed as a result of the sensitivity  
analyses at operating segment level."
"In addition, up to the date of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
there was no indication that the recoverable amount of an operating segment to which 
goodwill had been allocated could have fallen below the book value."
"Infineon has possible future (undis-
counted) leasing payments amounting to €45 million that are not included in  
lease liabilities because it is not sufficiently certain that the leases will be renewed."
"In addition, there are future payment obligations for leases that have not yet started 
but have already been contracted amounting to €48 million."
"Future payment obligations relating to short-term leases with a term of twelve months 
or less are immaterial in value."
"The lease contracts, in which Infineon subleases and acts as a lessor, are not material 
from the Group’s point of view."
"Provisions for warranties mainly represented the estimated future cost of fulfilling 
contractual requirements associated with products sold."
"Other provisions comprised mainly provisions for litigations (other than those relating 
to Qimonda), asset retirement obligations and miscellaneous other liabilities."
"Of the total provisions as of 30 September 2023 and 2022, cash outflows of €799 million 
and €983 million, respectively, were expected to occur within one year."
"For the non- 
current provisions, the cash outflow was expected to occur after more than one year."
"Besides the provisions in connection with Qimonda, €49 million as of 30 September 
2023 and €42 million as of 2022 of non-current provisions were attributable to length-
of-service related anniversary awards."
"Of this amount, €27 million (30 September 2022: €6 million) 
related to non-current contract liabilities reported under other non-current liabilities."
"The increase in contract liabilities mainly results from advance payments from  
customers based on capacity reservation agreements."
Further information on Infineon’s financial liabilities can be found in note 27.
"19  Pension plans
Defined benefit pension plans
Infineon’s employee benefit plans consist of domestic and foreign defined benefit 
and defined contribution pension plans providing retirement, disability and  
surviving dependents’ benefits."
"For Infineon, the significant benefit plans in  
Germany pertain to Infineon Technologies AG and, within the foreign benefit plans,  
to Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Austria."
"In Germany, Infineon primarily offers defined contribution benefits which provide  
for the employees when they reach retirement age, or in the event of disability or 
death."
"The statutory framework is provided by the Company Pension Act (in German: 
Betriebsrentengesetz or “BetrAVG”) and by employment law in general."
"With the 
Infineon pension plan, new entrants receive a defined contribution benefit, which is 
funded by Infineon."
"Payments by the Infineon pension plan are generally made in  
twelve annual installments."
"For active employees who were entitled to benefits in the  
 
form of an annuity before the Infineon Pension Plan came into force, this commitment 
was transferred into the Infineon Pension Plan and thereby the possibility of an  
annuity is guaranteed."
"Together with former employees whose pension benefit obli-
gations were not transferred into the Infineon Pension Plan, this group makes up the 
largest part of the obligation at this time."
"A corresponding provision is recorded for 
the German defined benefit pension plans, which are partly backed by plan assets."
"Individual agreements are in place for the members of the Management Board, which 
are backed by plan assets."
"The major portion of the plan assets is managed by a pen-
sion trust in the legal form of a registered association."
"This is composed of executives 
of Infineon Technologies AG, and the investment strategy is defined by Infineon  
Technologies AG."
"The benefit obligation of some foreign plans is measured according to the income  
in the last month or year of service; others are dependent on average income over  
the service period."
"Foreign pension plans are managed by country-specific external 
pension funds or other pension schemes."
"The obligations arising from foreign defined 
benefit pension plans are partly covered by plan assets."
"The management of existing 
foreign plan assets is performed by the respective pension scheme."
The valuation date of the pension plans is 30 September.
"The Group-defined benefit pension plans are exposed to risks arising from changes  
to actuarial assumptions such as discount factors, salary and pension trends,  
investment risks and longevity risks."
"A lower discount rate leads to higher pension 
liabilities."
"Lower than expected growth in plan assets could lead to a deterioration  
of the funded status."
"91
Since no asset ceilings applied, the funded status of the Infineon pension plans  
corresponded to the amounts reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position as of 30 September 2023 and 2022."
"The 2018 G mortality tables by Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used for Germany as in the 
previous year, and for Austria, the AVÖ 2018-P tables were applied."
"Sensitivity analysis
The following sensitivity analysis table shows how the present value of all defined 
benefit pension obligations would be affected by changes in the aforementioned 
actuarial assumptions."
"In each case, they reflect the effect of changes in one actuarial 
assumption while all other assumptions remain constant."
"The investment 
guidelines require a mix of active and passive investment management programs 
covering different asset classes."
"Taking the duration of the underlying liabilities into 
account, a portfolio of investments of plan assets in equity, debt and other securities, 
as well as real estate and reinsurance policies, is targeted to maximize the total long-
term return on assets for a given level of risk."
"Investment risk is monitored on an 
ongoing basis through periodic portfolio reviews, in coordination with investment 
managers and annual liability measurements."
"The aim is to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets against  
the liabilities using a diversified portfolio of investments within a defined risk budget 
and to thereby increase the funding ratio in the long term."
"The geographical allocation of the equity component  
of plan assets is globally diversified."
"As a matter of policy, Infineon’s pension plans  
do not invest in the shares or debt instruments of Infineon."
"The position “Other” in 
the previous table comprises exchange-traded commodities (ETC) and other invest-
ment funds."
"The market value of the ETC held domestically was €36 million as of  
30 September 2023 (previous year: €35 million)."
"The market value of the land and real estate leased to Infineon group companies by 
the legally independent pension trust amounted to €29 million and €30 million as of 
30 September 2023 and 2022 respectively."
"The realized return on plan assets in the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023 was 
positive €29 million (30 September 2022: negative €89 million)."
"Interest costs and expected 
return on plan assets were recorded net as part of financial expenses."
"Actuarial gains before taxes of €32 million and €332 million for the 2023 and  
2022 fiscal years, respectively, had been recognized outside of profit (loss) for the 
period in other comprehensive income."
"As of 30 September 2023 and 2022, cumulative actuarial losses amounted to €39 million 
and €71 million, respectively."
"In the 2024 fiscal year, payments of €38 million are expected to be made to plan 
assets, of which €35 million relate to benefits paid directly to pension recipients by 
the Group companies."
"The weighted-average duration of defined benefit plans was around 12 and 13 years 
as of 30 September 2023 and 2022, respectively."
"Infineon has no further performance obligations or 
risks with regard to these pension plans in excess of the fixed contributions paid."
"Additionally, the Group makes contributions to government pension schemes."
"Expenses for defined contribution plans amounted to €333 million and €309 million 
in the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years."
"It was divided into 1,305,921,137 no par value registered shares, 
each representing €2 of the Company’s ordinary share capital."
"Each share grants the 
holder one vote and an equal portion of the profits in the form of a dividend, as 
resolved by the Annual General Meeting."
"Own shares held by the Company as of the 
date of the Annual General Meeting carry no voting rights and are not entitled to  
a dividend."
"Additional paid-in capital
The pro rata expense for share-based payments resulted in an increase in additional 
paid-in capital of €92 million in the 2023 fiscal year (2022: €62 million)."
"Tax effects totaling 
€23 million (2022: €9 million) increased the additional paid-in capital."
"The 
new shares participate in profits from the beginning of the fiscal year of their issue."
"The originally authorized capital 2020/I of €750,000,000 was 
reduced to €640,000,000 by the capital increase of €110,000,000 as decided by the 
Management Board and the Supervisory Board on 26 May 2020 and entered in  
the Commercial Register on 27 May 2020."
"Within the framework of the Authorized 
Capital 2020/I, the Management Board is authorized, with the approval of the 
Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of the shareholders in certain 
cases."
"The capital increase of 26/27 May 2020  
utilized around 4 percent of this framework."
"For share capital increases against 
contributions in kind or a combination of cash contributions and contributions in 
kind, the authorization further provides an upper limit of 10 percent of the share 
capital in place at the date of the authorization in the Annual General Meeting."
"The subscription rights of the shareholders are excluded in relation  
to these shares."
"The Management Board, with the approval of the Supervisory 
Board, decides on the additional content of the share rights and the conditions of 
share issue (Authorized Capital 2021/I)."
"Hybrid capital
Infineon Technologies AG issued a perpetual hybrid bond on 1 October 2019 to  
refinance the acquisition of Cypress, which is an equity instrument under IAS 32."
The term is not contractually limited; the bond has no final maturity date.
"The hybrid 
bond can only be canceled by Infineon subject to certain conditions."
"The investors 
have no cancellation rights and cannot trigger a premature repayment liability for 
Infineon."
Distributions are at Infineon’s sole discretion.
"The hybrid capital investors’ compensation is paid in arrears on 1 April of each year, 
subject to repayment or redemption."
"On 1 April 2023, €39 million (2022: €39 million) 
was paid out to the hybrid capital investors."
"Dividends
For the 2022 fiscal year, a cash dividend of €0.32 per share (total amount: €417 million) 
was paid."
"For the 2021 fiscal year, a cash dividend of €0.27 per share (total amount: 
€351 million) was paid."
"With regard to the 2023 fiscal year, a dividend of €0.35 for each share entitled to a  
dividend shall be proposed to be paid from the €710 million of distributable profits  
of Infineon Technologies AG."
"This would result in an expected distribution of approxi-
mately €456 million."
"The payment of this dividend depends on the approval of the 
Annual General Meeting on 23 February 2024."
"It is of prime importance that sufficient 
cash funds are available to finance operating activities and planned investments 
throughout all phases of the business cycle."
"On the other hand, debt should only  
constitute a modest portion of the financing mix."
"Infineon derives its long-term key objectives for capital management based on these 
principles and the clear target to remain investment grade."
"For liquidity, the gross 
cash should amount to €1 billion, plus at least 10 percent of revenue."
"Gross financial 
debt should not exceed two times EBITDA."
"Infineon is not subject to any statutory capital requirements, nor are any such 
defined in the Articles of Association."
"Capital management, as well as the corresponding targets and definitions, are based 
on indicators derived from the consolidated IFRS financial statements."
"Gross cash  
is defined as the total of cash and cash equivalents and financial investments."
"Gross 
financial debt comprises short-term and long-term financial debt."
"Infineon defines 
EBITDA as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes and depreciation 
and amortization."
"The gross cash position decreased from €3,717 million as of 30 September 2022,  
to €3,590 million as of 30 September 2023 (for details, see the chapter “Review  
of liquidity” in the Combined Management Report,   p."
"Based on revenues of 
€16,309 million, the ratio of gross cash to revenue as of 30 September 2023 was  
€1 billion, plus an additional 15.9 percent of revenue (30 September 2022: €1 billion, 
plus 19.1 percent of revenue)."
"With gross financial debt of €4,733 million as of 30 September 2023 (30 September 
2022: €5,662 million), and EBITDA of €5,773 million for the 2023 fiscal year (2022: 
€4,518 million), the gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.8 as of 30 September 2023  
(30 September 2022: 1.3)."
"Infineon continues to have sufficient financial flexibility  
to ensure that, in addition to financing its planned investments, it is also able to  
regularly pay dividends (see note 20,   p."
"The USPP notes totaling US$2,235 million issued in April 2016 and June 2021 contain 
a number of standard covenants, including a debt coverage ratio, which provides  
for a certain relationship between the size of debt (adjusted) and earnings (adjusted)."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon has met the minimum requirements of all covenants."
"Should Infineon not comply with the covenants attached to the USPP notes, then  
all USPP notes outstanding as of 30 September 2023 amounting to US$2,235 million 
(see note 16,   p."
123) could become immediately repayable.
"Performance Share Plan
A Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan, the so-called Performance Share Plan, was developed 
for employees and members of the Management Board."
"Under this plan, (virtual) performance shares are initially provisionally granted on  
1 April (up to the 2020 fiscal year: 1 March) of the fiscal year according to a predeter-
mined LTI grant amount in euros."
"For the tranches up to and including 1 March 2020, the performance shares are split 
between 50 percent performance-related shares and 50 percent that are not dependent 
on performance."
"The performance-related shares are finally granted only when the 
Infineon share outperforms the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX) during  
the period between the date of the provisional allocation and the end of the vesting 
period."
"If at the end of the vesting period the requirements for an allocation of perfor-
mance shares – either all or only those that are not performance-related – are fulfilled, 
then entitlement to the transfer of the corresponding number of (real) Infineon shares 
is acquired."
"The value of the performance shares ultimately assigned to members  
of the Management Board must not exceed 250 percent of the respective LTI grant 
amount; above this cap, performance shares lapse."
"The fair value of the performance shares at the date of allocation was determined by 
an external expert using a recognized financial-mathematical method (Monte Carlo  
simulation model for the prediction of share price and index developments)."
"The  
fair value of the instruments granted was determined, taking into account future  
dividends as well as the payment cap."
"The number of real Infineon shares to be transferred depends on the achievement  
of targets during the performance period."
"The performance period begins on 1 October of the first fiscal year of the perfor-
mance period and ends four years later on 30 September."
"The TSR target accounts  
for 80 percent and the ESG targets 20 percent of the overall target achievement."
"For 
tranches from 1 April 2023, the TSR target accounts for 70 percent to 80 percent and 
the ESG targets for 20 percent to 30 percent of the overall target achievement."
"TSR and 
the ESG target achievements can be between 0 percent and 150 percent."
The vesting period begins on the allocation day.
"In contrast to the 
performance period, the vesting period ends four years after the allocation day, i.e., 
on 31 March."
"At the end of the four-year performance period, the target achievement 
is determined."
"The final number of performance shares to be allocated after the expiry of the  
vesting period is determined by multiplying the number of provisionally allocated 
performance shares by the overall target achievement of the two performance criteria 
during the performance period."
"The final allocation of the performance shares  
within an LTI tranche may not result in a profit (before tax) of more than 250 percent 
of the respective LTI grant amount; above this cap, all performance shares still to  
be allocated lapse."
"The fair value of the performance shares at the date of allocation was determined by 
an external expert using a recognized financial-mathematical method (Monte Carlo 
simulation model for the prediction of the share price development and the TSR target 
achievements)."
"The fair value of the instruments granted is determined taking into 
account future dividends as well as the payment cap."
"With the allocation of a (virtual) restricted stock 
unit, the plan participants acquire the right to receive a (real) Infineon share after the 
expiry of the vesting period, provided that the employees are still employed by Infineon 
at this time."
"The final allocation is made in stages (each representing 25 percent of 
the provisionally allocated restricted stock units) after the expiry of the vesting period 
of one year following allocation."
"The fair value of the restricted stock units at the date of allocation was determined  
by an external expert using a recognized financial-mathematical method (Monte Carlo 
simulation model for the prediction of share price developments)."
"The fair value of 
the instruments granted is determined, taking into account future dividends."
"23  Other financial commitments
In addition to provisions and liabilities, there were other financial obligations that 
were not recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position."
"These 
resulted, in particular, from legal risks (see note 24,   p."
"136 ff.) and unconditional  
purchase commitments, which are explained in more detail below."
"Contracts already entered into for commenced or planned investments in property, 
plant and equipment (purchase commitments) as of 30 September 2023 amounted 
to €2,921 million (30 September 2022: €2,344 million)."
"Commitments arising from 
orders placed for investments in intangible asset projects amount to €1 million as of 
30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: €6 million)."
"Furthermore, Infineon has committed to invest €500 million in the “European Semi-
conductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH” in Dresden (Germany), 100 percent 
of whose shares are currently held by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 
Limited (TSMC)."
Infineon’s participation will amount to 10 percent.
"In the course of its investing activities, Infineon also receives government grants 
related to the construction and financing of certain of its manufacturing facilities."
"Grants are also received for selected research and development projects, and for 
employee development initiatives."
"Certain grants have been received contingent upon 
Infineon complying with particular project-related requirements, such as creating  
a specified number of jobs over a defined period of time."
"From today’s perspective, 
Infineon expects to comply with these requirements."
"Nevertheless, should such 
requirements not be met, as of 30 September 2023, a maximum of €290 million  
(30 September 2022: €275 million) of subsidies already received could be refundable."
"Through certain sales and other agreements, Infineon may be obligated in the normal 
course of business to indemnify or compensate its counterparties under certain con-
ditions for warranties, patent infringement or other matters."
"Historically, payments made by Infineon under these 
types of agreements have not had a material effect on Infineon’s financial condition, 
liquidity position and results of operations."
"24  Legal risks
Litigation and government inquiries
Smart card chips antitrust litigation
In October 2008, the EU Commission initiated an investigation into the Company and 
other manufacturers of chips for smart cards for alleged violations of antitrust laws."
"In September 2014, the EU Commission imposed a fine of €83 million on Infineon, 
which in July 2020 was reduced to €76.9 million by the General Court of the European 
Union."
"In July 2019, a direct customer filed a lawsuit against Infineon Technologies UK Limited 
and several Renesas entities in London (United Kingdom) relating to the aforemen-
tioned EU antitrust case."
"The London court dismissed the complaint for being time-
barred."
The dismissal was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.
"The plaintiff filed a further 
appeal to the UK Supreme Court."
"In December 2022, the UK Supreme Court finally  
dismissed the complaint."
"Proceedings in relation to Qimonda
All significant assets, liabilities and business activities attributable to the memory 
business (Memory Products) were carved out from Infineon and transferred to 
Qimonda in the form of a contribution in kind with economic effect from 1 May 2006."
"Qimonda filed an application at the Munich local court to commence insolvency  
proceedings on 23 January 2009."
"On 1 April 2009, the insolvency proceedings were 
formally opened."
"The insolvency of Qimonda has given rise to various disputes 
between the insolvency administrator and Infineon."
"Alleged activation of a shell company and liability for impairment of capital
The insolvency administrator filed a request for declaratory judgment in an unspeci-
fied amount against Infineon Technologies AG and, by way of third-party notice,  
Infineon Technologies Holding B.V."
"and Infineon Technologies Investment B.V., at the 
Regional Court Munich I in November 2010."
"In addition to the request for declaratory judgment against Infineon in an unspecified 
amount, on 14 February 2012 the insolvency administrator also lodged a request for 
payment based on an alternative claim (in German: “Hilfsantrag”), as well as making 
other additional claims."
"In conjunction with this alternative claim, the insolvency 
administrator has requested the payment of at least €1.71 billion plus interest in con-
nection with the alleged activation of a shell company."
"On 15 June 2012, the insolvency 
administrator increased his request for the payment of 14 February 2012 on the 
grounds of activation of a shell company to at least approximately €3.35 billion plus 
interest."
"Furthermore, the insolvency administrator continues to base a substantial 
part of his alleged payment claims, as already asserted out of court against Infineon 
in August 2011 for an unspecified amount, on liability for impairment of capital (in 
German: “Differenzhaftung”)."
"This claim is based on the allegation that, from the  
very beginning, the carved-out memory products business had a negative billion 
euro value."
"The insolvency administrator therefore asserts that Infineon is obliged  
to make good the difference between this negative value and the lowest issue price 
(in German: “geringster Ausgabebetrag”) of the subscribed stock."
"Additionally, the 
insolvency administrator has asserted a claim for repayment of allegedly unjustly 
charged consultancy fees in the amount of €10 million in connection with the flotation 
of Qimonda."
"The legal dispute has, in the meantime, focused on the claims asserted for alleged 
lack of value."
"On 29 August 2013, the court appointed an independent expert to  
clarify the valuation issues raised by the insolvency administrator and to address 
technical matters."
"The legal dispute is being pursued with great effort by both parties, and many  
extensive written submissions have already been exchanged between the parties."
"Both sides have engaged numerous specialists and experts who are supporting the 
respective parties with assessments and opinions."
"On 21 September 2018, in consultation with the parties, the independent expert 
appointed by the court presented an interim report on his preliminary assessment  
of the value of the contribution in kind."
"The Company is in principle prepared to  
conduct discussions about an out-of-court settlement of the legal dispute on the 
basis of the interim report."
The parties are exchanging further written submissions.
"It is not clear at this stage  
if the legal dispute can be resolved with an out-of-court settlement, or, if this is not 
the case, when a first-instance court decision would be reached."
"Residual liability of Infineon as former shareholder of  
Qimonda Dresden GmbH & Co."
"OHG 
Infineon was a shareholder with personal liability of Qimonda Dresden until the 
carve-out of the memory business; as a result, certain long-standing creditors have 
residual liability claims against Infineon."
"These claims can only be exercised by the 
insolvency administrator acting in the name of the creditors concerned."
"In the mean-
time, settlements have been concluded with most of the major liability creditors."
"As described above, Infineon faces certain risks in connection with the insolvency 
proceedings relating to the assets of Qimonda and that entity’s subsidiaries."
"In con-
sideration of the interim report from the court-appointed expert, Infineon recorded 
provisions relating to Qimonda of €212 million in total as of 30 September 2023."
"This 
comprises mainly provisions for the still pending legal dispute over the alleged acti-
vation of a shell company and liability for impairment of capital, including legal costs."
"As of 30 September 2022, provisions relating to Qimonda amounted to €211 million."
"In addition, it is 
possible that liabilities and risks materialize that are currently considered to be unlikely 
to do so and, accordingly, represent contingent liabilities that are not included in  
provisions."
"Other
Infineon is also involved in various other legal disputes and proceedings in connection 
with its existing or previous business activities."
"These can relate, in particular, to 
products, services, patents, export control and environmental issues and other matters."
"Based on its current knowledge, Infineon does not believe that the ultimate resolution 
of these other pending legal disputes and proceedings will have a material adverse 
effect on Infineon’s financial condition, liquidity position and results of operations."
"Furthermore, in connection with its existing or previous business operations, Infineon 
is also exposed to numerous legal risks, which until now have not resulted in legal 
disputes."
"These include risks related to product liability, environment, capital market, 
anti-corruption, competition and antitrust legislation as well as export control and 
other compliance regulations."
"Claims could also be made against Infineon in connec-
tion with these matters in the event of breaches of law committed by individual 
employees or third parties."
"Suspension of enforce-
ment was granted as part of the ongoing appeal proceedings for 2011 and 2012."
"After 
completion of the current tax audit, suspension of enforcement will also be applied 
for 2014 and the appeal proceedings will be extended accordingly."
"Infineon expects 
that there is a sufficient degree of likelihood of winning any potential appeal or  
legal action."
"Provisions and contingent liabilities for legal proceedings  
and other uncertain legal issues
Provisions relating to legal proceedings and other uncertain legal issues are recorded 
when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the associated amount can 
be reasonably estimated."
"To the extent that liabilities arising from legal disputes and 
other uncertain legal positions are not probable or cannot be reliably estimated, then 
they qualify as contingent liabilities."
"Any potential liability is reviewed again as soon 
as additional information becomes available and the estimates are revised if necessary."
"Provisions with respect to these matters are subject to future developments or changes 
in circumstances in each of the matters, which could have a material adverse effect 
on Infineon’s financial condition, liquidity position and results of operations."
"Irrespective of the validity  
of the allegations and the success of the aforementioned claims and other matters 
described above, Infineon could incur significant costs in the defense of these matters."
"25  Transactions with related companies and persons
Infineon has transactions in the normal course of business with joint ventures, asso-
ciates and other related companies (collectively “related companies”)."
"The related 
companies are disclosed in note 30,   p."
"Related persons are persons in key 
management positions, in particular members of the Management and Supervisory 
Board (see note 30,   p."
162 f.) and their close relatives (collectively “related persons”).
"Related companies
Infineon purchases certain raw materials and services from and sells certain products 
and services to related companies."
"2	
Both Dr. Reinhard Ploss and Dr. Helmut Gassel resigned from the Management Board of Infineon Technologies AG in the 2022 fiscal year."
"Their employment contracts continued until 31 December 2022 and 30 September 2022, respectively."
"For this period, Dr. Reinhard Ploss 
and Dr. Helmut Gassel were entitled to remuneration in full."
"In addition, Dr. Helmut Gassel was granted a severance payment and agreed 
to a post-contractual non-competition clause that runs until November 2023, for which Dr. Helmut Gassel received compensation."

The total remuneration of the members of the Management Board for their active 
service pursuant to section 314, paragraph 1, no."
"6 in conjunction with section 315e, 
paragraph 1, HGB amounted to €9 million (2022: €15 million)."
"This includes a long-term 
incentive (LTI) in the form of a performance share plan (see note 22,   p."
"A total 
of 193,373 (virtual) performance shares (2022: 148,737) were provisionally allocated  
to the members of the Management Board in the 2023 fiscal year."
"The fair value of  
these provisionally allocated (virtual) performance shares amounted to €6 million 
(2022: €4 million)."
"The total remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 fiscal year 
amounted to €3 million (2022: €3 million)."
"Former members of the Management Board received payments of €7 million in the

"As of 30 September 2023, pension obligations for former members of the Management 
Board amounted to €63 million (30 September 2022: €63 million)."
"In the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, there were no significant transactions between 
Infineon and related persons that fell outside of the scope of the existing employ-
ment, service or appointment terms, or the contractual arrangements for their 
remuneration."
"Constanze Hufenbecher resigned from her position on the Management Board with 
effect from 31 October 2023; her contract of employment will end on 14 April 2024."
"The Supervisory Board appointed Elke Reichart to succeed Constanze Hufenbecher 
with effect from 1 November 2023 until 31 October 2026."
"The Remuneration Report was subjected to a separate 
substantive audit by the auditor in accordance with IDW PS 490."
"This audit also 
includes the formal audit required by section 162, paragraph 3 of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG)."
"This amount represented cash and cash equivalents 
of consolidated companies located in countries where the transfer of cash is legally 
restricted, for example, China."
"The reconciliation below shows changes in those financial liabilities and hedging 
transactions for which payments received and made are shown under cash flows from 
financing activities in the statement of cash flows."
These are now no longer reported under current or non-current financial assets.
The previous year’s figures have been adjusted to improve comparability.
"In the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, there were no reclassifications between the  
categories of financial instruments."
"Disclosures about fair value
Financial instruments at fair value
Financial instruments measured at fair value are allocated to the following measure-
ment levels in accordance with IFRS 13."
"Their fair value was determined by discounting 
future cash flows according to the discounted cash flow method."
"Where possible,  
valuation parameters observed on the reporting date in the relevant markets (such  
as currency rates, interest rates, or commodity prices) drawn from reliable external 
market data providers were used (level 2)."
"Where fair values are determined on the 
basis of non-observable factors, these are assigned to level 3."
"The determination of the fair values of the deal contingent forward and deal contingent 
option designated as cash flow hedges (see “Derivative financial instruments and 
hedging activities”,   p."
"147 ff.) were determined on the basis of factors observable in 
markets such as forward prices, interest rate curves and volatilities."
"In addition, the 
assumption about the date of completion of the acquisition was taken into account 
as a non-observable factor (level 3)."
Other non-current assets included equity investments and investments in funds.
"Where 
these are traded on an active market, the fair value was based on the actual market 
price (level 1)."
"In addition, other non-current assets included derivative financial 
instruments whose fair value was calculated using recognized financial-mathematical 
models, with only observable input parameters included in the measurement (level 2)."
"For equity investments where no market price from an active market is available, the 
fair value was determined by considering existing contractual arrangements based 
on externally observable dividend policy (level 3)."
"A hypothetical change in the material on the market non-observable valuation 
parameters at the balance sheet date of ± 10 percent or one month would have resulted 
in a theoretical reduction in fair values of €1 million or an increase of €1 million  
(previous year: both €1 million)."
"The same assumption applies to  
liabilities resulting from trade payables and other current liabilities categorized as 
“Other financial liabilities (amortized cost)”."
"The fair value of current and non-current financial debt that is measured at amortized 
cost is based either on quoted prices as of the reporting date (level 1) or is determined 
based on expected future cash flows discounted using a current market interest rate 
(level 2)."

Management Board and Supervisory Board
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Consolidated Financial Statements
Infineon does not net financial instruments."
"The Company conducts derivative  
transactions according to the global netting agreement (Master Agreement) of the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and other comparable 
national framework agreements."
"Under the terms of these agreements, any netting 
arising from the occurrence of certain future events would have had no material 
effect on the balance sheet presentation of these financial instruments."
"Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Infineon holds derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging purposes."
"This 
includes the use of forward exchange contracts and interest- and commodity swaps."
"The objective is to reduce the impact of the exchange rate, interest rate and commodity 
price fluctuations on future net cash flows."
"At the inception 
of the hedging trans­
action, and on a continuing basis, Infineon verifies the existence 
of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument 
(critical term)."
"For the abovementioned hedging transactions, the hedge ratio was 1:1."
"No material ineffective elements arising 
from the deal contingent forward or the deal contingent option were recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss in the 2023 fiscal year."
"Any ineffectiveness 
was attributable to changes in the expected timing of the payment of the purchase 
price in US dollars as well as the contingency component contained within the hedg-
ing instruments and the credit default risk."
"With the completion of the acquisition  
of GaN Systems on 24 October 2023, the deal contingent forward and deal contingent 
option became due and the hedge was closed."
"The effective portion of the hedge 
and the cumulative amounts recognized in the reserve for the costs of hedging were 
reclassified as costs of the acquisition of GaN Systems and were therefore taken into 
account in determining the goodwill arising from the transaction."
"To hedge the price risks of highly probable gold purchases in the 2024 fiscal year, 
Infineon entered into swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges."
"The designated 
hedged items and the hedging instruments were subject to the same risk."
"The eco-
nomic connection was proven by means of a regression analysis."
"Due to the execu-
tion of only highly effective hedging transactions, Infineon assumes that significant 
ineffective elements will normally not be generated."
"Infineon applies a hedging ratio 
of 1:1."
"Ineffectiveness can be caused mainly by the impact of the credit risks arising 
from the counterparty and Infineon on the fair value of the swap that is not reflected 
in the change in the fair value of hedged cash flows attributable to changes in raw  
material prices."
"As in the previous year, no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the  
Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss for these hedging relationships."
"As in the  
previous year, no gains or losses were transferred from other reserves to profit or loss  
as a result of cash flow hedges for future raw material purchases being canceled  
following the decision that the occurrence of the hedged transaction had become 
unlikely."
"Effects from derivative financial instruments designated  
as a hedging relationship
The amounts relating to positions that were designated as hedged items as of  
30 September 2023 and 2022 are shown in the table below."
"Infineon’s financial risk management seeks to minimize potential 
adverse effects on its profitability and liquidity."
"Infineon uses derivative financial 
instruments to hedge certain risks to which it is exposed."
"Financial risk management 
is undertaken by the central Finance & Treasury (FT) department in accordance  
with policies approved by the Chief Financial Officer."
"The FT department identifies, 
evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the operating units."
"The FT department’s policies contain principles for overall risk management as well 
as guidance covering specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, 
credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, and the 
investment of excess liquidity."
"Developments in cyclical market and segment risks as well as geopolitical risks are 
dynamic and can have direct and indirect effects on financial risks."
"The course of 
events and their impact on Infineon’s risk position is continually monitored and 
taken into account in the methods, models and processes used to control financial 
risks."
"Possible longer-term effects on Infineon and the associated volatility in the 
financial markets cannot actually be estimated more precisely."
"Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk of losses resulting from adverse changes in the  
market prices of financial instruments, including those related to foreign exchange 
rates, interest rates and other price risks."
"Infineon is exposed to various market risks in the ordinary course of business, primar-
ily resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates."
"Infineon enters 
into a range of derivative financial transactions with various counterparties to limit 
such risks."
"Derivative instruments are used only for hedging purposes and not for 
trading or speculative purposes."
"Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk within the meaning of IFRS 7 is the risk arising from changes  
to foreign exchange rates."
"Accordingly, foreign exchange risks are associated with 
financial instruments that are denominated in a foreign currency that does not  
correspond to the functional currency, and the foreign currency represents the  
relevant risk variable."
"Risks arising from the translation into Infineon’s reporting  
currency are not risks within the meaning of IFRS 7."
"Fluctuations in the exchange rates of these  
currencies compared to the euro had an effect on the results of Infineon in the 2023 
and 2022 fiscal years."
"The Management Board has established policies that require Infineon’s individual 
legal entities to manage the foreign exchange risk with respect to their functional  
currency."
"Group entities prepare a monthly rolling cash flow forecast by currency  
in order to determine foreign exchange risks."
"The net foreign exchange positions 
determined in these forecasts are required to be hedged, usually by entering into 
internal hedging contracts."
"Part of the foreign currency 
risk cannot be mitigated due to differences between actual and forecasted amounts."
"Infineon calculates this remaining risk based on net cash flows considering items  
in the Statement of Financial Position, actual orders received or placed and all other 
planned cash receipts and payments."
"For the net result related to foreign currency hedging transactions and foreign currency 
transactions included within profit (loss) for the period, see note 27."
"Foreign exchange risk at Infineon arises predominantly from main foreign currency 
positions."
"The assumed exchange rate changes relate 
only to financial instruments within the meaning of IAS 32."
"Infineon is exposed to interest rate risk through its financial investment instruments 
and financial debt resulting from bond issuances and debt financing."
"Due to the  
cyclical nature of its core business and the need to maintain high operational flexibil-
ity, Infineon holds a relatively high level of liquid financial assets that are invested  
in short-term fixed-interest instruments."
"These financial assets generally are invested 
with a contract duration of between one day and twelve months maturity at interest 
rates achievable in the short-term."
"The associated interest rate risk is compensated  
to a certain extent by financial liabilities, which generally have fixed interest rates."
"To reduce the net remaining risks caused by changes in interest rates, Infineon is able 
to make use of interest rate derivatives in order to align the fixed interest periods of 
assets and liabilities."
"IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis showing the effect of possible changes in market 
interest rates on profit or loss."
Infineon prepares this using the iteration method.
"Changes in market interest rates affect Infineon’s interest income and expenses from 
variable-yield financial instruments as well as from fixed-yield financial instruments 
that were measured at fair value through profit or loss."
"In the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years, Infineon held financial instruments that were 
exposed to market price risks."
"A change in the relevant market prices would have had 
no significant impact on the results of the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years."
"Additionally, Infineon is exposed to price risks with respect to raw materials upon 
which it is dependent."
"Infineon seeks to minimize these risks through its procure-
ment policy (including the use of multiple sources, where possible) and its operating 
procedures."
"In line with these measures, Infineon concluded additional financial 
derivative contracts for certain commodity supplies (gold) for the following fiscal year 
in order to mitigate the remaining risk arising from the fluctuation of commodity 
prices (see note 27,   p."

Credit risk
Credit risk arises when a customer or other counterparty of a financial instrument 
fails to discharge its contractual obligations."
"Infineon is exposed to this risk as a con-
sequence of its ongoing operations, its financial investments and certain financing 
activities."
"Infineon’s credit risk arises primarily from cash and cash equivalents, finan-
cial investments, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments."
"Excluding 
the impact of any collateral received, in the case of financial investments, cash and 
cash equivalents, trade receivables, and financial assets measured at amortized cost, 
the carrying amount corresponds to the maximum credit risk."
"Foreign exchange hedging contracts, as well as the investment of liquid assets in cash 
equivalents and financial investments, are entered into with major financial institu-
tions worldwide that have high credit ratings."
"Infineon assesses the creditworthiness 
of banks using a methodology that establishes investment limits for individual banks 
that are updated on a daily basis according to current external ratings and credit 
default swap premiums."
"Possible breaches of stipulated investment thresholds result 
in immediate notification and the requirement to reduce the risk."
"This methodology 
is also used to identify a significant increase in credit risk in the context of the recog-
nition of expected credit losses within the meaning of IFRS 9 at the balance sheet date."
"Infineon applies the general impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9 for cash and 
cash equivalents as well as financial investments."
"Infineon considers low credit risk to be an internal credit rating “Holding 
Quality 1”."
"A change in the internal rating from “Holding Quality 1” to “Holding Qual-
ity 0” indicates a significant increase in credit risk."
"The impairment is calculated using 
a weighted-probability method."
"This impairment is calculated as a measure of the 
probability of default based on the exposure at the balance sheet date, the loss ratio 
for that exposure, and the credit default swap spread."
"There was no reclassification between the impairment  
levels in the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years."
"Infineon had slightly reduced the distribution of its cash investments over around  
ten banks as of 30 September 2023."
"As of 30 September 2023, no financial institution 
was responsible for more than 18 percent (30 September 2022: 13 percent) of  
Infineon’s cash investments."
"This gave rise to a maximum risk position of €76 million 
(30 September 2022: €55 million) in the event of the default of a single financial  
institution, assuming no deposit insurance scheme is in place."
"In addition, to spread 
the risk of investment, investments were made in money market funds with the  
best rating and in money market investment funds."
"Infineon also held derivative 
financial instruments with a positive fair value of €10 million as of 30 September 2023 
(30 September 2022: €5 million)."
"Infineon manages the credit risk with respect to trade receivables through a com­
prehensive credit evaluation for all major customers, the use of credit limits and  
continual monitoring procedures."
"New customers are evaluated for creditworthiness 
in accordance with Infineon guidelines."
"Credit limits are also in place per customer, 
and creditworthiness and credit limits are constantly monitored."
"A further measure 
taken to reduce credit risk is the use of reservation of title clauses."
"However, despite 
continuous monitoring, Infineon cannot fully exclude the possibility of a loss arising 
from the default of one of its contract parties."
"Infineon assigns trade receivables to different risk classes based on external ratings, 
the analysis of customer balance sheet figures, default probabilities (credit default 
swaps), customer payment behavior and country risks."
"The simplified method is used 
to determine the expected losses from trade receivables."
"The expected losses over 
the entire term of the trade receivables are determined."
"The allowance is calculated 
for each customer using a weighted-probability method."
"In calculating the expected  
credit losses, for each customer, Infineon takes into account a forward-looking  
 
probability of default provided by a credit rating agency."
"Individual allowances are 
recorded based on case-by-case facts or other risk indicators."
"116) amounted to €2 million 
for all risk classes in both the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years."
"The individual allowances 
on trade receivables (no rating) amounted to €3 million as of 30 September 2023  
(30 September 2022: €4 million)."
"Liquidity risk could arise from a potential inability of Infineon to meet maturing  
financial obligations."
"Infineon’s liquidity management provides that sufficient  
levels of cash and other liquid assets are available and ensures the availability  
of funding through adequate levels of committed credit facilities."
"The following table discloses the maturity profile for non-derivative financial liabilities 
and a cash flow analysis for derivative financial instruments with negative fair values."
"The table shows the undiscounted contractually agreed cash flows that result from 
the respective financial liability."
"Cash flows are recognized at the date when Infineon 
becomes a contractual partner to the financial instrument."
"Amounts in foreign cur-
rencies were translated using the closing rate at the reporting date."
"The cash outflows 
of financial liabilities that can be repaid at any time are assigned to the period in 
which the earliest redemption is possible."
"Future cash flows from derivative financial instruments (see note 27,   p."
"147 ff.) may 
differ from the amounts shown in the table, since exchange rates or relevant factors 
are subject to change."
"In the 2023 fiscal year, Infineon’s business was structured 
into the four operating segments Automotive, Green Industrial Power, Power & Sensor 
Systems and Connected Secure Systems."
"In addition, Infineon differentiates Other 
Operating Segments as well as Corporate and Eliminations."
"Automotive
The Automotive segment designs, develops, manufactures and markets semicon­
ductor products for automotive applications."
"These include powertrain and energy 
management, connectivity and infotainment, body and comfort electronics, safety 
and data security."
"The product portfolio ranges from sensors, microcontrollers,  
software solutions, reliable power supplies, storage systems for specific applications, 
Si and SiC power semiconductors, as well as components for human-machine  
interaction and vehicle connectivity."
"Green Industrial Power 
The Industrial Power Control segment was renamed Green Industrial Power with 
effect from 1 April 2023."
"Decarbonization, electrification and energy efficiency are key 
business drivers in this segment."
"This focus, together with the decisive contribution 
that the segment makes to CO2 reduction, is reflected in the new name."
"The name 
change has no impact on the organizational structure, the strategy, or the scope of 
the business."
"The Green Industrial Power segment specializes in semiconductor solu-
tions for the intelligent management and efficient conversion of electrical energy 
across the entire conversion chain, comprising the generation, transmission, storage 
and use of electricity."
"The product portfolio comprises mainly IGBT power transistors 
and the driver ICs to control them, as well as power semiconductors based on SiC."
"Power & Sensor Systems
The Power & Sensor Systems segment comprises a wide range of power semiconductor, 
radio frequency and sensor technologies."
"The portfolio of products consists of control 
ICs, drivers and MOSFET power transistors, USB controllers and radio frequency 
products such as RF antenna switches, RF power transistors and signal amplifiers."
"Connected Secure Systems
The Connected Secure Systems segment provides comprehensive systems which are 
based on microcontrollers as well as on wireless connectivity and security solutions."
"Other Operating Segments
Other Operating Segments comprise the remaining activities of divested businesses 
and other business activities."
"Since the sale of the Wireless mobile phone business, 
services to Intel Mobile Communications and MaxLinear are included in this segment."
"Also included are supplies of LDMOS wafers and related components and services  
to Wolfspeed, Inc."
"(formerly Cree, Inc.), since the sale of the major part of Infineon’s 
Radio Frequency Power Components business."
"Similarly, certain items are included in Corporate and Eliminations which are not  
allocated to the other segments."
"These include certain corporate headquarters costs 
and selected topics, which are not allocated to the segments since they arise from 
corporate decisions and are not within the direct control of segment management."
"Furthermore, raw materials and supplies are mostly not under the control or respon-
sibility of the operating segment management and are therefore mostly allocated  
to corporate functions."
"Work in progress and finished goods are almost entirely  
allocated to the operating segments."
"Chief Operating Decision Maker, definition of Segment Result and  
allocation of assets and liabilities to the individual segments
The Management Board, as joint Chief Operating Decision Maker, decides how 
resources are allocated to the segments."
"Based on revenue and Segment Result, the Management Board assesses performance 
and defines operating targets and budgets for the segments."
"Decisions relating to financing and the investment of cash funds are taken at a  
Group level and not at a segment level."
"For this reason, neither financial income nor 
financial expense (including interest income and expense) is allocated internally to 
the segments."
"Neither assets, liabilities nor cash flows per segment is reported to the Management 
Board on a regular basis, nor is segment performance assessed on this basis."
"The exception to this approach is certain inventory information which is regularly 
analyzed at a segment level."
"Infineon also allocates depreciation and amortization 
expense to the operating segments based on production volume and products  
produced using standard costs."
"Costs are generally recharged without impact 
on profit or loss."
"Also allocated to Corporate and Eliminations in the 2023 fiscal year was €0 million 
(2022: €7 million) of reversal of impairments to assets."
"The allocation of revenues from external customers to geographic areas is based on 
the customers’ locations."
"The average number of employees by geographic region is 
provided in note 4."
"109
No single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of Infineon’s revenue during 
the 2023 and 2022 fiscal years."
These are now no longer reported under current or non-current financial assets.
"The previous year’s figures have been adjusted to 
improve comparability."
"2	Greater China comprises Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."
"Non-current assets do not include financial instruments, deferred tax assets and 
assets from employee benefits."
"www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/investor/corporate-governance/#corporate-governance
Fees for audit and advisory services pursuant to section 314,  
paragraph 1, no."
"The audit fees charged by KPMG in the 2023 fiscal year 
amounted to €4.3 million for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
various annual audits, including an audit review of the Interim Financial Statements."
"Fees for other services
Fees of €0.2 million were charged by KPMG to the Company in the 2023 fiscal year for 
other services."
"These mainly included quality assurance during the implementation 
of regulatory requirements."

On 23 January 2009, Qimonda AG applied to the Munich District Court for insolvency proceedings to be opened."
Insolvency proceedings were formally opened on 1 April 2009.
"The equity and earnings of Qimonda AG and its subsidiaries  
are not disclosed due to the substantial and ongoing restriction of Infineon’s rights as a result of Qimonda AG’s insolvency."
"Since all Qimonda-related investments were written down in full in previous years, this has no effect on Infineon’s net assets, financial position and results of operations."

Infineon accounts for its interest using the equity method because Infineon has significant influence due to the right to hold a supervisory board position in combination with comprehensive minority rights and certain contractual rights  
in the context of development cooperation."
22	 Infineon accounts for its interest using the equity method as Infineon lacks controlling influence due to certain contractual participation rights of the co-shareholder.

"In addition, we 
have audited the combined management report of Infineon Technologies AG and of 
the Group (hereinafter: the “group management report”) for the financial year from  
1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023."
"In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content  
of those components of the group management report specified in the “Other Infor-
mation” section of our auditor’s report."
"The group management report contains cross-references that are not required by  
law and which are marked as unaudited."
"In accordance with German legal require-
ments, we have not audited the cross-references and the information to which the 
cross-references refer."
"In all material respects, this group management report 
is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German 
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future 
development."
"Our opinion on the group management report does not cover the 
content of those components of the group management report specified in the 
“Other Information” section of the auditor’s report."
"The group management report 
contains cross-references that are not required by law and which are marked as 
unaudited."
"Our audit opinion does not extend to the cross-references and the 
information to which the cross-references refer."
"Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led  
to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial 
statements and of the group management report."
"Independent Auditor’s Report
For the Consolidated Financial Statements and Group Management Report we have issued an unqualified auditor’s report."
The English language text below is a translation of the auditor’s report.
"The original German text shall prevail in the event of any discrepancies  
between the English translation and the German original."
"We do not accept any liability for the use of, or reliance on, the English translation  
or for any errors or misunderstandings that may derive from the translation."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in 
the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are inde-
pendent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law 
and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German 
professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements."
"In addition, in 
accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have 
not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regula-
tion."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
group management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated  
Financial Statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most 
significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial 
year from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023."
"These matters were addressed in  
the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters."
"Impairment testing of goodwill
Please refer to note 2 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for infor-
mation on the accounting policies applied and the assumptions used."
"Information on 
the value of goodwill can be found under note 14."
"The financial statement risk
The consolidated financial statements of Infineon Technologies AG reported goodwill 
in the amount of EUR 6,547 million as at 30 September 2023."
"At 23% of the balance 
sheet total, goodwill accounts for a considerable share of total assets."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value  
in use."
"Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount of the operating segment to which 
the goodwill is allocated exceeds the recoverable amount of this unit."
"Infineon  
determines the recoverable amount of the respective cash-generating unit to which 
goodwill was allocated according to value in use."
"Impairment testing of goodwill is complex and based on a range of assumptions that 
require judgement."
"As a result of the impairment test performed, the Company did not identify any  
need to recognise impairment losses."
"In light of the discretionary judgement of the 
assumptions underlying impairment testing, there is the risk for the consolidated 
financial statements that a required impairment was not recognised."
"There is also the 
risk that the related disclosures in the notes are not appropriate."
"Our audit approach
When assessing the impairment test, we also assessed the appropriateness of key 
assumptions."
"We assessed the Company’s calculation method and selected assump-
tions in terms of their appropriateness with the help of our valuation specialists."
"For this purpose, we checked that corporate planning was updated for the next five 
years and adopted by the Management Board."
"We also confirmed 
the accuracy of the Company’s previous forecasts by comparing the budgets of  
previous financial years with actual results and by analysing deviations."
We checked how the discount rates used were derived and their amounts.
"For this 
purpose, we compared the assumptions and data underlying the discount rates,  
in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor, with our 
own assumptions and publicly available data."
"To ensure the computational accuracy of the valuation method used, we verified the 
Company’s calculations on the basis of selected risk-based elements."
"We have 
assessed this analysis."
"In order to take into account the earlier cut-off date for impair-
ment testing, we also assessed the impact of events until 30 September 2023 on 
impairment testing."
"Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures in the notes regarding impairment  
testing of goodwill are appropriate."
"Our observations
The calculation method used for impairment testing of goodwill is appropriate and  
in line with the accounting policies to be applied."
The Company’s assumptions used for measurement are appropriate.
The related disclosures in the notes are appropriate.
"Other information
The Management Board and the Supervisory Board, respectively, are responsible for 
the other information."
The other information also includes the remaining parts of the annual report.
"The 
other information does not include the consolidated financial statements, the group 
management report information audited for content and our auditor’s report thereon."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management 
report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an 
opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material  
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have 
nothing to report in this regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Management Board is respon-
sible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have 
the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In 
addition, it is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of 
accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, 
or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting 
process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group 
management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence  
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial 
statements and this group management report."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout 
the audit."
"The 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than 
the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud  
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal controls."
"›	 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the Management 
Board and the reasonableness of estimates made by the Management Board and 
related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a 
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report 
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group 
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respec-
tive opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the 
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"›	 
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information  
of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the group management report."
"We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"›	 
Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated 
financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s 
position it provides."
"›	 
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the  
Management Board in the group management report."
"On the basis of sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions 
used by the Management Board as a basis for the prospective information, and 
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assump-
tions."
"We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and  
on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that 
future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"We describe 
these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclo-
sure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in accordance therewith is 
further described below."
"Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Manage-
ment 1: Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QS 1)."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing the 
ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process."
"Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents 
are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the require-
ments of Section 328 (1) HGB."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain  
professional scepticism throughout the assurance work."
"›	 
Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file made 
available containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, on the 
technical specification for this electronic file."
"›	 
Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content 
equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group 
management report."
"Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation
We were elected as group auditor at the Annual General Meeting on 16 February 2023."
We were engaged by the Supervisory Board on 3 May 2023.
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with 
the additional report to the Audit Committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit 
Regulation (long-form audit report)."
"Other matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated 
financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the exam-
ined ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance opinion contained therein  
are to be used solely together with the examined ESEF documents made available in 
electronic form."
