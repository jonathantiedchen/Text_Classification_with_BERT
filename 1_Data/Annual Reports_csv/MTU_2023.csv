"Operationally, MTU remained in top form."
"We were very successful in our core business and 
generated adjusted revenue of €6.3 billion and adjusted EBIT of €818 million."
"The free cash  
flow amounted to €352 million."
"On an organic basis, we therefore fully achieved our targets."
All areas of the company made a key contribution to this success.
"Moreover, we are still on track 
for our goal of revenue of €8 billion and an operating profit of €1 billion by 2025, 8 - 1- 25."
"At the same time, we faced the enormous financial consequences of the Geared Turbofan fleet 
management plan, which had an impact of around € 1 billion on our reported revenue and earn-
ings."
"As a result, MTU reported negative earnings for the first time in its 90-year history."
"The 
fleet management plan was triggered by a manufacturing problem with a component produced 
by our program partner Pratt & Whitney."
"This affects us through our risk- and revenue-sharing 
agreement because our share of the earnings and the risks associated with the Geared Turbofan 
is 18%."
"The Geared Turbofan fleet management plan will also have a substantial impact on our 
cash flow in the coming years."
That means we have to pay special attention to our cost structure.
"These ups and downs were reflected in our share price in 2023: Thanks to our successes, our 
share rose to a high for the year of €244.50 in April."
"When the impact of the Geared Turbofan 
fleet management plan was announced, our shares lost a quarter of their value."
"They are now 
recovering."
"Nevertheless, our market capitalization is still below the actual value of our compa-
ny."
I assure you that we are working hard to close the gap.
"At the same time, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for supporting us through all the 
highs and lows in 2023 and for your continuing loyalty."
"Despite the difficult situation, we would 
like to show our appreciation by paying a dividend for 2023."
"At the Annual General Meeting, we 
will therefore be proposing a dividend of €2.00 per share."
"That is a sign of our reliability, even in 
challenging times."
We want MTU to remain an attractive and future-oriented investment for you.
I can assure you: MTU’s future prospects are good.
"Aviation is 
on an upswing and the sector is poised for growth."
"Some regions and segments have already 
exceeded the pre-Covid level."
There is high demand for new engines and maintenance services.
"The Paris and Dubai airshows were good indicators of the positive outlook for the aviation sec-
tor."
"Aircraft manufacturers booked record orders in Paris and MTU secured orders worth more 
than U.S.$1 billion."
"In Dubai, we gained orders of more than U.S.$500 million."
"That places us in 
a good starting position."
"We further improved this position in 2023 by investing continuously in 
the future of the company – both in technology and in our capacity at all locations worldwide."
"For example, a new production building for disks was erected in Munich."
"In addition, we held 
the groundbreaking ceremony for our new development center."
"New training capacities were 
established at our locations in China and Canada as a sound basis for vocational and further 
training of skilled staff."
"In addition, we took a second test station into service in Zhuhai, China."
"In 2023, we also expanded the capacity of our on-site service network: We obtained permits in 
Australia for the CF34 engines for regional aircraft and in Brazil for our CFM56 engines, which 
are used in the classic A320 family."
"MTU Maintenance Dallas can now perform on-site engine 
tests at its new, larger premises."
"In 2023, it was once again clear that we are making the right 
investments, and that our investments during the coronavirus pandemic were also right."
"With-
out them, we would not have the capacity for the additional upcoming shop visits resulting from 
the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"We face a balancing act: positioning the company 
well for market requirements and, at the same time, implementing the inspection program 
efficiently in collaboration with our partners."
"At this point, I would like to stress that, with regard to the Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan, MTU is part of the solution, not part of the problem."
"We are doing everything within our 
power to remedy the situation as quickly as possible together with our partners."
"MTU is both 
a pioneer and a benchmark: Since the start of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, 
we have used our expertise to suggest improvements and to enhance the inspection process – 
across the entire MRO network for the Geared Turbofan."
"In addition, we are evaluating whether 
we can shift maintenance work on other engines to other MTU locations to free up capacity for 
the Geared Turbofan in Hanover."
"Furthermore, we are working on expanding Geared Turbofan 
maintenance capacities also at other sites such as EME Aero or MTU Maintenance Zhuhai so 
that we can work through this issue as quickly as possible."
"We are making a clear contribution 
to regaining airlines’ trust in the Geared Turbofan."
"This is not a fundamental or technological 
problem; it is a manufacturing problem."
"The Geared Turbofan has the right, future-oriented 
architecture."
"It is a vital component in our technology agenda as we move towards emission-free 
flying."
"In 2023, we also drove forward other technologies within our technology agenda."
"As part of 
the European Clean Sky 2 research program, we are optimizing our low-pressure turbines and 
high-pressure compressors."
"Our WET concept is making progress with funding from the Euro-
pean Clean Aviation program."
Clean Aviation is also providing funding for our Flying Fuel Cell.
"For the Flying Fuel Cell, we need absolutely reliable, high-performance electric propulsion sys-
tems."
"To position ourselves optimally for this, in 2023, we acquired the electric motor developer 
eMoSys."
eMoSys’ drives already have the highest known power density.
"Furthermore, together 
with MT Aerospace we are developing a complete liquid hydrogen fuel system for commercial 
aviation."
Our Flying Fuel Cell should be the first application.
"To sum up: Even in challenging 
times, we are investing in our future so that we remain a leading technology company."
"Our clear 
goal is emission-free flying."
"In this way, we want to play our part in solving climate change 
because that is one of the most urgent problems facing humanity."
"In 2023, we also made good progress with future technologies for military aircraft."
"A four-year 
technology agreement was signed for the new European fighter jet system FCAS."
"This includes 
additional technology studies for the demonstration phase of the engine."
"Moreover, together 
with Safran, we want to work on an engine for the next generation of military helicopters."
"Rapid 
and efficient development should be achieved through a pan-European team."
MTU has been driving forward all of these topics with great commitment.
"That is only possible 
with a strong team."
"In the numerous uncertainties and crises of recent years, MTU has been 
demonstrating its strength."
"On behalf of the Executive Board, I would like to thank all employ-
ees for their exceptional commitment and enormous flexibility."
"We are proud to have such a 
competent and motivated team at our side."
"And we are sure that together we can master the 
Geared Turbofan fleet management plan and use our operational strength to shape the future of 
the aviation sector."
We will not allow ourselves to be blown off course.
"We are charting a focused yet calm track 
through these turbulent times."
We have honed our strategy and have a keen eye on our targets.
"MTU is a healthy, growth-oriented company with opportunities in all segments."
"Our long-term 
prospects are still strong."
We still want to continue to grow profitably.
"Even though 2024 will 
be dominated by the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, we anticipate a positive organic 
trend – in all business areas."
"In 2024, revenue is expected to rise fastest in the commercial 
series business."
"We also expect to see an increase in revenue in the spare parts business, com-
mercial maintenance and the military business."
"Looking beyond this year, we remain confident."
8 – 1 – 25 still applies.
"On an adjusted basis, by 2025, we want to generate revenue of €8 billion 
and an operating profit of €1 billion."
"In short, we intend to deliver on our promises in the future – and we will do so."
"I would be 
delighted if you would continue to put your trust in us on this journey."
"That 
is demonstrated by its strong organic growth in 2023."
"However, the Geared Turbofan fleet 
management plan weighed heavily on reported revenue and earnings in 2023."
"Thanks to its 
technological edge, balanced portfolio and broad customer base, MTU is well placed to achieve a 
further rise in revenue and earnings on an adjusted basis in 2024, and to go on growing beyond 
2024."
"The following sections contain the Supervisory Board’s report on its activities in fiscal 
year 2023."
"The Supervisory Board will continue its close and trustful collaboration with all 
stakeholders in 2024."
"In 2023, 
the Supervisory Board carried out, fully and with due care, the duties of oversight and advice 
entrusted to it by law, the articles of association, and its own rules of procedure."
"It regularly advised the Executive Board on the running of the company, continually supported 
and monitored the management of the business activities and assured itself that the Executive 
Board’s dealings were proper and lawful."
"The Supervisory Board was informed and consulted 
in a direct and timely manner on all decisions of consequence for the company."
"The Executive 
Board provided the members of the Supervisory Board with regular, prompt and comprehensive 
information on the company’s situation."
"The Supervisory Board received written monthly reports  
on the company’s net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"At its meetings, the 
Supervisory Board also discussed the business performance of all of MTU’s affiliated companies."
"The Supervisory Board discussed the strategy and all important projects with the Executive 
Board."
"After examination and careful deliberation, the Supervisory Board endorsed the com-
pany’s strategic orientation with its focus on sustainable and profitable organic growth."
"The 
Supervisory Board passed resolutions on all transactions for which its approval was required in 
accordance with the law, the company’s articles of association or the Executive Board’s rules of 
procedure after reviewing and discussing them with the Executive Board."
"Preparatory meetings 
can also take place without the Executive Board as necessary."
"Moreover, the Supervisory Board 
regularly schedules meetings without the Executive Board."
"In 2023, as in previous years, the Supervisory Board examined and oversaw the internal control 
mechanism at MTU, especially the risk management system, internal auditing and legally com-
pliant corporate governance."
"Further-
more, the Supervisory Board looked extensively at the company’s compliance."
"In view of the legal requirements for stock corporations, which impose an obligation to obtain 
the consent of the Supervisory Board for certain related party transactions, the Supervisory 
Board adopted an internal procedure to comply with these requirements in 2020."
"In the report-
ing period, there were no transactions requiring consent or disclosure."
"Meetings of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board held five regular in-person meetings in 2023."
"It also held one extraordi-
nary meeting using the hybrid format, i.e., some members attended in person while others took 
part via a video conference."
The members took part in all meetings.
"Attendance was therefore 
100%."
"In addition, one workshop was organized for the Supervisory Board with external support 
and the Executive Board and Supervisory Board held a joint strategy workshop."

bution proposal."

An exploratory drill was scheduled for October / November.
Start-up is expected for winter 2024 / 2025.
"MTU expects this to reduce CO2 emissions at the

"At the extraordinary meeting on September 22, 2023, the Supervisory Board was given an 
update on the PW1100G-JM fleet management plan and the resulting aircraft on ground (AOG) 
times for airlines."
"Moreover, it was given extensive information on this issue and its impact on 
the company at all subsequent meetings."
"In addition, regular and timely reports on the latest 
developments were provided by the Executive Board to a Supervisory Board working group."
"Another item was the proposal for a new compensation system for the Executive Board and its 
components."
"At the meeting on October 24, 2023, the Executive Board reported on the groundbreaking 
ceremony for the new development center at the Munich location, the Geared Turbofan fleet 
management plan, the ongoing recovery of air traffic and MTU’s continued growth, supported 
by all market segments."
"Further, it reported on global deliveries of passenger aircraft, MTU’s 
production strategy 4.0, the supply situation of suppliers in Israel, and the quality and occupa-
tional safety situation, which are at a high level."
"The Supervisory Board looked intensively at 
technology development in the commercial and military areas and MTU’s future propulsion con-
cepts, with improvements in climate impact and energy consumption."
"Moreover, it adopted a resolution on the new compensation system for the 
Executive Board, which will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting 2024 for approval."
"At the meeting on December 11, 2023, the Supervisory Board examined the company’s situa-
tion and held a detailed discussion of the operational business plans and the budget for 2024."
"The meeting also included a detailed review and confirmation of the management’s compliance

"Further items at this meeting were the compen-
sation of the Executive Board, especially the status of achievement of the ESG targets for 2023 
and proposals for the ESG targets and strategic multipliers for 2024."
"The Supervisory Board 
thanked the Executive Board for waiving a considerable portion of its variable compensation in 
view of the anticipated financial burden on the company as a result of the Geared Turbofan fleet

"The results of the review of the efficiency of the 
Supervisory Board were also presented."
"The Supervisory Board voted on the appointment of one 
shareholder representative to the Supervisory Board of MTU Maintenance Hannover GmbH."
"In 
addition, it discussed the competitive situation in China."
"At its meetings, the Supervisory Board also discussed the legal requirements and the recom-
mendations of the German Corporate Governance Code regarding Executive Board compensa-
tion."
"The compensation system takes account of sustainability targets and provides for appropri-
ate and motivating compensation."
"Between official meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was regularly briefed on 
the company’s current situation, significant business transactions and important pending 
decisions."
"This entailed regular meetings with the Executive Board, including consulting on 
strategy, the status of planning, the progress of business, the company’s risk situation, the risk 
management system and compliance."
"For this reason, in 2023 the Supervisory Board once again looked in de-
tail at the application and implementation of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), 
based on the current version of April 28, 2022."
"Furthermore, the Supervisory Board regularly 
discusses the composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board with a view to diversi-
ty and the appropriate inclusion of women."
"The Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure contain binding provisions for dealing with 
conflicts of interest."
"Such conflicts must be disclosed and, where appropriate, may result in 
termination of the member’s term of office."
"This also applies for proposals for election submit-
ted to the Annual General Meeting."
There were no conflicts of interest in the reporting period.
"If 
there are any discussions or resolutions affecting this supplier in future, the Supervisory Board 
member concerned will not take part in them."
"There were no such discussions or resolutions in 
the reporting period."
"The Supervisory Board also undertook a detailed examination of the recommendations of the 
GCGC on the independence of the members representing the shareholders."
"The Supervisory 
Board deems all of its members to be independent."
"This expressly applies to the employee 
representatives and to Dr. Rainer Martens, who ceased to be a member of MTU’s Executive 
Board at the end of 2017."
"Moreover, it applies to Dr. Joachim Rauhut, who has been a member 
of the Supervisory Board for more than 12 years."
"Consequently, all Supervisory Board commit-
tees consist exclusively of independent members."
"For the future, the Supervisory Board has set 
twelve years as the maximum period for membership of the Supervisory Board and considers 
this to be appropriate for MTU."
"Members of the Supervisory Board undertake training on their 
own responsibility, with support from MTU where necessary."
"MTU may also defray the costs of 
training."
"In fiscal year 2023, MTU supported training and development measures and also held 
a strategy workshop in December."
"In consultation with the Executive Board, the Supervisory 
Board ensures long-term succession planning for appointments to the Executive Board."
"To this 
end, the Supervisory Board regularly reviews the present term of all Executive Board contracts, 
taking into account, in all cases, the age of each member and the competency profile of potential 
candidates."
There is an onboarding process for new members of the Supervisory Board.
"This gives them 
a thorough insight into MTU’s product portfolio, strategy, corporate governance and how the 
Supervisory Board works."
"The Supervisory Board regularly assesses how effectively the Supervisory Board as a whole and 
its committees perform their tasks."
"At the turn of 2022 / 2023, the Supervisory Board con-
ducted a self-assessment of the work in plenary session, with the aid of an external consultant."
"This took the form of a questionnaire and individual interviews with each Supervisory Board 
member and the Executive Board."
"The topics included, in particular, the provision of informa-
tion for the Supervisory Board, the discussion culture, the composition of the committees and 
the preparation of meetings."
"Benchmarking against a selected peer group of companies was also 
used."
"The results were discussed with the Supervisory Board at a separate workshop in spring 
2023."
"They form the basis for the ongoing development of the work of the Supervisory Board 
and its profile of skills and expertise as well as for the final assessment by the Supervisory 
Board, that its work was, and still is, performed efficiently."
"In fall 2023, the Supervisory Board 
conducted a further self-assessment using a questionnaire developed by an external law firm."
"The members of the Supervisory Board considered that their work was conducted efficiently 
and adopted some specific measures to enhance the preparation and conduct of its meetings."
"In 2023, the Audit Committee also performed another self-assessment."
"This comprised a ques-
tionnaire developed by an external firm of lawyers."
"The focal areas of this self-assessment were 
the tasks and organization of the committee, the skills of its members, oversight of the audit, 
internal auditing and the risk management system, and financial reporting."
"The members of the 
Audit Committee considered the work of the committee to be conducted efficiently and adopted 
some specific measures to enhance the organization of its work."
"Cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, and among the members 
of the Supervisory Board, in the past fiscal year was judged to be very good."
"No conflicts of 
interest arose between MTU and any member of its Executive Board or Supervisory Board."
"This declaration of 
conformity is reproduced in this Annual Report in the section of the management report headed 
Corporate governance statement, together with a more detailed description of the company’s 
corporate governance system."
The declaration has also been posted on the MTU website.
"Each 
of these committees presents regular reports on its activities at the plenary meetings of the Super-
visory Board."
"A Nomination Committee, which meets on an ad hoc basis, has been set up in accordance with 
the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"The task of the Nomination 
Committee is to find suitable candidates for election to the Supervisory Board."
"Its members are 
Gordon Riske (Chairman) and Dr. Joachim Rauhut (since May 11, 2023) / Dr. Jürgen M."
"Geißinger 
(until May 11, 2023)."
"In 2023, the Nomination Committee held two meetings – to prepare for a 
successor to Dr. Joachim Rauhut, who will be leaving the Supervisory Board at the Annual General 
Meeting 2024."
"In addition to the competencies of potential candidates, special attention was paid 
to their available time."
"The Supervisory Board also examined the availability of its current mem-
bers."
"It concluded that it all members, without exception, have sufficient time for their work on 
MTU’s Supervisory Board and its committees in addition to their other professional activities and 
that their availability is good."
"This is reflected both in the very high attendance rates at plenary 
and committee meetings (100% in 2023), the thorough preparation and follow-up of the meetings 
– which have been extended since spring 2023 – and the intensive and in-depth discussions at the 
meetings and with the Executive Board."
"The Personnel Committee is responsible, among things, for concluding contracts with the Execu-
tive Board, including on their compensation, and for proposing candidates for the Executive Board."
"The members of this committee are Gordon Riske, Dr. Joachim Rauhut (since May 11, 2023) / 
Dr. Jürgen M."
"Geißinger (until May 11, 2023) and the employee representatives Josef Mailer and 
Danielle Frijia."
"The Personnel Committee met four times in 2023 – including two extraordinary 
meetings (total attendance: 100%)."
"The committee also discussed the new compensation 
system for the Executive Board in detail."
"Other topics were the status of achievement of the ESG 
targets for 2023 and a discussion of the proposed ESG targets and strategic multipliers for 2024."
"The Mediation Committee, whose members are identical with those of the Personnel Committee, 
did not have to convene in 2023."
"The members of the Audit Committee are Dr. Joachim Rauhut (Chairman), Dr. Christine Borten-
länger, Claudia Sowa-Frank (since May 11, 2023) / Heike Madan (until May 11, 2023), and Josef 
Mailer."
It held six routine meetings in the year under review.
"In addition, it prepared the Supervisory Board’s proposal to the Annual General Meeting on the 
appointment of the auditor."
"Further, it was responsible for engaging the auditor, the agreement 
with the auditor on the audit fees, and for specifying the key areas of focus for the audit of the 
annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for 2023."
"The Audit Committee oversaw the quality of the audit and the independence of the auditor, which 
had been confirmed by the auditor."
"Furthermore, the Audit Committee discussed the additional 
services provided by the auditor."
"The procedure for procuring the non-audit services provided by 
the auditors was reviewed and affirmed and the content and fees for such services in the reporting 
period were approved on a case-by-case basis."
"Moreover, it examined the qualification of the 
persons engaged to conduct the audit and the auditor’s general quality assurance concept and its 
practical application."
"The committee and other members of the Supervisory Board received the audit reports from 
KPMG for their deliberations."
"These documents were reviewed in detail in the presence of the 
auditor."
"On this basis, the committee recommended that the Supervisory Board should adopt the 
financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year 2023, and approve 
the combined management report and the Executive Board’s profit distribution proposal."
"In accordance with statutory requirements, the Audit Committee monitored the accounting pro-
cess, the accounting-related internal control and risk management system and the internal audit-
ing system, which it judged to be appropriate and effective."
"It oversaw the company’s compliance 
activities and received reports from the internal auditors."
"The Audit Committee received reports 
from the heads of the Corporate Audit and Compliance units and on related party transactions."
"No 
material weaknesses were established in the internal control system for the accounting process or 
system for early identification of risks."
"KPMG issued an unqualified 
audit opinion."
"This was signed by Johannes Hanshen and Angelika Huber-Straßer, who audited 
MTU for the first time in fiscal year 2023."
"The audit reports and documents to be reviewed were 
submitted in good time to all members of the Supervisory Board."
"The Chairman of the Audit 
Committee reported to the Supervisory Board on the audit performed by KPMG."
"The Supervisory Board reviewed the annual 
financial statements, consolidated financial statements, combined management report includ-
ing the non-financial statement, and the profit distribution proposal, and raised no objections."
"The company’s annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for 2023, as 
submitted by the Executive Board, were approved at the Supervisory Board’s meeting on March 
19, 2024."
The annual financial statements are therefore adopted.
"The Supervisory Board agreed 
to the Executive Board’s proposal for the distribution of the net profit after giving due consid-
eration to the interests of the company and its shareholders."
"A dividend payment of €2.00 per 
share eligible for the dividend will therefore be proposed to the Annual General Meeting."
"Changes in the governing bodies
MTU’s former Chief Operating Officer, Lars Wagner, has been the company’s new CEO since 
January 1, 2023 and Dr. Silke Maurer has been the new Chief Operating Officer (COO) since 
February 1, 2023."
There were four changes on the Supervisory Board in 2023.
"On the employees’ side, there were 
three changes: Thomas Dautl, Heike Madan and Michael Winkelmann were members of the 
Supervisory Board until May 11, 2023."
"Kai Eisenblätter, Dr.-Ing."
"Marc Haltrich and Claudia  
Sowa-Frank have been members since May 11, 2023."
"The Supervisory Board thanks Heike 
Madan, Thomas Dautl and Michael Winkelmann for their work."

The Supervisory Board thanks Dr. Jürgen M.
"Geißinger for his many years of 
service and his enormous commitment."
Ute Wolf is a new member of the Supervisory Board.

"The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Board for its close and constructive 
collaboration."
"It would also like to thank all employees and the Works Council for their success-
ful work and enormous commitment in 2023."

"However, this had little impact on the global equity markets."
"Despite 
short-term volatility, the overriding sentiment was positive, resulting in solid price gains over 
the year."
"The German blue-chip index, DAX, also posted a positive performance in 2023."
"It started the 
year at a low of 14,069 points."
"The index moved upward in the first half of the year, despite 
the rise in benchmark interest rates, to 16,470 points at the end of July."
"At the end of October, 
the DAX dropped back to around 14,700 points."
"In the final weeks of the year, the DAX rallied 
again, and rose to a high for the year of 16,794 points on December 11."
"It closed 2023 at 16,752 
points, a gain of 20.3% over the year."
"Following the recovery of many aviation stocks in 2022, the sector performance on the equity 
markets was again very robust in 2023."
"According to the International Air Transport Associa-
tion (IATA), the positive trend in passenger traffic continued."
"Worldwide, passenger traffic was 
back at 98% of the pre-pandemic level."
"This also benefited the sector index: The Stoxx Europe 
TMI Aerospace & Defense Index, which includes shares in MTU as well as the Airbus Group, 
Safran, and Rolls-Royce, posted a positive trend in 2023 and rose continuously over the year."
It ended the year up 37.5%.
"Weak price performance by MTU shares
In the first half of the year, MTU’s share price rose continuously, with some volatility, climbing 
to a high for the year of €244.50 in April."
"On July 25, 2023, RTX, the parent company of Pratt 
& Whitney, announced a fleet management plan for the Geared Turbofan(GTF) – an engine 
program in which MTU has a stake."
"Despite confirming the increased forecast for adjusted EBIT 
when the half-year results were published, shares in MTU lost ground and were €208.50 on July 
26, 2023."
"On September 11, 2023, RTX announced that the Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan would be extended, reducing the engine consortium’s earnings by around U.S.$ 6 to 7 
billion."
"This led to a further considerable drop in MTU’s share price on the following days and 
the share fell to a low for the year of €161.20 on September 21, 2023."
"However, following pub-
lication of the nine-month results, which were impacted by exceptional charges for the Geared 
Turbofan fleet management plan, the share price continued to rally."
"Positive factors were prob-
ably the organic growth in all business segments and renewed confirmation of its guidance for 
its adjusted results for the full year."
Shares in MTU ended 2023 at €195.25.

Shareholders participate in MTU’s success through a dividend."
"Despite the charges for the 
Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board have 
decided to pay a dividend for 2023."
"At the Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2024, they will 
propose payment of a dividend of €2.00 per share for fiscal year 2023."
"The dividend would be 
paid on May 14, 2024."
The payment ratio would be 18% of MTU’s adjusted net income.
"Trading volume
In 2023, the average number of MTU shares traded via Xetra trading was 169,000 shares per day, 
compared with 186,000 per day in 2022."
"The highest number of shares traded was 1,085,379 on

"Broad coverage by analysts
As of December 31, 2023, 26 analysts were reporting regularly on MTU."
"At the end of De-
cember, 17 financial institutions rated the stock as a buy, 9 had it on hold and none had a sell 
recommendation (2022: 15 “buy,” 8 “hold,” 1 “sell”)."
The average price target was €219.
"One-on-one meetings and investors’ confer-
ences were held as both in-person and remote events."
"In all, MTU took part in 16 international 
investors’ conferences, including the German Investment Seminar organized by Oddo and 
Commerzbank in New York, the German Corporate Conference organized by Kepler Cheuvreux 
in Frankfurt and numerous investors’ conferences held by various banks in London."
"A key platform for dialogue with shareholders was the MTU Annual General Meeting, which 
was held digitally on May 11, 2023, as a video webcast."
"Around 72% of the share capital with 
voting rights was represented (previous year: around 74%)."
"The Paris Airshow, which was held in 2023 for the first time since 2019 and is one of the most 
important events in the aviation sector, was also used to engage in intensive dialogue with 
capital market players."
"At the Investor & Analyst Event at the Paris Airshow, the Executive 
Board and Investor Relations team explained MTU’s future opportunities and growth prospects 
to around 200 analysts and representatives of investors."

"The compensation report complies with the provisions 
of Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and was prepared jointly by the 
Supervisory Board and the Executive Board."
"The Personnel Committee 
regularly reviews the appropriateness and market alignment of the Executive Board compensa-
tion."
"For this, it also uses the expertise of independent external compensation experts with regard 
to both the compensation system and the structure of the target direct compensation compared 
with relevant stock market segments."
"For MTU, the comparison is based on the MDAX stock mar-
ket segment."
"In addition, given MTU’s inclusion in the DAX in 2019, it refers to the DAX segment 
(peer group for the horizontal comparison)."
"If a need for adjustment is identified, the Personnel 
Committee submits a corresponding proposal to the Supervisory Board."
"In accordance with the 
statutory requirements, the compensation system is resubmitted to the Annual General Meeting 
for approval at the latest every four years and in the event of significant modifications."
"In accordance with Section 120a (4) of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the compensation report 2022 was submitted to the Annual General 
Meeting for approval on May 11, 2023 and was approved by 73.53% of the votes cast."
"In agreement with the Executive Board members, the Supervisory Board plans to submit a 
modified compensation model, effective from 2024, to the Annual General Meeting for approval."
"The modifications take into account the statutory requirements and fulfillment of the recommen-
dations of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)."
"Furthermore, the aim is to find a 
balance between market-aligned compensation of the Executive Board members and the relevant 
expectations of MTU’s investors."
"The planned modifications to the compensation system in fiscal year 2024 
 
are described below in the section Planned modification of the Executive Board compensation 
system as of fiscal year 2024."
"All amounts are rounded to full euros, unless otherwise specified."
"Due to rounding, it is possible 
that individual amounts in the compensation report may not correspond exactly to the totals 
stated and that the percentages presented may not correspond exactly to the absolute amounts 
they refer to."
"Non-performance-related components
Non-performance-related compensation, which normally makes up around 40% of the target 
direct compensation, is paid on a monthly basis and consists of fixed compensation and fringe 
benefits."
"The fringe benefits comprise taxable reimbursements of expenses such as insurance 
premiums, including any taxes thereon, and the cash equivalent of payments in kind such as 
the provision of company cars for business and private purposes."
"Performance-related components
Performance-related compensation makes up around 60% of the target direct compensation; it 
consists of a short-term incentive (STI) and the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP / LTI)."
"Short-term incentive (STI)
Performance-related compensation is paid in the form of a short-term incentive (STI)."
"It normal-
ly comprises approximately 40% of the performance-related components."
"Its effective calcula-
tion depends on the degree of target achievement for two equally weighted targets, which are 
the Group’s key performance indicators (KPIs) adjusted EBIT (profitability) and free cash flow 
(liquidity)."
"Further, an adjustment is made for significant non-period earnings impacts on the basis of 
the internal materiality criterion for external reporting."
"In the reporting period, as in previous 
periods, such adjustments relate to “impairment losses,” “restructuring expenses” and “chang-
es in the consolidated group”, and thus to the corresponding earnings contributions, in other 
words “other significant non-period earnings impacts”."
"It is common practice for items to be 
classified as special items to be eliminated in the reconciliation to adjusted EBIT by consultation 
between the CEO, the CFO, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, and the Audit Committee."
"To arrive at the free 
cash flow, these non-recurring cash flows were therefore eliminated from the cash flow from 
investing activities."
"The performance targets adjusted EBIT and free cash flow to be achieved in the respective fiscal 
year to ensure full payment of the STI component of the target direct compensation are set an-
nually in advance by the Supervisory Board, taking the operational business plan into account."
"The target achievement levels for both performance targets are calculated on this basis, the 
arithmetic mean of which corresponds to the STI target achievement level."
"The entry threshold 
for the STI target achievement level was set at 80%."
"If it is achieved, it corresponds to a payment 
of 50% of the STI component."
There is no STI entitlement below this entry threshold.
"Similarly, 
the maximum payment is capped at 200%, which is payable if the maximum STI target achieve-
ment of 120% is reached."
"Between the entry threshold, the 100% level and maximum STI target 
achievement, the payment percentage is interpolated on a straight line in each case."
"The ESG targets, their level and the 
target achievement ranges are also set annually by the Supervisory Board, taking corporate 
planning into account."
"The corresponding ESG multiplier is derived from the achievement of the 
ESG targets and takes the form of a scaled increase or reduction in the STI payment, based on the 
achievement of the financial targets, of up to 20% – ESG multiplier between 0.800 and 1.200."
"If the term of office of a new Executive Board member starts during a fiscal year, the entitle-
ment to the STI for that fiscal year is granted on a pro rata temporis basis."
"Target achievement for the adjusted EBIT performance criteria is calculated as the arithmetic 
mean of the corresponding payment percentage for the fiscal years in the performance period 
using the same method as is used to determine the STI payment percentage."
"Achievement of the TSR target for each year in the performance period is derived by compar-
ing the average performance of shares in MTU and the reference index in the 30 trading days 
immediately prior to the end of the fiscal year or the end of the preceding fiscal years."
"The 
entry threshold for the TSR target component has been set at a relative performance versus the 
reference index of –10 percentage points."
This corresponds to a payment of 50%.
"The maximum 
TSR target achievement is outperformance of the index by +10 percentage points, correspond-
ing to an LTI payment level of 200%."
"Analogously to the STI, the TSR target achievement level is 
interpolated on a straight line between the entry threshold, and a relative performance of zero 
and maximum target achievement."
"The RSP / LTI payment percentage for the three-year performance period is calculated as the 
arithmetic mean of the multi-year achievement of the adjusted EBIT target or the related adjust-
ed EBIT payment percentage and the TSR target achievement or the associated TSR payment 
percentage."
"The RSP / LTI payment percentage is based on a scale of between 0% to 200% based 
on the target direct compensation agreed with the individual Executive Board member."
"If the term of office of a new Executive Board member starts during a fiscal year, the entitle-
ment to the RSP / LTI is granted on a pro rata temporis basis."
"For those years in which the individual served a full 
year on the Executive Board, the actual target achievement for the year is used."
"If an RSP / LTI is granted for the reporting period, settlement takes the form of a taxable cash 
payment, which is paid on the condition that, after deduction of individual income tax, it will be 
used for the purchase of MTU shares; these are subject to a four-year lock-up period."
"Further rules on compensation
All Executive Board members appointed prior to fiscal year 2021 received direct defined benefit 
pension commitments."
"The structure of these commitments is outlined below in the section 
Rules when terminating the contracts of Executive Board members."
"Instead of such defined benefit 
entitlements, Executive Board members appointed after January 1, 2021 receive an annual 
pension allowance as a contribution to a pension plan."
"Further, the compensation system for the Executive Board contains penalty and claw-back 
rules."
"This enables the Supervisory Board, at its discretion, to reduce performance-related com-
ponents that have not been paid out (penalty clause) or claim reimbursement of performance- 
related components that have already been paid (claw-back clause)."
"The share ownership guidelines require the CEO and the other members of the Executive Board 
to acquire shares in MTU equivalent to 300% (CEO) and 200% (other Executive Board members) 
respectively of their gross annual basic salary within four years."
"Shares acquired through the 
RSP are included."
"All Executive Board members fulfilled this individual obligation in the report-
ing period."
"The shares held in compliance with the share ownership guidelines are subject to a 
two-year lock-up period when a member leaves the Executive Board."
"Under Section 87a (2) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in specific excep-
tional circumstances (e.g."
"in the event of a serious financial or economic crisis), the Supervisory 
Board may temporarily depart from the defined compensation system if this is in the long-term 
interests of MTU."
"General unfavorable market developments explicitly do not constitute specific 
exceptional circumstances permitting temporary departure from the compensation system."
"Departure from the compensation system is only possible on the basis of a corresponding reso-
lution by the Supervisory Board, based on a proposal by the Personnel Committee, after careful 
examination of its necessity."
"Even in such cases, the compensation must still be geared to the 
long-term and sustainable development of MTU and reflect the success of the company and the 
performance of the Executive Board."
"The components of the compensation system where such departures are permitted in the 
circumstances outlined above are the performance criteria for the STI and RSP and their 
weighting, the ranges for possible achievement of the targets and the methods used to deter-
mine target achievement."
In accordance with Section 87a (1) sentence 2 no.
"1 of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG), the Supervisory Board has set a maximum level of compensation for each member of 
the Executive Board."
"This comprises all fixed and variable components (fixed compensation, 
fringe benefits, pension arrangements, STI, and RSP / LTI)."
"The maximum compensation caps 
the total compensation granted for a fiscal year, irrespective of the time of payment."
"It is €5.5 
million for the Chairman of the Executive Board and €3.0 million for the other Executive Board 
members and thus unchanged from the previous year."
"Special attention has been paid to the ongoing development of the performance-relat-
ed components, especially the performance-related long-term component."
"The rules on pension 
arrangements are unchanged."
The STI remains a performance-related component with a short-term incentive effect.
"Within 
this structure, the previous performance-related financial key performance indicators, adjust-
ed EBIT and free cash flow, will be supplemented by non-financial ESG performance criteria."
"The payment of the STI will therefore be based on the level of achievement of financial and 
non-financial performance criteria."
"To this extent, the new compensation system takes account 
of the increasing significance of ESG / sustainability aspects of corporate governance and the 
corresponding demands made by investors."
"Furthermore, the introduction of a strategic multiplier enables the Supervisory Board to reward 
the success of the Executive Board in implementing specific strategic and transformative 
measures."
"As in the previous system, the STI targets and the corresponding target achievement 
curves and thus the entry thresholds and caps on target achievement / payment percentages 
will be set by the Supervisory Board at the beginning of each fiscal year."
"The previous performance-related long-term incentive component, the Restricted Stock Plan 
(RSP / LTI), is to be replaced by a Performance Share Plan (PSP / LTI)."
"The planned introduction 
of the PSP / LTI will grant a market-oriented, long-term incentive (LTI) that correlates better 
with investors’ expectations."
"In particular, payment will reflect both financial performance 
criteria and non-financial ESG performance criteria."
"The performance period has been extended to four years, compris-
ing the grant year and the following three years."
"Further details of the planned modification of the compensation system for the Executive Board 
and supplementary criteria, penalty and clawback rules, share ownership guidelines, etc."
"can 
be found in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting 2024."
"Consequently, the entry threshold for target 
achievement for the STI was exceeded in the reporting period and the target achievement level, 
as outlined above, was therefore 139.25% (previous year: 200%)."
"The ESG multiplier for the STI, based 
on achievement in the reporting period, is applied in accordance with the contractual ruling."
"A target range of 80 – 120% was 
set for each of these criteria."
"Compared with the previous year, the basis used to measure target 
achievement for the non-financial “CO2” performance criterion was extended to include two 
further Group companies – in Vancouver and Serbia (both part of the MRO segment)."
"Conse-
quently, all fully consolidated production / maintenance location are integrated into MTU’s 
climate protection strategy, the ecoRoadmap, which aims to achieve climate-neutral production 
and maintenance activity at MTU’s sites or to systematically reduce their CO2 emissions."
"The 
most important elements of this multi-faceted strategy are: higher energy efficiency, captive 
generation of sustainable energy at the site, procurement of low-emission energy sources such 
as green electricity, and emissions compensation."
"By setting specific climate goals, MTU wants 
to play a part in achieving the climate targets set out in the Paris Agreement."
"Consequently, 
the performance period differs from the reporting period."
"Target achievement for the subcompo-
nent “CO2 abatement realized through sustainable measures in kt CO2 absolute” is determined 
using the emission factors for the baseline year 2019 – the year when MTU introduced its 
“ecoRpadmap” climate strategy."
"The maintenance operation (Group company) in Vancouver, Canada included for the first time 
in 2023 was already operational in 2019, so it increases the CO2 emissions in the baseline year 
2019."
"All CO2 emissions from this site contribute to emissions in the context of organic growth 
but do not increase the emissions measured in the baseline year 2019."
"When evaluating the 
climate protection measures realized at this site, the first year of operation (2023) is therefore 
taken as the baseline."
"The planned emissions from this site in 2023 form the basis for the sub-
component “CO2 abatement through sustainable measures in kt CO2 absolute” and are therefore 
included in the definition of the overall target for this subcomponent."
"For the Nova Pazova site, 
the common country-specific emissions factor for each energy source for 2023 is used."
"In this way, integration of the target values for the new locations takes into account the require-
ments set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"The two subcomponents are considered separately and, in particular, not cumulatively."
"Further-
more, measurement of target achievement for the non-financial targets is based on an integral 
view of MTU’s global production / maintenance locations in Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde, 
Rzeszów, Vancouver and Nova Pazova."
"For the non-financial performance criterion “CO2,” at the beginning of 2023 the Supervisory 
Board defined 54 kt remaining CO2 emissions as 100% target achievement for the subcom-
ponent “maximum remaining CO2 emissions in kt CO2 absolute”."
"For the component “CO2 
abatement realized through sustainable measures in kt CO2 absolute”, the Supervisory Board 
defined a reduction in CO2 of 3.54 kt compared with the audited baseline year (2019) as the 
basis for 100% target achievement in the reporting period."
"Target achievement for the ESG target “CO2” is de-
rived as the arithmetic mean of the target achievement of the subcomponents, with a minimum 
CO2 target achievement of 80% and a maximum target achievement of 120%."
"Thanks to reduction in CO2 emissions and the additional purchase of green power, the “maxi-
mum remaining CO2 emissions in kt CO2 absolute” for the relevant performance period of the 
reporting period were just 49 kt CO2, which was 9% below the target of 54 kt CO2."
"Therefore, the 
corresponding target achievement for this component is 109%."
The corresponding target achievement level is therefore 128%.
"The arithmetic mean of the target achievement of each of the subcomponents gives a target 
achievement level of 119% for the ESG (non-financial) target “CO2” in the reporting period."
"Achievement of the non-financial (ESG) performance criterion “number of training days per 
employee” was derived from the average training days per employee at the German locations 
(Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde), based on training undertaken in the period January 1, 2023 
through December 9, 2023."
"In this way, the company sets a strategic, forward-looking focus on 
proactive learning and individual development as a prerequisite for the recruitment and reten-
tion of employees, who realize their potential and put their ideas into practice."
"Through this 
ESG target, the company is strengthening its established leadership values “we transform”, “we 
empower”, and “we create trust”, for all managerial staff by making the employee leadership 
and development process a central management focus."
"For the ESG target “number 
of training days per employee,” the Supervisory Board defined an average of 2.5 training days 
per employee at the German locations as 100% target achievement."
"The target range is between 
80% and 120%."
"A target achievement level of 80% is defined as 2 training days per employee, 
while 3 training days per employee equate to target achievement of 120%."
"The average number of training days per employee at the Germany locations was 3.6 in 2023, so 
target achievement for the criterion “number of training days per employee” is 120%."
"The target achievement levels of 119% for the ESG target “CO2” and 120% for the “number of 
training days per employee” target give an arithmetic mean of 119.50% and an ESG multiplier of 
1.195."
"Restricted Stock Plan (RSP) / Long Term Incentive (LTI)
The value of the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP or LTI – long-term incentive) is based on the con-
tractually agreed RSP grant value and the realized multi-year RSP / LTI performance level."

Compensation for the reporting period
The following table contains an individual breakdown of the compensation of each Executive

sation of €5.5 million for the CEO and €3.0 million for each of the other Executive Board members 
was not exceeded in any case."
"Former Executive Board members received pension payments of €908,259 in the reporting period 
(Reiner Winkler €601,634; Dr. Rainer Martens €306,625)."
"The following table shows the change in the individual compensation of the Executive Board and 
Supervisory Board members, the earnings indicators for the company and the Group and the 
average compensation of the workforce."
"Moreover, the review of the target direct compensation of the Executive Board members is per-
formed on a multi-year basis, as in the past, and not on a one-year basis, as is the case for the rest 
of the workforce."
"It is always benchmarked using a comparison within the relevant stock market 
segment (horizontal comparison): MTU has been included in the DAX segment since 2019; before 
that it was in the MDAX segment."
"⁄
To date, the review of the target direct compensation of the Executive Board members has 
been performed on a multi-year basis, whereas the review and adjustment of compensation 
for the remaining workforce has been performed annually."
"⁄
Moreover, when considering the development of the target direct compensation of Executive 
Board members, structural aspects need to be taken into account; in particular, these include 
the rising demands made on the Executive Board following MTU’s inclusion in the DAX stock 
market segment."

"Consequently, the net profit of MTU Aero Engines AG is not a suitable reference 
base for performance-related compensation components, which regularly take into account 
financial and non-financial targets for the Group."
"Therefore, the adjusted EBIT for the Group 
is included in the vertical comparison as an additional earnings indicator as it is used as the 
financial performance indicator for the performance-oriented compensation components of both 
the Executive Board and the entire workforce in Germany."
"In all compensation groups evaluat-
ed, the calculation of the annual changes in compensation excludes company pension schemes."
"Perspective for the compensation of the Executive Board members in/for 
2024
The compensation system for Executive Board members is to be modified from fiscal year 2024 
– provided that this is approved by the Annual General Meeting 2024."
"The financial and non-fi-
nancial / strategic targets of relevance for the performance-related compensation components 
for the Executive Board for 2024 will be set in parallel with the preparation of the compensation 
report and the audited consolidated financial statements for 2023."
"In view of the sensitivity of 
the forecasts on which the targets are based, in keeping with the procedure used in the year un-
der review and previous periods, they will be published in the compensation report 2024."
"The 
aforementioned financial and non-financial targets are naturally consistent with the forward 
looking statements in the management report (forecast and non-financial statement) in the 
Annual Report 2024."
"Executive Board members appointed after January 1, 2021 receive a pension allowance as a 
contribution to a pension plan, paid out annually in cash, instead of the pension commitment 
outlined above."
"This enables Executive Board members to take responsibility for building up 
their personal pension provision at their own discretion."
"Granting a pension allowance relieves 
MTU of the opportunities and risks related to defined benefit commitments."
"The benefit target is to provide a pension amounting to 60% of 
the basic salary after 15 years of service on the Executive Board."
"To replace any MTU pension entitlements earned by individual Executive Board members prior 
to their appointment to the Executive Board, they are granted an initial transfer amount equal 
to their individually earned pension capital."
"Once the initial transfer amount has been determined, a pension account is opened for each el-
igible member of the Executive Board, to which further capital units are credited annually."
"The 
annual capital units are determined on the basis of the individual Executive Board member’s 
contribution and an age-related factor."
"The age-related factor represents an interest rate of 6% 
p.a."
"The contribution period is normally limited to 15 years of service on 
the Executive Board and ends at the age of 60."
"From the age of 61, the pension account earns 
interest at 4% p.a."
until the pension is drawn (= bonus amount).
"The total of the accrued capital 
units, plus the initial transfer amount and any bonus amounts credited, make up the pension 
capital available to finance post-employment benefits."
"The amount credited is based on the contribution paid at the time of 
exit."
"When an insured event occurs, the pension capital is generally granted as a one-time payment."
"At the request of the Executive Board member and subject to the Group’s approval already 
granted, a lifelong annuity may be granted, based on interest of 6% on the pension capital and 
benefit increases of 1% p.a."
"Alternatively, at the request of the Executive Board member, the 
capital may be drawn in 10 installments, with a 4% increase in each case."
"When an insured 
event occurs, the pension account is topped up to the level of benefit commitment under the 
plan (guaranteed capital)."
"Pension benefits do not become payable until an insured event occurs 
(i.e., on reaching pensionable age, or in the event of disability or death), even if the insured 
party leaves the Executive Board."
The pension entitlement is vested from inception.
"2)	 
Level of benefits to which the insured party would have been entitled under the previous pension plan."
"3)	 
All entitlements to company pension benefits (excluding the individual employee-funded capital account [""Pension Capital 
Aufbaukonto""]) taking into account the maximum contribution period."
"The differences in the annual contributions to the pension accounts result from the remaining 
periods of service until the end of the respective maximum contribution period, the respective 
age-related factors, and the individual amounts of pensionable compensation."
"2)	 
In the reporting period, the IFRS pension expenses (IAS 19) were influenced by past service costs in connection with the 
adjustment of the basic compensation as of January 1, 2024, which determines the respective pension commitment."
"3)	 
In the reporting period, the IFRS pension expenses (IAS 19) were influenced to a large extent by past service costs in 
connection with the adjustment of the basic compensation due to appointment as CEO effective January 1, 2023."
"The defined benefit obligations (DBO) for former members of the Executive Board, measured in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), amount to €22,113,042 
(previous year: €9,542,940)."
"If the contract of service is terminated by MTU or the Executive Board member 
subject to the period of notice, the Executive Board member is entitled to a pro-rata STI or RSP / 
LTI payment for the remaining term of the contract."
"of the German 
Securities Trading Act (WpHG), acquires the majority of the voting rights and this results in 
material disadvantages for the Executive Board."
"In such case, 
each member of the Executive Board shall have a special right of termination, which is to be 
exercised within a period of six months, with a period of notice of three months to the end of a 
month."
"For the calculation of the severance payment, 100% target fulfillment is agreed for 
the variable compensation components."
"Compensation of the Supervisory Board
The rules governing Supervisory Board compensation are laid down in the articles of associ-
ation of MTU Aero Engines AG."
"The compensation is relative to the size of the Group and the 
duties and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board members."
"Pursuant to Article 12 of the current articles of association of MTU Aero Engines AG, members 
of the Supervisory Board receive fixed annual compensation of €80,000, payable after the end of 
the fiscal year."
"The chair of the Supervisory Board receives three times and the deputy one-and-
a-half times the amount of fixed compensation."
"In addition to this compensation, members serv-
ing on one of the Supervisory Board’s committees receive an additional €20,000 for the fiscal 
year and a further €40,000 for the fiscal year if they chair a committee."
"Furthermore, members 
of the Supervisory Board receive an attendance fee of €3,000 per meeting of the Supervisory 
Board and its committees, limited to €3,000 per day."
"Expenses incurred in connection with the 
exercise of their office are reimbursed, as is any value-added tax payable on compensation."
"The 
members of the Supervisory Board do not receive any share-based compensation."
"The following table contains an individualized breakdown of the compensation of each Supervi-
sory Board member in the reporting period (figures exclude value-added tax)."
"The fixed annual 
payment and compensation for committee membership are disclosed as compensation owed and 
comprise the compensation for the reporting period paid out at the start of the following year."
"The attendance fees are disclosed as compensation granted and are the amounts paid to each 
member in the reporting period."

"Responsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board
The management and the Supervisory Board of MTU Aero Engines AG are responsible for the 
preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, in accordance with 
the requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"The management and the Supervisory Board are also 
responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the prepara-
tion of the remuneration report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error."
"Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the relat-
ed disclosures, based on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in accordance with the German 
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der 
Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Those standards require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free 
from material misstatement."
"An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts, includ-
ing the related disclosures, in the remuneration report."
"The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s professional judgement."
"This includes an assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in the remuneration report, including the related 
disclosures."
"In assessing these risks, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant 
for the preparation of the remuneration report, including the related disclosures."
"The objective 
is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control."
"An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the Supervisory Board, as 
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report, including the related 
disclosures."
"We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion."
"Opinion
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the remuneration report 
for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, including the related disclosures, 
complies in all material respects with the financial reporting requirements of Section 162 AktG."
"As we have issued an unqualified 
opinion on the substantive audit of the remuneration report, this opinion includes the con-
clusion that the disclosures pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) AktG have been made, in all

"Content of internet sites referred to in the combined management report are not components of the com-
bined management report and are not audited; such references are for information purposes only."
"The MTU Group
Business activities and markets
MTU’s portfolio covers the entire lifecycle of commercial and military aircraft engines and  
aero-derivative industrial gas turbines."
"The company’s activities range from development,  
manufacturing and marketing to maintenance."
"MTU has technological expertise in low-pressure turbines, high-pressure compressors and 
turbine center frames, and in repair techniques and manufacturing processes."
"Through risk- and 
revenue-sharing partnerships, it is involved in important national and international technology 
programs and cooperates with the top names in the industry (GE Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney 
and Rolls-Royce)."
The Group also provides maintenance services for commercial aircraft engines.
"In the military 
sector, it has been the leading industrial partner to the German armed forces for decades."
"MTU operates in two segments: the OEM business (Original Equipment Manufacturing) and 
MRO business (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul)."
"The OEM segment covers new commercial 
engines, including spare parts, and the whole of the military sector."
"The MRO segment comprises 
the commercial maintenance activities."
"Group structure, locations and organization
Through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and equity investments, MTU has a presence in all key

Corporate strategy
MTU’s corporate strategy is geared to profitable growth, customer satisfaction and sustain-
ability."
"In addition to financial indicators, it therefore takes ecological and social aspects into 
account."
"The four target areas of MTU’s growth strategy are:
A balanced product portfolio – Participation in rapidly growing new programs
MTU focuses on rapidly growing and high-volume commercial and military engines and works 
with various partners."
"It optimizes its risk profile and growth opportunities through continuous 
participation in varying thrust classes and fields of application."
"There will 
also be a cargo version of the Boeing 777X."
"MTU’s solid positioning in the MRO segment is partly 
due to these programs, as the company has secured itself a share of the future aftermarket service 
business through its stakes in these engine programs."
"In the commercial maintenance business, the company is driving forward the expansion of its 
portfolio of products and services, including digital services, to enhance customer satisfaction and 
continuously broaden its customer base."
"In the military business, extensive work started on the new FCAS (Future Combat Air System), 
following placement of the order at the end of 2022."
"Belgium now wants to join the European cooperation program alongside 
Germany, France and Spain and make a financial contribution."
"The development of the new digital engine control & monitoring unit (DECMU) for the EJ200 
program is proceeding on schedule."
"Initial tests should be performed in 2024, with certification 
expected in 2025."
"DECMU will replace the previous technology and therefore help to secure the 
future of this engine and support the future development of the aircraft and engine as part of the 
long-term evolution (LTE) of the Eurofighter."
"In combina-
tion with optimized cyclic processes, the aim for the mid term is to raise the efficiency of MTU’s 
core modules – the low-pressure turbine, high-pressure compressor and turbine center frame – 
and reduce their weight, in order to increase profitability and environmental friendliness."
"In line with the overriding objective of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, specific 
targets are being defined for aviation."
"One example is ACARE Flightpath 2050 “Fly the Green 
Deal.” Alongside a specific CO2 target, this sets targets for non-CO2 effects, for example, due to 
emissions of nitrogen oxides and the formation of condensation trails."
"MTU published a revised 
version of its Claire (Clean Air Engine) technology agenda in 2022."
"The declared aim is to bring 
onto the market products that enable climate-neutral or emission-free flying well before 2050."
"MTU is therefore stepping up research into future-oriented propulsion concepts, together with 
its partners in industry, science and research."
"Claire therefore defines time horizons, targets 
and possibilities for implementation for the three areas of aviation: short-, medium-, and long-
haul flights."
"The water-enhanced turbofan (WET), a revolutionary gas turbine-based propulsion 
concept, can significantly reduce all emissions that impact the climate."
"In addition, MTU is 
working on the Flying Fuel Cell (FFC) for full electrification of the powertrain."
"A fuel cell con-
verts liquid hydrogen into electricity, which is used to drive electric motors."
"The aim is to develop demonstration versions of both concepts as part of the national aviation 
research program and, in a European context, through Clean Aviation."
"In addition to alternative propulsion systems, on the road to climate-neutral aviation, sustain-
able aviation fuels (SAFs) play an important role."
"They have the potential to significantly reduce 
the climate impact of aviation with the engines currently used in aircraft."
"MTU is therefore 
playing a part in this field, for example, as a founding member of the association aireg (Aviation 
Initiative for Renewable Energy in Germany e.V.) and as a strategic partner in several projects 
to set up SAF production facilities."
"Alongside technical improvements to products, the digitali-
zation of products, services and value-creation processes is growing in importance."
"Here, MTU’s 
activities are geared primarily to reducing lead times and expenses, for example in development 
by making extensive use of simulation techniques in all disciplines through to full integration 
in the virtual engine."
"Enhanced competitiveness – Increased productivity accompanied  
by a reduction in capital tie-up
MTU encourages a culture of continuous improvement in order to secure its competitiveness 
and further increase customer satisfaction."
"The focus here is on optimizing structures, process-
es and capital tie-up in all areas of the company."
"Digitalization and automation technologies 
play a key role here."
MTU’s most important task is fulfilling its delivery obligations.
"To this end, in the Technology 
division it has introduced a lean matrix organization based on material flows to achieve a fur-
ther improvement in collaboration, smooth processes and greater efficiency."
"The goal is to continuously optimize MTU’s supply chain and its production and service net-
work in terms of delivery capability, quality and costs."
"Profitability and competitiveness are to 
be enhanced further by high investment in maintenance and repair shops in countries where 
wage costs are low."
"In addition to its production activities, MTU is also increasingly building up support activities 
and processes at its locations in Poland and Serbia."
"In addition, this gives it extended access to 
skilled employees."
"Along with measures to improve productivity and customer satisfaction, MTU is also concen-
trating on its ambitions to reduce CO2 emissions at its production locations."
"The “ecoRoadmap” 
climate strategy was initially introduced at the Munich location in 2021."
"Since 2023, it has 
been applied globally at all production sites in Germany and abroad."
"The goal is to reduce CO2 
emissions by 60% compared with 2019."
"Employees and corporate culture – Networked teams in a creative  
environment 
Highly motivated, skilled workers are crucial to the successful development of the MTU Group."
"MTU’s corporate culture places emphasis on personal development and achievement coupled 
with a strong sense of social responsibility."
"The trend toward digitalization is set to change the work environment and tried-and-tested man-
agement methods."
"More scope and greater responsibility for employees as well as short decision 
paths are key elements of an effective corporate culture."
"All employees are encouraged and 
empowered to contribute their own ideas and translate them collaboratively into new products 
and services, innovative business models and improved processes."
"The company promotes cultural and individual diversity, flexible working conditions and 
high-quality basic and further training opportunities for its workforce."
"The roadmap for the ongoing development of the corporate culture sets the following focal areas 
for the coming years: greater diversity and internationality, entrepreneurial action at all levels, 
a digital mindset, networking and collaboration, and alignment with the hybrid world of work."
The development of this corporate culture is supported by targeted tools and methods.
"The HR 
strategy was updated in 2023 and comprises six core elements, which aim to keep MTU on a 
profitable growth track: strategic human resources planning, talent management and manage-
ment development, attractiveness as an employer, and adaptation of the HR organization and 
IT systems."
"The continuous development of the leadership values, innovation management and 
innovative corporate culture strengthens MTU’s overarching corporate vision: “We shape the 
future of aviation.”
Last year, the top management defined the long-term strategy for the MTU Group up to 2030."
"The overarching areas that form the backbone of this strategy are human resources, digita-
lization and a global presence."
"They are long-term success factors in a constantly changing 
environment:
	
⁄
Human resources: The global structure of the MTU team, combined with a strong employer 
brand and contemporary talent and skills management ensure the necessary capacity and 
competencies."
"⁄
Digitalization: Scalable and resilient IT networks the entire company and facilitates smooth 
global business processes and collaboration."
"⁄
Global presence: Establishing and extending locations, especially on a best-cost basis, and 
the adapted management structure support MTU’s growth options."
"Key performance indicators
The implementation of MTU’s corporate strategy, which is focused on profitable growth, customer 
satisfaction and sustainability, is managed through key financial and non-financial performance 
indicators adopted by the Executive Board."
"These performance metrics are derived from corporate 
planning and provide guidance for management of the company in its focus on sustainable and 
profitable growth of the company."
Specific attention is paid to ecological and social aspects.
"To 
facilitate decisions that create a suitable environment for implementing the corporate strategy, 
the manufacturing and support functions are supported by a central risk management, internal 
control and compliance management system."
"Based on agreement between the Executive Board 
and Supervisory Board, the central financial performance indicators, supplemented by focused 
non-financial performance indicators, are incentivized as part of a value-based compensation 
system for the Executive Board and senior executives."
"For a definition of adjusted EBIT, which is the central financial indicator of operational  
profitability, please see the reconciliation to adjusted key performance figures in the Results of 
operations section."
"Another indicator monitored by the company is the adjusted EBIT margin, 
which shows the relationship between adjusted EBIT and adjusted revenue."
"For a definition of the free cash flow KPI, which MTU calculates from a combination of the cash 
flow from operating activities and investing activities, adjusted for non-recurring cash flows, 
please see the liquidity analysis in the Financial situation section."
MTU’s key performance indicators will be revised from 2024 onwards.
"Alongside the financial 
KPIs outlined above, they now include adjusted earnings per share and the non-financial KPIs 
defined below."
"Adjusted earnings per share is a ratio of adjusted net income to the weighted average number of 
shares in circulation."
"The 
performance period for CO2 abatement is longer than for the financial KPIs."
"While previous goals such as those set 
out by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe in Flightpath 2050 
focused exclusively on the direct CO2 effects on the climate, in the future, the entire climate im-
pact of aviation will be taken into consideration."
"That includes non-CO2 effects such as the climate 
impact of emissions of nitrogen oxides and water, as well as the impact of condensation trails, 
which increase cloud formation."
"As an intermediate step towards meeting the goal of the Paris 
Agreement, the European Green Deal defines a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 
2030 and the achievement of climate neutrality by 2050."
"In July 2021, the European Commission 
presented the “Fit for 55” package containing measures to help achieve these targets."
"Examples 
are revising the European emissions trading system and the introduction of a minimum quota 
for the use of sustainable aviation fuels."
"Alongside such measures, there is a need, above all, for 
innovative solutions for aircraft and engines."
"MTU has established technological leadership in its core competencies of low-pressure turbines, 
high-pressure compressors, turbine center frames, and high-tech manufacturing processes and 
repair techniques."
"This is the basis for continued systematic development of the present gas tur-
bine-powered engines and for revolutionary new propulsion systems."
"MTU’s main area of activity in the evolutionary development of gas turbine-powered engines is 
raising efficiency in order to minimize climate and health-related emissions."
"This will be achieved, 
on the one hand, by a further reduction in the fan pressure ratio, thereby increasing thrust 
efficiency."
"On the other hand, thermal efficiency will be increased by improving the efficiency of 
components and higher temperature and overall pressure ratios."
"Weight and dimensions also have 
a major influence on energy consumption."
"Here too, continuous improvement is the goal."
"MTU’s mid- and long-term targets for the development of new commercial engines are aligned to 
the European Green Deal as an intermediate step towards achieving the overarching goal of the 
Paris Agreement."
"The MTU technology agenda Claire (Clean Air Engine) translates these into 
targets at the level of drive systems and serves as the guide for technology and innovation."
"Stage 1 is the Geared Turbofan (GTF), which was developed in partnership with Pratt & Whit-
ney and entered series production in early 2016 for the Airbus A320neo."
"The GTF reduces fuel 
consumption and hence CO2 emissions by around 16% compared with the IAE V2500 (see also 
Commercial engine programs)."
"The improved product, the Pratt & Whitney GTF Advantage, reduces 
CO2 emissions even further."
"Stage 2 of Claire aims to achieve a considerable improvement in the climate impact of aviation 
through revolutionary gas turbine-based concepts and electric propulsion systems based on fuel 
cells."
"One of the most promising gas turbine concepts is the water-enhanced turbofan engine,  
a system developed by MTU that considerably reduces all climate-related emissions."
"A second  
system being developed as part of Claire stage 2 is the Flying Fuel Cell (FFC), a fully electric  
system based on a hydrogen fuel cell."
"This system is almost entirely emission-free and could be 
used in an initial product for smaller aircraft within the scheduled timeframe of 2035+."
"Claire stage 3 concentrates on two areas: the use of the revolutionary concepts in the widest  
possible range of applications and optimization of energy consumption."
"Although these concepts 
are largely climate-neutral, minimizing energy consumption is vital to reduce pressure on  
resources and cut costs."
"Technologies for engines of the future
Commercial engine programs
The most significant innovation in the area of aircraft engines in recent decades is the Geared 
Turbofan (GTF) engine developed by MTU in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney."
"Unlike conven-
tional turbofans, in which the fan and low-pressure turbine run at the same speed on a single 
shaft, the GTF links the two components using a reduction gear."
"This allows the fan with its 
larger radius to rotate more slowly, while the low-pressure turbine rotates faster."
"What is more, the engine is lighter 
because the low-pressure turbine and low-pressure compressor require fewer stages."
"In the GTF project, MTU is responsible for developing and manufacturing the high-speed 
low-pressure turbine, the front half of the high-pressure compressor and four brush seals."
"Fur-
thermore, MTU is responsible for final assembly of one-third of the serially produced engines 
for the Airbus A320neo – which is performed in Munich – and carries out the acceptance tests 
for these engines."
It is also a partner in the MRO network.
"As of November 2023, the engines in the Geared Turbofan family had clocked up more than  
26 million flight hours."
"Arithmetically, they had avoided over 14 million metric tons of CO2 
compared with comparable use of the previous model."
"From 2025, Pratt & Whitney 
and MTU will offer the Pratt & Whitney GTF Advantage for the A320neo, an even more efficient 
PW1100G-JM engine with higher thrust, which will increase range and loading capacity."
"The 
increased efficiency is attributable to improvements in the MTU components."
"For the next generation of the Geared Turbofan, the aim is to achieve a further increase in the 
lifecycle of components as well as a further reduction in fuel consumption."
"The reduction in 
fuel consumption should be achieved primarily by a further increase in the efficiency of the 
components, combined with higher overall pressure ratios."
"To achieve this, for example, highly 
complex 3D blade designs need to be implemented in a very small space."
"An increase in the 
lifecycle of components should be achieved, for example, through new coatings and optimized 
design concepts."
Key technologies are therefore also required for production and assembly.
"When it comes to engines of the highest thrust class for long-haul aircraft, MTU is participating 
in GE Aerospace’s GE9X for the new Boeing 777X by developing and manufacturing the turbine 
center frame."
"Military engine programs
The EJ200 engine powers the Eurofighter and is in service with numerous air forces."
"In 2023, 
MTU successfully continued the development of a new digital engine control & monitoring unit 
(DECMU) which it embarked on in 2021 to secure the future of this engine."
The first DECMU-NG for further start-up and integration activities was assembled in 2023.
"The 
validation round for the flightworthy standard (FWS) is planned for mid-2024."
"An engine test is 
planned for early 2025."
"Germany, France and Spain are planning to introduce the new Future Combat Air System 
(FCAS) from 2040."
"A key component in this system is a new fighter jet, which is scheduled 
to come into service as from 2040."
"A central element in this new jet is the Next European 
Fighter Engine, for which MTU and Safran will be the joint lead for development, production 
and after-sales support."
"Two design phases involving MTU, Safran, ITP, Dassault and Airbus 
GmbH (Germany) / Airbus SAU (Spain) were successfully completed by the end of 2021."
"In the 
reporting period, work continued on the design studies and an intensive technology preparation 
phase started."
"New areas of business
The WET (water-enhanced turbofan) is a further development of the conventional gas turbine 
engine."
"It can reduce all climate-related emissions, thereby further reducing the overall climate 
impact."
"SWITCH (Sustainable Water-Injected Turbofan Comprising Hybrid electrics), a project 
funded through the Clean Aviation initiative, was launched in the reporting period."
"In this project, 
MTU will be developing technologies for the hybrid-electric water-enhanced turbofan with the 
industrial partners Pratt & Whitney, Airbus, Collins and GKN as well as academic partners."
"Fuel cells powered by green hydrogen have the potential to enable almost emission-free flying 
in the longer term."
"Propulsion systems based on the Flying Fuel Cell (FFC) that are suitable for 
aircraft are not yet available."
"All known demonstration platforms are based on solutions from the 
automotive sector."
"Unlike aircraft applications, weight and parasitic load play a secondary role in 
the automotive sector."
"A positive decision was received from the Clean Aviation initiative on the project application 
HEROPS (Hydrogen-Electric Zero Emission Propulsion System)."
"This project will develop and 
assemble a demonstration unit for ground testing."
"In addition, MTU has acquired eMoSys GmbH, 
an innovative developer of electric motors based in Starnberg, Germany."
"Digitalization
In the context of its digitalization strategy, MTU is examining the entire product lifecycle and 
the entire value chain from development to manufacture and maintenance."
"Interdisciplinary 
working groups have translated the company-specific needs and requirements of the manufac-
turing and support units into digitalization roadmaps and consolidated and prioritized them 
for the group."
"The roadmaps for individual units and topics define the specific areas of work, 
divided into time horizons of three, five and ten years."
"Establishing internal structures ensures 
efficient management and processing of the topics."
"One example is the Digi Board, a central 
body whose role is to prioritize the right projects from a strategic viewpoint on the basis of a 
cross-functional definition of requirements so that they can be completed efficiently."
"The main focus here is on networking data, interdisciplinary cooperation 
and automated design optimization."
"Working with a model-based value chain is a key basis for 
this."
"As well as speeding up the development phase by providing more robust predictions, these 
modules principally aim to reduce production and maintenance costs and increase the quality 
of components."
"New design methods were developed, in particular, for revolutionary engine concepts, where 
conventional design methods can no longer be used."
"The highly interdisciplinary nature of 
these concepts requires a far more detailed overview of the interaction between the aircraft and 
engine because the key to leveraging their potential essentially lies in intelligent integration 
and the use of artificial intelligence."
"To this end, MTU has acquired new insights and capabili-
ties, especially in the field of system engineering."
"Materials
Robust, advanced materials and the protective coatings required for them are key technologies 
that MTU is steadily driving forward for use in the next generation of the Geared Turbofan."
"For the development of the Next European Fighter Engine, there is a need for new materials 
that can withstand high stress levels throughout operation."
"The future focus will be on poly-
mer-based fiber-reinforced composites and powder metallurgy materials."
"Based on this, new technology projects were launched with universities, research institutes and 
industrial partners in the reporting period."
"The revolutionary water-enhanced turbofan (WET) and Flying Fuel Cell (FFC) concepts require 
greatly modified or completely new materials and coatings."
"For example, these have to be 
suitable for conditions where there is a high vapor content (in the case of WET) or for the use 
of hydrogen (in the case of FFC)."
"MTU is already working on these topics in cooperation with 
universities and industrial partners."
"In parallel with this, MTU is extending its capabilities to simulate the manufacture of materials 
and on the correlation of their properties."
"This requires modern material database structures 
and fundamental material models."
"Manufacturing and maintenance technologies
Additive manufacturing processes are opening the way to new methods of production."
"In this 
area, MTU is focusing on laser powder bed fusion, where the component is built up by fus-
ing very thin layers of a powder material."
"MTU uses additive manufacturing to produce the 
borescope eyepieces for PW1100G-JM engines, making it one of the first companies to use 
this technique for series production of aviation components."
"Preparations are under way to 
introduce this type of process to manufacture complex components such as bearing housings."
"The longer-term plan is to create new designs that would be either impossible or very costly to 
implement using traditional technology."
"Further optimization of the entire additive manufacturing process chain was successfully imple-
mented in 2023."
"For example, depowdering processes were automated, online process control 
was introduced and a new surface treatment process was established."
"For these blisks, which are made of nickel-based alloys, which 
are extremely difficult to process and are used in the aft stages of high-pressure compressors, 
MTU has developed a new electrochemical material-removal process (Precise Electrochemical 
Machining – PECM)."
"By working with an extremely small inter-electrode gap, in the microm-
eter range, PECM accomplishes much greater reproduction precision."
"There are also plans to 
use this technology in fields with very complex geometries."
"This applies, above all, to future 
high-pressure compressors, which have increasingly small dimensions as the overall pressure 
ratios are constantly increasing."
"Innovative technologies for the cathode design, novel genera-
tors, a newly developed type of machine and more efficient and more environmentally friendly 
electrolyte preparation are to be used."
"So far, profile grooves for turbine disks have been produced by broaching."
"Since turbine disks 
are also made of materials with high heat resistance that are time-consuming to process and 
cause heavy wear, MTU aims to transfer PECM technology from compressor blisks to turbine 
disks."
A production line is currently being installed in a dedicated production building.
"In 
parallel, proof of readiness for series production is being established."
"Series production of GTF 
turbine blisks using PECM technology is scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2024 and 
should greatly enhance the profitability of the GTF program."
"The aim is to use AI-supported algorithms and cloud solutions to considerably increase 
the capabilities of this program."
"Protecting technology assets (intellectual property)
As of November 2023, MTU’s patent portfolio contained 724 patent families (2,542 individual 
patents)."
A patent family is a set of identical patents registered in various countries.
"For instance, specimen engines are made available to 
universities and colleges, MTU experts give lectures or supervise students writing internship 
reports, theses and dissertations."
"Furthermore, students are given support with assignments 
and final reports."
"In addition, MTU honors outstanding achievements by awarding the annual 
Heilmann prize to a young scientist meriting recognition for achievements in engine technology."
"Strategic alliances are established with research partners in order to strengthen ties between 
universities and industry, and to safeguard MTU’s innovative capabilities."
"Cooperation with 
leading German universities and research institutes was stepped up during the past years."
"In 
specific areas of research, cooperation with MTU competence centers is continuously being 
extended."
"To complement its own technological focus, MTU is supporting the ramp-up of sustainable 
aviation fuels, for example, through the signature in the reporting period of a memorandum of 
understanding on a research cooperation for power-to-liquid fuels."
"Bauhaus Luftfahrt, which is based in Munich, is a visionary think tank with an international 
dimension that pursues unconventional, holistic and interdisciplinary research."
"It brings in-
dustry and science together under one roof, focusing primarily on exploring the socioeconomic, 
political and ecological aspects of aviation, designing visionary aircraft and engine systems, 
unearthing promising technologies for the future and carrying out knowledge management."
"Refund of research and development expenses principally comprises public grants for research 
and development for quieter and more fuel-efficient aircraft engines."
The Group funds its share of the research and development expenses.
"If the criteria for capital-
ization are met, the development expenses are recognized as internally generated intangible 
assets or as other assets if consideration is paid (acquired development work), and subsequently 
amortized through revenue or the cost of goods sold."
"Information on capitalized research and 
development expenses for self-generated development work can be found in Note 14."
"Intangible 
assets and goodwill and information on acquired development work can be found in Note 17."
"Acquired program assets, development work and other assets in the Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Investment in intangible assets in the OEM segment (commercial and military engine business) 
which meets the capitalization criteria relates principally to the engine programs in the Pratt & 
Whitney GTF family of engines and the PW800 program."
"The amortization of capitalized development costs recognized through revenue or the cost of 
goods sold mainly relates to the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine family."
"Further information on the special items in the impairment 
losses can be found in Note 12."
Additional disclosures relating to the income statement.
"The main factor holding back growth was the tight monetary policy 
required to check inflation."
"In October, the IMF predicted that global GDP would grow by 2.5% in 
2023, compared with 3.0% in the previous year."
Monetary policy is now having an effect.
"Higher 
interest rates and falling international raw material prices reduced the global inflation rate from 
8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023 (source: IMF)."
"In 2023, Europe posted the lowest growth of the three major economic regions."
"In the euro 
zone, the GDP growth slowed significantly, from 3.3% in 2022 to 0.7% in 2023."
"The region had to 
contend with high energy prices and record interest rates in the euro zone, as well as an export 
slowdown."
"By contrast, GDP growth in the USA remained stable at 2.1% in 2023."
"Money saved by 
households during the pandemic enabled strong consumer demand."
"In China, economic growth 
increased from 3% in 2022 to 5% during 2023, driven by the reopening of the country."
"Neverthe-
less, the recovery from the pandemic was below expectations."
"Consumer spending only improved 
slowly and the Chinese economy faced a crisis in the real estate sector."
"Sector-specific conditions within the aviation industry  
Despite the global economic challenges, the broadly based post-pandemic upswing in air traffic 
continued."
"Globally, revenue passenger kilometers (RPKs) rose by 36% in 2023 to 94% of the 
pre-crisis level of 2019 (source: IATA)."
"China reopened earlier than had been anticipated and 
this accelerated the growth in traffic in Asia by 96% compared with the previous year, bring-
ing the region to 86% of the 2019 level."
"The recovery in North America and Europe is more 
advanced: In these two regions, passenger travel grew by 15% and 20% respectively year-on-year 
and was already back at 102% and 95% of the pre-crisis level."
The recovery was also reflected in the number of passenger flights in 2023.
"Worldwide, the 
number of flights by commercial passenger aircraft increased by 24% between 2022 and 2023 
to around 97% of the 2019 level (source: Flightradar24)."
"In line with this, there was increased 
demand for maintenance – especially at MTU’s MRO locations."
"Capacity was increased to meet 
the rising demand."
"Unlike the passenger markets, the tense macroeconomic and trade policy developments had 
a negative effect on global demand for air cargo."
"Cargo tonne kilometers decreased by 1.9% 
in 2023."
"However, cargo-only aircraft, which account for the majority of global air freight by 
volume and make up 9.7% of the total fleet, continued to post good figures."
"That is particularly positive 
for MTU because the company has a strong presence in the cargo aircraft market (14.4% of 
MTU’s fleet)."
"Driven by the strong recovery of demand for passenger travel and lower fuel prices, total reve-
nue in the airline sector increased by 21.7% to U.S.$896 billion in 2023 and the sector returned 
to profit for the first time since 2019."
"Following cumulative losses of around U.S.$180 billion in 
the three years of the pandemic, the sector posted a net profit of U.S.$23.3 billion in 2023."
"The 
price of crude oil dropped from U.S.$100 per barrel in 2022 to U.S.$84 in 2023 and contributed 
to the improvement in profitability."
"Weak global economic activity and rising oil output in the 
USA had a greater impact on the oil price than the geopolitical risks and the production cuts by 
Russia and Saudi Arabia."
"Annual deliveries by Airbus and Boeing increased by 10% in 2023, from 1,141 to 1,263 com-
mercial aircraft (source: Cirium)."
"Looking at the commercial aircraft programs in production 
of importance to MTU, annual deliveries of the A320neo family rose from 516 to 571 aircraft, 
while Boeing more than doubled deliveries of the 787 from 31 in 2022 to 73 in 2023."
"The 
combined order backlog of these two manufacturers increased from 11,817 aircraft in 2022 
to 14,224 in 2023."
MTU/ benefited greatly from the new orders in 2023.
"Aircraft orders were 
linked to orders for MTU’s engine programs in both the narrowbody and the widebody sectors."
"In view of the delivery bottlenecks throughout supply chain and the fleet management plan 
for GTF engines, which started in the fourth quarter, airlines are continuing to reactivate older 
aircraft or postponing taking them out of service."
"The GTF fleet management plan resulted 
from a rare production defect in powder metal components manufactured by Pratt & Whitney."
"The present shortage of new aircraft in the 737 and A320neo ranges has increased demand for 
aftermarket services for older aircraft and engines (for example, the V2500 and CFM56)."
"While 
the GTF fleet management plan is a financial burden, the continued operation of older MTU en-
gines constitutes an opportunity through additional demand for maintenance and spare parts."
"The parked fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft contracted from 4,411 (16.5% of the fleet) in 2022 
to 2,899 aircraft (10.5%) in 2023 (source: Cirium)."
"Only 443 aircraft were taken out of service in 
2023."
"That was 1.6% of the fleet, which was a historically low level compared with the average 
of 2.4% in the period from 2010 to 2022."
"Financial situation
The following explanatory comments and analyses are based on the audited MTU consolidated 
financial statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and 2022."
"The consolidated 
financial statements were drawn up in accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), to the extent 
that these have been adopted by the European Union."
"In accordance with IFRS requirements, new and revised standards and interpretations were ap-
plied for the first time in the financial statements for 2023."
"This did not have a material impact 
on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group."
"They are described 
in detail in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements under Accounting standards, 
interpretations and amended standards and interpretations applied for the first time in fiscal year 
2023."

dollar exchange rate compared with the previous year.
"In the commercial and military engine business (OEM), revenue (before consolidation) fell by 
€582 million from €1,831 million to €1,249 million."
"The considerable drop in revenue in the 
OEM segment was due to the exceptional charges for the Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan, which reduced revenue by €917 million."
"The operating business before this special item 
continued to develop positively (see “Reconciliation to adjusted key performance figures”)."
"This 
was principally due to the positive business development of new engine business for the GTF 
and GEnx programs, growth in the aftermarket business with the PW2000, GEnx, GP7000 and 
CF6-80 and the delivery of engines for business jets."
Considering the fact that billing in U.S.
"dollars is customary in the aviation 
sector, revenue development was held back by the development of the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate, 
which averaged U.S.$1.08 per euro in 2023 compared with U.S.$1.05 per euro in the previous 
year."
"Due to the reve-
nue impact of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, the increase in the cost of goods 
sold was well above the rise in revenue."
"While inflation effects increased costs, the U.S."
"dollar 
exchange rate and economies of scale realized in relation to the utilization of production and 
service capacities took pressure off the cost of goods sold and gross profit compared with the 
previous year."
"Analogously to revenue, exceptional charges of €15 million in connection with the Geared Tur-
bofan fleet management plan (see Reconciliation to adjusted key performance figures) had to be 
recognized in the cost of goods sold."
"In the previous year, the cost of goods sold was dominated 
by impairment losses of €77 million (in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war and the busi-
ness development of the T408 program)."
"All in all, the developments outlined above resulted in 
a considerable drop in the gross profit, and the gross margin, which is defined as the ratio of 
revenue less cost of goods sold to revenue, fell from 16.0% in the previous year to 2.2 % in the 
reporting period."
"Accounting principles and 
policies / Consolidated group / Materiality criterion – Non-material investments) – and, above all, 
refer to other periods, out of the key earnings figures of the Group and its segments."
"The aim 
is to measure the success of managing operating activities in the reporting period and, at the 
same time, to provide information as a further point of reference for efficient comparison with 
different periods and companies."
"Following its standard practice, the central earnings indicators reported by MTU as key perfor-
mance indicators are:
	
⁄
adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), the adjusted EBIT margin and
	
⁄
adjusted net income."
"The adjusted figures do not come under the provisions of the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs); they are to be seen as an addition to the key financial indicators reported 
pursuant to IFRS."
"The prior-year revenue figure has not been amended 
because adjusted revenue was not reported in the previous year for materiality reasons because 
there was no relevant influence on the adjusted EBIT margin."
"(KKR), following the latter’s purchase of 100% of 
the MTU shares from the then DaimlerChrysler AG."
"In the context of the acquisition, assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities were identified in accordance with IFRS 3 and measured 
at fair value."
"Since then, the identified intangible assets, in particular, have resulted in sub-
stantial amortization."
"The resulting earnings impacts are eliminated as special items in the 
reconciliation to adjusted EBIT."
"⁄
“Effects from the increase in the stake in IAE-V2500”: The increase in MTU’s stake in the 
Pratt & Whitney IAE-V2500 program in 2012 was accounted for as the addition of a program 
asset."
"Since then, this asset has been amortized over the expected remaining useful life of 
the program, thereby reducing revenue, and the corresponding earnings impact is eliminated 
as a special item in the reconciliation to adjusted EBIT."
"In the previous year, the impact of impairment losses in connection with 
the termination of business relationships with Russian partners as a consequence of the 
Russia-Ukraine war was eliminated in adjusted EBIT."
"In 2022, earnings were impacted by 
impairment losses on assets relating to the stake in the PW1400G-JM program and, to a 
smaller extent, the stake in the PW1100G-JM and the commercial maintenance business 
(MRO segment)."
"Claims to insurance compensation payments for materialized damage from the leasing of 
engines to Russian customers, which were impaired in the previous year, were realized in the 
reporting period."
"The corresponding other operating income was eliminated as a special item 
in the reconciliation to adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income in the reporting period."
"In 2022, the earnings impact of impairment losses in connection with changes in forecast 
sales of the GE T408 program – the engine for the Sikorsky CH53-K cargo helicopter – was 
eliminated in the calculation of adjusted EBIT."
"⁄
“Restructuring expenses”: Earnings impacted by restructuring measures within the meaning 
of IAS 37."
No such effects had to be recognized in the reporting period or the previous year.
"⁄
“Changes in the consolidated group”: Earnings impacts result from the acquisition, divest-
ment or discontinuation of material investments and processes of a comparable nature."
"No 
such effects had to be recognized in the reporting period or the previous year."
"In the reporting period, this category 
comprised the considerable earnings impact of the accrual for the expected charges for the 
PW1100G-JM “Geared Turbofan fleet management plan”."
"Further details can be found in 
section I."
"Accounting principles and policies / PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan (powder metal issue)” in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, in the reporting period this category also contained the earnings impact of the 
provisions for “major consortial litigation and claims” in connection with the stake in a 
GTF program."
The resulting reduction in earnings in the reporting period was €26 million.
This was eliminated as a special item in the reconciliation of adjusted EBIT.
"Furthermore, MTU reports contingent liabilities of €228 million in connection with this in 
the reporting period; these do not have any impact on profit or loss."
"These effects have been eliminated as a special item in the reconciliation to adjusted revenue 
and adjusted EBIT."
"To establish adjusted earnings before income taxes, only net interest income/
expense and the interest shares in other financial income/expense, which are mainly connected 
with provisions for pensions and liabilities from pensions and plan assets, are added to adjusted 
EBIT."
"None of the other components of financial income/expense, especially those that are 
influenced by the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate, such as the effects of exchange-rate hedging, are 
taken into account."
Adjusted net income is derived from adjusted earnings before income taxes.
"The normalized 
income taxes are calculated on the basis of the expected average tax rate for the Group derived 
in each case from the current operational planning for the Group."
"This is 27% (previous year: 
26%)."
"The profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity method does not form part of 
the tax base."
For informational purposes the adjustments are allocated to prior year's revenue respectively cost of goods sold.
"This was driven primarily by the establish-
ment of provisions for the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, which became necessary 
in the reporting period."
"The very negative impact on earnings was only offset to a small extent 
by a business-driven increase in the profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity 
method."
The other function costs increased slightly.
"The business-driven increase, exacerbated 
by the effect of inflation, was almost offset by the absence of the very high provisions recog-
nized in the previous year for credit default risks in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war."
Other operating income and expenses improved.
"Compared with the previous year, the main 
influences here were the income from insurance cases and the more moderate development of 
the expenses that had to be recognized for the risk of legal action and lawsuits."
"Overall, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) clearly deteriorated year-on-year."
"As a conse-
quence of the adjustments relating to the reporting period and the previous year, especially the 
effects of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, the adjusted EBIT of both the Group and 
its two segments improved."
The adjusted EBIT margin was 12.9% (previous year: 12.3%).
"Net financial income/expense
Net financial income/expense was unchanged from the previous year."
"In particular, the increase 
in interest income from financial investments and improved foreign currency measurement 
effects were reduced by the year-on-year increase in interest expense for pension provisions due 
to the change in the discount rate and the OCI recycling of the V2500 hedge."
"Earnings before taxes (EBT)
The very negative development of EBT in the reporting period compared with the previous year 
corresponds to the negative development of EBIT."
"Income taxes 
As a consequence of the negative earnings before taxes, tax income of €108 million was 
registered in the reporting period (previous year: tax expense of €130 million)."
"The high 
expenditures for the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan resulted in deferred tax income 
of €300 million (previous year: €0 million)."
"The effective Group tax rate, calculated on the basis 
of earnings before taxes, was 52.8% (previous year: 28.1%)."
"Information on the reconciliation of 
the expected tax expense to the effective tax expense is provided in Note 10."
"Income taxes in the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Net income
Net income decreased significantly by €430 million to €-97 million (previous year: €333 
million)."
"By contrast, adjusted net income increased by €118 million to €594 million (previous 
year: €476 million)."
"Consolidated statement of comprehensive income
In the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, net income is reconciled with the total 
comprehensive income for the period of -€50 million (previous year: €466 million)."
"The income and expenses recognized directly in other comprehensive income in the report-
ing period, net of deferred taxes, mainly comprised an increase of €91 million (previous year: 
decline of €34 million) in the fair value of hedging instruments."
"This was partly compensated 
by actuarial losses of €34 million (previous year: actuarial gains of €151 million) on pension 
obligations and plan assets, and exchange rate losses from the translation of foreign businesses 
amounting to €10 million (previous year: exchange rate gains of €16 million)."
"Diluting effects arose from the shares that could potentially be issued through the convertible 
bonds issued by MTU."
"In view of the loss in the reporting period, the diluted earnings per 
share measured in accordance with IAS 33.41 were also €-1.90 (previous year: €6.06)."
"Order backlog  
MTU’s order backlog consists of firm customer orders that commit the Group to delivering prod-
ucts or providing services, plus the contractual value of service agreements."
"As of December 31, 
2023, the order backlog (after consolidation) amounted to €24.4 billion (previous year: €22.3 bil-
lion)."
"Compared with the previous year, the order backlog increased in both the MRO segment and 
the OEM segment."
"By contrast, the order backlog was decreased by the change in the year-end 
exchange rate from U.S.$1.07 per euro in the previous year to U.S.$ 1.11 per euro in the reporting 
period."
"OEM-segment
Revenue
In the commercial and military engine business (OEM), revenue (before consolidation) fell by 
€582 million from €1,831 million to €1,249 million."
"The considerable drop in revenue in the OEM 
segment was due to the exceptional charges for the establishment of provisions in connection with 
the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, which reduced revenue by €917 million."
"Excluding 
the effects of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan (special item), which significantly 
reduced revenue, the operating business continued to develop positively."
"Adjusted revenue was 
€2.212 million."
Considering the fact that billing in U.S.
"dollars is customary in the aviation 
sector, revenue development was held back by the development of the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate, 
which averaged U.S.$1.08 per euro in 2023 compared with U.S.$1.05 per euro in the previous 
year."
"Revenue in the commercial engine business decreased by €623 million (46.7%) to €711 million, 
mainly due to the impact of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"By contrast, adjusted 
revenue in the commercial engines business developed positively."
"In all, it increased to €1,675 
million."
"After adjustment for the charges of €917 million for the Geared Turbofan (PW1100G-JM) 
fleet management plan, the main driver of adjusted revenue in the commercial engine business 
was the PW1100G-JM engine for the A320neo."
"Revenue in the military engine business was €538 million, an increase of €41 million (8.3%) from 
the previous year’s level of €496 million."
"Here, the main sources of revenue in the reporting peri-
od were the EJ200 engine for the Eurofighter and the RB199 for the Panavia Tornado."
"Revenue rose and there was a sig-
nificant increase in earnings from stakes in commercial engine programs, after adjustment 
for the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Another positive earnings driver was the 
revenue growth in the military engine business."
"Adjusted EBIT was also supported by the 
stronger U.S."
dollar hedging rate in the reporting period compared with the previous year.
A further positive effect came from the U.S.
"dollar exchange rate at year-end, especially its 
impact on the refund liabilities for invoice corrections relating to stakes in commercial engine 
programs (risk- and revenue-sharing partnerships)."
"Overall, adjusted EBIT was higher than in 
the previous year."
"By contrast, there was a significant downward trend in EBIT: In the reporting period, EBIT 
was affected by the impact of Geared Turbofan fleet management plan in the amount of 
€932 million and provisions for major consortial litigation and claims in the amount of €23 
million."
"EBIT was €-508 million in 2023, compared with €268 million in the previous year."
"The previous year’s figure was also affected by special items, especially impairment losses of 
€53 million in connection with the Russia-Ukraine war and €24 million in connection with 
the stake in the T408 engine program."
"Information on adjusted earnings is provided in the 
Reconciliation to adjusted key performance figures in the Results of operations section."
"Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on intangible assets came to €78 million (previous year: €58 million) and 
essentially related to the capitalization of self-generated development work for the Pratt & Whit-
ney GTF engine family and the PW800 engine program."
"Capital expenditure on property, plant 
and equipment amounted to €218 million (previous year: €157 million) and related principally 
to construction in progress to expand production capacity and to other equipment, operational 
and office equipment."
"Expenditure on program assets and acquired development work was €25 
million (previous year: €26 million) and mainly related to the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine fami-
ly."
Information about investments in financial assets is provided under Financial position.
"Employees
The average number of employees in the OEM segment increased by 615 to 7,366 (previous 
year: 6,751)."
"MRO segment
Revenue
In the commercial maintenance business, revenue (before consolidation) increased by €608 
million year-on-year to €4,225 million (previous year: €3,616 million)."
"There was an increase in 
both revenue from the MRO segment’s core business that is not tied to OEMs and revenue from 
orders placed by OEMs for the PW1100G-JM program, including for long-term maintenance 
business."
The ratio was roughly 70% to 30%.
"The most important sources of revenue in the core 
MRO business were the V2500 engine type for the classic A320 family, despite a slight decline, 
and the CF34 engine program."
This segment also benefited from growth in engine leasing.

"EBIT nevertheless improved significantly to €346 million, compared with €239 million 
in the previous year."
"Information on adjusted earnings 
is provided in the Reconciliation to adjusted key performance figures in the Results of operations 
section."
"Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment was €17 million 
lower at €215 million (previous year: €232 million)."
"This was mainly due to lower capital 
expenditures to build up the new MTU Maintenance Serbia repair facility, because this is now 
operational."
"At the same time, MTU continued to invest in the growing engine leasing business, 
expansion of MTU Maintenance Hannover, and further capacity-related expansion and replace-
ment measures."
"Information about investments in financial assets is provided under Financial 
position."
"Employees
The average number of employees in the MRO segment increased by 325 to 4,523 (previous 
year: 4,198)."
"Financial position
Initially, the company had the same financing instruments in the reporting period and the pre-
vious year."
"However, since the convertible bond issued in 2016 matured in 2023, the remaining 
bonds were redeemed or converted in the reporting period."
"Principles and objectives of financial management
The main objectives of financial management are efficiently ensuring that the Group has 
adequate liquidity or financing to avoid financial risks and safeguard financial flexibility."
"The 
Treasury department at MTU Aero Engines AG issues policies for managing interest rate, cur-
rency management and counterparty risks, financing, investing surplus liquidity and selecting 
suitable banks centrally for the Group."
"As a rule, the cash flow from operating activities in the business segments represents the 
Group’s main source of liquidity."
"Liquidity forecasts are based on the Group’s operational and 
strategic planning, flanked by a monthly rolling (short-term) liquidity forecast."
"Except where 
there are conflicting regulatory or tax requirements, MTU Aero Engines AG provides the neces-
sary financing for its subsidiaries and subsidiaries invest their surplus liquidity with MTU Aero 
Engines AG."
A central cash pooling system is in place for the German Group companies.
"This 
reduces the need for external borrowing and thus cash outflows for interest payments."
"The limits set for counterparties are based on their long-term credit rating, their historical 
probability of default derived from this, and the size of the company."
"The limits set also support 
risk-based diversification of the credit default risk in connection with the investment of funds 
and the use of derivatives."
"The minimum requirement for treasury counterparties is an invest-
ment-grade rating."
"Funds are invested primarily in euro-denominated sight and time deposits, 
money market funds and commercial paper."
"Foreign currency investments are only permitted 
up to the level of the surplus liquidity in the respective currency; speculative investment to 
improve the interest yield is not permitted."
"The term of investments is determined by liquidity 
planning."
"The investment policy is geared to preserving value and the liquidity of the invest-
ments."
"The risk of changes in interest rates is negligible due to the very short nature of such 
investments."
"To achieve this target, MTU uses a variety of internal and external financing instruments, in-
cluding occupational pension plans, bonds, credit facilities and leasing models."

on the Group’s capacity to raise funds through authorized and contingent capital, please refer to

"Financial risk in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
provide information on MTU’s approach to the financial risks inherent in financing and mea-
surement, the methods used to hedge interest rate and currency risks, and price, default and 
liquidity risks."
"In the reporting period, the first of two extension options was exercised (until June 29, 2028)."
The credit facility had not been drawn down as of the reporting date (previous year: €0 million).
"As in previous years, MTU did not engage in any off-balance-sheet financing transactions in the 
reporting period, such as the sale of receivables in connection with asset-backed securities or 
obligations toward special-purpose entities."
"Net financial debt
Net financial debt serves as an indicator of the MTU Group’s financial situation and is defined 
as the difference between gross financial debt and current, interest-bearing financial assets."
"Net financial debt was lower than on December 31, 2022."

"The liability matures in 2027 and, as of the closing date, reflects a nominal amount of 
U.S.$80 million (previous year: U.S.$122 million)."
"Translated at the closing rate, that was

"The carrying amount of the purchase price liability 
was €69 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €108 million)."
"As of the re-
porting date, the unutilized nominal amount of such financing commitments was €831 million 
(previous year: €776 million)."
"As part of its ordinary activities, the Group furthermore incurred 
other financial liabilities comprising purchase commitments and future cash outflows for 
leases."
"These are additional to the liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet at the 
end of the reporting period."
"They relate to contractual obligations to acquire intangible assets, 
property, plant and equipment, and leased items."
"Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations in the Notes to the 
consolidated financial statements for detailed information on contingent liabilities and other 
financial obligations."
"Liquidity analysis
Reconciliation to adjusted free cash flow
One of MTU’s key performance indicators is free cash flow."
"MTU determines its free cash flow 
by combining its cash flow from operating activities with its cash flow from investing activities 
and eliminating components of the latter (non-recurring cash flows) that lie outside the oper-
ational management of the core business."
"To arrive at the free cash flow, these non-recurring 
cash flows were therefore eliminated from the cash flow from investing activities."
"To arrive at the free cash flow in the reporting period, adjustments were made for the follow-
ing non-recurring cash flows: cash inflows in connection with interest-bearing sales financing 
arrangements in the form of aircraft and engine financing totaling €5 million (previous year: 
€0 million)."
"This positive development was driven by the cash-effective business growth and a year-
on-year reduction in cash outflows for working capital."
"Negative factors were higher income tax 
payments and the unfavorable development of the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate in the reporting 
period."
"The Geared Turbofan fleet management plan that started in the reporting period, and es-
pecially the related compensation payments to customers of the PW1100G-JM engine program, 
hardly affected the cash flow from operating activities in the reporting period."
"Based on current 
knowledge, the cash-effective charges are mainly expected in the period 2024 through 2026."
For further information on the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan see section I.
"Accounting 
principles and policies – PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan (powder metal 
issue) in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Cash flow from investing activities
Capital expenditure on intangible assets amounted to €80 million (previous year: €59 million) 
and mainly comprised capital expenditure on development work for the Pratt & Whitney GTF 
engine family, the GE9X and the PW800 program."
"Capital expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment, excluding the proceeds from asset disposals, amounted to €302 million, compared 
with €306 million in the previous year."
"The capital expenditure relates to the growth in the 
engine leasing business, especially the purchase of used engines by the location in the Neth-
erlands, MLS (Amsterdam), and MTU’s expansion and replacement measures, especially at its 
German locations."
"In the previous year, in addition to the capital contributions outlined above, there were cash 
outflows for the capital increase at EME Aero sp."
"o, a joint venture with Lufthansa Technik, 
and subsequent cash inflows in connection with the sale of Vericor Power Systems in 2021."
"Expenditure on program assets and acquired development work was €21 million (previous year: 
€21 million) and mainly related to the Pratt & Whitney GTF engine family."
"Cash flow from financing activities
The cash outflow in the reporting period was mainly due to the dividend payment of €171 
million (previous year: €112 million) and payments for lease liabilities totaling €81 million 
(previous year: €64 million)."
"Change in cash and cash equivalents
The increase in cash and cash equivalents results from the fact that the cash inflows from 
operating activities more than offset the cash outflows for investing and financing activities 
in the reporting period."

dated financial statements."

"The capital expendi-
tures mainly relate to expansion and replacement measures, especially at the sites in Munich,

"Additionally, they include loans and capital 
contributions made in the reporting year for the expansion of Ceramic Coating Center SAS, 
a joint venture with Safran Aero Engines."
"Further, in the reporting period, the electric motor 
developer eMoSys GmbH (not consolidated) was acquired and there was a capital increase at

assets is included in Note 17."
"Acquired program assets, development work and other assets in the 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Assets
In the fiscal year 2023, intangible assets and goodwill increased by €49 million (previous year: 
increased by €22 million)."
"The main drivers were additions of capitalized, self-created develop-
ment expenses for the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan engines."
"Property, plant and equipment increased by €117 million (previous year: €132 million)."
"This 
was mainly due to capital expenditure for construction in progress for the expansion and 
replacement of production capacities in Germany and the increase in other equipment and 
operational and office equipment in connection with the growing engine leasing business."
"The development of financial assets was supported by the positive business development at 
companies accounted for using the equity method, which led to an increase in their carrying 
amounts."
"The increase in deferred tax assets was mainly due to the expenses for the Geared Turbofan 
fleet management plan, which were recognized as refund liabilities."

"Trade receivables decreased by €12 million year-on-year to €1,010 million (comparative figure 
for the previous year restated – more precise distinction between contract assets and trade 
receivables from stakes in commercial engine programs)."
"There were also receivables from tax authorities in respect of tax refunds amounting to €81 
million (previous year: €34 million)."

"Positive changes in equity
Equity increased in 2023, mainly due to an increase of €91 million in the fair value of hedg-
ing instruments (previous year: reduction of €34 million)."
"A further increase of €46 million 
(previous year: €2 million) came from the conversion of the convertible bond 2016."
"This was due, in par-
ticular, to a lower actuarial discount rate."
"Non-current liabilities mainly contain the gross financial debt of €1,396 million (previous year: 
€1,478 million) and other provisions of €28 million (previous year: €53 million)."
"The reduction 
in the gross financial debt in the reporting period was attributable to the conversions of the 
convertible bond 2016 which matured on May 17, 2023 and to the decrease in other financial 
liabilities from the acquisitions of stakes in programs."
"Non-current liabilities represented 22.1% 
of total equity and liabilities as of December 31, 2023, which was lower than in the previous 
year."
"Total equity and non-current liabilities decreased by €260 million in the reporting period to 
€5,190 million (previous year: €5,450 million)."
"Furthermore, 112.7% (previous year: 131.5%) of 
the Group’s non-current assets are financed through available non-current funds."
"This was principally attributable to the reclassification of certain components of 
provisions for personnel obligations to personnel-related financial liabilities."

plan see section I."
"Accounting principles and policies – PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet manage-

"Revenue forecast
On February 14, 2023, the Executive Board forecast that revenue would rise to a range of  
between €6,100 million and €6,300 million in 2023 (revenue 2022: €5,330 million)."
"The 
revenue forecast was confirmed when the half-year financial report was published on July 26, 
2023."
"When the figures for the third quarter were published on October 27, 2023, the revenue 
forecast was confirmed, after adjustment for the charges for the Geared Turbofan fleet manage-
ment plan."
"The adjusted revenue as of year-end 2023 (adjusted, in particular, for the effects of 
the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan) was €6,326 million, which was marginally above 
the forecast range of between €6,100 million and €6,300 million."
"This 
guidance was specified in more detail when MTU reported its half-year figures: it was anticipated 
that the adjusted EBIT margin would be slightly over the previous year and that adjusted EBIT 
would be slightly higher than €800 million."
"After the third quarter, the forecast for adjusted EBIT 
was confirmed – after adjustment for the published effects of the Geared Turbofan fleet manage-
ment plan."
"Free cash flow
On February 14, 2023, MTU set a target for 2023 of a significant positive free cash flow on the 
prior-year level."
"This forecast was revised upward when the company presented its half-year 
report on July 26, 2023."
"It was expected that the free cash flow would be slightly higher than 
the previous year’s figure."
"This guidance was confirmed when the third-quarter figures were 
published on October 26, 2023."
"This target was met as of December 31, 2023, with a free cash 
flow of €352 million (previous year: €326 million)."
"Overall assessment of business performance in 2023
MTU’s business performance in 2023 was characterized by a further recovery in the operating 
business despite the Russia-Ukraine war."
"However, this was countered by the massive earnings 
impact of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Reported revenue was €5,363 million 
(previous year: €5,330 million) and thus remained around the previous year’s level despite a 
revenue reduction of €917 million for the establishment of provisions for the Geared Turbo-
fan fleet management plan."
"Before intersegment consolidation, the MRO segment contributed 
revenue growth of 16.8%."
"By contrast, revenue in the OEM segment was 31.8% lower due to the 
Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"The Group’s adjusted revenue (adjusted, in particular, 
for the revenue-reducing impact of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan) was €6,326 
million, an increase of 18.7% compared with the previous year (in the previous year, revenue 
was not adjusted for materiality reasons)."
"Despite the setbacks in connection with the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, MTU was 
able to continue its investment and growth phase in 2023."
"Capital expenditure in the reporting 
period was dominated by development activities for engines in all commercial thrust classes 
and the expansion of production capacity at locations in Germany and other countries."
"In 2023, MTU increased adjusted EBIT (adjusted, in particular, for the effects of the revenue-re-
ducing impact of the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan) in both the OEM and the MRO 
segment."
Adjusted EBIT was €818 million (previous year: €655 million).
"The adjusted EBIT 
margin was 12.9% (previous year: 12.3%)."
There was a corresponding increase in the free cash flow.
"Despite high investment in develop-
ment assets, capacity expansion at sites in Germany and abroad, the free cash flow increased 
to €352 million (previous year: €326 million)."
"At present, the Geared Turbofan fleet manage-
ment plan is expected to impact the cash flow in period 2024 through 2026 and to significantly 
reduce free cash flow in these years."
"Non-financial performance indicators
The high priority given to climate protection is shown by the fact that reducing CO2 emissions 
is an important environmental, social and governance (ESG) target."
"The ESG-related KPI CO2 
is a climate-oriented parameter that affects the variable compensation of the Executive Board 
and senior executives."
"In addition, it applies the gold standard to compensate for unavoidable CO2 emissions  
at the Munich location."
"As a result, operation of this location has been climate-neutral since 2021."
The long-term objective of Green Global is climate-neutral production and maintenance by 2045.
"The MTU Group’s Scope 1 emissions were 39,428 t CO2eq (previous period: 37,738 t)."
"Scope 
2 emissions were 9,635 t CO2eq (previous period: 9,387 t)."
"The change was attributable to the 
business-related increase in production, especially at the location in Serbia."
"Arithmetically, 
emissions from electricity consumption in Serbia (Scope 2) are offset by the purchase of allow-
ances."
"The remaining CO2eq emissions from the operation of the Munich location are offset 
using the gold standard, so this location had a climate-neutral footprint in 2023."
"The twelve-month 
performance period used for this is December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2023 and thus 
differs from the reporting period."
"Thanks to reduction in CO2 emissions and the additional 
purchase of green power, the “maximum remaining CO2 emissions in CO2 kt absolute” for the 
relevant performance period of the reporting period were just 49 kt CO2, which was less than 
the target of 54 kt CO2."
"The annual financial statements of MTU AG were 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and are pu-
blished together with the combined management report in the Unternehmensregister [German 
Company Register]."
"Further information can be found in the annual financial statements 
of MTU Aero Engines AG as of December 31, 2023, prepared in accordance with the German 
Commercial Code (HGB), Section Principles and methods."
"Business activities 
MTU AG develops and manufactures components for commercial and military aircraft engines  
and aero-derivative industrial gas turbines."
"The company also carries out maintenance of 
military engines."
"MTU has technological expertise, in particular, in low-pressure turbines, 
high-pressure compressors and turbine center frames, and in repair techniques and manufactu-
ring processes."
"It is involved in important national and international technology programs and 
cooperates with the top names in the engine industry (known as OEMs) – GE Aerospace, Pratt & 
Whitney and Rolls-Royce."
"Further information can be found in the annual financial statements of MTU Aero Engines AG as of December 31, 2023, in 
the section on the principles and methods used."
"Revenue
Revenue decreased by €170 million, from €2,908 million (restated) to €2,738 million in the reporting 
period."
"The considerable drop in revenue was due to the exceptional charges for the establishment  
of provisions in connection with the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, which 
reduced revenue by €955 million."
"Excluding the effects of the Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan (special item), which significantly reduced revenue, the operating business continued to 
develop positively."
"Revenue from spare parts for 
military applications also contributed to revenue growth in the reporting period."
Considering the fact that billing in U.S.
"dollars is customary in the aviation sector, 
revenue development was reduced by the development of the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate, which aver-
aged U.S.$1.08 per euro in 2023 compared with U.S.$1.05 per euro in the previous year."
"Cost of goods sold and gross profit
The cost of goods sold increased as a result of the higher business volume."
"Due to the revenue 
impact of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, the increase in the cost of 
goods sold was well above the rise in revenue."
"While inflation effects increased costs, the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate and economies of scale realized in relation to the utilization of production 
and service capacities took pressure off the cost of goods sold and gross profit compared with the 
previous year."
"Analogously to revenue, exceptional charges of €15 million in connection with the PW1100G-JM 
Geared Turbofan fleet management plan had to be recognized in the cost of goods sold."
"In the 
previous year, the cost of goods sold was dominated by impairment losses of €39 million (after 
reclassification; in connection with the Russia/Ukraine war)."
"The gross profit dropped from €371 million in the previous year (restated) to €-545million in the 
reporting period."
"Selling expenses
In 2023, selling expenses were stable relative to the previous year."
"Within general administrative 
expenses, material and personnel expenses were reduced by €6 million to €58 million."
"Net financial income/expense
Net financial income/expense for the reporting period contains investment income of €209 
million (previous year: €224 million)."
"Of this amount, €152 million (previous year: €201 
million) comprises profit transfers from MTU Maintenance Hannover GmbH, Langenhagen, 
Germany, MTU Maintenance Berlin-Brandenburg GmbH, Ludwigsfelde, Germany, and MTU 
Versicherungsvermittlungs- und Wirtschaftsdienst GmbH, Munich, Germany."
"Furthermore, income from investments contains dividend payments of €57 million (previous 
year: €23 million) from foreign investments, especially €29 million from MTU Aero Engines 
Polska sp."
"o.o., Rzeszów, Poland, and €28 million from MTU Maintenance Zhuhai Co."
"The current tax expense included in this figure amounted to €125 
million (previous year: €182 million), including tax income of €3 million (previous year: tax 
expense of €18 million) relating to prior periods."
"The compensatory effect of net deferred tax 
receivables of €277 million (previous year: €54 million) includes €3 million (previous year: €15 
million) relating to prior periods."
"Taking into account the withdrawal from other retained earnings, these were matched in full by 
free reserves pursuant to Section 268 (8) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and Section 253 
(6) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) as of the reporting date."
"Subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, a proposal will be put to the Annual General 
Meeting that the entire net profit available for distribution be used to pay a dividend of €2.00 per 
share (previous year: €3.20 per share)."
"€50 million (previous year: €47 million) was invested in internally generated 
development assets and €21 million (previous year: €14 million) was invested in acquired deve-
lopment work for the GTF engine family and the Pratt & Whitney Business Jet engine programs."
"Property, plant and equipment increased, principally as a result of expansion and modernizati-
on of the Munich site and the purchase of new and replacement machinery and tools/fixtures."
"Financial assets increased by €23 million to €1,400 million (previous year: €1,377 million)."
"This 
was principally attributable to the acquisition of eMoSys GmbH, a capital increase of €9.5 milli-
on at this company, and capital contributions of €5 million in each case to the affiliated compa-
nies MTU Maintenance Serbia d."
and MTU Maintenance Dallas Inc.
"In addition, a loan of €3 
million was granted to MTU Maintenance Dallas in the reporting period."
"Furthermore, the stake 
in the joint venture Ceramic Coating Center S.A.S."
"was increased by €1 million and a loan of €5 
million was granted to this company."
"By contrast, capital repayments of €1 million in each case 
were received from AES Aerospace Embedded Solutions and EPI Europrop International GmbH."
"Inventories were virtually stable compared with the previous year, with a more unfavorable 
development compared to revenue, based on hypothetical adjustment for the revenue-reducing 
effect of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Receivables and other assets increased by €429 million year-on-year (previous year: €2,923 mil-
lion), representing a slower growth than for revenue, based on hypothetical adjustment for the 
revenue-reducing effect of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Within 
this item, there was a business-induced increase in trade receivables to €871 million (previous 
year: €760 million), which was in line with revenue, based on hypothetical adjustment for the 
revenue-reducing effect of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Since the 
commercial OEM activities are billed in U.S."
"dollars, the change in the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate 
prevailing on the reporting date from U.S.$1.07 per euro to U.S.$1.11 euro reduced this item."
"The increase in receivables from affiliated companies from €878 million to €1,026 million 
relates to claims under profit and loss transfer agreements and the financing of subsidiaries."
The receivables from investments decreased from €934 million to €838 million.
"This change 
is consistent with the development of the ordinary business activities in the reporting period, 
the maturity structure/scope for netting and the change in the exchange rates prevailing on the 
reporting date, which affects foreign currency balances as of the reporting date."
"Other factors contributing to the increase were claims to refunds of income 
taxes and input taxes."
"Securities, which were previously aggregated in the line item bank deposits, are now presented 
separately in the line item securities."
"The change in bank deposits was due to the operating per-
formance; in particular, it was not affected by the considerable financial burden expected from 
the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan, which is expected to have an impact 
in the period 2024 through 2026."
"Equity comprises the capital stock less the nominal amount of treasury shares, capital reserves, 
retained earnings, and the net profit available for distribution."
"The development of pension provisions was influenced by the increase in the discount rate set 
by the regulator."
"The increase in miscellaneous provisions was mainly due to the establishment of provisions 
for the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan."
"Furthermore, the increase was 
driven by the rise in operating revenue in 2023, accompanied by an increase in accruals for 
invoice corrections in connection with stakes in commercial engine programs."
"The increase in 
this item was reduced by the change in the closing exchange rate for the U.S."
"dollar at year-end 
from U.S.$1.07 per euro to U.S.$1.11 per euro."
"The €162 million increase in liabilities to €2,333 million in the reporting period (previous year: 
€2,171 million) mainly resulted from an increase of €126 million in miscellaneous liabilities."
"This was principally attributable to the reclassification of personnel-related obligations from 
other provisions as the valuation uncertainty relating to such provisions decreased."
"The other 
liabilities contain total personnel-related obligations of €166 million (previous year: €91 milli-
on)."
"In the reporting period, they also included obligations from the granting of performance-
related compensation (previous year: miscellaneous provisions of €59 million)."
"Financial position
Initially, the company had the same financing instruments in the reporting period and the pre-
vious year."
"However, since the convertible bond issued in 2016 matured in 2023, the remaining 
bonds were redeemed or converted in the reporting period."
"Principles and objectives of financial management 
The main objectives of financial management are efficiently ensuring that the company has 
adequate liquidity or financing to avoid financial risks and safeguard financial flexibility."
"The Treasury department at MTU Aero Engines AG issues policies for managing interest rate, 
currency management and counterparty risks, financing, investing surplus liquidity and  
selecting suitable banks centrally for the Group."
"As a rule, the cash flow from operating activities in the business segments represents the 
company’s main source of liquidity."
"Funds are invested primarily in euro-denominated sight 
and time deposits, money market funds and commercial paper."
"Further details of the cash flow can be found in the management report in the section Financial 
position."
"Other disclosures
The opportunities, risks and future development of MTU AG essentially correspond to the op-
portunities, risks and future development of the MTU Group as described below in the sections 
Forecast and Risk and opportunity report."
"As the Group’s parent company, MTU AG is integrated in the Group-wide risk management 
system that is described in detail in the Risk and opportunity report."
"The description of the  
internal control system of MTU AG required under Section 289 (4) of the German Commercial 
Code (HGB) can be found in the section Internal control and risk management system for the 
Group accounting process."
"For further information on the use of financial instruments, please refer to the Notes to 
the consolidated financial statements and to the explanations in the section Use of financial 
instruments."
"It 
anticipates that the global economy will grow by 2.4% in 2024, following growth of 2.5% in 2023."
"Growth is likely  to be held back by high interest rates, which are still necessary to check inflation."
"In this context, the IMF forecasts that global inflation will slow from 6.9% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024."
"In the developed economies, consumer price inflation should drop from 4.6% to 3.0%."
Economic growth in the United States will probably decline from 2.1% in 2023 to 1.5% in 2024.
"Consumer spending will weaken as savings have been spent and this can no longer be offset by 
tighter fiscal conditions."
"In China, too, growth is expected to drop in 2024, with domestic and the 
real estate market remaining weak."
"Asia’s largest economy expected to grow by 4.2% in 2024, 
compared with 5.0% in 2023."
"In the euro zone, where demand was already subdued in 2023, GDP 
growth is expected to rise from 0.7% to 1.2% in 2024."
"The downside impact of high inflation on 
real incomes should decline."
"Sector-specific conditions within the aviation industry
In December 2023, IATA forecast that demand for air travel and airline revenue would return 
to pre-crisis levels in 2024."
"Global passenger traffic should increase by 9.8% in 2024 to 104% of 
the 2019 level."
Cargo traffic should stabilize at the 2023 level.
"For the airlines, this means glob-
al revenue of U.S.$964 billion in 2024 (2019: U.S.$838 billion) and a further improvement in 
net profit to U.S.$25.7 billion."
The IATA forecast is based on an oil price of U.S.$87.5 per barrel.
"Airbus and Boeing started 2024 with a record order backlog of 14,224 aircraft, which, at cur-
rent production rates, equates to a production period of 11 years."
"This is a reflection of airlines’ 
capacity to invest in the next generation of energy-efficient aircraft and engines."
"To meet the 
high demand from airlines for aircraft capacity, Airbus and Boeing are planning to increase 
deliveries in 2024."
"Airbus intends to raise the production rate of its best-selling A320neo family 
from 46 aircraft per month in 2023 to 65 per month."
"The mid-term target is 75 per month in 
2026."
"By contrast, Boeing intends to increase deliveries of the 737 family from 36 per month 
in 2023 to 50 per month in 2025 / 2026."
"Following Alaska Airlines incident with a 737 Max 9 
in January 2024, however, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA first has to ap-
prove expansion of production of the MAX range."
"The production target for the 787 is 120 units 
a year by 2025-2026, compared with 73 deliveries in 2023."
"The 777-9 powered by the GE9X is 
still scheduled to come into service in 2025."
"That 
applies for the availability of aircraft, production and maintenance."
"Investment in infrastructure 
must continue – with the continued goal of meeting rising passenger numbers."
"Operation of the 
fleet in service will have to be extended instead of taking aircraft out of service and the value 
of used aircraft will remain high."
"There will be high demand for the corresponding aftermarket 
services."
"Future performance of MTU
The forward-looking performance indicators published for the forecast financial indicators are 
based on data generated in the planning process."
"The method used to calculate the forecast key 
financial indicators is consistent with the accounting policies applied and the calculation logic 
for the alternative performance indicators outlined in Note 12."
"Additional disclosures relating to 
the income statement."
"Expenditure on new products and services
The recovery of the aviation sector is continuing and by year-end 2023 global flight movements 
were also back at the 2019 level."
"While this positive trend is expected to continue, with flights 
resuming their continuous growth path, it is being held back by ongoing restrictions on flights 
as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war."
"Overall though, the aviation sector is steadily recovering, 
not least due to the change in China’s pandemic policy, and it is expected that flights will return 
to the pre-crisis level in 2024."
The recent ramp-up of engine production should continue in 2024.
"Similarly, there should be 
corresponding growth in market demand for spare parts and the MRO business."
"Development work should also continue to grow in 2024, not least because of the participation 
in the next generation fighter aircraft, the Future Combat Air System (FCAS)."
"For the start of the ramp-up of engine production rates and to secure its long-term competitive-
ness, MTU is investing a substantial amount to expand the highly productive manufacturing 
and logistics capacity at its headquarters in Munich, Germany."
"Moreover, expansion of capacity will continue, especially in China."
"In the commercial spare parts 
business, organic revenue growth is expected to be in the low-teens percentage range."
"Revenue growth in the military engine business is expected to be in the low- to mid-teens per-
centage range."
"Rising revenue in connection with development work for the FCAS will contrib-
ute to this."
"For the commercial maintenance business, MTU forecasts growth in the mid- to high-teens 
percentage range on a U.S."
"In this business, the proportion of revenue from the 
PW1100G-JM is expected to increase."
"Its share of MRO revenue should be between 40% and 
45%."
Execution of the GTF fleet management plan will play a significant role in this.
"In view of this, the adjusted total revenue of the MTU Group in euros is expected to be between 
€7.3 and €7.5 billion."
This estimate is based on an average exchange rate of the U.S.$1.10 to the euro.
"Operating profit
In 2024, MTU expects adjusted EBIT to grow in line with the growth in adjusted revenue and 
the development of the adjusted EBIT margin."
"MTU expects an adjusted EBIT margin (relative to 
revenue) between 12% and 13%."
Adjusted net income is expected to develop essentially in line with adjusted EBIT.
"Free cash flow
Capital expenditure will remain high in 2024."
"Moreover, higher working capital reserves will be 
held to safeguard delivery capability."
"Nevertheless, MTU plans to offset these charges through 
its operating business."
"However, the charges arising from the GTF fleet management plan will 
reduce the free cash flow."
"Overall, free cash flow is expected to be in the low three-digit million 
range."
"Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share are expected to develop essentially in line with adjusted EBIT in 
2024."
"Future dividend
MTU’s dividend policy envisages the payment of an attractive dividend."
"In view of the excep-
tional circumstances resulting from the GTF fleet management plan, the company is compelled 
to reduce the dividend for 2023, contrary to its target."
"For the fiscal years affected, it is there-
fore suspending the target of continuously raising the payout ratio towards 40% of adjusted net 
income."
"This affects 
personnel capacity in IT, engineering capacity for the development of the Next Generation 
Fighter Engine and personnel to safeguard continuous growth."
"Research and development
In 2024, MTU’s research and development activities again focused on engine efficiency – 
concentrating on the ongoing development of its key components: low-pressure turbines, 
high-pressure compressors and turbine center frames."
"In addition, the company is working on 
new technologies for long-term projects aimed at decarbonizing aviation."
"The focus is on the 
water-enhanced turbofan (WET) and the Flying Fuel Cell (FFC)."
"The aims are to reduce fuel con-
sumption and emissions and extend repair cycles."
"In addition, development work in the military 
business is dominated by work on the Next European Fighter Engine."
"Detailed information on 
research and development activities, including the targeted medium- and long-term reductions 
in fuel consumption and emissions, is provided under Research and development."
"Overall forecast of future business performance in 2024
The Executive Board anticipates that business will develop positively: There should be a further 
significant rise in revenue and MTU should continue to post strong adjusted EBIT."
"Stepping 
up development activities and capital expenditure again in 2024 will provide a sound basis for 
the sustained long-term growth of MTU’s business."
"In this context, the operational challenges 
resulting from the GTF fleet management plan will be a focus of activity."
"MTU is monitoring the possible effects of the macroeconomic situation and the global crises on 
its business performance and will revise its guidance during the year if necessary."
"To enable it to take best advantage 
of market opportunities and to identify and manage the risks involved, MTU has an integrated 
opportunity and risk management system."
"This is linked to the Group’s value-oriented perfor-
mance indicators and its organizational structure."
"The system is based on the internationally 
recognized COSO II Enterprise Risk Management Framework."
"To assist in implementing risk 
management in the MTU Group, the central risk management function provides the risk 
owners with a variety of information and tools."
"These include the MTU risk guidelines and 
extensive checklists, which provide guidance and operational support in the risk management 
process."
"The systematic consideration of significant risk factors serves as a fundamental basis for 
value-oriented management of the MTU Group and ensures lasting business success."
"MTU 
identifies risks early on, analyzes their possible consequences and devises appropriate risk 
mitigation measures."
"Strategy and risk management system
Control environment
MTU regards a suitable control environment as being essential for a functioning risk manage-
ment system."
"The main elements of this are:
	
⁄
management style and philosophy,
	
⁄
integrity and ethical values,
	
⁄
no-blame culture,
	
⁄
staff training and development."
"The MTU Principles require a constructive approach to mistakes, and the company’s leader-
ship values include a commitment to actively driving change, creating an atmosphere of trust, 
and ensuring continuous improvement."
"This is supported by lean management in all areas of 
the company, which also aims to create a culture that ensures a functioning risk management 
system."
"Risk management objectives and risk strategy
The objectives of MTU’s risk management system are to create transparency with regard to all 
risks and opportunities, to ward off risks to MTU’s status as a going concern and to safeguard 
the company’s future business success."
"Rather, 
it seeks to integrate its opportunity and risk management system into all processes in the 
company, from financial planning, control and reporting processes right through to monthly 
reporting to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"Risk management also takes place 
in other areas of the company; for instance, it is a key component of project management."
"Identification, analysis and management of risks
MTU regards risk management as a continuous process that ensures responsible behavior 
when dealing with specific risks to organizational units and general risks affecting several 
units or the entire Group."
"The Group’s risk inventory, which encompasses all organizational units and all risk factors to 
which MTU is exposed, forms the basis for identifying risks."
"In the interests of a more detailed 
assessment of risks, MTU has divided this framework into 13 risk categories covering all orga-
nizational units."
"Operational risk management takes place at the level of the individual, organizationally sepa-
rate units and in the subsidiaries."
"These are responsible for identifying, assessing, controlling 
and monitoring the risks in their specific areas, and documenting them in a central risk 
management tool."
"To this end, the organizational units use a general risk checklist derived 
from the risk inventory."
"The mandatory threshold for reporting quantitative risks to the central 
risk management function is €5 million for adjusted EBIT and liquidity (cash) over the defined 
three-year assessment period."
"The establishment of risk maps and risk reporting take place 
in parallel with the quarterly financial statements."
"Risks occurring during the year that could 
threaten the company’s status as a going concern are reported immediately to the central risk 
management function."
"Therefore, risks for which provisions have been recognized on the 
balance sheet due to their high probability of occurrence are not included in the risk exposure."
"In addition to these quantitative, financial risks, risk management explicitly includes quali-
tative, non-financial risks."
"The four levels of probability of occurrence are the same for these 
qualitative risks."
"It also 
provides assistance with the risk management process, prescribes uniform methods and 
tools, and evaluates the Group’s overall risk position."
"Furthermore, it supports the work of the 
cross-organizational Risk Management Board, which performs central control and monitoring 
functions for the Group."
"At its quarterly meetings, the Risk Management Board discusses the 
interactions between individual risks, ensures that all risks have been reported in full, and 
discusses the risk exposure of the Group as a whole."
"The report to 
the Executive Board is agreed with the Risk Management Board and is structured on the basis 
of the segments."
"This report presents the company’s Top Risk Map, which covers all risks and 
opportunities exceeding €20 million adjusted EBIT or liquidity (cash) over a three-year period."
"A risk assessment is then performed in this context, taking account of the amount of damage, 
the probability of occurrence and the identification of compensatory countermeasures."
"The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee is also given an update of the MTU Group’s risk 
position on a quarterly basis."
"The most important issues from the previous risk review are also 
presented in monthly reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board."
"Monitoring the risk management process
Monitoring the risk management process is crucial to ensure its proper functioning and ongo-
ing development."
The system used for the early recognition of risks is audited by the auditor.
"Macroeconomic and strategic risks
Macroeconomic risks
(Structural risks, country risks)
Within the aviation industry, MTU is exposed to competition in the development, production 
and maintenance of engines, engine modules and engine components."
"This business is cyclical 
and reacts sensitively to demand for passenger and cargo traffic."
"It is influenced by the general 
macroeconomic situation (GDP and trading volumes, exchange rates and raw material prices)."
"Demand from airlines for new aircraft and MTU’s commercial engine products (new engines 
and spare parts) and their financing capability are heavily influenced by passenger numbers."
"A 
deterioration in the macroeconomic situation and the related demand for air traffic reduces use 
of the existing fleet of aircraft and demand for new aircraft."
"This represents a risk for MTU’s 
business."
"Moreover, high competitive pressure among airlines could have a negative effect on 
individual airlines, which are potential direct or indirect MTU customers."
"Compared with the previous year, the geopolitical risks have increased and in some cases inten-
sified."
"The risk classification of short-term market-related risks is currently as follows:
	
⁄
Risk classification “likely”/”high”: Possible employment restrictions resulting in staff short-
ages in the aviation sector."
"⁄
Risk classification “likely”/”high”: Climate change-related and natural catastrophes resulting 
directly or indirectly in a change in market structure and thus a reduction in demand and 
flights."
"⁄
Risk classification “possible”/”high”: Possible escalation of the political conflict and trade 
restrictions between the USA/Europe and China, resulting in a global recession."
"⁄
Risk classification “possible”/”high”: Higher interest rates resulting in negative (global) 
economic trends and thus lower demand."
"The company’s ability to make appropriate predictions and plans for its business, especially 
in the short- and mid-term, is still hampered by the unprecedented situation and the complex 
interaction of geopolitics, the climate crisis, economic development and pandemics."
"Although 
MTU consults with government agencies, industry associations and external aviation analysts 
at national and international level, there is a certain amount of uncertainty affecting its ability 
to adequately forecast the impact of these risk factors on its business."
"Incorrect forecasts could 
have a considerable negative effect on the company’s business activity, cash flows, results of 
operations and financial position."
MTU could be affected by disruption of supply chains.
"Therefore, 
MTU could be exposed to risks in respect of costs that are necessary to meet its contractual 
commitments as well as risks to its product supply schedules."
"Moreover, in some cases MTU’s 
customers and downstream operations are still affected by staff shortages."
"There is al-
ready a public debate about the social, economic and ecological implications of air travel and air 
cargo driven by the ongoing global climate debate."
"This has heightened personal and corporate 
awareness of travel and consumption behavior."
"Potential changes in usage patterns and the 
applicable regulations could be intensified and given new momentum by experience during the 
Covid-19 pandemic, e.g., online video conferencing as a substitute for business trips."
"If a reduc-
tion in travel and altered consumer spending patterns are regarded as socially desirable by the 
general public, this could have a significant negative impact on MTU’s business model."
"In particular, purely economic aspects will play their customary central role for air traffic along-
side the consequences of the global debate on climate policy."
"In its World Economic Outlook of 
October 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that there is a risk the real estate 
crisis in China could deepen and of persisting high inflation, with continuing high interest rates 
on the capital market."
Both could cause a global recession.
"The IMF estimates that the impact 
of the monetary policy tightening by the U.S."
"central bank to combat high inflation will be felt 
worldwide, with the strength of the U.S."
"dollar versus the currencies of emerging and develop-
ing countries increasing inflationary and debt pressures."
"In view of the rising cost of servicing 
debt, more than half of low-income developing countries are affected or threatened by a high 
debt risk."
"A deterioration in the economic situation has the potential to reduce future growth in air 
traffic and thus demand for commercial engine products."
"Protectionist measures taken in some 
countries even before the pandemic are a further risk factor."
"These include the trade conflict be-
tween the USA and China."
"Protectionist measures hold back the volume of trade and countries’ 
economic output and therefore reduce cargo and passenger traffic."
"Political crises and restrictions on air traffic as a result of wars, terrorist attacks or natu-
ral catastrophes are a constant risk to air traffic and to MTU’s engines business."
"Following 
Russia’s military attack on Ukraine, the international community, especially the EU and the 
USA, imposed extensive economic sanctions on Russia."
"As a matter of course, MTU supports 
all sanction regulations and is in full compliance with them."
"For example, all deliveries and 
data transfers to Russia have been halted and payments to Russia and Russian recipients have 
been suspended."
"Furthermore, MTU has halted the signing of any new contracts with Russian 
involvement for an indefinite period of time."
"Contract negotiations that were already under-
way were halted with immediate effect."
"Generally speaking, MTU had only very limited MRO 
business with customers in Russia and no presence in the region."
"In the OEM business, it is 
involved in the PW1400G-JM engine program, which was intended for use in a Russian mid-
haul jet (Irkut MC-21)."
This program has also been halted.
"Regardless of this, the company is 
constantly monitoring the situation, including its effects on global material supplies."
"Potential 
impacts to MTU’s supply chain are being assessed continually and factored into the procure-
ment strategy."
"The direct impact of the war in Ukraine on global air traffic and supply chains is 
limited at present."
"The outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023 has exacerbated the geopolit-
ical situation."
"The Economist Intelligence Unit in the UK considers that a further escalation of 
the conflict is unlikely, but that it increases the risk of a severe oil price shock."
"According to the 
World Bank, however, the global economy is now better positioned to deal with a supply-side 
shock than it was in October 1973."
"At present, the conflict does not have any significant impact 
on international air traffic."
"There is a significant impact on air traffic in Israel, but this accounts 
for less than 0.5% of global air traffic."
"The direct risk arises from factors that could reduce de-
mand for travel, for example, if the USA or other nations were to issue general travel warnings 
for their citizens."
"Escalation of the present conflict to a broader Middle East war in which Iran is 
involved would, however, have a significant negative impact on global aviation because airlines 
are dependent on major airport hubs such as Dubai and Doha and the region is an important 
corridor for global flights."
"During the 
decision-making phase of a program, highly qualified specialists perform cost-benefit analyses 
based on set procedures that include the obligation to carry out a risk analysis on the basis 
of different scenarios."
"MTU’s business model is based on long-term processes, particularly in 
the OEM segment."
"Many years of development, preproduction and volume production may lie 
between the decision to invest in a new commercial engine and the breakeven point."
"The risk 
is that the original economic and technological parameters might change over time, hence the 
need for frequent reassessments that take into account the most recent economic and techno-
logical developments."
"A decisive factor in this regard is, in particular, the success of the aircraft 
platforms on which the engines are deployed."
"MTU counters such strategy risks through a 
broad portfolio."
"This means that the company limits the impact of an individual program or 
aircraft platform by holding an interest in a wide range of products across all thrust classes."
"In the longer term, a further identifiable risk, in addition to that arising from MTU’s strategic 
decisions, is the arrival on the market of new competitors, e.g."
"However, 
given the high financial and technological barriers to market entry, this risk is currently not 
regarded as critical."
"The engine industry is dominated by high investment both as development compensation 
payments to the engine OEMs and as development work by MTU at the start of a new engine 
program."
"The long product lifecycles of both aircraft and engine programs have to be taken 
into account when assessing the return on these investments."
"Empirical observation indicates 
that the lifecycle of successful engine programs for commercial aircraft is well over 30 years 
from the initial purchase until the end of the program."
"In view of the long product lifecycle, the 
estimation requirements outlined above relate to long-term developments."
"Given the after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the 
resulting influence on the macroeconomic environment, demand for passenger flights remained 
below the pre-crisis level in 2023."
"Nevertheless, MTU’s commercial business posted a signifi-
cant upward trend both in the sale of new engines and in the aftermarket business."
"The com-
mercial MRO business also reported a strong increase in demand."
"The impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic and the war in Ukraine, especially in the form of supply chain problems and capacity 
constraints, as well as macroeconomic developments make it difficult for the company to make 
estimates and assumptions."
"The estimates and judgments are derived from assumptions based 
on the currently available information and effects of dynamic macro- and microeconomic factors 
on the aviation industry as a whole and on the business partners of relevance for MTU."
"Changes 
to these assumptions and estimates could have a highly negative impact on MTU’s business 
activities, cash flow, results of operations and financial position."
"In 2021, Airbus presented three aircraft concepts 
that could facilitate emission-free commercial flights, with an increased focus on hydrogen."
Modified engines should allow direct combustion of this volatile gas.
"According to Airbus, this 
technology could come into use from 2035."
"While combustion of hydrogen in modified engines 
would hardly alter MTU’s present business model, electric propulsion systems are in principle a 
substitution risk for conventional engine technologies."
"However, they do not yet come anywhere 
near the performance required to power a large passenger or freight aircraft."
"Among the key results from these studies are:
	
⁄
Propulsion systems based on electric batteries are suitable today for applications requiring 
low performance and short duration of use, such as general aviation and urban mobility."
"At the moment, there are no known battery concepts with sufficient capacity for short- and 
medium-haul aircraft, let alone for long-haul aircraft, which together represent an important 
market for MTU at present."
"⁄
Hybrid propulsion systems combine various power generation and fuel systems, for example, 
a kerosene-fired gas turbine and a battery-powered electric engine."
"Potential benefits are 
additional freedom in the design of aircraft and propulsion systems and integration of the en-
gine."
The focus is generally on reducing energy consumption and less on the climate impact.
"However, the targets of the Paris Agreement already cover all climate-related emissions."
"To 
identify the potential of further hybrid architectures as early as possible, MTU is involved in 
studies to evaluate such concepts."
"However, as yet they have not shown any major benefits 
compared with conventional propulsion systems in terms of energy consumption or climate 
impact."
"⁄
Considerable progress has been made in the development of fuel cells in recent years."
"How-
ever, their present performance potential is not sufficient for commercial aviation."
"In the long 
term, however, in conjunction with liquid hydrogen fuel, they have far greater potential for 
use in aviation than batteries."
"A positive decision was received on a coordinated application 
for funding under the EU Clean Aviation program submitted by a consortium of international 
partners led by MTU."
"The aim is to develop and assemble a demonstration unit for ground 
testing."
"In addition, MTU has acquired eMoSys GmbH, an innovative developer of electric 
motors based in Starnberg, Germany."
"⁄
CO2 is used as the starting product for the production of synthetic fuels."
"This significantly 
improves CO2 performance by 80% or more, depending on the production process."
"The big 
advantage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is that it is a “drop-in” fuel, in other words, no 
technical modifications to the aircraft, engine or airport infrastructure are necessary."
"In 
initial trials, SAF has also shown considerable potential to reduce condensation trails and 
their climate impact."
"SAF is therefore the technology that could bring a direct improvement 
in the climate impact of the present fleet."
"MTU Aero Engines is involved in research into SAF 
through its membership of the Bauhaus Luftfahrt research institute in Munich and aireg 
– Aviation Initiative for Renewable Energy in Germany e.V., which is based in Berlin."
"This 
not-for-profit initiative, where MTU leads the Fuel Utilization Working Group, is promoting 
the availability and use of renewable energies in aviation."
"In addition, MTU has signed a 
memorandum of understanding on a research cooperation for power-to-liquid fuels."
"Togeth-
er with its partners, Lufthansa, Airbus, Munich airport and the German Aerospace Center 
(DLR), the aim is to use and evaluate SAFs based on green energy."
"From today’s perspective, the fields in which MTU currently operates will not be affected by actual 
substitution risks in the foreseeable future."
"Nevertheless, MTU will continue to keep a close eye 
on developments in alternative propulsion concepts and compile further studies so it can react 
and, above all, participate in a timely fashion."
"In parallel, MTU is permanently working to improve 
the efficiency of conventional engines, thus continuously raising the ecological and economic 
access barriers for any substitute products."
"In addition to the substitution risks, risks could arise 
from climate-related regulations in the future."
"At present, there are no indications of specific 
activity by the regulatory authorities."
"Nevertheless, MTU is carefully monitoring developments in 
its field and will examine any emerging regulatory activities to identify potential strategic risks."
"All in all, in light of the measures taken to control them, MTU considers its macroeconomic and 
strategic risks to be manageable, even taking into consideration the short-term geopolitical risks 
outlined separately above."
"Market, program and cooperation risks
Market and program risks
(Competition & market risks, program & project risks)
The production of engine modules and components for aircraft is characterized by intensive 
competition between market participants."
"MTU is exposed to this competition in all aspects of 
its two operating segments: the commercial and military engine business (OEM) and the com-
mercial maintenance business (MRO)."
"In its OEM segment, MTU participates in programs to develop and build new engines, which its 
OEM partners offer to manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft, airlines and govern-
ments."
"Some of these programs compete with other engine programs for installation in the 
same aircraft type."
"Therefore, MTU’s success depends partly on the ability of its OEM partners 
to secure orders from manufacturers, airlines and governments for the engine programs that 
MTU is involved in."
"As well as competition in the new engines business, MTU’s competitive situation in the OEM 
segment includes the sale of engine parts and components in the aftermarket business."
"The 
aftermarket business is highly significant for MTU because the success of its participation in 
engine programs over the entire lifecycle depends to a large extent on this business."
"MTU’s 
commercial business is cyclical and sensitive to demand for air transport as well as to the finan-
cial situation of the commercial aviation industry."
MTU’s customers in the military engine business are national and international agencies.
"Therefore, political changes have an almost immediate effect on MTU."
"Given the tight national 
budgets that can be observed at present, especially in Europe, there is always the risk that 
countries may postpone or cancel orders."
"Due to the budget situation, it may be necessary to 
renegotiate the scope of contractually agreed deliveries."
"In the military engine business, MTU 
is firmly embedded in international cooperative ventures."
"This tends to limit risks because the 
partners work together to protect their common interests."
"Furthermore, the terms of existing 
contracts in the military sector are generally defined to cover a prolonged period of time, thus 
largely ruling out price risks."
"Even though the company assumes that defense budgets are likely to rise in the future,  
MTU’s military business is principally dependent on the sustained commitment of the German 
and other European governments and the U.S."
"administration to their military procurement 
programs."
"MTU is also exposed to competition in its MRO segment, which comprises commercial main-
tenance, repairs and overhauls."
"MTU is an independent provider of MRO services and there-
fore competes with airlines’ internal MRO service providers, which have links to many of its 
potential customers."
MTU’s other major competitors are OEMs’ maintenance operations.
"OEMs 
can link their service contracts with airlines to the sale of engines, which initially gives them 
a competitive advantage over MTU in this field."
"Worldwide, there are also many independent 
engine maintenance shops that, like MTU, are endeavoring to expand their market position."
"In the present geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, the commercial maintenance market 
is still affected by different speeds of recovery."
"The narrowbody business is recovering far faster 
than the widebody business and large domestic markets such as China, the USA, India are 
leading the way in the revival of regional traffic."
"Furthermore, it is evident that scheduled engine overhauls are being postponed (e.g., for 
engines with a remaining lifecycle) or are heavily budget-driven, e.g., to avoid expenditure by 
undertaking short-term optimization with lower MRO requirements."
Conditions are tough in some areas of the commercial MRO market in which MTU operates.
"The 
market conditions may remain challenging in the future as a result of factors that the company 
is unable to influence."
"⁄
Some of the engine programs in the MRO business are at an advanced stage in their lifecycle, 
so the MRO product portfolio could be too strongly focused on aging products and technolo-
gies."
"⁄
OEMs strive, and could continue to strive, to negotiate agreements where a large proportion 
of maintenance work is performed by internal units, especially because some of these units 
have links to their potential customers."
"A considerable shift towards such in-house units 
would reduce the competitive opportunities for third-party suppliers such as MTU."
"⁄
MTU is a contracting party in “fly by the hour” and “power by the hour” agreements which ob-
ligate it to perform maintenance work on engines at flat-rate, usage-based prices."
"Under these 
agreements, MTU therefore effectively assumes the risk of higher maintenance and overhaul 
costs."
"MTU may incur losses in connection with these agreements because the underlying 
price models require a complex analysis of the performance conditions (including assumptions 
on future engine use and shop visit rates) when submitting offers for long-term agreements."
"If 
the assumptions made by MTU prove incorrect, its margins could be negatively affected."
"These can be terminated at short notice in certain circumstances, e.g., if there is 
a change in the company’s shareholder structure."
"All these scenarios are beyond the company’s 
influence."
"The loss of a major customer could have a severely negative impact on MTU’s business 
activities, financial position or results of operations."
"For information on customer cluster risks, 
please refer to the Segment report in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"In its commercial business, MTU is involved in a number of risk- and revenue-sharing contracts 
(RRSP contracts) with OEMs, which relate to the development, production, sale and, in some 
cases, maintenance of commercial aircraft engines."
"The OEMs with which MTU has RRSP con-
tracts include Pratt & Whitney, GE Aerospace, IAE LLC and IAE AG."
"Through RRSP contracts, 
MTU participates in the development, production and maintenance of new engine programs."
"In return, MTU is entitled to a share of the revenues from the sale of engines, components and 
spare parts."
RRSP contracts are an important business base for MTU.
"They enable it to build up long-term 
relationships with OEMs and to participate in the major engine manufacturers’ sector-leading 
engine programs."
"Furthermore, MTU’s RRSP contracts entail considerable risks, including a 
lack of control over the activities covered and losses arising from pricing of program activities 
or upfront financing of design and development costs, cost overruns, guarantees, warranties 
and penalties."
"⁄
The RRSPs give MTU only limited inspection rights."
"As a result, it is not in a position to fully 
monitor whether the OEMs fully meet their obligations or exercise their rights fairly."
"⁄
OEMs can perform repair processes on MTU components or work with second-hand spare 
parts, which would have a negative effect on MTU’s sales of spare parts."
"⁄
MTU has to undertake considerable advance work for the design and development of the 
engine components, for which it has been allocated design and development responsibility."
This upfront work has to be performed before a single engine has been sold.
"Therefore, future 
revenue from the engine program is not certain."
"⁄
Similarly, MTU may be required to make advance payments (“entry fees”) to OEMs to enable 
it to participate in programs, as compensation for development or other work already under-
taken by the OEMs."
"⁄
Aircraft manufacturers may require OEMs to make advance payments for participation in 
new aircraft programs and to cover a percentage of the manufacturer’s R&D expenses."
"The 
OEMs generally pass some of the costs for such payments on to their RRSP partners."
"In the event of cost overruns in the development 
and production of parts for which MTU is responsible, MTU may therefore not be able to recoup 
such costs from its share of the program."
"As a result, its profits from the engine program could 
be reduced."
"In the commercial maintenance business, MTU’s interests in the Asian market include a 50:50 
joint venture, MTU Maintenance Zhuhai Co."
"In jointly controlled entities, 
where decisions have to be made collectively, there is always a risk of differences of opinion."
"Similarly, participation in international joint ventures often reveals cultural and political 
differences (for instance payment morale)."
"Moreover, changes in the geopolitical situation can 
adversely affect cooperation in joint ventures."
"From today’s standpoint, MTU believes its collaborative business model stands it in good stead 
to effectively manage market and program risks, in particular in respect of the challenges asso-
ciated with the development, production and market introduction of new engine programs and 
architectures."
"All in all, MTU considers the risks arising from market and program risks, and 
the dependence on cooperations to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to 
control them."
"MTU finances its R&D 
spending from its own funds, state funding and, to a limited extent, through corresponding exter-
nal orders."
"There is a risk that R&D activities might not meet customers’ or market requirements 
cost-effectively or on schedule or might not meet the targets set."
"Therefore, the company cannot 
give any assurance that the capital used for these R&D activities will lead to opportunities for com-
mercialization or result in productivity improvements commensurate with the resources invested."
"Furthermore, MTU is developing specific technologies and capabilities for its programs with a 
focus on reducing emissions and thus the climate impact of engines."
"If one of these programs 
should be halted or only be continued with a considerable delay, there is a possibility that MTU 
might not recoup the R&D costs and related investment expenditures incurred in the expectation 
of such programs."
Some of MTU’s development activities are carried out within the scope of cooperative ventures.
"Each stake in such ventures and in RRSPs spreads the R&D-related risks beyond the company and 
therefore reduces its control over them."
"If one of MTU’s cooperation partners has development and 
production risks, these could have a significant negative economic effect on MTU."
"In addition, MTU may be required to make penalty pay-
ments to its RRSP partners if it fails to meet delivery schedules or certain development targets."
"The risks are reduced by systematic, professional project management and risk diversification 
among the various development partners."
"All in all, MTU considers its research and development risks to be manageable, especially in light 
of the measures taken to control them."
"Manufacturing risks/shop floor risks
(Manufacturing, repair & maintenance risks, program & project risks)
Highly sophisticated components and new materials are needed to meet the requirements of 
OEMs and other consortium partners with respect to engine weight, fuel consumption and noise 
emissions."
"In order to efficiently produce and process such components, MTU develops – and 
gains official approval for – innovative new manufacturing techniques."
"This can lead to delays 
in the start of production, a temporary increase in unit costs or a temporary reduction in deliv-
ery volumes compared to the agreed level."
"A further risk is that customers might impose pen-
alties in the event that deliveries are delayed."
"It could also happen that the new manufacturing 
processes are not yet sufficiently mature to fully meet requirements when volume production 
is due to start."
"MTU counters this risk in technology projects by providing systematic support 
for the development and implementation process."
"All in all, MTU considers the manufacturing/
shop floor risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them."
"MTU is exposed to a risk of inadequate 
availability of such products."
"Disruption can be caused by factors such as cross-border supply 
chain problems caused by the geopolitical situation, for example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict 
and the Israel-Gaza conflict, and technical problems or bottlenecks in production capacity."
"MTU 
considers the probability of occurrence as possible and the potential impact as high."
"Moreover, 
crisis-driven price hikes (inflationary impact) could result in higher procurement costs."
"Given 
the structure of the RRSP agreements with its partners, MTU is only able to pass unexpected 
cost increases on to partners and customers to a limited extent in individual cases."
"Therefore, 
MTU takes the extensive measures outlined below to minimize the risks insofar as possible."
"MTU plans production requirements at regular intervals in close consultation with the supply 
chain to avoid unexpected procurement bottlenecks."
"Wherever it makes sense, products are 
validated and sourced from several suppliers."
"To limit inflation insofar as possible, there are 
multi-year supply contracts for many products."
"Regular supplier risk assessments, established 
purchasing and procurement processes, and close relationships with suppliers also help to 
minimize purchasing and procurement risks."
"All in all, MTU considers the procurement and 
purchasing risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them."
"Liability risks
(Program/project risks, compliance risks, governance risks)
Product liability claims, including defects in products produced by cooperation partners, and 
insurance costs could adversely affect MTU’s financial position."
"MTU operates in markets where its products and services could expose it to liability for per-
sonal injury, death or property damage."
"Liability could arise, in particular, due to failure of an 
engine or engine component designed, developed, manufactured, supplied or installed by MTU 
or one of its RRSP partners, in both the new engines business and the spare parts and aftermar-
ket business."
"In the commercial business, however, MTU is party to consortia and RRSP contracts."
"In most of 
these relationships, liability for third-party claims is borne by the consortium or the partners 
on the basis of their respective contribution to the consortium or RRSP, irrespective of the fault 
of the individual partner."
"In these RRSP programs, the consortium lead generally has the right 
to settle third-party claims unilaterally on behalf of all program participants."
"Consequently, 
MTU may be exposed to substantive liability for defects unrelated to the performance of its 
products."
"Furthermore, MTU’s ability to negotiate compensation in individual cases may be lim-
ited or non-existent."
"At the same time, the joint liability of engine program consortia constitutes 
effective transfer of the risk of defects that are attributable to MTU."
"In the military engine business, MTU is largely exempt from product risk liability."
"Most of the RRSP contracts require MTU to take out insurance to cover potential product liabil-
ity."
"Conversely, MTU makes participation in such programs contingent on such agreements."
"To 
cover the above risks, MTU has aviation product liability insurance with international aviation 
insurers (minimum rating of A– from Standard & Poor’s or A.M."
"Overall, such insurance 
covers the product liability risks discussed here within the value and content limits of such 
coverage."
It is possible that these limits could be exceeded within the RRSP contracts.
"All in all, MTU considers its liability risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures 
taken to control them."
"Risks relating to financial instruments
Foreign currency risks
(Financial risks)
More than 85% of MTU’s revenue is generated in U.S."
"It is currently expected that over 75% 
of this currency risk of the receipts generated in this currency will be naturally hedged by costs 
settled in U.S."
dollars and deferred invoice corrections.
"Most other expenses are incurred in euros 
and, to a lesser extent, in Polish zloty, Chinese renminbi, Serbian dinar and Canadian dollars."
"In 
line with the corporate policy of generating profit solely on the basis of operating activities and not 
through currency speculation, MTU makes use of hedging instruments exclusively for the purpose 
of controlling and minimizing the effect of U.S."
"dollar exchange rate volatility on the Group’s finan-
cial position and results of operations."
"The hedging horizon is up to five years and uses a model where 
the authorized hedging ratios decline the further in the future the expected net currency exposure 
is."
"Thus, only a small portion of the expected net U.S."
"dollar exposure in the present and following 
year is exposed to currency risks relative to the Group’s reporting currency (the euro)."
"As of December 31, 2023, MTU held a hedging portfolio comprising forward foreign exchange con-
tracts totaling U.S.$2,920 million (translated at the rate on the reporting date: €2,643 million), with 
maturities up to 2027."
"Detailed information on the financial instruments used to hedge future cash flows is provided in 
section IV, Note 35."
Financial risk in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
"In view of this hedging strategy, MTU considers its foreign currency risks to be manageable."
"For a detailed description of MTU’s financial management system, please refer to the Principles and 
objectives of financial management section under Financial situation."
"All in all, MTU considers the foreign currency risks to be manageable, especially in light of the 
measures taken to control them."
"Non-payment risk
(Financial risks, country risks)
Airlines, which are affected by the geopolitical and macroeconomic situation, are major direct and 
indirect customers of MTU."
"These companies may find themselves facing financial difficulties that 
affect the receivables of MTU and its partners."
"Due to the pandemic, global airline customers amassed considerable losses in 2020 and 2021 
(according to IATA, U.S.$138 billion in 2020 and U.S.$42 billion in 2021)."
"Although the situation 
improved in 2022 (U.S.$6.9 billion) in line with the development of the pandemic, the macro-
economic context nevertheless has to be taken into consideration."
"For 2023, IATA is expecting a 
profit of U.S.$4.7 billion, which reflects the recovery of air traffic to approximately the pre-crisis 
level prior to 2020."
"The consortium leaders in the commercial OEM business have intensive receivables management 
systems in place."
"Despite the crises, the credit default risks in the commercial OEM business 
are still considered to be manageable due to the structures established by the programs and 
long-standing experience."
"In the MRO business, the responsible account managers use estab-
lished and proven concepts to proactively monitor and manage credit risks in short cycles."
"A risk 
assessment is carried out before any relevant contract is signed, and systematic compensatory 
precautions are taken as needed."
"These include commercial credit insurance, export credit guar-
antees (Hermes coverage) and the structure of payment terms (prepayments)."
"All in all, MTU con-
tinues to consider the risks of non-payment to be manageable, especially in light of the measures 
taken to control them."
"Other risks arising from business operations
Compliance and legal risks
(Compliance risks, governance risks)
Compliance risks arise when managers or employees of the company fail to comply with laws and 
regulations or fail to observe internal guidelines."
These risks can arise in all areas of the company.
"MTU has implemented a number of measures with regard to its organizational structures and 
processes to minimize these risks and to safeguard compliance."
Criminal intent can never completely be ruled out.
"All in all, MTU considers the compliance 
risks to be manageable, especially given the measures taken to control them and the manage-
ment’s oversight and regular assessment of their appropriateness and effectiveness."
"To compensate for rele-
vant legal risks, processes that reinforce control are monitored and driven forward by central 
functions with technical and managerial authority."
"Identifiable risks arising from pending 
tax audits, customs audits, export controls and legal proceedings are managed by the central 
departments with the support of independent external consultants."
"The focus lies in particular 
on targeting process weaknesses and compensating for them."
"All in all, MTU considers its compliance and legal risks to be manageable, especially in light of 
the measures taken to control them."
"Environmental risks and climate change
Environmental risks  
(Environmental risks, governance risks)
Plants and installations at MTU’s sites are subject to local environmental and occupational safety 
laws and regulations."
"To prevent or minimize pollution, official operating permits or licenses 
have to be obtained."
"In this context, operating concepts are required."
"Investments and operating 
expenditures are designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations and oversight of 
their appropriateness and effectiveness is systematically supported by establishing corresponding 
risk management and internal control systems."
"Nevertheless, MTU cannot completely preclude in-
dividual breaches of the applicable laws and regulations and failure to comply with their at times 
dynamic development and interpretation."
"Consequently, there is a risk that considerable fines or 
penalties could be imposed, including criminal sanctions."
"In addition, permits or licenses might 
be revoked or not extended in the future."
"Some MTU facilities have a long history of industrial 
operations."
"In individual cases, newly discovered contamination of sites could result in a risk that 
MTU could be exposed to claims in excess of the known obligations."
"Further information on occupational safety and environmental protection can be found in the 
Non-financial statement."
"All in all, MTU considers the environmental risks to be manageable,  
especially in light of the measures taken to control them."
"Climate change
(Environmental risks, compliance risks, governance risks)
When setting its own targets, MTU is guided by the EU Green Deal, which is derived from the 
1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement and aims for climate neutrality by 2050."
"The main areas of 
activity are the transition to climate-neutral aviation and the shift to climate-neutral provision 
of the products and services."
"Goals and opportunities geared to sustainable commercial propulsion concepts as part of the 
transition to emission-free flying are defined in MTU’s Clean Air Engine Technology Agenda 
Claire."
"This is being implemented as part of MTU’s Leading Technology Roadmap, which focuses 
on two areas: First, the evolutionary development of gas turbines based on the GTF, combined 
with revolutionary propulsion concepts that greatly improve the cyclic process and significantly 
reduce all emissions."
"Second, complete electrification of the powerchain to maximize emis-
sion-free flying."
"Out of all the concepts considered, from MTU’s current standpoint the conver-
sion of hydrogen into power with the aid of a fuel cell is becoming most relevant."
"MTU calls 
this the Flying Fuel Cell."
"Alongside these topics, MTU is actively supporting developments to 
increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)."
"Information on alternative propulsion tech-
nologies for aircraft is presented in the sections entitled Substitution risks arising from disruptive 
technologies in the risk report and Research and development, and in the Non-financial statement."
"The measures designed to achieve climate-neutral provision of MTU’s products and services 
are set out in the ecoRoadmap, a climate strategy that MTU has been rolling out stepwise since 
2021."
"MTU continuously monitors greenhouse gas emissions in the production and mainte-
nance of engines and modules at its sites using the internationally recognized Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Protocol."
MTU strives to achieve a lasting reduction in GHG emissions.
"To make 
the climate impact of MTU even more transparent for stakeholders, the company takes part 
in the annual rating by the international non-profit organization CDP, which collects data on 
greenhouse gas emissions, climate risks, and climate strategies from companies once a year."
"All in all, MTU considers the climate change risks to be manageable, especially in light of the 
measures taken to control them."
"The two risks consid-
ered to be most critical in this field are system crashes due to technical faults and cyberattacks, 
resulting in the non-availability of systems, unauthorized disclosure of information, or perma-
nent loss of data."
"In view of the advanced digitalization of all material business processes at 
MTU, high availability and integrity of IT systems are crucial for smooth business operation."
"MTU generates, stores and processes extensive data with special confidentiality requirements – 
not only, but in particular, in the military business."
"MTU constantly invests considerable sums in technical and organizational measures to guar-
antee the availability, confidentiality and integrity of the IT systems used or operated by the 
company."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that MTU will be confronted with system failures, 
unauthorized access to confidential information or the loss of data."
"Every data theft, unautho-
rized data manipulation or data loss could negatively affect MTU’s relationship to present or 
potential customers."
Incidents like this could expose MTU to liability claims by third parties.
"All 
in all, MTU considers the IT risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to 
control them."
"Personnel risks
(Structural risks, social risks, communication risks)
The quality of MTU’s products and services depends to a large extent on the personnel it can 
recruit and retain, especially engineers and other specialists."
"MTU seeks to access both young 
talent and experienced specialists through company training programs, dual-study programs 
(which combine practical and academic work), attractive working conditions and marketing ac-
tivities."
"However, for many key positions within the MTU Group there only a few sources of new 
staff with the necessary qualifications."
"The competition for such employees has increased in 
recent years and could intensify further in the future."
"Moreover, it is expected that demographic 
change will greatly exacerbate the shortage of skilled workers and adversely affect the ability to 
maintain or increase the personnel capacity required for business operations."
"In addition to the risk that the MTU might not be able to recruit enough skilled workers, there 
is a risk of losing staff to other companies."
"The company is of the opinion that some MTU 
employees have technological know-how that makes them attractive to competitors or other em-
ployers."
"MTU’s success depends on its ability, not simply to employ technically skilled special-
ists, but also to retain them over the long term, motivate them and support their personal and 
professional development."
"Failure to recruit, retain and drive forward the development of qualified employees could impair 
MTU’s ability to realize its planned business performance."
"All in all, despite the present challenging economic situation, MTU considers the human  
resources risks to be manageable, especially in light of the measures taken to control them."
"In MTU’s risk management process, risks are assigned to one of four probability 
levels."
"Based on quantifiable risks (>€5 million) evaluated in the risk management process, for 
the fiscal year 2024, MTU derives risk-based earnings exposure based on experience of around 
€118 million (previous year: €85 million)."
"The OEM segment accounts for around €81 million of 
this and the MRO segment for the remainder."
"In addition to the earnings impact, the liquidity 
impact of the risks is identified, monitored and addressed through the risk management pro-
cess."
"In 2024, the identified risk factors could reduce liquidity by approximately €209 million 
(previous year: €180 million)."
"However, this would be covered by available cash and cash equiv-
alents and by credit lines that have not been drawn down."
"The OEM segment accounts for €170 
million of the liquidity risks and the MRO segment accounts for the remainder."
"This includes a risk of adverse effects on 
business performance if the capacities and supply of spare parts required to meet the higher 
maintenance requirements for the GTF fleet cannot be increased sufficiently fast."
"This risk 
is compounded by consortial liability for aircraft-on-ground penalty payments to the airlines 
affected."
"The resulting impact on liquidity is expected in the period 2024 through 2026 and has been 
taken into account in the current corporate planning and forecasts."
"Possible additional expense 
in connection with the PW1100GG-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan would put fur-
ther pressure on the liquidity situation."
"In the MRO segment, the effects of additional demand resulting from the forecast recovery in 
the engine maintenance business have to be taken into account as risk drivers."
"Al in all, taking into account the compensatory measures, at present MTU has not identified 
any risks that could jeopardize its status as a going concern."
"Market and program opportunities
Basic research and ongoing development of engine technologies, followed by their deployment in 
end products, have made MTU one of the world’s leading manufacturers of engine components."
"MTU’s new products lead the field in terms of efficiency because they save fuel and reduce 
emissions, noise and costs."
"The A320neo, Airbus A220 and Embraer E190-E2 with GTF engines 
are already being used successfully in scheduled service."
"Since 2018, the PW800 engine family, 
developed in cooperation with Pratt & Whitney Canada, which is based on the same core engine 
as the GTF, has powered premium manufacturer Gulfstream’s new generation of business jets."
"In order to balance out its engine portfolio in the long-haul segment, MTU has participated in 
the development of the GE9X, which will be the sole engine for the Boeing 777X."
"Thanks to this 
balanced portfolio, MTU expects to benefit in the decades ahead from the predicted growth in all 
present market segments: the regional jet, narrowbody and widebody segments."
"The expected 
growth relates to both commercial series and new components business and the spare parts and 
aftermarket business, which should benefit, in particular, from the business performance of the 
V2500 engine programs and successively from the GTF program family."
"There is also a chance 
that the compensation payments in connection with the risk- and revenue-sharing agreements 
with OEM partners could be below the level of the provisions recognized in the balance sheet."
"Among its customers in the military sector, MTU has established a reputation as a highly quali-
fied partner with comprehensive system know-how in product development, manufacturing and 
maintenance."
"In particular by driving forward its military-engine maintenance services with the 
German air force, MTU sees chances to strengthen its ties with Germany’s armed forces."
"These will doubtless receive a further boost from the increase in international 
defense budgets resulting from the geopolitical developments in the reporting period."
"Driven in particular by the T408 engine, the military-program partnership with GE Aerospace 
could generate further opportunities to participate in transatlantic programs in the future."
"This integrated approach 
to MRO enables program partners to become members of an MRO network, giving them access to 
the entire volume of MRO work associated with an engine series, in accordance with their share 
in the program."
There is a variety of models for participating.
"For instance, partners in the MRO 
network might only perform repairs on their own components, or be allocated a quota of complete 
shop visits corresponding to their program share."
"Membership in an MRO network offers more 
moderate margins than operating as an independent MRO provider."
"The independent MRO market for engines such as the GE90 and V2500 continues to offer long-
term prospects for MRO providers to participate in this steadily growing market."
"In particular, the 
increase in the number of aircraft no longer tied to the OEMs offers independent MRO providers 
like MTU the opportunity to gain new customers and to assume responsibility for managing the 
maintenance of large fleets."
"Thanks to ongoing investment in automation and focused expansion of capacity, the high demand 
in the OEM and MRO segments can be met cost-efficiently in the long term."
Through MTU Maintenance Lease Services B.
"V., Amsterdam, Netherlands, MS Engine Leasing 
LLC, Rocky Hill, CT, USA, and the partner companies in the PW1100G-JM MRO network, MTU 
aims to extend its activities in the lucrative leasing business and increase the scope of services 
provided in the aftermarket."
"Research and development opportunities
The risk report describes the risks associated with research and development and manufactur-
ing, but MTU’s ongoing technology and development activities also open up new business op-
portunities."
"This could help ensure a 
balanced portfolio of engines and new propulsion concepts at different life cycle phases both in 
the series and new components business and in the spare parts and aftermarket business."
"At-
tention should be drawn to MTU’s participation in the FCAS program in the reporting period as 
this can also be regarded as an important driver of the ongoing development MTU’s technolog-
ical expertise for commercial aviation applications as well."
"The risk report refers to the challenges involved in the continued ramp-up of new or relatively 
new programs; here too, the challenges can be transformed into opportunities."
"The risk analy-
ses undertaken to secure the ramp-up of production, backed up by the MRL process and design 
or process FMEA, result in timely identification of potential problems and the related lasting 
process improvements."
"The effects of these improvements are not only felt in new programs; 
they can also be transposed to existing ones."
"That leads, for example, to further cost reductions 
and enhanced delivery reliability."
"The expansion of, for example, AM (additive manufacturing) 
and ECM (electrochemical machining) opens up new possibilities for the application-optimized 
design of components and cost advantages in production."
"Through continuous improvements towards operational excellence, methods, processes and 
leadership behavior are constantly being developed as part of Lean Management@MTU."
"This 
results in increased transparency, a focus on value creation, support in achieving ambitious 
targets, and faster and more sustainable problem-solving and approaches to improvement based 
on integrated product development (IP4E)."
"Improved preventive approaches, a faster response to 
deviations from plan and sustainable and structured solutions to problems enable the company 
to put in place stable processes and optimize resource deployment."
"For further information, 
please refer to the section headed Research and development."
"Other opportunities
As a large part of the company’s revenue comes from contracts invoiced in U.S."
"dollars, especial-
ly in the commercial new engines and series business (OEM) and the commercial spare parts 
and aftermarket business (OEM, MRO), a strengthening of the U.S."
"dollar against the euro would 
improve MTU’s earnings."
"If there is a stabilization or short-term drop in inflation, this would 
have a positive effect on MTU’s cost structure and hence on its business results."
"See the Risk report for information on how the opportunities identified can be exploited and the 
associated risks avoided."
"Overall assessment of opportunities
Unlike the risk situation, as of December 31, 2023, there had not been any significant change in 
the opportunities compared with the previous year."
"MTU has taken all the organizational mea-
sures necessary to recognize potential opportunities in good time and respond to them adequately."
"MTU applies the same methods in its assessment of specific opportunities as it does when eval-
uating risks."
"As a conservative approach is taken to the identification of risks and opportunities, 
the opportunities are necessarily low compared with the risks."
"Based on the opportunities identified, MTU anticipates that the earnings opportunities in 2024 
are around €78 million (prior year: €33 million), with the OEM segment accounting for €64 mil-
lion of this."
"The liquidity-related opportunities amount to €85 million (previous year: €50 million), 
with €71 million of this attributable to the OEM segment."
"Opportunities to extend MTU’s range of 
products and services may initially lead to a financial burden."
"In view of the long cycles involved 
in the business model, these will only generate positive earnings in subsequent fiscal years."
"MTU 
does not currently foresee any fundamental changes in its opportunities."
"The risk management system (RMS) is a continuous and systematic process that has to be 
applied uniformly throughout the Group to ensure early identification, evaluation, management, 
monitoring and reporting of risks."
"The overriding objective is to safeguard the existence of the 
company and its future success."
The Executive Board of MTU bears overall responsibility for establishing the ICS and RMS.
"They are aligned to the business model and specific requirements of the MTU Group and are an 
important element in its comprehensive approach to corporate governance."
"This comprises a 
framework for creating sustainable value for shareholders, customers, employees and society."
All MTU entities are included in the ICS and RMS.
"The local management of each entity is 
responsible for realizing an appropriate and effective ICS and RMS, based on the Group-wide 
requirements, and is supported in this by the central divisions."
"MTU’s internal audit function, which is process-independent, plays an important role in 
checking the effectiveness of, and improving, the ICS and RMS."
"It regularly assesses, and helps 
to enhance, the controlling and monitoring systems."
"It is also considered to have an advisory 
function, contributing to improving business processes and, ultimately, the effectiveness of the 
ICS."
"The rules of procedure of the internal audit function comply with national and internation-
al requirements as laid down by the Deutsches Institut für Interne Revision and the Institute of 
Internal Auditors."
The internal audit function is also bound by the code of professional ethics.
"The administrative standards of the internal audit function are accessible to all employees on 
MTU’s intranet."
"The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board discusses risk management and the audits by 
the internal audit function."
"Compliance Management System
The ICS and RMS also include a compliance management system (CMS), which is aligned to the 
company’s risk situation."
"As the highest decision-making authority, the CEO bears the responsibility for the company’s 
business ethics and anti-corruption policy."
"The central functions responsible for ensuring com-
pliance are a Group-wide Compliance Officer and the Compliance Board."
"MTU has implemented a number of measures with regard to its organizational structures and 
processes to minimize these risks and to safeguard compliance."
The corporate culture at MTU is characterized by trust and mutual respect.
"The observance 
of legal and ethical rules and principles plays a central role in this respect."
"They are set out 
in a Code of Conduct, which has been implemented."
"This Code of Conduct embodies MTU’s 
corporate culture and reflects its resolve to comply strictly with the relevant laws and internal 
regulations."
It is a Group-wide guide to ethical business relations.
"The Compliance Officer submits quarterly reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory 
Board’s Audit Committee, which in turn reports to the plenary meetings of the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee oversees the Executive Board’s compliance ac-
tivities."
"The company has established a global whistleblower system that allows employees and 
external stakeholders to report suspected cases of misconduct confidentially to the Compliance 
Officer."
MTU strives to continuously develop its compliance system.
"That includes raising employees’ 
awareness of compliance-related matters."
"Objectives and components
MTU’s Executive Board, Supervisory Board and Audit Committee attach the greatest importance 
to ensuring the regularity, accuracy and reliability of MTU’s financial reporting."
"The account-
ing-related internal control and risk management system applicable for the MTU Group’s finan-
cial statements helps ensure systematic compliance with these internal and external accounting 
requirements."
"⁄
The accounting-related risk management system (RMS) is an integral part of the Group’s 
company-wide risk management system."
"It forms the basis for the uniform and appropriate 
handling of risks and for communicating them within the Group."
"The risks inherent in the 
Group’s financial reporting are among the corporate risks to be monitored as a whole."
"⁄
The design of the accounting-related internal control system (ICS) at MTU meets the require-
ments of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act (BilMoG), the definition provided 
by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer e.V."
"– IDW), 
the internationally recognized and established framework of the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO I) and the features specific to MTU."
"Main features
	
⁄
MTU has a clearly defined management and corporate structure."
"Key cross-organizational 
functions are coordinated centrally by the Group accounting department."
"At the same time, 
the subsidiaries have sufficient independence and are responsible for financial reporting."
"⁄
Appropriate guidelines (e.g., accounting policies / financial reporting guidelines / training 
materials) have been introduced and are regularly updated."
"The Group Accounting function, 
comprising the Group Financial Reporting and Accounting Policies departments, is the cen-
tral point of contact for questions on accounting and financial reporting and has the right to 
issue instructions within its area of competence."
"⁄
Group Accounting coordinates and leads the preparation of the consolidated financial 
reports, on the basis of a defined data reporting system for Group companies."
"It helps the 
Group companies implement the reporting system by providing a uniform chart of accounts 
for the Group, along with reporting forms that reference the chart of accounts and other 
supporting materials (quality assurance tools)."
"⁄
Preparation and quality assurance for the financial data communicated by the Group com-
panies for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements are undertaken on a decentral-
ized basis by the respective finance departments on the basis of the Group-wide reporting 
guidelines."
"⁄
As a supplementary control measure, (plausibility) and quality control checks on the report-
ed data are carried out by the Group accounting department and during the consolidation 
process for the consolidated financial statements."
"⁄
The (professional) qualifications of staff employed in the finance function are regarded as 
important for the quality of the Group’s accounting process and are monitored and driven 
forward by the management team."
"The departments and other organizational units involved 
in the accounting process are suitably equipped and regularly trained both in quantitative 
and qualitative terms."
"In this context, the structure and workflows are reviewed at regular 
intervals with the support of external consultants and through discussions with peer group 
companies."
"⁄
The Group accounting process is integrated into the ERP system through structured interfac-
es between the ERP accounting systems of the Group companies and the central consolida-
tion and Group reporting system."
"The IT systems are protected against unauthorized access 
by appropriate installations."
"As far as possible, standard software is for financial reporting."
"The accounting-related IT systems and processes (e.g., IT general controls) undergo regular 
internal and external reviews based on an extensive concept."
"⁄
Risk-mitigating controls are in place for accounting-related processes."
"Examples are stan-
dardized reporting formats, IT controls, systematic checks on forecast financial information, 
a level-of-authority approval concept for quality assurance of book-keeping and financial 
reporting information."
"The appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system 
are regularly assessed and refined by the administrative management of the relevant Group 
companies."
"⁄
The consolidated financial statements and all significant financial data submitted by Group 
companies for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements are audited annually by the 
Group’s external auditor."
"The same auditor also reviews the condensed consolidated financial 
statements and interim Group management report in the half-year financial report."
"This is 
supplemented by an external audit or assurance review of the separate financial statements 
compiled by the material Group companies."
"Furthermore, the non-financial statement 
prepared as part of the management report is subject to a limited assurance review by the 
auditors."
"⁄
The financial reporting and accounting-related ICS and RMS are regularly audited by the 
internal audit department."
"In addition, they are overseen by the Audit Committee."
"⁄
The sustainability-related information for the management report, especially the non-fi-
nancial statement, is compiled and reviewed on a decentralized basis by the responsible 
departments at MTU’s locations in accordance with the applicable Group-wide guidelines."
"Supplementary (plausibility) checks and other quality assurance processes are performed on 
the reporting data and their aggregation or consolidation by a central CR organization, which 
is overseen by an interdisciplinary CR Board."
The shares are registered shares.
"All shares have 
equal rights and each share entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual General Meeting
Restrictions on voting rights and the transfer of share ownership
As of December 31, 2023, MTU held 53,575 treasury shares (previous year: 64,262)."
"No voting 
rights are exercised in respect of treasury shares."
"The articles of association of MTU Aero En-
gines AG do not contain any restrictions on voting rights or the transfer of share ownership."
"The 
Executive Board has no knowledge of any agreement between shareholders that could give rise 
to any such restrictions."
"All amendments to the articles of association require a resolution by the Annual General 
Meeting with a majority of at least three quarters of the voting stock attending, pursuant to 
Section 179 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The right to add amendments of a 
purely formal nature, for instance changes to the share capital as the result of utilization of the 
authorized capital, is devolved to the Supervisory Board under the terms of Article 13 of the 
articles of association."
"Conditional capital
In accordance with Article 4 (6) of the articles of association, the company’s capital stock may 
be conditionally increased by up to €3,746,888 through the issue of up to 3,746,888 new reg-
istered non-par-value shares."
"The purpose of this conditional capital increase is to issue shares 
to owners or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants in accordance with the 
authorization granted to the company under a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting 
on April 15, 2015."
"Shares are issued at a conversion price or warrant exercise price determined 
on the basis of this authorization."
"Until April 14, 2020, the Executive Board was authorized to issue, with the prior approval of the 
Supervisory Board, bearer and/or registered convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants (col-
lectively referred to as “bonds”) with a total nominal value of up to €500 million."
"In 2016, MTU 
made use of this authorization to increase the company’s capital stock by issuing a convertible 
bond with a nominal value of €500 million."
"Further, in accordance with Article 4 (7) of the articles of association, the company’s capital 
stock may be conditionally increased by up to €1,600,000 through the issue of up to 1,600,000 
new registered non-par-value shares (Conditional Capital 2019)."
"The purpose of this condition-
al capital increase is to issue shares to owners or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds 
with warrants in accordance with the authorization granted to the company under a resolution 
passed by the Annual General Meeting on April 11, 2019."
"Further, in accordance with Article 4 (8) of the articles of association, the company’s capital 
stock may be conditionally increased by up to €2,600,000 through the issue of up to 2,600,000 
new registered non-par-value shares (Conditional Capital 2021)."
"The purpose of this condition-
al capital increase is to issue shares to owners or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds 
with warrants in accordance with the authorization granted to the company under a resolution 
passed by the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2021."
"Shares are issued at a conversion 
price or warrant exercise price determined on the basis of this authorization."
The bonds may be issued in return for cash contributions only.
"They may be 
issued in euros or – to an equivalent value – in any other legal currency, for instance that of an 
OECD country."
They could also be issued by an affiliated company where MTU exercises control.
"In such cases, and subject to the prior approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board 
was authorized to act as guarantor for the bonds and to grant the owners of the bonds the right, 
obligation or option to convert them into new registered non-par-value shares in MTU."
"Resolution concerning the authorization to purchase and use treasury 
shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) no."
"8 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"At no point in time may the value of the acquired shares, together 
with other treasury shares in the company’s possession or which are attributed to it pursuant 
to Section 71a et seq."
"of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), exceed 10% of the company’s 
capital stock."
"At the discretion of the Executive Board, the shares may be purchased through the 
stock exchange or by means of a public offer to buy addressed to all shareholders (or – where 
permitted by law – through a public call to submit a sell offer)."
"The shares must be sold in return for proceeds that are not more than 10% above or below the 
quoted share price, net of any supplementary transaction charges."
"In the event of substantial fluctuations in the share price, 
the Executive Board is authorized to publish a new public offer to buy or a public call to submit 
a sell offer based on a recalculated average value of share prices computed as outlined in the 
previous sentence."
"The volume of the offer can be limited in the case of shares purchased by means of a public 
offer to buy addressed to all shareholders (or a public call to submit a sell offer)."
"If the whole 
take-up of the offer (or the total number of offers) exceeds this volume, the purchase must be 
transacted in proportion to the number of shares offered."
"Preferential treatment may be given 
to small packages (up to 100 shares) offered for sale."
"If shares are to be used by issuing them to active 
or former members of the MTU Executive Board under the terms of the company’s stock 
option programs, the Supervisory Board is authorized to transact this issue."
"d) 
Furthermore, the Executive Board was authorized to use the purchased treasury shares as 
partial or complete payment in conjunction with business combinations or the acquisition, 
whether direct or indirect, of companies, parts of companies or holdings in companies."
"f) The Executive Board was moreover authorized, with the consent of the Supervisory Board and 
without any requirement for a further resolution to be passed by the Annual General Meeting, 
to redeem purchased treasury shares in whole or in part."
"They may be redeemed in a simplified 
procedure without any capital reduction and by adapting the arithmetic value of the outstanding 
portion of non-par-value shares to that of the company’s stock capital."
"The redemption may be 
limited to a defined fraction of the purchased shares."
"The authorization to redeem shares may be 
used on one or more occasions."
"If the simplified procedure is employed, the Executive Board is 
authorized to amend the number of non-par-value shares stated in the articles of association."
"g) 
The above-stated authorizations may be exercised on one or more occasions, in whole or 
in part, individually or in combination."
"They may also be exercised by Group companies as 
defined in Section 17 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"h) 
The subscription rights of existing shareholders in respect of these treasury shares are ex-
cluded insofar as the shares are utilized in the manner stated above in subsections b) to e)."
"i) 
The authorization to purchase treasury shares granted to the company on April 15, 2015, is 
revoked as of the effective date of this new authorization."
"The authorization to use the trea-
sury shares purchased under the terms of the above-mentioned earlier resolution dated April 
15, 2015, remains in force."
"In the event of a change of control, bondholders can 
redeem their bonds prematurely at the terms described in more detail in the bond conditions."
"A “change of control” comprises the acquisition of control or a mandatory offer under Section 
35 (2) sentence 1 and Section 14 (2) sentence 1 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG)."
"In June 2022, MTU Aero Engines AG agreed a revolving credit facility with a banking syndicate, 
which provides for a right of termination for the lenders in the event that one or more persons 
assume(s) control of MTU Aero Engines AG or acquire(s) more than 50% of the company’s 
issued capital."
"In addition, MTU Aero Engines AG has a cooperation agreement with another engine manufac-
turer."
"Under this agreement, that manufacturer is entitled to terminate the contract for cause 
in the event that one of its competitors acquires more than 50% of the company’s voting rights."
MTU Aero Engines AG has further cooperation agreements with the same engine manufacturer.
"Under these agreements, that manufacturer is entitled to terminate the contract for cause in the 
event that one of its competitors acquires more than 30% of the company’s voting rights."
"MTU Aero Engines AG also has equity investments in various joint ventures with other engine 
manufacturers, the purpose of which is to cooperate in the development and production of air-
craft engines."
"According to the provisions of the corresponding agreements, MTU Aero Engines 
AG’s share in the joint venture may be withdrawn and its participation in the accompanying 
cooperation agreements terminated if MTU Aero Engines AG is taken over by a competitor of 
the partners in these consortia."
It is standard market practice to confer contractual rights of this kind.
"Should an event meeting 
any of the above definitions of change of control take place, the exercise of rights ensuing from 
these agreements could have a substantial impact on MTU’s net assets, financial position or 
results of operations."
"of the German 
Securities Trading Act (WpHG), acquires the majority of the voting rights and this results in 
material disadvantages for the Executive Board."
"In such case, 
each member of the Executive Board shall have a special right of termination, which is to be 
exercised within a period of six months, with a period of notice of three months to the end of a 
month."
"For the calculation of the severance payment, 100% target fulfillment is agreed for the 
variable compensation components."
No comparable agreements have been made with regard to other employees.
"This is a combined non-financial statement in accordance with 
Sections 289b et seq."
and Sections 315b et seq.
of the German Commercial Code (HGB).
"It con-
tains disclosures relating to MTU Aero Engines AG as the parent company, as well as information 
relating to the MTU Group."
"The structure of the Group is described in the Combined management 
report under The MTU Group."
"In addition, in early summer, the company publishes a separate sustainability report for the pre-
vious fiscal year in accordance with the international reporting standards of the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI)."
"Since the definition of materiality used by CSR-RUG differs from the definition 
used by the GRI, MTU has not used any standard as the framework for its non-financial statement
Business model
The MTU Group and its business model are described in the Combined management report under 
The MTU Group."
"CEO Lars Wagner has also been named as 
Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)."
"Above all, he defines MTU’s positioning, sustainability strategy 
and objectives, in close collaboration with the CR Board."
"The CR Board and CSO together form the 
highest decision-making body at MTU."
"The Group-wide CR strategy is the starting point for an annual materiality process in which MTU 
identifies the material topics for the company and its stakeholders."
"The materiality analysis for 
2023 was already performed on the basis of the new European reporting standard ESRS (Europe-
an Sustainability Reporting Standard, November 2022), which will be mandatory for the first time 
for the fiscal year 2024."
"Financial materiality comprises the opportunities and risks for MTU based 
on probability and scope."
"Impacts on the environment and the society are estimated on the basis 
of their scale (low/high), scope (individual/global) and remediability (irreversible/reversible) 
along the entire value chain for the time dimensions short-, mid- and long-term."
"The materiality is 
based on a gross assessment."
"Using this method, for 2023, seven topics were identified as relevant for the non-financial state-
ment in accordance with the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG)."
"CSR-RUG 
requires the provision of relevant non-financial information on the business performance, oper-
ating results and position of the Group."
"Information is also required on the impact of its business 
activities on the following aspects: environmental, employee, and social matters, human rights, 
combating corruption, and possible additional aspects."
"As one such additional aspect, the non-fi-
nancial statement contains information on product quality and flight safety."
"Using the method 
based on the ESRS to define materiality, occupational safety and human rights in the supply chain 
are no longer material topics for the NFS, but are still included on a voluntary basis to ensure 
consistent reporting."
"The materiality evaluation of the topics was discussed and confirmed by the 
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee."
"Involving stakeholders
MTU is engaged in dialogue with external stakeholders regarding environmental and social 
impacts."
"Stakeholders can give feedback on MTU’s sustainability management via an online 
survey."
"There are also personal and anonymous reporting channels that stakeholders can use 
to submit complaints and grievances to the company."
"The Munich, Hanover and Ludwigsfelde 
sites provide information for the public on their environmental impact and activities in annual 
environmental declarations."
"MTU is committed to the global multi-stakeholder initiative, the UN 
Global Compact, and its ten principles including respect for human rights, fair working condi-
tions, protecting the environment and fighting corruption."
"In addition, the company is repre-
sented on topic-specific initiatives such as the TRACE International anti-corruption initiative."
"Risk management for non-financial topics
Risk identification and evaluation for the topics covered by the non-financial statement are 
based on MTU’s established opportunity and risk management."
"In this process, the risk inventory is reviewed for new 
material topics and aspects."
"To supplement the risk management process, MTU has established 
a compliance system with a separate reporting line."
"It is organized and managed by the Compli-
ance Officer."
"The risk analysis did not reveal any reportable risks with a high probability of having a severe 
negative impact on the identified non-financial topics."
"Product quality and flight safety
Product quality and flight safety have very high significance for MTU."
"High quality stan-
dards, together with product safety and reliability, are important corporate objectives that are 
enshrined in the MTU Principles."
"MTU’s Quality Vision 2025 also focuses on faultless quality, 
product safety in flight, and high customer satisfaction."
"A Group-wide integrated management 
system (IMS) ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and internal regulations as well 
as clear assignment of responsibilities within the company."
"Corporate Quality is a 
separate organizational unit directly subordinate to the Chief Operating Officer (COO)."
"It reports 
quarterly to the Executive Board on quality aspects and flight-related incidents."
"In accordance 
with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standard, the IMS includes a specific 
safety management process, which defines how to handle safety-related incidents at MTU’s 
locations and in air traffic."
"Appropriate organizational structures and responsibilities, such as a 
Flight Safety Board and a Flight Safety Manager, have also been established."
"Aviation authorities set high regulatory quality and safety requirements
Quality and safety are of paramount importance in aviation and the corresponding framework 
conditions are strictly regulated."
"Legal requirements for the safe operation of flights are closely 
monitored by the aviation authorities."
"The company has to comply with the legal requirements 
imposed upon it as a development, manufacturing and maintenance organization in the aviation 
industry."
"MTU continuously evaluates the regulatory requirements for its business activities 
in order to obtain or keep the required licenses, approvals and certifications from the avia-
tion authorities."
"The strict regulatory quality and safety requirements must be complied with 
throughout the entire product lifecycle of an engine."
"MTU has therefore implemented processes 
designed to meet these requirements."
"For example, the aviation sector has strict rules govern-
ing documentation in order to verify the airworthiness of engines and their components."
"There 
must be no gaps in documentation over the entire product lifecycle."
"To ensure compliance with 
quality and safety requirements, MTU has implemented comprehensive testing and monitoring 
processes throughout the entire value chain."
"Components undergo thorough testing, based on 
their criticality, and are monitored in the production process."
"Annual internal audits and quality audits by customers and authorities provide evidence that 
MTU meets uniformly high standards and is in conformance with regulatory requirements."
MTU uses supplier audits to monitor suppliers’ compliance with sector-specific requirements.
The audits are managed on a site-specific basis.
"The implementation of MTU’s IMS at the indi-
vidual sites is validated and certified by independent and accredited external auditors."
"Continuous monitoring of quality
MTU continuously monitors quality and, where necessary, initiates appropriate measures to 
achieve effective improvements."
"Providing customers and partners with safe and high-quality 
products and services helps to keep MTU’s business competitive."
"“We increase the satisfaction 
of our stakeholders” was an overarching corporate objective for 2023."
"Sub-targets were specified 
to demonstrate that the high performance and quality of its products and services make MTU 
an attractive partner for its stakeholders."
"The targets are implemented through initiatives with 
a long-term focus, which are realized on a continuous basis."
"A defined process is in place to ensure that all customer complaints about sub-standard quality 
of MTU products are followed up and analyzed, and that appropriate measures are defined and 
implemented to effectively eliminate the root cause."
"The success of these measures is closely 
monitored."
Customer complaints are evaluated at site level.
"At the majority of sites, the number 
of customer complaints declined or was unchanged in the reporting period."
"Geared Turbofan fleet management plan
During 2023, it became evident that the service life of components in the share attributable to 
the program partner Pratt & Whitney could be reduced in some cases."
"This is due to a rare con-
dition of the powder metal used in their production."
"This requires an extensive fleet manage-
ment plan for Geared Turbofan engines of type PW1100G-JM."
"In the coming years, 600 to 700 
shop visits will be necessary to inspect the relevant components and, if necessary, replace them 
as a preventive measure."
"Continuous development focuses first and foremost on the set of rules and internal 
quality reporting."
"In addition, regular site-specific training on quality aspects is organized for 
managers and employees."
"For example, new employees are required to complete a mandatory 
training module on the IMS."
"As a first step, a new 
training concept with mandatory web-based training for all employees and additional training 
modules for MTU safety personnel has been rolled out at the German locations."
"In addition, the 
Quality Day 2023 organized as part of the Passion for Quality initiative was dedicated to flight 
safety and the safety management system."
"In 2023, further progress was also made in imple-
menting the new sector-wide AS13100 standard, which were developed jointly in the AESQ."
"MTU and its suppliers are required to implement these in their regulations and apply them in 
practice."
"MTU is also involved in work on a new edition of AS13100, which will include, for the 
first time, lessons learned."
"Through its responsibility in the area of climate change mitigation, 
MTU wants to make a contribution to achieving the Paris climate target, which is its lodestar in 
the development of technology."
"When setting its own targets, MTU is guided by the EU Green 
Deal, which is derived from the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement and aims for climate neu-
trality by 2050."
"MTU’s technology agenda Claire (Clean Air Engine) is focused on possible solu-
tions for aircraft engines and their potential to reduce climate impact and energy consumption."
"There is a three-step program to achieve these targets: The focus is no longer on CO2 emissions 
but on the overall climate impact of air traffic."
"Alongside CO2 emissions, that includes non-CO2 
impacts, especially those resulting from emissions of nitrogen oxides and the formation of con-
densation trails."
"In keeping with this paradigm shift, MTU realigned Claire in 2022."
"In view of the long product cycles in the aviation sector, the climate goals for engines have 
a long-term perspective."
"They are set out in memoranda of understanding with stakeholders 
(airlines, the aviation industry, research, aviation authorities) such as “Fly the Green Deal,” the 
European vision for climate-neutral aviation."
"In order to have a widespread impact in 2050 and 
contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality, the products enabling climate-neutral avia-
tion have to be launched on the market well before 2050."
"Therefore, MTU is also stepping up the 
development of completely new propulsion concepts that go beyond conventional gas turbines."
"It is working on these revolutionary engine architectures with partners from industry, science 
and research, for example, with Bauhaus Luftfahrt and the German Aerospace Center (DLR)."
"In 
parallel with this, today’s engines such as the highly efficient Geared Turbofan (GTF) are being 
driven forward in collaboration with Pratt & Whitney and combined with sustainable fuels."
"Multi-level technology and innovation process
MTU manages technology development for future products using a multi-level process."
"In the mid 
term, advanced product designs will be generated in order to derive technology requirements."
"In 
the long term, pilot concepts will be drafted with the aid of technology radar, and development of 
the enabling technologies and innovations will be initiated."
"The next-generation GTF is one ex-
ample of an advanced product design."
"The pilot concepts are the water-enhanced turbofan (WET) 
and the Flying Fuel Cell™ (FFC)."
"An Innovation Board regularly discusses all topics related to 
technology and innovation and initiates technology projects and studies."
"Evolutionary development based on the Geared Turbofan
Together with its partner, Pratt & Whitney, MTU offers a highly efficient engine concept: the 
GTF engine family."
"These engines are used in modern short- and medium-haul aircraft (Air-
bus A320neo and A220, Embraer E2 family of E-jets)."
"Compared with the previous generation 
of engines, the GTF family reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 20% per 
flight."
"Since it came into service, the GTF engine family has clocked up 26 million flight hours 
and thus avoided 14 million tons of CO2 (data from Pratt & Whitney; status year-end 2023)."
"Test flights are currently being carried out with the GTF Advantage, a technologically more 
advanced version of the GTF for the A320neo family."
"Moreover, it has already been successfully 
tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs)."
"SAFs are sustainably produced drop-in fuels, which can be used without major modifications."
They will pay a major role in the transition to climate-neutral flying.
"MTU is engaged in continu-
ous dialogue with relevant stakeholders and takes part in studies to support the introduction of 
SAFs, for example, as a member of aireg - Aviation Initiative for Renewable Energy in Germa-
ny e.V., an association of airlines, manufacturers, and research institutes."
"A study on SAFs 
published by aireg with MTU’s involvement shows their enormous potential."
"In addition, MTU 
is involved in the Cleantech working group led by the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, 
Regional Development and Energy."
"The aim of this working group is to build a power-to-liquid 
plant in Bavaria."
"In the reporting period, MTU also signed a memorandum of understanding 
on a research alliance to start work on power-to-liquid aviation fuels (PtL)."
"Representatives of 
MTU, Lufthansa, DLR, Airbus and Munich airport will be working together on this."
"Therefore, leading aviation companies and scientists are pooling their strengths to accel-
erate the selection of technology, market launch and industrial scale-up of PtL fuels in Germany."
"The research alliance will also look into other questions such as the impact on local air quality, 
maintenance requirements and the use of pure PtLs, in other words, fuel without the admixture 
of fossil-based kerosene."
"In order to utilize the full potential of the GTF, MTU and Pratt & Whitney are developing the 
next generation of this engine."
"Many of the technologies required for this are being developed 
as part of the German aviation research program (LuFo)."
"MTU is concentrating on its GTF com-
ponents: the high-pressure compressor and the high-speed low-pressure turbine."
"Revolutionary propulsion concepts for the path to climate neutrality
As described in Claire, evolutionary technology development will not achieve climate neutrality 
by 2050."
Revolutionary propulsion concepts are needed.
"The concept favored by MTU is the 
water-enhanced turbofan (WET), which harnesses energy form exhaust emissions from the 
engine."
Water is vaporized by a vaporizer and injected into the combustion chamber.
"The water 
required for this is obtained from the exhaust emissions via a condenser."
"This wet combustion 
concept brings a massive reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides."
"At the same time, it greatly 
reduces fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and the formation of condensation trails."
"Both inno-
vative WET technology and hybrid-electric technologies are being developed as part of SWITCH, 
one of the biggest technology projects emerging from the first call for projects by the European 
Commission’s Clean Aviation research program."
"The aim is to ground 
test a hybrid-electric gas turbine for aircraft based on the Geared Turbofan within three years 
and to bring the WET concept to Technology Readiness Level 4."
"This Readiness Level describes 
the successful validation of components in the laboratory."
"SWITCH involves an international 
consortium led by MTU."
"The industrial partners are Airbus, Pratt & Whitney, Collins Aerospace 
and GKN Aerospace."
Other partners are the DLR and universities.
"Complete electrification of the powertrain in aircraft is another possibility for a revolutionary 
propulsion concept."
The MTU concept is called the Flying Fuel Cell.
"Initially, it could be used for 
regional short-haul flights."
"This propulsion system does not generate CO2, NOx or particulate 
emissions."
"MTU introduced its ecoRoadmap climate strategy 
at its headquarters in Munich in 2021."
"Following the completion of the first stage of expan-
sion to Green Europe, this was extended to all fully consolidated production and maintenance 
locations (Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde, Rzeszów, Nova Pazova, Vancouver) as Green Global 
during the reporting period."
"In addition, it compensates for unavoidable CO2 emissions at the Munich location."
"As 
a result, operation of this location has had a climate-neutral footprint since 2021."
"The long-term 
objectives of Green Global are climate-neutral production and maintenance by 2045."
"Environmental management at site level
The Executive Board bears responsibility for Group-wide environmental protection at opera-
tional level."
"Standards are implemented through an environmental management system that 
defines processes, responsibilities and targets at site level."
"Environmental protection is part of 
MTU’s integrated management system (IMS)."
"The environmental protection criteria apply for 
all business units and processes and are implemented through process workflows and special 
company standards."
"The minimum standard for the operation of machines and facilities such 
as test stations is set by national legislation and secondary regulations."
"The Executive Board re-
ceives a report on energy consumption (based on production hours) at the Green Global sites as 
part of the quarterly IMS reporting."
"Moreover, as part of the ecoRoadmap climate strategy, CO2 
emissions reduction in the operation of the sites is reported regularly to the Executive Board, 
CR Board and Green Global Board, which comprises the site managers at the fully consolidated 
production and maintenance facilities."
"These reports cover the remaining CO2 emissions and 
the results of the sustainable measures."
"Here, the company sets out its commitment to an integrated approach, with environmental and 
climate protection included in business decisions."
"Environmental responsibility is explicitly set 
out in the MTU Principles in the section “Environment and society.” Furthermore, MTU expects 
sustainable and proactive climate protection from its suppliers."
"These expectations are set out 
in a binding code of conduct."
"Employees are actively included in environmental protection through information campaigns 
and training, for example, to encourage them to save energy at work."
"These outreach measures 
include the onboarding process for new employees, an environmental action day for apprentic-
es and web-based training in environmental protection, which was introduced in 2022."
"MTU’s 
support for its employees’ environment and climate awareness is an integral part of the Code of 
Conduct."
"Corporate environmental production is organized on a decentralized basis and climate protec-
tion is included in the assessment of environmental impacts."
"Local departments at all produc-
tion sites are responsible for implementing the relevant measures."
"The site management bears 
direct responsibility for environmental protection at each site."
"They are advised and supported 
by internal experts."
"The specialist departments regularly share information on innovations 
and best practices."
"The German sites are certified as complying the international management 
standard ISO 14001 and/or the EU Eco-Audit Regulation (Eco Management and Audit Scheme, 
EMAS)."
"More green energy for MTU
Within the framework of the ecoRoadmap climate strategy, local teams draw up sustainability 
measures, which they implement in collaboration with the relevant departments."
"In 2023, for ex-
ample, these included optimizing ventilation systems and improved workflows for engine testing."
An important step towards carbon neutrality at the MTU sites is the shift to green energy.
"That 
includes photovoltaic (PV) installations to generate green electricity and the use of sustainable 
aviation fuels (SAFs) for engine tests on test stations."
"In 2023, the operation of PV installations to 
generate electricity for captive use was extended at the Rzeszów site."
"MTU is also driving forward 
the deep geothermal project at its Munich location; the preparatory construction work started at 
this site in the reporting period and the drilling tower was erected."
"In the future, thermal under-
ground water sources could make the supply of heat at the site largely independent of fossil fuels."
"In this way, MTU wants to help make the city of Munich climate-neutral by 2035."
"It has rejoined 
the city’s Climate Pact initiative, which continued in 2023."
"In addition, MTU is stepping up the 
procurement of green electricity."
"Electricity consumption at its locations in Poland and Serbia is 
already completely emission-free."
"The production and maintenance locations also have local environmental programs that pre-date 
the ecoRoadmap."
"The “Eco Facility 2025” project at the site in Rzeszów, Poland, aims to reduce 
environmental impacts and enhance environmentally conscious behavior by employees."
"Energy consumption 2023
CO2eq emissions from production and maintenance activities (Scope 1 and 2) mainly result 
from the energy consumption required to operate the facilities."
"In the twelve-month perfor-
mance period from December 2022 to November 2023, which differs from the fiscal reporting 
period, consumption of energy (Scope 1 and 2) at the MTU Group’s production sites totaled 
323,951 megawatt hours (MWh) (2022: 305,359 MWh)."
"Energy consumption at the Munich 
site was 172,926 MWh (2022: 168,195 MWh)."
"The increase in energy consumption was due to 
higher capacity utilization and the inclusion for the first time of the new site in Serbia in the 
period under review."
"Scope 2 
energy consumption is attributable to the consumption of purchased energy (electricity and district heating)."
"Other energy 
consumption (e.g."
"other fuels) is not reported because its contribution to total consumption by the MTU Group is not 
material."
The Nova Pazova production site is included in the data for 2023 for the first time.
"Energy consumption in external 
testing of engines and industrial gas turbines was 1,501 MWh; SAF combustion during testing at the Hanover location was 
235 MWh."
This energy consumption is not included in the data in the table.
"CO2 emissions data for 2023
In the period under review (December 2022 to November 2023), CO2eq emissions from the 
MTU Group’s production sites totaled 49,063 metric tons (t) CO2eq (2022: 47,125 t)."
"Scope 1 
emissions were 39,428 t CO2eq (2022: 37,738 t)."
"Scope 2 emissions were 9,635 t CO2eq (2022: 
9,387 t)."
"Here too, increasing capacity utilization and the new location in Serbia contributed to 
the increase in emissions."
"That said, in Serbia emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 
2) were offset by the purchase of allowances, so arithmetically their contribution was zero."
"MTU undertook offsetting of the remaining Scope 1 and 2 CO2eq emissions in Munich, so this 
location had a climate-neutral footprint in 2023."

	 Scope 1 CO2eq emissions result from direct consumption of the fuels kerosene, natural gas, and fuel for mobility purposes."
Scope 2 CO2eq emissions are attributable to the consumption of purchased energy (electricity and district heating).
"The 
Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the energy suppliers’ emissions factors (market-based method)."
"Further sources of 
CO2eq emissions such as other fuels and refrigerants are not reported because their contribution to the Group’s emissions 
is not material."
The Nova Pazova production site is included in the data for 2023 for the first time.
"Emissions from energy 
consumption at the site in Canada are now included in full."
"External testing of engines generated 389 metric tons CO2eq, 
while the combustion of SAF in engine testing in Hanover generated 61 metric tons CO2eq."
"These emissions are not 
included in the CO2eq data for the MTU Group."
"Reducing CO2 is an important ESG target
The high priority given to climate protection is also shown by the fact that reducing CO2 emis-
sions is an important ESG (environmental, social and governance) target."
"The ESG-related KPI 
CO2 affects the variable compensation of the Executive Board and senior executives."
"Achieve-
ment of the targets is based on the ecoRoadmap climate strategy for emissions from MTU’s glob-
al production/maintenance locations – Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde, Rzeszów, Vancouver 
und Nova Pazova."
"The twelve-month performance period 
used for this is December 1, 2022 through November 30, 2023 and thus differs from the report-
ing period."
"They include, for example, emissions from upstream value creation by suppli-
ers, emissions relating to capital expenditure, and downstream use of products."
"Plans to evaluate 
MTU’s Scope 3 emissions are now included in the sustainability strategy and are currently being 
implemented."
"The aim is to identify and evaluate all upstream and downstream activities, report 
on significant categories, and reduce such emissions."
"Prevention of bribery and corruption
MTU’s long-term business success is based on compliance with the applicable laws and regula-
tions and the company’s own internal guidelines."
"MTU condemns corruption of any kind and all 
other forms of white-collar crime."
"A Group-wide Code of Conduct requires employees and manage-
ment to act with responsibility and integrity and to comply with the law and in-house regulations."
"The MTU Principles foster consistency, reliability and integrity in MTU’s activities."
"Further regu-
lations such as the MTU standard on donations, sponsorship and customer events contain further 
details and also help prevent corruption."
"As the highest decision-making authority, the CEO bears the responsibility for the company’s 
business ethics and anti-corruption policy."
"The central functions responsible for ensuring com-
pliance are a Group-wide Compliance Officer and the Compliance Board."
"The Compliance Officer 
is responsible, in particular, for ongoing development of MTU’s established compliance system to 
prevent corruption."
He works in close consultation with the Compliance Board.
"The Compliance 
Board holds both regular and ad-hoc meetings at the invitation of the Compliance Officer."
"The 
Compliance Officer submits quarterly reports to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board’s 
Audit Committee, which in turn reports to the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board."
"The 
Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee oversees the Executive Board’s compliance activities."
"In 
addition, the Compliance Officer has a regular direct reporting line to the CEO."
"The company has established a global whistleblower system that allows employees and external 
stakeholders to report suspected cases of misconduct confidentially to the Compliance Officer."
"As well as the scope to seek personal contact, the web-based iTrust system can be used to submit 
reports anonymously."
"The Compliance Officer examines all allegations received and manages the 
necessary measures if they prove founded."
"Zero tolerance of bribery and corruption
MTU’s goal is to prevent bribery and corruption throughout the Group (principle of zero tol-
erance)."
"To minimize corruption risks, all sales-related consultancy contracts are reviewed by 
the Compliance Officer, where relevant with the assistance of external service providers, before 
they are concluded or renewed."
"The Corporate Audit unit uses audits to monitor the effective-
ness, efficiency and appropriateness of MTU’s internal control system."
"There were no confirmed 
cases of corruption in the reporting period."
"It has also signed the standards issued by the 
Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe (ASD), which aim to prevent bribery 
and corruption and encourage fair and equal competition."
"In Germany, this initiative is led by 
the German Aerospace Industries Association (BDLI)."
"Moreover, these standards are a binding 
element of contracts with sales consultants."
"Activities focus on prevention
MTU strives to continuously develop its compliance system."
"That includes raising employees’ 
awareness of compliance-related matters, for example, with the aid of training materials on the 
Code of Conduct for all employees."
Training continued in the reporting period.
"2,523 employees 
took part in 2023."
Training now comprises voluntary routine training for all employees.
"As part 
of the establishment of the MTU Maintenance Serbia location, a process to screen new suppliers 
in Serbia for corruption risks was defined and has been continuously applied since then."
"In addition, MTU has an internal standard that contains 
generally valid parameters, rules and definitions of performance indicators."
"Quarterly Group-
wide reporting to the Executive Board is established."
"Occupational safety is organized on a 
decentralized basis at MTU and is therefore aligned with site-specific requirements."
"At the com-
pany’s production sites, occupational safety is the responsibility of the site management and 
occupational safety officers are appointed at management level."
"The responsible local depart-
ments implement site-specific occupational safety requirements and report regularly to the site 
management."
"The company’s production and maintenance sites in Germany, Poland and Canada 
have local occupational safety committees, which include representatives of the workforce."
"Occupational safety is part of MTU’s integrated management system (IMS) and is regularly 
reviewed and driven forward."
"At the European production sites, workplace regulations that are 
mandatory for all employees contain important safety rules pertaining to accident prevention, 
fire protection and what to do in the event of workplace or commuting accidents."
"MTU strives to minimize health and safety risks to its employees and third parties, whilst also 
seeking to make continuous improvements, for example, through regular workplace assess-
ments and continuous prevention work."
"Workplaces are regularly assessed for any risks and 
hazards they present for employees so that appropriate measures can be implemented where 
necessary."
"To prevent accidents and achieve a lasting reduction in the number of accidents, the 
local occupational safety specialists record all accidents using uniform criteria (categories 1 to 
5 from near-misses to fatal accidents) and analyze them with the employees involved and their 
managers."
"Where the analysis reveals significant accident hotspots, the causes are investigated 
and appropriate steps taken to prevent a recurrence."
"In addition, near-misses are recorded and 
evaluated at all production sites."
"Group-wide safety instruction is mandatory for all employees 
at least once a year and trained first responders have been named."
"The responsible local depart-
ments also undertake prevention work through training sessions and information on occupa-
tional safety issues."
"Temporary staff are included in occupational safety on the same basis as 
permanent employees."
"The occupational safety management systems at MTU’s German locations are certified ex-
ternally as conforming to standard ISO 45001 Occupational health and safety management 
systems."
"MTU sets an annual tolerance threshold for workplace accidents at its production and 
maintenance locations."
"This comprises the sum of non-reportable category 3 accidents resulting 
in between one and three days absence and reportable category 4 accidents resulting in more 
than three days absence, excluding in each case commuting accidents."
"In 2023, the tolerance 
threshold ranged from 0 to 16 accidents – depending on the location."
"Three of the six produc-
tion locations were within the target."
"Accidents involving contractors’ 
employees are not included."
Accidents during mobile working are included if they are work-related.
"In the reporting period, the MTU Group recorded 50 accidents resulting in absence from work 
(category 3 and 4 accidents resulting in at least one day off)."
"The number of accidents was lower 
than in the previous year, when 63 accidents were recorded."
"This was mainly attributable to a 
sharp drop in accidents at the Munich location from 23 in 2022 to 11 in the reporting period."
"As 
a result, the Group-wide accident rate improved from 5.4 accidents per 1,000 employees in 2022 
to 4.0 in the reporting period (AG 2023: 1.8 / 2022: 3.9)."
"As in previous years, 
there were no fatal accidents at MTU."
"Interdepartmental network-
ing supports mutual learning and standardization within MTU."
"The local occupational safety 
officers derive proactive measures from regularly updated risk assessments, routine inspections 
of workplaces and audits of production and administration."
"The results of such analyses and 
workplace assessments are used as a basis for the safe and ergonomic design of new workplaces."
All accidents are reported and evaluated.
"The analyses show that MTU’s plant and machinery 
generally have a very high level of technical and organizational safety, so the cause of many ac-
cidents tends to be attributable to behavior rather than to the operation of plant and equipment."
"Therefore, measures once again focused on promoting safe working practices and enhancing 
the safety culture."
"Ergonomic workplace design is given high priority and is continuously 
checked through workplace inspections and audits."
These measures are site-specific.
"Employee development  
Innovative capability and competitiveness are key success factors in the aviation industry."
"MTU is convinced that continuous and intensive employee development is essential for this 
and therefore invests in vocational and further training of all employees and managers and, 
in particular, in the development of talented employees."
"In response to these times of change, 
the company is extending its leadership competencies through future-oriented concepts to 
enable it to effectively address current and new requirements."
"Moreover, in many of the areas in which MTU operates, training requirements are defined by 
the aviation authorities, for example, through mandatory training on human factors (human 
error)."
"In addition to industry-specific vocational training, for example, of aircraft mainte-
nance engineers, and dual courses of study aimed at building up knowledge over the long 
term, MTU encourages further training of its employees."
"This is a key principle of corporate 
social responsibility defined in the company’s Code of Conduct."
"Promoting further training 
and individual development perspectives for employees and managers are also enshrined in 
the MTU Principles and Group-wide HR strategy."
"In addition, since 2023, the variable com-
pensation of the Executive Board and senior executives has included a target relating to the 
area of further training."
"Through this ESG target (ESG = environmental, social, governance), 
MTU is strengthening staff training as a success factor for the future."
"The Head of People & Culture is responsible for training and development of employees 
Group-wide."
"The Executive Board discusses the training indicators once a year (training 
report), sets priorities, decides on specific training and development initiatives and arranges 
for them to be implemented."
"MTU’s commitment to staff training is reflected in a varied training and development offering 
and its extensive spending on staff training are matched by high demand from employees 
to enhance to their knowledge and skills."
"The basis is a Group-wide works agreement in 
Germany, which guarantees all staff access to training and requires managers to discuss de-
velopment options with their employees (training interview)."
"In addition, at the three sites in 
Germany (Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde), the works council is involved in further training 
of employees, in accordance with the German Codetermination Act."
"It has a say in the train-
ing program."
The sites in other countries also have further training regulations.
"At MTU Aero 
Engines North America, for example, all employees receive an annual Development Plan that 
fosters individual development and sets out specific measures."
"Training requirements are established annually in a standard process either in a training 
interview where employees discuss training with their manager or by MTU’s internal further 
training team on the basis of divisional/company-level interviews."
"Completed training and 
development courses are documented in a training history."
"Training officers are available to 
provide advice on needs-focused training."
"A multilingual online learning portal is an important basis for extending multimedia and 
self-directed learning."
"Increased use of digital and hybrid formats is expected to ensure up-
skilling of staff at all levels and to provide flexible support."
"The MTU Leadership Values (“We 
transform, We empower, We create trust”) create a common set of values and principles for 
managers."
The values provide guidance and define leadership expectations.
"In 2023, the 
company therefore reinforced its leadership value process."
"The HR and Organizational Development team provides local support to help managers 
implement personal change and changes in working situations."
"The team also facilitates 
Group-wide change processes such as the Turnaround project at the Hanover location and the 
Excellence made in Berlin-Brandenburg project at the Ludwigsfelde site."
"The Business Chal-
lenge, a cross-site training initiative for all managers, aims to strengthen an independent, 
entrepreneurial mindset and action."
"It was launched in 2023 with a focus on collaboration be-
tween the OEM and MRO segments."
"This training program integrates future-oriented learning 
technologies such as virtual reality."
"In addition, a competency model in the area of digitaliza-
tion is being developed for managers."
This will form the basis for future training activities.
"Furthermore, MTU offers development opportunities and programs at all levels to identify 
and support talented employees in the best possible way and to support the professional 
development of those already appointed to management positions."
"One central tool is a per-
sonal status snapshot, e.g., through participation in a Development Center."
"95% of managers 
appointed to leadership functions at the German locations in 2023 (between January and 
October) attended a Development Center (MTU AG: 100%)."
"MTU offers new and experienced managers opportunities to benefit from coaching, either in 
the context of a change of leadership role or function or through reflection and sparring (box-
stop coaching)."
Fostering talented women and equality in management are also important to the Group.
"Further information on diver-
sity and support for women is presented in the Corporate governance statement."
"Revised feedback landscape
Regular feedback from employees is an important indicator of successful teamwork and leader-
ship."
"In the reporting period, the established employee surveys (“pulse checks”) were integrat-
ed into a new feedback landscape with additional tools, providing scope for surveys that address 
specific target groups and topics."
"⁄
Pulse checks: Snapshots of satisfaction, commitment and strategy in the company
	
⁄
Leadership feedback: 180 degree feedback for managers at all levels, geared to individual 
managers and their leadership role in the context of the Leadership Values."
"Each manag-
er reflects on their individual feedback report with a coach and derives areas of action to 
strengthen their personal leadership quality and development."
"⁄
Team feedback: A snapshot of teamwork and to foster team dialogue on improvements (from 
2024)
	
⁄
Readiness index: Assessment of the present status of the corporate culture."
"The leadership value “We empower” is reflected in a high level of training 
Since 2023, the ESG target for the social aspect has been linked to the leadership value “We em-
power” and is therefore calculated on the basis of staff training."
"The average number of training 
days per employee at the German locations (Munich, Hanover, Ludwigsfelde) is now one of the 
factors determining the variable compensation of Executive Board members."
"The target was an 
average of 2.5 days per employee."
"In 2023, the average was 3.6 days per employee, which was 
above the target."
"In addition to enabling employees to spend time for training, MTU invests extensively in per-
sonnel development to encourage the principle of lifelong learning."
"At MTU AG, it spent 5.6 million on 
staff training (2022: €3.4 million) (costs for internal and external training, excluding vocational 
training)."
"The increase correlates with the target for average training days per employee and is 
due, for example, to the future-oriented Business Challenge training initiative for all managers."
"Sound vocational training at MTU
Qualified employees with a sound vocational training are also important to MTU."
"In 2023, it 
enabled 105 young people in Germany to embark on vocational training."
"For MTU Maintenance 
Serbia, it has established training based on the German dual training system in cooperation 
with the Aviation Academy Belgrade."
"Furthermore, in the reporting year it signed a cooperation 
agreement with the Serbian Office for Dual Education to drive forward dual training and busi-
ness-focused learning."
"In collaboration with the British Columbia Institute of Technology, MTU 
Maintenance Canada has opened a training academy that combines theoretical learning with 
practical experience of engine maintenance."
"This training program is designed for 36 partici-
pants, who will subsequently be able to deepen their specialist knowledge at MTU."
"Respecting the human rights of employees
MTU respects the internationally proclaimed human rights set out in the United Nations’ Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights."
"Human rights are integrated into the corporate culture with 
the aid of various tools to ensure they are respected and promoted."
"In particular, MTU strives to 
prevent employees being exposed to any violation of their human rights (zero-tolerance principle)."
"MTU is committed to respecting the individuality and dignity of every individual, maintaining 
equality of opportunity in the workplace and preventing discrimination wherever possible."
"The 
protection of human rights, the right to appropriate remuneration as well as recognition of regu-
lations governing employee and union representation under labor and works constitution law are 
implemented Group-wide through the Code of Conduct."
"As an employer, MTU aims to create fair 
working conditions based on legally binding employment contracts and appropriate remuneration."
This includes freedom of association and the right to adopt collective agreements.
"Compliance 
with the Code of Conduct and ethical principles is also enshrined in the MTU Principles."
"The MTU 
Principles stress that respecting human rights is an essential element in MTU’s social and societal 
responsibility."
"Furthermore, in a policy statement signed by the Executive Board at the beginning 
of 2023 MTU gives an undertaking that it will respect human rights."
"This policy statement sets 
principles for human rights and working conditions as well as responsibilities for complying with 
human rights."
"In Germany, MTU is bound by the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), which prohibits dis-
crimination against employees and job applicants."
"In addition, there are internal guidelines on fair 
and cooperative conduct, which are designed to prevent bullying, sexual harassment and discrim-
ination."
"These guidelines were adopted in consultation with the representatives of the workforce 
and include a systematic process for dealing with complaints."
"Revised risk management on human rights
MTU has enhanced its risk management geared to respecting human rights."
"In this context, a 
Human Rights Officer was appointed in the reporting period."
"The Human Rights Officer oversees 
internal risk management in the area of human rights risks and reports directly to the Chief 
Sustainability Officer on the Executive Board."
"Moreover, Human Rights Coordinators have been 
named at site level and in the relevant departments (Supply Chain, HR, Environmental Protection 
and Workplace Safety, Communications)."
"A risk analysis of all fully consolidated Group companies is performed once a year and as 
required."
This is coordinated centrally by the Human Rights Officer.
"The scope and severity of 
human rights-related risks are identified using a uniform procedure."
"This Human Rights Coor-
dinators at the sites are involved in this risk identification process."
"The risks are then evaluated 
using a risk matrix, which relates the probability of occurrence to the severity of each risk."
"A 
materiality threshold has been set for both the consolidated view at Group level and for each site."
"The Human Rights Officer also reviews the effectiveness of risk management, especially with a 
view to preventive and remedial activities."
"Reports can be made confidentially within the Group to 
the Compliance Officer or via the web-based reporting system iTrust."
"In addition, site-specific 
reporting structures have been set up."
"In line with the provisions of, for example, the General Act 
on Equal Treatment (AGG), every site in Germany has designated contacts who are appropriately 
trained and to whom employees can address any complaints of discrimination."
"At MTU Mainte-
nance in Canada, employees can make a formal complaint to the head of Human Resources in 
the event of discrimination."
"In addition, employees have the right to submit a formal complaint 
externally to the BC Human Rights Tribunal."
"At MTU Aero Engines Polska this function is carried 
out by an elected employee representative."
"In addition, employees can report complaints to man-
agers, the works council or the head of human resources."
"The Executive Board is informed about 
infringements depending on the severity of their impacts."
"If a breach of human rights obligations 
is identified, appropriate action is immediately taken to end it, prevent further breaches in the 
future, or minimize its scope."
"When they join the company, new employees are informed about the principles set out in the Code 
of Conduct and – in Germany – the General Act on Equal Treatment (AGG), and they undertake 
to comply with these requirements."
"In addition, MTU provides regular training on the Code of 
Conduct at all the company’s sites and all hierarchical levels."
"Furthermore, information on the 
prevention of discrimination is provided on the company’s intranet."
"In 2023, there were three substantiated complaints under applicable anti-discrimination laws at 
sites in the MTU Group."
"The complaints were investigated, appropriate action has been introduced 
to remedy the shortcomings, and the cases have been closed."
"Respect for human rights in the supply chain
MTU respects the internationally proclaimed human rights set out in the UN Declaration of 
Human Rights and extends this to its supply chain as well."
"The aim is to ensure the observance 
of human rights and fair working conditions."
"In a policy statement on the protection of human 
rights adopted in 2023, MTU expresses its commitment to respecting human rights due dili-
gence obligations in the supply chain."
A code of conduct for suppliers is in place to cover the upstream value chain.
"The Code of Conduct requires suppliers to respect and apply human rights, and 
to make sure that they are not complicit in human rights violations."
"In particular, it requires 
observance of labor standards relating to freedom of association, the right to collective bargain-
ing, the ban on forced and child labor, equal pay regardless of gender and the equal treatment 
of employees."
"A revised version of the Code of Conduct for MTU Suppliers came into effect in 
2023."
"This sets out human rights requirements with regard to fair pay, occupational health and 
safety, and environment-related aspects such as handling hazardous substances and waste, and 
environmental protection and climate protection expectations."
"MTU also expects its suppliers 
to obtain a corresponding undertaking from subcontractors and reserves the right to terminate 
any contract with a supplier without notice if the supplier fails to adopt remedies in the event 
of breaches of such requirements."
"In addition, these principles of behavior are contained in the 
general business conditions and the contractual documents for suppliers."
"An annual risk analysis of direct suppliers to fully consolidated Group companies is performed 
using a standardized tool, taking into account the probability of occurrence and the extent of 
any damage."
"This is based on defined ESG-related criteria such as product groups and the coun-
tries where they are sourced."
"This risk analysis is integrated into the established risk process 
for suppliers."
"To supplement this, key suppliers are screened for compliance with sustainability 
criteria, using a scorecard in an ESG assessment tool (ESG = environmental, social, gover-
nance)."
Risk management includes preventive measures and any necessary remedial action.
"In 
addition, at MTU Maintenance, a structured supplier evaluation is performed twice a year for 
suppliers to the German sites."
"Various measures are used to achieve the goal of ensuring that human rights are respected in 
the supply chain."
"These apply, above all, to the procurement of tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, 
which are used in some MTU components."
"Procurement of these minerals can be problematic 
because some of them come from Central African mines where the profits may be used specif-
ically to fund armed conflicts that violate human rights."
"MTU strives to ensure a sustainable 
and transparent value chain without these “conflict minerals.” The company does not procure 
minerals directly but they enter production and pre-production via the global, multi-step supply 
chain."
"The general conditions of business and the templates for contracts with MTU suppliers 
require information on the origin of minerals."
"This information is compiled using the EICC/
GeSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template."
"Based on its survey in 2023, MTU has no indication that components 
from its suppliers contain conflict minerals."
"Moreover, in the reporting period there were no indications that suppliers had violated the 
human rights provisions of the Code of Conduct for MTU Suppliers."
"Furthermore, MTU did not 
have to terminate its relationship with any suppliers as a result of breaches of human rights."
"Due diligence processes were introduced in the reporting period to implement the requirements 
for the management of human rights in the supply chain arising from the German Act on Cor-
porate Due Diligence Obligations in the Supply Chain (LkSG)."
"Human Rights Coordinators have 
been named for supply chains in the OEM and MRO segments."
"They are responsible for the risk 
analysis and report to the Group Human Rights Officer."
"Responsible international trade
Trade compliance plays a vital role for MTU."
"One important goal here is to avoid violations of 
human rights."
"The provisions of international trade legislation apply to all business units and 
Group companies, including their employees."
"Customs and export control laws govern which 
products, services and technical data MTU is permitted to sell or pass on to whom, for what 
purpose and where."
"Compliance with customs legislation and international trade regulations is 
explicitly stipulated in MTU’s Code of Conduct."
"Export control law prohibits doing business with specific countries or individuals, and the 
supply of sensitive goods, transfer of advanced technologies, and provision of military services 
without explicit authorization by the respective official bodies."
"Under customs regulations, MTU is required to provide a precise description, 
detailed itemization and accurate declaration of the value of all goods intended for import or 
export."
"What is more, anti-boycott laws may prohibit individuals and entities from participating 
in other countries’ economic boycotts and restrict the dissemination of information relating to 
business activities or individuals."
"To ensure compliance with international trade regulations, 
harmonized process standards have been introduced Group-wide."
"These verify conformity with 
export control regulations and required authorizations prior to the dispatch of documents and 
components."
"The head of the international trade department reports disciplinarily to the head 
of purchasing and has a direct duty to report to the CEO, who is the company’s chief export 
compliance officer."
"In the reporting period, MTU continued compulsory training of all employees affected by export 
control regulations on the basis of a defined training concept."
"The Internal Compliance Program 
(ICP) was revised to bring it into line with the legal framework applicable for the reporting 
period."
"Disclosures on the EU taxonomy
Background 
A key objective of the EU Action Plan for Financing Sustainable Growth is to reorient capi-
tal flows towards sustainable investment."
"This Regulation con-
tains a uniform and legally binding classification system defining which economic activities are 
deemed to be “environmentally sustainable” in the EU."
"The results of this classification have to 
be reported annually on a company-specific basis."
"To supplement the requirements on sustainable economic activities within the meaning of the 
Taxonomy Regulation, the EU Commission has issued delegated acts."
"Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of June 4, 2021 on the technical screening criteria (Del."
"By contrast Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of July 6, 2021 specifying the content and 
presentation of information to be disclosed (Del."
"C&P) addresses the content and presen-
tation of the information to disclosed with respect to environmentally sustainable economic 
activities and the methodology to comply with the disclosure obligation."
"Following 
examination of all activities for the six environmental objectives, all taxonomy-eligible and tax-
onomy-aligned MTU activities related to the climate change mitigation objective."
"Consequently, 
reporting still focuses solely on this environmental objective."
"Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of June 27, 2023 consists of amendments to Delegated 
Regulation (EU) 2021/2139."
"It introduces the aviation-related eco-
nomic activities 3.21 “Manufacturing of aircraft” and 6.18 “Leasing of aircraft.” MTU provides 
disclosures on these economic activities for the first time in the reporting period."
"As a result, 
economic activity “3.6 Manufacture of other low carbon technologies,” which was reported in 
the previous year, is no longer applicable."
"Therefore, no further disclosures are made on this 
economic activity."
"With regard to the classification of an economic activity as “environmentally sustainable” with-
in the meaning of the EU taxonomy, a distinction has to be drawn between those activities that 
are taxonomy-eligible and those that are taxonomy-aligned."
"Only those economic activities that 
are described in the delegated acts on technical screening criteria are deemed to be taxono-
my-eligible."
"The taxonomy-aligned economic activities met these criteria in the re-
porting period."
"In addition, attention is paid to the rules on avoiding principal adverse impacts 
pursuant to Article 18 (2) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"If all of these criteria are met, the 
economic activity can be classified as taxonomy-aligned."
"To assess whether the criteria are 
met, each economic activity is compared with criteria of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 
and the related technical screening criteria to check whether it meets the requirements."
"For 
economic activity “7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings,” for example, checks were per-
formed on the availability of energy performance certificates and compliance with the criteria 
for energy-efficient operation of buildings."
"In accordance with Section 315e (1) HGB, the con-
solidated financial statements of MTU as of December 31, 2023, have been drawn up using the 
IFRSs."
"If capital expenditures and 
operating expenditures cannot be allocated to a single engine, allocation keys are applied."
"The 
data basis for the allocation keys is the proportion of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned 
turnover."
All consolidated companies in the MTU Group are included in the calculation.
"The disclosure of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned turnover / capital expenditures 
(CapEx) / operating expenditures (OpEx) as a proportion of the respective total amounts for the 
MTU Group for the fiscal year 2023 is based on a full analysis of the Group’s business activities."
"The basis for calculat-
ing the turnover KPI is the net revenue generated by goods and services, including intangibles, 
in accordance with IAS 1.82(a)."
"The denominator used to calculate this KPI is the total revenue of €5,363 million in 2023, as 
reported in the MTU Group’s income statement for the fiscal year."
"This is examined across 
all Group subsidiaries to identify whether it was generated by taxonomy-eligible or taxono-
my-aligned economic activities as defined in the annexes to Delegated Regulation 2021/2139 
and Delegated Regulation 2023/2486 to the Taxonomy Regulation."
"Based on the current status of the regulations, for the economic objective “climate change 
mitigation,” the economic activity “3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft” was identified as a material 
revenue-generating economic activity of the MTU Group within the meaning of the delegated 
act."
"As a consequence, the turnover generated by MTU from the manufacture, repair, main-
tenance, retrofitting, design, conversion and upgrading of aircraft, aircraft components and 
aircraft equipment is classified as taxonomy-eligible."
"Since this is MTU’s core business, taxonomy-eligible turnover increased from €515 million in 
the previous year to €4,954 million."
"This is due to the switch from economic activity “3.6 Manu-
facture of other low carbon technologies” to economic activity “3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft,” 
which was added to the EU taxonomy in the reporting period and is a far better reflection of 
MTU’s business."
"For more detailed information on the turnover KPIs, please see the corresponding table at the 
end of this section."
"CapEx KPI
In accordance with subsection 1.1.2.2."
"Capital expenditures 
also include additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets resulting from 
business combinations (application of IFRSs [IAS 16, 38, 40, 41, IFRS 16] and national account-
ing methods)."
Acquired goodwill is not taken into account.
"Total capital expenditures as defined 
in the EU Taxonomy Regulation amounted to €511 million in 2023."
"Taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment as defined in the Taxonomy Regulation are deter-
mined by analyzing the project descriptions of the additions of assets."
The sum of the additions that constitute taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures is €425 million.
"The largest contribution comes from capital expenditures in connection with economic activ-
ities “3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft” and “7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings.” The tax-
onomy-eligible capital expenditures amount to 83% of total capital expenditures (previous year: 
33%)."
"The capital 
expenditure plans comprise capital expenditures as well as operating expenditures that cannot 
be capitalized, which aim to expand taxonomy-aligned economic activities, in this case, to the 
initial performance of a taxonomy-aligned activity."
"MTU’s current understanding of the EU Tax-
onomy is that capital expenditure plans can be disclosed if the research and development plans 
are comprised almost entirely of operating expenditures (OpEx), which are disclosed under the 
OpEx KPI."
"By investing in research and development for engine technologies with a low climate 
impact, MTU is contributing to the climate change adaptation objective."
"Different methods are 
used for product-related development of established engine technologies and research work for 
new engine technologies."
"Development expenses are determined on the basis of the economic 
activity to which they relate (“3.21 Manufacturing of aircraft”) based on allocation to engine 
types."
"Research expenses are allocated to the economic activity “9.1 Close to market research, 
development and innovation” and serve to extend taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned 
economic activities."
"Overall, the plans relate to various research projects that MTU expects to 
become taxonomy-aligned under the activity “9.1 Close to market research, development and 
innovation” in the next six to ten years."
"The planning horizon for the relevant research projects 
corresponds to the customary development cycle for aviation technology."
"MTU is planning 
taxonomy-aligned expenditures for research and development of €857 million in the aforemen-
tioned period."
"The following table presents the taxonomy-eligible CapEx contained in the numerator by asset 
group."
"[T43] Quantitative breakdown of the CapEx numerator at economic activity level
Activity 
in Mio."
"The denominator is derived from the sum of the costs listed above by means of a detailed analy-
sis of accounts and cost centers."
"The total operating expenditures pursuant to Taxonomy Regula-
tion Article 8 | Annex I Point 1.1.3.1 of Annex I to Del."
The numerator of the OpEx KPI as defined in the point 1.1.3.2.
"A large proportion of the taxonomy-eligible operating expenditures of €239 million comprises 
non-capitalized research and development expenses."
"Consequently, the analysis of the taxono-
my eligibility of research and development expenses is of material significance for the calcula-
tion of the OpEx KPIs."
"Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures are determined on the basis of the capital expendi-
ture plans."
"The parameters are the same as those outlined in the section above on the CapEx 
KPI."
"In 2023, the research and development expenses allocated to activity “9.1 Close to market 
research, development and innovation” were €71 million."
"That was 25% of operating expendi-
tures."
Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditures increased from 52% in the previous year to 83%.
"For more detailed information on the OpEx KPIs, please see the corresponding table at the end 
of this section."
"In the calculation of the above KPIs, double-counting of economic activities was avoided by 
applying various controls, including the documentation of data generation and ensuring that 
the data are reconcilable with other financial information."

Responsible corporate management
Responsible corporate management is very important to MTU Aero Engines AG."
"The company 
therefore complies with all the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 
(GCGC)."
"The term “corporate governance” stands for the management and oversight of a compa-
ny in accordance with the principles of responsibility and long-term value creation."
"MTU sees 
good corporate governance as a natural responsibility that embraces every area of the company."
"That comprises mutual trust and efficient collaboration between the Executive Board and the 
Supervisory Board, respect for the shareholders’ interests and open and transparent commu-
nication with all stakeholders."
"As a company with global operations, MTU acts in compliance 
with the relevant national and international standards."
"In Germany, where the company has its 
headquarters, these standards are laid down principally in the Stock Corporation Act (AktG), 
the Codetermination Act (MitbestG) and the GCGC."
"The Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code concluded a new 
version of the GCGC on April 28, 2022, and submitted it to the Federal Ministry of Justice and 
Consumer Protection for review and publication."
"The GCGC was published in the Federal Ga-
zette on June 27, 2022 and therefore came into effect."
"The Executive Board and Supervisory Board closely examined the GCCG during the past fiscal 
year."
This report has been compiled in compliance with the applicable version of the GCGC.
"A full description of management practices that extend beyond statutory requirements is also 
provided in this section of the Annual Report."
"Corporate management  
Accepting responsibility – not only for its products and processes, employees, customers and 
partners, but in equal measure for the environment and society as a whole – forms an integral 
part of MTU’s corporate culture."
"Alongside long-term business targets, its corporate strategy 
therefore gives appropriate consideration to ecological and social objectives."
"MTU is committed 
to sustainable development; its contribution goes beyond the statutory requirements."
"The prin-
cipal focus areas of MTU’s social commitment are environmental protection, human resources 
policy, and community outreach projects in the neighborhoods of its sites."
"These commitments 
are publicly documented on the MTU website at www.mtu.de under About us > Corporate 
responsibility."
"The company has a Code of Conduct, which has to be observed by all employees."
"The Code of 
Conduct can be downloaded from the company’s website at www.mtu.de under About us > 
Compliance > Our compliance culture."
"The declaration of conformity is published in MTU’s website at Investor Relations > Corporate 
governance > Compliance statement."
"The company communicates with these groups via many channels, including the  
intranet and internet, social media, brochures, employee and customer magazines as well  
as at events."
The aim is to generate broad public acceptance.
MTU insists on the finest quality for its products and services.
"Compliance with quality  
standards is verified by the relevant authorities and through internal and external audits."
The quality standards are published on the MTU website under Engines > Quality.
"Trust-based cooperation among governing bodies
MTU is a stock corporation organized under German law."
"Its governing bodies are the Executive 
Board, the Supervisory Board and the Annual General Meeting."
"The close cooperation between 
the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is based on trust and on intensive, ongoing 
sharing of information."
"The Annual General Meeting, in particular, offers shareholders the 
opportunity to put questions to MTU executives and to exercise their voting rights."
"Working procedures of the Executive Board
The goal of the Executive Board in managing MTU is to create, on its own responsibility and 
in the company’s interest, sustainable added value, taking into account the interests of its 
shareholders, employees and other stakeholders."
"The Executive Board works as a team, with its 
members bearing joint responsibility."
"The members of the Executive Board regularly discuss 
important actions and events within their respective remits."
"Their differing qualifications and 
professional experience are complementary."
"The company’s Executive Board consisted of four 
members in 2023."
"The Supervisory Board is briefed by the Executive Board in a regular, timely and comprehensive 
manner on the situation of the company, especially in thematically specific meetings of the Su-
pervisory Board and Audit Committee at intervals throughout the fiscal year."
"The meetings ad-
dress the company’s strategy, the status of planning, the achievement of targets, the company’s 
risk situation and its risk management activities."
"The Executive Board coordinates decisions 
of a strategic nature with the Supervisory Board, ensures that such decisions are implemented 
and discusses the progress made."
"To ensure the flow of information on the company’s results 
of operations, financial position and net assets, the Executive Board has set up a process in 
which the Supervisory Board receives written reports on a monthly basis."
"Any deviations from 
the planned operational performance are explained in detail to the Supervisory Board."
"Further-
more, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is briefed regularly and in person on the compa-
ny’s current situation, significant business transactions and important pending decisions."
"The Executive Board also receives regular reports on compliance, i.e., on the measures taken to 
comply with laws and regulations as well as with company guidelines."
"Material decisions by the Executive Board, especially those concerning the budget, require the 
approval of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board provides information on its work in 
the Report of the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report."
"The Executive Board’s rules of  
procedure, along with the list of transactions by MTU Aero Engines AG requiring Supervisory 
Board approval, can be viewed on the company’s website at www.mtu.de under Investor Relations > 
Corporate governance > Articles of association."
"In line with the recommendation of the GCGC, the Supervisory Board has set an age limit  
for the members of the Executive Board."
"Appointment or extension of the appointment to the 
Executive Board is only possible up until the age of 65."
"The currently valid compensation system for the Executive Board was adopted in October 2020 
in accordance with the German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights’ Directive 
(ARUG II) and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"It was ap-
proved by a large majority at the Annual General Meeting in 2021."
"In response to the declining 
acceptance by MTU shareholders in the following years and its own considerations regarding 
a reform, in 2023 the Supervisory Board developed a new compensation system with the aid of 
an independent, external compensation consultant."
"In December 2023, the Supervisory Board 
resolved to submit this to the Annual General Meeting 2024 for approval."
"The remuneration  
of the Executive Board for the 2023 fiscal year can be found in the section headed Management 
compensation report and on MTU’s website at Investor Relations > Corporate governance >  
Management compensation report 2023."
"Working procedures of the Supervisory Board
In line with statutory requirements, the Supervisory Board comprises six shareholder repre-
sentatives and six employee representatives."
"The Supervisory Board appoints the Executive 
Board and monitors and advises it in the management of the company’s business."
"In 2010 the 
Supervisory Board resolved as a matter of principle to appoint new members to the Executive 
Board for a term of three years."
"Key corporate decisions require the approval of the Supervi-
sory Board."
"The company regularly provides support in the training of Supervisory Board 
members and is prepared to assume the related costs."
"In 2023, the Supervisory Board members 
undertook their training independently."
"All members of the Supervisory Board make sure that they have sufficient time to perform their 
tasks."
"The statutory limits on the number of mandates and the upper limit of two supervisory 
board mandates for members of the executive board of a publicly listed company and five super-
visory board mandates for other members recommended by the GCGC are taken into account."
"In compliance with the GCGC, in 2023 only one former member of the Executive Board of MTU 
Aero Engines AG, namely Dr. Rainer Martens, had a seat on the Supervisory Board; the GCGC 
recommends no more than two."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for regularly assessing 
the independence of its own members, especially the shareholder representatives."
"As a matter 
of principle, it considers the employee representatives to be independent."
"It considers that 
the Supervisory Board is independent if the majority of its members and the majority of the 
shareholder representatives are considered to be independent."
"In its present composition, this 
applies to all members of the Supervisory Board."
"It also applies to the shareholder representa-
tives Dr. Jürgen M."
"Geißinger (member of the Supervisory Board until May 11, 2023) and Dr. 
Joachim Rauhut, who had/have been members of the Supervisory Board of MTU for more than 
12 years."
"The period for which members have served on the Supervisory Board is published in 
their resumes on the company’s website."
"Until the end of 2023, the Supervisory Board set four terms of 
office as the maximum for membership of the Supervisory Board and considered this to be ap-
propriate for MTU."
"There are no other indications that the members of the Supervisory Board of 
MTU lack independence."
"In this way, independent advice and oversight of the Executive Board 
is ensured by both the full Supervisory Board and its committees."
The Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure provide for the establishment of committees.
"The 
Supervisory Board of MTU has four committees: an Audit Committee, a Personnel Committee, a 
Mediation Committee and a Nomination Committee."
"The members of the Audit Committee are 
Dr. Joachim Rauhut (Chairman), Dr. Christine Bortenlänger, Heike Madan (until May 11, 2023), 
Josef Mailer and Claudia Sowa-Frank (since May 11, 2023)."
"The members of the Personnel 
Committee and the Mediation Committee are Gordon Riske (Chairman), Dr. Jürgen M."
"Geißinger 
(until May 11, 2023) and Dr. Joachim Rauhut (since May 11, 2023), plus the employee represen-
tatives Josef Mailer and Daniele Frijia."
"The members of the Nomination Committee are Gordon 
Riske (Chairman), Dr. Jürgen M."
"Geißinger (until May 11, 2023) and Dr. Joachim Rauhut (since 
May 11, 2023)."
"Both committee members have in-depth knowledge and experience of internal control 
processes, in other words, risk and compliance management, the internal control system and 
internal auditing."
Further details can be found in the section headed The Supervisory Board.
"In addition,  
the resumes of the Supervisory Board are published on the company’s website at www.mtu.de 
under About us > Supervisory Board."
"In consultation with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board ensures long-term succession 
planning for appointments to the Executive Board."
"To this end, the Supervisory Board regularly 
reviews the present term of all Executive Board contracts, taking into account the age of each 
member, the competency profile of potential candidates and the defined diversity objective for 
the Executive Board."
"The Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure contain binding provisions for dealing with 
conflicts of interest."
"Such conflicts must be disclosed and, where appropriate, may result in 
termination of the member’s term of office."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board must explicitly 
state such potential conflicts of interest when submitting the nominations to the Annual Gen-
eral Meeting."
There were no conflicts of interest in the reporting period.
"If there are any discus-
sions or resolutions affecting this supplier in future – this was not the case during the reporting 
period – the Supervisory Board member concerned will not take part in them."
"Importance is attached to 
diversity."
"The competence profile forms the basis for all nominations submitted to the Annual 
General Meeting."
It is published on MTU’s website.
"Nominations submitted by the Supervisory 
Board to the Annual General Meeting take account of all objectives and also strive to comply 
with the competence profile for the Supervisory Board as a whole."
"These are available on the 
company’s website at About us > Supervisory Board."
"Marc Haltrich
Anita Heimerl 
Dr. Rainer Martens

A."
"The compensation of the members of  
the Executive Board and Supervisory Board is based on clear and transparent criteria."
"These are 
described in the section headed Management compensation report, and on MTU’s website at 
Investor Relations > Corporate governance > Management compensation report 2023."
"The Supervisory Board regularly assesses how effectively the Supervisory Board as a whole and 
its committees perform their tasks."
"At the turn of 2022 / 2023, the Supervisory Board conduct-
ed a self-assessment of the work in plenary session, with the aid of an external consultant."
"This 
comprised a questionnaire and individual talks with each Supervisory Board member and with 
the Executive Board."
"Special attention was paid to the areas of strategy, structures & processes, 
corporate culture, composition of the Supervisory Board, leadership and ESG."
"Benchmarking 
against a selected peer group of companies was also used."
"The results were discussed with the 
Supervisory Board at a separate workshop."
"They form the basis for the ongoing development of 
the work of the Supervisory Board and for its competence profile."
"In fall 2023, the Supervisory 
Board conducted a further evaluation of feedback derived from a questionnaire developed by 
an external law firm."
"This examined the provision of information for the Supervisory Board, 
the discussion culture, the composition of the committees and the preparation of meetings."
"The 
Supervisory Board considered its work to be efficient and only adopted a few specific measures 
to improve the organization of its work."
"The Audit Committee also conducted a self-assessment by evaluating feedback from a question-
naire developed by an external law firm."
"The focal areas of this self-assessment were the tasks 
and organization of the committee, the skills of its members, oversight of the audit, internal 
auditing and the risk management system, and financial reporting."
"The members of the Audit 
Committee considered the work of the committee to be conducted efficiently and adopted some 
specific measures to enhance the organization of its work."
"Diversity
The diversity of its employees plays a key role in MTU’s success."
"Therefore, diversity is very 
important to MTU."
"In the context of the German law on equal participation of women and men in leadership 
positions, MTU has set itself goals."
"In accordance with Section 111 (5) of the German Stock 
Corporation Act (AktG), the supervisory boards of publicly listed companies and companies 
that are subject to the German Codetermination Act (MtibestG) are required to set target quotes 
for women on their supervisory and executive boards."
"In addition, under Section 76 (4) of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) the Executive Board is required to set a target quota for 
women at the two management levels directly below the Executive Board."
Diversity also plays an important role in the composition of the Supervisory Board.
"In compli-
ance with both the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the GCGC, the supervisory boards 
of listed companies subject to the German Codetermination Act (MitbestG) must comprise at 
least 30% women and at least 30% men."
"The Supervisory Board has five female members: Dr. 
Christine Bortenlänger, Anita Heimerl, Claudia Sowa-Frank, Univ.-Prof. Dr. Marion A."
"Weissen-
berger-Eibl and Ute Wolf."
"Two are employee representatives and three are shareholder repre-
sentatives."
"The percentage of women on the Supervisory Board therefore increased to 41.7% in 
2023."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board has set the following goal: International focus is very im-
portant for MTU as a global corporation."
"At least one member of the Supervisory Board should 
therefore meet the criterion of “internationality.” It is already the case that various members of 
MTU’s present Supervisory Board trained or have spent a large part of their professional lives 
abroad."
"The members of the Supervisory Board should continue to contribute an international 
perspective."
"The Supervisory Board takes the above-mentioned goals into account when submitting propos-
als for election by the Annual General Meeting."
"The same applies to the Nomination Committee, 
which is responsible for preparing the vote of the Supervisory Board."
"Since the main criterion 
for any proposal is still the company’s interest, the Supervisory Board proposes the most suit-
able candidates."
The Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure set an age limit for members.
"Their terms on the 
Supervisory Board automatically end at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the 
member’s 75th birthday."
"Moreover, a general limit of twelve years has been set for membership 
of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board also places value on fostering diversity in appointments to the Executive 
Board."
"The members of the Executive Board have diverse qualifications and work experience, 
which contribute to their work."
"In accordance with the provisions of the German Stock Corpora-
tion Act (AktG) and the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), in 2017 the Supervisory 
Board set a target quota of 25% for female members of the Executive Board, to be achieved by 
June 30, 2022."
"The Supervisory Board has appointed Dr. Silke 
Maurer to the company‘s Executive Board for a three-year term of office."
"For the management levels below the Executive Board, the Executive Board has set a target 
quota of 15% (three women) for the first management tier and 20% (18 women) for the second 
tier, to be achieved by June 30, 2027."
"As of December 31, 2023 (based on modified reference 
base), the proportion of women in the first management tier was 10.5% (two women) and the 
proportion in the second tier was 19.8% (18 women)."
"In view of the pleasing development of the 
proportion of women in the second management tier, the Executive Board will set a new target 
in 2024, earlier than had been planned."
"MTU was therefore able to realize some of the potential 
effectively, but not in equal measure in all units."
"In recent years, various initiatives have been 
introduced to increase the proportion of women in management positions (mentoring, establish-
ment of the Network of Engine Women, etc.); these should have a greater impact in the medium 
term."
MTU is continuing to pursue its goal of increasing the number of women on all levels.
"Every 
area of the company is called upon to work actively toward achieving this corporate objective."
"The measures focus on recruiting more female potentials and providing more intensive support 
for female employees during their careers."
"To this end, MTU invests extensively in the develop-
ment of its female employees and is involved in mentoring programs and a variety of initiatives."
"In addition, MTU has an active network for women, with Lars Wagner, CEO, as its advocate, 
and extensive measures to improve work-life balance, including flexible working hours, support 
services for families, and scope for teleworking."
"A full description of diversity management at 
MTU Aero Engines AG can be found in the current Sustainability report."
"Accounting
MTU prepares its consolidated financial statements and interim reports in accordance with the 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)."
"The Executive Board is responsible for 
this."
"Financial reporting comprises, in particular, the consolidated financial statements and the 
Group management report (including the non-financial statement)."
"In addition, the financial 
reporting and the audit include sustainability reporting, together with the audit thereof."
"The 
annual financial statements of MTU Aero Engines AG are compiled in accordance with the 
provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"An internal control system, coupled with 
the application of uniform accounting policies, should ensure that the results of operations, 
financial position, net assets and cash flows of all Group companies are accurately presented."
"In addition, MTU has a differentiated system in place to identify and monitor business and 
financial risks."
"Risk management and control system
The aim of the Executive Board is to ensure that the company has an appropriate and effective 
risk management and control system."
"Based on this, the Executive Board 
has not found any indication indication that either the overall entire risk management system 
or the overall internal control system might not be appropriate or effective."
"MTU takes findings 
and suggestions for optimization resulting from audits by the Internal Group Audit function and 
external audits as an opportunity to make continuous improvements to the risk management 
system and internal control system."
"The systems are described in the section headed Internal 
control and risk management system."
"The Executive Board reports to the Supervisory Board in a regular and timely manner on exist-
ing opportunities and risks, and how they are developing."
"The Audit Committee of the Super-
visory Board discusses risk management."
"The observance 
of legal and ethical rules and principles plays a central role in this respect."
"These and other 
aspects of compliance, such as the responsible handling of insider information, are documented 
in a Code of Conduct, which was revised, agreed and introduced jointly by the Executive Board 
and the Group Works Council in 2020."
"This Code of Conduct embodies MTU’s corporate culture 
and reflects its resolve to comply strictly with the relevant laws and internal regulations."
"It is a 
Group-wide guide to ethical business relations."
"Nevertheless, the risk can never be entirely ruled out that unauthorized behavior of isolated in-
dividuals might lead to contravention of the law."
"MTU does everything in its power to minimize 
this risk as far as possible, and is committed to preventing acts of misconduct, such as corrup-
tion, in the first place through corresponding rules and regular and targeted training, and to 
uncovering and pursuing any such acts."
Compliance is an important aspect of all management functions at MTU.
"For example, all 
managers must check that every member of their staff is familiar with the Code of Conduct and 
abides by its rules."
Reinforcement is provided by internal training.
"The central contact for all compliance-related matters in the company is the Compliance Officer, 
who is a member of the corporate management and reports directly to the Executive Board."
"The 
duties of the Compliance Officer focus, first and foremost, on preventing corruption and failure 
to comply with cartel and insider regulations."
"The Compliance Officer advises the Executive 
Board, managers and the managing directors of the individual sites."
"He draws up training 
concepts and guidelines and makes recommendations on compliance checks."
"In addition, the 
Compliance Officer leads investigations into cases of suspected non-compliance and coordinates 
the measures taken."
"Furthermore, he acts as ombudsman."
"Both employees and third parties 
such as customers and suppliers can report suspected non-compliance issues to the Compliance 
Officer confidentially."
"As well as contacting him personally, they have access to iTrust, a web-
based whistleblower system that also allows anonymous reports."
"Reports on the Compliance Officer’s activities are presented to the Supervisory Board’s Audit 
Committee."
"The Audit Committee then informs the plenary meetings of the Supervisory Board 
via a summary of its own meetings."
"It supervises the Executive Board’s compliance activities, 
including monitoring the measures and training programs implemented by the Compliance 
Officer and proposing revisions to the compliance rules."
"MTU strives to ensure that all stakeholders are kept informed in equal 
measure."
"Within reason, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is also prepared to meet with 
investors to talk about topics specific to the Supervisory Board."
"He did this at a number of meet-
ings in late 2023 and early 2024."
"The company publishes an extensive range of information on 
its website at www.mtu.de."
It publishes quarterly information on its business activities.
"Any new 
developments likely to have a significant impact on the MTU share price are disclosed in the 
form of ad-hoc releases in accordance with statutory requirements."
"Information is also posted on the MTU website whenever members of the Executive Board or 
Supervisory Board or related persons have purchased or sold MTU shares, debt instruments or 
share-based derivatives."
"Section 19 of the European Market Abuse Regulation stipulates that 
these persons must disclose such transactions if their value in a single calendar year reaches 
or exceeds €20,000."
"The total number of shares in MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, held by 
members of the company’s Executive Board and Supervisory Board as of December 31, 2023, 
was less than 1% of the company’s capital stock."
"MTU decided 
to hold its Annual General Meeting in 2023 virtually again."
"At the vir-
tual Annual General Meeting in 2023, shareholders were able to request information pursuant 
to Section 118a (1) sentence 2 no."
"4 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) via electronic 
communication channels during the meeting."
"The company supports the exercise of shareholder rights and proxy voting by its sharehold-
ers in part by providing voting representatives who exercise voting rights in accordance with 
instructions received from individual shareholders."
"Shareholders also have the option of 
absentee voting."
"Shareholders can use electronic means to authorize proxies and provide voting 
instructions to the company’s voting representatives up to the beginning of the Annual General 
Meeting."
"Legislation on the introduction of virtual annual general meetings at joint stock companies 
came into force on July 27, 2022."
"Joint stock companies can now choose whether a virtual 
format is preferable to an in-person meeting or whether a hybrid format is an alternative."
"MTU 
has decided that it will hold its Annual General Meeting in 2024 as a virtual Annual General 
Meeting again."
"Besides cost and efficiency benefits of a virtual meeting, key considerations for the Executive 
Board were that it facilities simple access for all MTU shareholders, not just its national share-
holders, and sustainability aspects."
"Furthermore, the agenda for the Annual General Meeting 2024 does not contain any items that 
would require a physical presence at the meeting."
"MTU is convinced that holding the Annual 
General Meeting in virtual format safeguards shareholders’ rights of participation and scope for 
good interaction between the company and its shareholders in full and without any compromis-
es compared to an in-person Annual General Meeting."

Annual Report 2023 
I."
"MTU divides its activities into two operating segments: the 
commercial and military engine business (OEM) and the commercial maintenance business (MRO)."
"MTU’s commercial and military engine business (OEM segment) covers the development and 
manufacturing of modules, components and spare parts for engine programs, and in some cases 
final assembly."
"The military engine business additionally includes the provision of maintenance 
services."
"The MRO segment consists of the commercial maintenance business (MRO), which 
covers all activities relating to the maintenance, repair and overhaul of commercial engines as 
well as associated services."
"The parent company, MTU Aero Engines AG, which has its registered office at Dachauer Strasse 
665, 80995 Munich, Germany, is registered under reference HRB 157 206 in the commercial 
registry of the district court of Munich."
"The consolidated financial statements were approved for publication by the Executive Board of 
MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, on March 18, 2024."
"MTU’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the Internation-
al Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as applicable in the European Union (EU) and the 
supplementary requirements of Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"MTU 
applied all IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that were in 
effect at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared and had been endorsed 
by the European Commission for use in the EU."
Amounts are presented in euros.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
"This 
management assessment is based on the multi-year business planning, taking into account the 
proven past achievement of the plans and the complementary system for the early identifica-
tion of risks."
"Furthermore, the management assessment is supported by the company’s future 
earnings capability, an order backlog covering several years and sound financing combined 
with high levels of liquidity."
The fiscal year is identical to the calendar year.
"Comparative figures for the previous year are 
included in the consolidated financial statements."
"In the presentation of the balance sheet, a distinction is made between non-current and current 
assets and liabilities."
"A more detailed maturity analysis of certain items is provided in the notes 
to the consolidated financial statements."
"The income statement is prepared using the cost-of-sales method in which revenue is balanced 
against the expenses incurred to generate it, and expenses are classified by function: produc-
tion, research and development, distribution, and general administration."
"The consolidated 
financial statements are denominated in euros."
"All amounts are stated in millions of euros 
(€ million), unless otherwise specified."
"Due to rounding, some of the rounded figures presented 
in these consolidated financial statements may not correspond exactly to the sum of the individ-
ual figures, and it may not be possible to calculate some of the individual percentages from the 
rounded absolute figures presented."
"“0” represents amounts of between zero and half a million 
euros, while “-0” represents amounts between zero and minus half a million euros."
"Amounts of 
exactly €0.00 are shown by an empty field in tables."
"2)	 Effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025."
3)	 Still awaiting EU endorsement.
"MTU does not apply standards, interpretations and amendments before the effective date,  
taking into account endorsement by the EU."
"In view of the MTU Group’s current business model, the aforementioned standards are not 
expected to have a material impact on MTU’s financial reporting in future reporting periods."

On April 13, 2023, MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, acquired 100% of the shares in eMoSys 
GmbH, Starnberg, Germany, for €6 million."
"Stakes in such companies, where MTU 
is directly or indirectly able to significantly influence decisions on financial and business policy, 
are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method."
"MTU holds an 18% 
share in the voting rights of each IAE International Aero Engines LLC, East Hartford, CT, USA, and 
of PW1100G-JM Engine Leasing LLC, East Hartford, CT, USA."
"The contractual business relation-
ships, management agreements and representation on governance bodies give MTU significant 
influence, thus justifying their classification as associates from MTU’s perspective."
"Joint ventures
Joint ventures are companies over which MTU exercises joint control together with one or more 
other entities in accordance with IFRS 11."
"MTU’s joint ventures, namely
	
⁄


are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting."
"Consolidation principles
In accordance with IFRS 3, the Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition 
method, provided that the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business 
and the Group has obtained control."
"When determining whether a specific set of activities 
and assets constitutes a business, the Group assesses whether the set of acquired assets and 
activities comprises at least one input and one substantial process and whether the acquired 
set of activities and assets can generate outputs."
"Under the acquisition method, the acquirer 
accounts for the business combination by measuring and recognizing the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed."
"The identifiable assets, liabili-
ties, and contingent liabilities are measured at fair value."
"Any excess of the purchase price over 
the net fair value of the acquired assets is recognized as goodwill and tested for impairment in 
accordance with IAS 36 at least annually, or at shorter intervals if there is an indication that the 
asset might be impaired."
"If the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquired identifiable 
net assets exceeds the cost of the business combination, that excess (negative goodwill) is rec-
ognized in the income statement after remeasurement as required by IFRS 3.36."
"Non-controlling interests are initially measured on the basis of their proportion of the identi-
fiable net assets of the acquiree at acquisition date."
"Changes in the share of a subsidiary held 
by the Group that do not lead to a loss of control are accounted for as an equity transaction 
between owners."
The effects of intragroup transactions are eliminated.
"Receivables and liabilities as well as 
expenses and income between the consolidated companies are offset against each other."
"Intra-
group profits and losses are eliminated."
"Currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency using the exchange 
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction."
"At the reporting date, monetary items are trans-
lated using the exchange rate prevailing at that date, whereas non-monetary items are translat-
ed using the exchange rate prevailing on the actual transaction date."
"The translated amounts 
are recognized in revenue, cost of goods sold, other function costs, or net financial income/
expense depending on the underlying transaction."
"Revenue from currency translation does not consti-
tute revenue within the meaning of IFRS 15."
"Contrary to the general principle, currency translation differences relating to the following 
items are recognized in other comprehensive income and thus outside of profit or loss: 
	
⁄
Qualifying cash flow hedges, provided that they are effective."
"The assets and liabilities of Group companies whose functional currency is not the euro are 
translated from the corresponding local currency to the euro using the closing exchange rate at 
the reporting date."
"The translation differences arising in this way are 
recognized in other comprehensive income and do not have any impact on the net profit/loss for 
the year."
"In the event of only partial disposal, without loss of control, of a subsidiary that includes a for-
eign business, the corresponding portion of the accumulated translation differences is allocated 
to non-controlling interests."
"If the Group sells part of an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign business but 
retains a significant influence or joint control, the corresponding portion of the accumulated 
currency translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss."
"Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements of MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, and its subsidiaries 
are prepared using uniform accounting policies based on the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs)."
"Revenue
IFRS 15 states that revenue from contracts with customers should be recognized as an amount 
that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the 
promised goods or services as part of its contractual performance obligation."
"A five-step model 
framework is used to identify and measure this revenue:
1."
"
Identify the contract(s) with the customer,
2."
"
Identify each party’s performance obligations in the contract,
3."
"Determine the transaction price,
4."
"
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract,
5."
"
Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation."
"Identification of the contracts with the customer
Contracts may be entered into in writing, orally or implicitly in the ordinary course of business."
"In each case, the contracts must be enforceable and have commercial substance."
"A contract with 
a customer will be within the scope of IFRS 15 if these conditions are met and as soon as it is 
“probable” that MTU will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for the performance of 
the contractually agreed work and services."
"When the probability that the consideration will be 
collected is assessed, the customer’s ability and intention to deliver the consideration by the due 
date are taken into account."
"If, at the reporting date, a contract with a customer does not yet meet all of the above criteria, 
the company will continue to re-assess the contract at regular intervals until such time as the 
criteria are met."
"From this point onward, IFRS 15 will be applied to the contract."
"In the case of risk- and revenue-sharing partnerships with joint consor-
tium leadership – as is the standard for the military engine business (OEM segment) – by 
contrast, the customer served by the consortium (e.g., an air force) is identified as the customer 
within the meaning of IFRS 15."
"In the commercial maintenance business (MRO segment), MTU 
identifies customers within the meaning of IFRS 15 on the basis of the regular direct customer 
(e.g., aircraft operator, leasing company)."
"Contract modification
Given the long operating cycles in the engine industry, it is common practice to conclude long-
term contracts."
"These are regularly modified to provide more detailed specifications or optimize 
the exchange of services."
"In particular, the renewal of existing contracts is also regarded as a 
contract modification."
"A contract modification in accordance with IFRS 15 exists if the changes 
either create new rights and obligations or modify existing enforceable rights and obligations, 
thus altering the scope of the contract and/or the agreed price."
"Such changes must be accounted 
for either by modifying the existing contract or by establishing a separate, new contract."
"In the 
commercial maintenance business (MRO segment) in particular, maintenance for engine fleets 
can be arranged by way of long-term service agreements."
"The renewal of such long-term service 
agreements is usually accounted for as the termination of the old contract and the simultaneous 
establishment of a new contract."
"A good or service is distinct if the customer 
can benefit from the good or services on its own or in conjunction with other readily available 
resources, and if the promise to transfer the good or services to the customer is separately iden-
tifiable from other promises in the contract."
"Where a contract contains 
elements of variable consideration, the company will estimate the amount of variable consider-
ation to which it is entitled under the terms of the contract."
"Variable consideration included in the transaction price is only recognized as revenue to the 
extent that MTU considers a subsequent revenue reversal highly improbable."
The agreed transaction price is reduced in the case of payments to customers.
"MTU defines 
such payments to customers as payments that are not made in exchange for identifiable goods 
and services that are independent of MTU’s performance obligations toward its customer."
"Such payments to customers are customary in the sector, especially in the commercial engine 
business (OEM segment) due to risk- and revenue-sharing structures."
"The payments relate to 
compensation for engine development and certification, measures to gain market access and 
customer acquisition, and, where relevant, joint liability for warranty risks, contractual penal-
ties and other price and costs risks in connection with the respective engine programs."
"Allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations
Where a contract comprises multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocat-
ed to the performance obligations by reference to their standalone selling prices."
"Standalone 
selling prices are based whenever possible on information that is observable in the market."
"Certain variable consideration components are allocated in full to a performance obligation by 
reference to their economic substance."
"Factors taken into account here are that the performance 
obligation is substantially satisfied by MTU and the allocation is in line with the contractual 
objectives for the allocation of the transaction price."
"These transaction prices must be allocated in full to the goods 
delivered or services provided (e.g., engine assembly)."
"The ad-
ditional contractually agreed variable consideration (share in the net profits of the engine pro-
gram) is allocated to the obligation to provide the development/provision of engine technology."
"In the commercial maintenance business (MRO segment), transaction prices fixed in the consor-
tium agreement, including variable elements, are allocated with reference to the relative stand-
alone selling prices to the identified components of the respective maintenance contracts."
"Recognition of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied
Revenue is recognized, either over a specific period of time or at a point in time, when control  
of a good or service is transferred to the customer."
"Revenue from the delivery of engine modules and components is recognized at a point in time 
and calculated with respect to the effective transfer of control to the customer and the associated 
beneficial risks and opportunities."
"Revenue from customer-specific services – such 
as development projects and especially engine maintenance – is recognized over time if they meet 
the necessary criteria."
"When such revenue is recognized over time, the amount of completed work is determined as the 
ratio of contract costs incurred up to the reporting date to the expected total contract costs."
"The 
advantage of this method is that the inputs used to determine the amount of completed work 
are directly observable and the company can obtain the necessary information with sufficient 
reliability."
"Contracts with subcontractors
In individual cases, MTU works with subcontractors to fulfill its performance obligations."
"When 
MTU subcontracts the repair of engine components to a third party, MTU remains responsible 
for the quality of these repairs vis-à-vis its customer."
"MTU is normally responsible for ensuring 
certification of the airworthiness of the delivered engine components."
"Subcontractors generally 
bill MTU on a commercial basis."
This is independent of MTU’s invoicing of its customers.
"MTU therefore acts essentially as principal and recognizes its revenue from the relevant trans-
actions on a gross basis by recognizing invoices to its customers in revenue and the invoices 
received from subcontractors in the cost of goods sold."
"Activity as agent for the sale of non-MTU parts
As a member of certain engine consortia in the military sector (OEM segment), MTU partici-
pates in the sale of parts made by other partners, in addition to its development and production 
activities."
"The specific tasks performed by MTU consist, in particular, of organizing and sup-
porting the sales process."
"The corresponding commission on the sale is recognized as revenue 
when no uncertainty exists as to the amount of revenue arising from the sale, which is then 
recognized at a point in time."
"Since MTU is the agent in this transaction, it recognizes the net amount of the consideration to 
which it is entitled for its activity as an agent in revenue."
"Research and development expenses
Research costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred."
"In the case of development costs, a distinction is drawn between customer-funded development 
work and company-funded development work."
"Services provided as part of customer-funded development projects (e.g., government-funded 
technology programs) are reported in cost of goods sold, in light of the fact that the allocated 
funds are reimbursed by a contracting entity."
"Development costs generated in the context of company-funded development projects are capi-
talized in accordance with IAS 38 if they meet the relevant requirements."
"Otherwise, they are 
recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred."
"The capitalized development 
costs comprise all costs directly attributable to the development process and are amortized 
through cost of goods sold over the asset’s respective useful life from the start of marketing of 
the engine program by MTU."
"Intangible assets
Externally acquired and self-generated intangible assets are recognized in accordance with IAS 
38 if it is probable that a future economic benefit is associated with the asset and the cost of the 
asset can be measured reliably."
"Intangible assets with a finite useful life are carried at their purchase or production cost and 
amortized through cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over their useful lives."
Goodwill is tested for impairment regularly or as necessary in accordance with IAS 36.
"Each of 
the two operating segments, OEM (commercial and military engine business) and MRO (com-
mercial maintenance business), is tested separately."
"Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are subject to wear and tear and are carried at their purchase 
or production cost less cumulative depreciation charges and impairment losses."
"The cost of 
items of self-constructed plant and equipment comprises all directly attributable costs and an 
appropriate proportion of production-related overheads."
The revaluation model is not applied.
"Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method in 
accordance with the useful life of the respective asset."
"The useful lives and amortization methods pertaining to intangible 
assets are regularly assessed for appropriateness, and adjustments are made where necessary 
to the estimates used when the financial statements are being prepared."
"Public sector grants and assistance
In accordance with IAS 20, public sector grants and assistance are not recognized until there 
is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and that 
the grants will be received."
"Grants are recognized as other operating income in the periods 
in which the related expenses arise."
"This item also includes the reimbursement of personnel 
expenses under relevant government assistance programs."
"In the case of capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and on intangible assets, 
the amount of the public sector grant awarded for this purpose is normally deducted from 
the purchase or production costs of the asset."
"The grants are then recognized in the income 
statement using reduced depreciation/amortization amounts over the useful life of the asset."
"If 
public sector grants and assistance are not directly linked to assets that are subject to deple-
tion, they are generally recognized as other operating income in the periods in which expenses 
arising from fulfillment of obligations related to the grants are incurred."
"This does not apply 
to grants funding technology, which are reported as revenue as a verified reimbursement of 
expenses in the year they are received."
"They do not constitute revenue within the meaning of 
IFRS 15."
"Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying 
assets are added to the purchase or production costs of those assets in accordance with IAS 23 
until such time as the assets have been made ready for sale or for their intended use."
"Qualifying 
assets are those that require a substantial period of time to be made ready for their intended 
use or for sale."
"Borrowing costs are capitalized only insofar as they relate to the purchase and preparation of 
qualifying assets for their intended use or sale, and only include activities that commenced on 
or after January 1, 2009."
"The capitalized portions of borrowing costs that affect cash flows are 
included in the line item “interest paid” in the cash flow from operating activities in the consoli-
dated cash flow statement."
"Right-of-use 
assets are recognized at cost less all cumulative depreciation charges and all cumulative impair-
ment losses."
"Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the lease payments to be 
made over the term of the lease."
Lease payments are both fixed and variable.
"The Group generally calculates the present value of lease payments by applying its incremental 
borrowing rate at the delivery date, because the interest rate underlying each lease regularly 
cannot be determined reliably on an individual basis."
"After the delivery date, interest is added 
to the lease liabilities, and they are reduced by lease payments made."
"Lease payments are reported in the cash flow statement, with the amount of the lease liabilities 
paid recognized in cash flow from financing activities and the interest component paid recog-
nized in cash flow from operating activities."
"For accounting purposes, certain future developments are only taken into account if their occur-
rence is deemed to be sufficiently certain."
MTU applies the recognition exemptions permitted by IFRS 16.
"Accordingly, right-of-use assets 
and lease liabilities are not recognized if, from an economic standpoint, the lease term is less 
than 12 months at its commencement (short-term lease) or the value of the underlying asset 
is less than €5,000."
"Payments owed for short-term leases or low-value asset leases as well as 
variable lease payments are recognized in function costs in the income statement."
"If the Group acts as lessor, all leases at the start of their term are classified as either finance 
leases or operating leases."
"If this is the case, the lease is classified as a finance lease; if not, it is clas-
sified as an operating lease."
"In making this assessment, the Group takes into account certain 
indicators, especially whether the lease covers most of the useful life of the asset."
"On the delivery date of the leased assets, assets held in a finance lease are recognized as a 
receivable in the amount of the net investment in the lease."
"The market interest rate used to cal-
culate the lease is used to measure the net investment in the lease."
"Revenue relating to leases is 
outside the scope of IFRS 15."
"Acquired program assets and acquired development work
MTU refers to program assets and acquired development as capitalized compensation payments 
to the consortium leader (OEM) in favor of inclusion in or compensation for development ser-
vices for the respective engine program."
"Such compensation payments generally take account 
of the proportionate stake that MTU acquires or has acquired as a partner in the consortium for 
the engine program."
"Since there is no specific consideration, MTU classifies these compensation payments to the 
OEM – the identified customer in the commercial engine business (OEM segment) – as reve-
nue-reducing payments to customers in accordance with IFRS 15."
"Such payments are always 
accounted for by reference to the economic life of the engine program."
"Moreover, due to their 
structure, they are incurred at the start of the engine program."
"If such compensation payments contain significant deferred conditional components, they are 
accounted for analogously to IFRIC 1 if a direct relationship between the conditional compo-
nents and the economic benefit (revenue) from the program stake is identifiable."
"Changes 
resulting from reassessment of the deferred conditional components are initially recognized 
outside of profit or loss by adjusting the related asset."
"This asset is subsequently amortized as 
outlined above in accordance with the recognition of revenue from the respective engine pro-
gram over the remaining economic life of the program and thus reduces revenue."
"If impairment is indicated, the value of the asset in question is assessed on 
the basis of its recoverable amount."
"Annual impairment testing of goodwill takes place at the level of the cash 
generating units, corresponding to the two operating segments, commercial and military engine 
business (OEM segment) and commercial maintenance business (MRO segment)."
"Impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and acquired program 
assets or acquired development work are determined by comparing the carrying amount with 
the recoverable amount at the level of the engine programs, which are the cash-generating 
units."
"The recoverable amount is usually determined as the value in use using a discounted 
cash flow (DCF) method."
"If the need to recognize an impairment loss is identified, the fair value 
less costs to sell is also determined."
"When applying the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, the weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) before tax is derived iteratively on the basis of a corresponding after-tax discount rate."
"This is derived from the cost of equity after tax, which is based on a risk-free base interest rate 
and a risk premium (market risk premium multiplied by the beta coefficient calculated on the ba-
sis of a peer group analysis)."
"The cost of debt of the peer group companies is also factored into the 
calculation."
"Cost of equity and cost of debt are weighted according to the average capital structure 
of the peer group companies when determining WACC after tax."
"The discount rate used for a DCF 
method is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as an approximation of the risks associated 
with the asset or the cash-generating unit."
"For this purpose, the 
cash flows that can be generated by the asset or cash-generating unit are forecast."
"Such fore-
casts are based on the current operational or strategic planning for the Group approved by the 
management or the expected cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit being tested."
"If there is sufficient certainty that the reasons for impairment losses recognized in a prior 
period for assets or their cash-generating units are considered obsolete, the impairment loss on 
these assets is reversed, except in the case of goodwill."
"Non-current financial assets
Investments in joint ventures and associates that have a material impact on the Group’s net 
assets, financial position and results of operations are accounted for using the equity method."
"Transaction price reductions such as rebates, bonuses or cash discounts are 
taken into account when determining acquisition cost."
"Purchase cost comprises all direct costs 
of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and 
condition."
"Finished products and work in progress are recognized at purchase/production cost or net 
realizable value, whichever is lower."
"The purchase/production cost comprises all direct costs of 
acquisition and production plus the appropriate portion of material and production overheads, 
including production-related depreciation."
"Administrative expenses are also included to the 
extent that appropriate allocation to production operations is possible."
"Net realizable value is the estimated selling price generated in the ordinary course of business 
for the relevant finished goods, less the expected costs required to sell the product (costs to 
complete and selling expenses)."
"In the commercial maintenance business (MRO segment), the marketing of engine parts is 
affected, in particular, by the availability of used parts and by demand resulting from current 
usage of the engine fleet."
"Valuation allowances are recognized through profit or loss to account 
for the impairment risk of inventories."
"Contract assets
Contract assets are recognized with an impact on revenue and the balance sheet if the Group has 
satisfied its contractual obligations by transferring goods or services to the customer before the 
customer settles the identified consideration or the consideration is due."
"In doing so, settlement 
of the consideration relating to the contract asset by the customer does not take place solely over 
time – in this case, a trade receivable would be recognized instead of a contract asset."
"The contract 
assets are presented on the basis of contracts with customers, taking into account any related 
upfront payments or netted with the related contract liabilities."
"Financial assets
Financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, loans to third parties, 
other receivables, derivative financial assets, and other interests in related companies."
"At initial recognition, financial assets are measured at their fair value on the trade date, except 
for trade receivables, which are recognized at the transaction price."
"The measurement of a 
financial asset subsequent to initial recognition depends on its classification."
"Financial assets are accounted for at amortized cost in accordance with IFRS 9 if they are 
acquired with the objective of collecting solely contractual cash flows that are payments of prin-
cipal and interest."
"In this case, the Group does not apply the option of recognition at fair value 
through profit or loss permitted by IFRS 9."
"In application of the option permitted by IFRS 9, the Group recognizes financial assets that are 
contractual debt instruments that are held for trading at fair value through profit or loss."
"By con-
trast, taking into account the applicable accounting option, as a general rule, equity instruments 
are accounted for at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"Arm’s length acquisitions and disposals of financial assets are recognized as of the fulfillment 
date."
"Impairment loss on financial assets
The aim of the IFRS 9 impairment model is to reflect expected losses on the balance sheet and 
income statement."
"In the case of trade receivables and contract assets, expected losses are recognized for the 
entire remaining duration of the contract (lifetime expected credit losses)."
"For all other financial 
instruments, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month expected 
credit losses, unless there has been a significant increase in the credit risk."
"In this context, 
MTU does not assume a significant increase in credit risk if payment is more than 30 days past-
due because MTU’s business practices take a longer-term view."
"Rather, MTU considers there 
to be a significant increase in credit risk when uncontested, contractually due receivables are 
more than 90 days past-due."
"Otherwise, expected losses are also recognized for these financial 
assets over their remaining term to maturity."
"To determine whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk of a financial 
asset, the probability of default is assessed at least once a quarter using both external rating 
information and internal information on the specific credit risk of the financial asset."
"In the 
case of debt instruments, a significant increase in the credit risk is determined principally on 
the basis of past-due information and probability of default."
"When calculating the expected credit losses, a ratio is factored in for the possible impairment of 
groups of financial assets with a comparable credit rating."
"The loss allowance is based on credit 
spreads covering good, average and poor credit ratings."
"The classifications used by respected 
rating agencies are applied when making these assessments."
"For this assessment, MTU makes use, in particular, of publicly 
available information from respected credit and rating agencies."
"If the result is that the asset is 
uncollectable, it is derecognized instead of recognizing an impairment loss."
"Derivative financial instruments
MTU uses derivative financial instruments as a hedge against currency and price risks arising 
from its operating activities and financing transactions."
"At initial recognition and when measured subsequently, derivative financial instruments are 
measured at their fair value."
"If no quoted market prices in an active market are 
available, the fair value is calculated using recognized financial mathematical models (DCF 
method) on the basis of the relevant exchange rates, interest rates and credit standing of the 
contractual partners at the reporting date."
"Cash and cash equivalents
The salient feature of cash and cash equivalents, which include demand deposits, money market 
funds and short-term bank deposits, is that they generally have an effective maturity of three 
months or less from the date of acquisition."
"Assuming the appropriate creditworthiness of the 
debtor, they are measured at their nominal value or at fair value through profit or loss."
"Hedge accounting (hedging relationships)
MTU satisfies the requirements of IFRS 9 concerning instruments used to hedge future cash 
flows from revenue-generating transactions in foreign currencies (cash flow hedges)."
"At the 
inception of the hedge, the relationship between the financial instrument designated as the 
hedging instrument and the underlying transaction (hedged item) is documented, as are the 
risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge."
"This includes assessing 
the effectiveness of the hedging instrument used."
"Existing cash flow hedges are checked for 
effectiveness on a regular basis."
"MTU uses (derivative) financial instruments as cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure of 
expected cash flows relating to transactions in U.S."
"dollars (hedged items) to fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates."
"At remeasurement subsequent to initial recognition, the effec-
tive portion of the hedging instrument is recognized in equity in other comprehensive income, 
together with attributable deferred taxes, until such time as the underlying hedged transaction 
is realized."
"The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income at remeasurement are recycled to the 
income statement as soon as the underlying hedged transaction is recognized."
"The cost of effective 
hedging instruments, especially those used to hedge cash flows from revenue-generating transac-
tions (cash flow hedges), is recognized in other operating income."
"Current and deferred taxes
Current and deferred taxes are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the 
manner prescribed in the relevant income tax jurisdictions."
"Current and deferred taxes are 
recognized in equity if they relate to business transactions that directly lead to a decrease or 
increase in equity."
"The MTU Group assesses whether it is probable that a tax authority will accept a specific tax 
treatment."
"Based on this assessment, it determines the taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax 
losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment that it uses or plans 
to use in the income tax filings of relevance to the Group."
"If this tax treatment affects both current and deferred taxes, the MTU Group makes consistent 
judgments and estimates for both current and deferred taxes, or makes estimates that are 
coherent for both taxes."
"Interest on back taxes and tax refunds arising from tax audits is recognized in interest expense 
in the income statement."
"Tax assets are established on tax credits available for carry-forward at such time as 
the conditions attached to the award of the tax credit have been fulfilled."
"Similarly, deferred tax 
assets are established on tax losses available for carry-forward."
"Deferred tax assets are recog-
nized if it is probable that there will be taxable income against which it is possible to apply the 
deductible temporary difference and the tax losses and tax credits available for carry-forward."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates applicable on the date when 
the temporary differences are reversed."
"Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset insofar as 
this meets the relevant requirements of IAS 12."
"In the MTU Group, the recognition of deferred tax assets for tax credits and tax losses available 
for carry-forward is limited by the applicable taxable income against which they can be offset 
within a detailed planning period of at most five years."
"The same procedure is used when recog-
nizing net deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences."
"Pension obligations
Provisions for pension obligations are accounted for using the projected unit credit method 
in accordance with IAS 19."
"This method takes into account not only pension and other vested 
benefits known at the reporting date, but also expected increases in pensions as well as wages 
and salaries, applying a conservative assessment of the relevant parameters."
"In the case of defined contribution plans, the company has no obligations beyond the payment 
of contributions to the plan."
"In the case of defined benefit plans, the company has an obligation 
to fulfill commitments to current and former employees."
"In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate between defined contribution and defined benefit 
plans."
"In Germany, for example, a minimum level of benefits is guaranteed for defined contri-
bution plans, such that, even when the plan is provided through an external fund or insurance 
company, MTU, as the employer, remains liable."
"This “ultimate employer liability” is governed 
in Germany by the German Occupational Pensions Act (BetrAVG)."
"For financial reporting 
purposes, the term “defined benefit plan” is interpreted on the basis of the underlying econom-
ic substance of the arrangement."
"If the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to make 
further contributions, these plans are classified as defined contribution plans."
"Current contribu-
tions are recognized as personnel expenses through profit and loss in the period in which they 
are paid."
"Actuarial gains and losses – from the measurement of the defined benefit obligation (DBO) or 
the associated plan assets – may arise either from changes in the actuarial assumptions used 
or when the actual development diverges from those assumptions."
"They are recognized in other 
comprehensive income in the period in which they arise and are recognized separately in the 
statement of comprehensive income."
"By contrast, past service cost is recognized directly in 
profit and loss."
"If the criteria given in IAS 19 are met, reinsurance claims are treated as plan 
assets and netted against the corresponding pension obligations."
"The interest expense resulting 
from the reversal of the discount on the net liability, comprising pension obligations less the 
corresponding plan assets, is recognized through profit and loss in other financial income/
expense."
"Service cost is recognized in the income statement as personnel expenses allocated to 
the relevant function costs."
"Other provisions
In accordance with IAS 37, other provisions are recognized to cover legal or constructive obli-
gations resulting from past events if settlement is expected to result in an outflow of resources, 
where the expected amount can be estimated with sufficient reliability."
"Relevant obligations regu-
larly arise in connection with warranties, legal and litigation expenses, pending losses on onerous 
contracts, personnel-related matters, and other issues."
"If a planned and controlled restructuring program has been presented by the management, 
provisions are recognized for the expenditures arising directly from the restructuring."
"Restruc-
turing provisions are recognized only if there is a constructive restructuring obligation and if 
the related expenditures are both necessarily incurred as a result of the restructuring and not 
associated with the company’s ongoing operating activities."
"Non-current provisions for liabilities with an identifiable maturity of more than one year 
beyond the reporting date are measured at the present value of expected future cash flows."
"The company measures provisions for pending losses on onerous contracts at the lower of the 
expected costs on settlement of the contract and the expected costs on premature termination of 
the contract."
Provisions for personnel obligations are recognized in accordance with IAS 19 or IAS 37.
"Obli-
gations relating to pre-retirement part-time working arrangements and long-service awards are 
measured on the basis of actuarial reports."
"Contingent liabilities are not recognized as liabilities in the 
balance sheet because at the reporting date it is considered that there is unlikely to be an out-
flow of economic resources, or, as an exception, the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably 
estimated."
"Contract liabilities
If a customer pays consideration before the company transfers the contractually agreed good or 
service to the customer, which gives rise to an unconditional right to consideration, the compa-
ny recognizes a contract liability for the consideration in accordance with IFRS 15."
"Recognition of a contract liability signifies that MTU has entered into an agreement with a 
customer in which it promises to transfer goods or services to that customer in exchange for 
consideration."
"In the commercial engine business (OEM segment), MTU is a party, in some 
cases, to the contract liabilities of the consortium leader (OEM) or the engine program through 
its position as a partner in the program consortium."
"On subsequent recognition, MTU accounts 
for the revenue impact of such liabilities proportionately to its customer relationship with the 
engine program OEM, taking into account the refund liabilities in connection with its stake in 
the relevant engine program."
"The contract liabilities are presented on the basis of contracts 
with customers and are netted against any corresponding contract assets recognized as of the 
reporting date."
"Refund liabilities
In accordance with IFRS 15, a refund liability is recognized if the company receives consider-
ation from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer."
"A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration received for which the entity 
does not expect to be entitled as of the reporting date."
"In the commercial engine business (OEM 
segment), MTU participates in program profits through the provision of development work/
technology."
"As a partner in such consortia, MTU 
initially participates in all invoicing by the engine program through its pro rata share of the 
program profits."
"Furthermore, as a partner in commercial engine program consortia (OEM segment), MTU is 
exposed to unplanned price and cost risks relating to the engine program, which can also result 
in – at times significant – corrections to the share of the program profits granted by the OEM."
"To take account of such potential refunds, MTU recognizes revenue-reducing refund liabilities 
on the basis of estimates."
"Financial instruments
A financial instrument is a contract that simultaneously gives rise to a financial asset in one 
company and to a financial liability or equity instrument in another company."
"Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities reflect contractual obligations to return cash or another financial asset."
"Financial liabilities include, in particular, bonds and other liabilities evidenced by certificates, 
trade payables, finance lease liabilities, promissory notes, derivative financial liabilities and 
other financial liabilities to third parties."
"Financial liabilities are measured at their fair value at the time of acquisition, which is normally 
equivalent to the fair value of the settlement amount."
"Transaction costs directly attributable to 
the acquisition are deducted from the amount of all financial liabilities, except derivatives."
"If 
a financial liability is interest-free or bears interest at below the market rate, it is recognized 
or initially measured at fair value; this amount generally deviates from the settlement price or 
nominal value."
"Subsequently, the financial liability is amortized using the effective interest rate 
method."
"Interest on debt is presented in the consolidated cash flow statement in the line item “interest 
paid” in the cash flow from operating activities."
"Disclosures relating to the Executive Board’s or Supervisory Board’s 
proposal to the Annual General Meeting concerning the dividend payment are provided in 
section VII."
"Determination of the net profit available for distribution on the basis of the annual 
financial statements."
"These assump-
tions and estimations conform with the circumstances prevailing at the reporting date and, to 
that extent, also influence the amount of income and expenses recognized in the reporting pe-
riods presented."
"Furthermore, recognition of tax assets, especially in connection with temporary differences, tax 
losses available for carry-forward and tax credits are included."
"Assumptions and estimations 
are the elementary basis for planning calculations at company, segment, program, and custom-
er contract level."
"In individual cases, the actual values may differ from the assumptions and estimations made, so 
it may be necessary to adjust the measurement of assets and liabilities recognized in the finan-
cial statements."
"Changes are made to estimations in accordance with IAS 8 when more reliable 
information becomes available and these may have an impact on the figures in the period in 
which the changes are made and, where applicable, on subsequent periods."
"If the actual results 
deviate from estimations that are relevant for the financial statements, or if the estimations 
have to be adjusted in a future period, this may have a significant impact on the presentation of 
the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations."
"⁄

In view of the customary long-term nature of engine programs, considerable estimations are 
required, for example, on volume, price and cost structures, the time period for the provision 
of the work and services and the corresponding consideration within the program."
"These can 
have a very significant impact on accounting and thus on the recognition of revenue for the 
program-related assets."
"The principal components of program-related assets, alongside the 
acquired program assets, are the capitalized compensation payments for developments, capi-
talized development work, inventories, contract assets and program-related financial assets."
"⁄
In the process of determining impairment losses, estimations are made concerning such 
parameters as the source, timing and amount of the impairment risks."
"If the actual results deviate from these estimations, or if these estimations have to be 
adjusted in a future period, this may have an impact on the presentation of the Group’s net 
assets, financial position and results of operations."
"Further details of impairment testing can 
be found in Note 14."
Intangible assets and Note 17.
"⁄
Refund liabilities, especially for warranty and liability risks, result from MTU’s specific 
compensation obligations to the relevant OEM arising from its stakes in consortia for com-
mercial engine programs (OEM business)."
"Accounting for these refund liabilities requires 
considerable judgment and necessarily has to be based on the associated estimations made 
by the engine OEMs, which manage the relevant relationships with program customers."
"In 
this context, with regard to the reporting period, attention should be drawn specifically to the 
compensation obligations relating to the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan to offset 
the reduced service life of powder metal components in the PW1100G-JM engine program."
"In order to measure these, 
substantial estimations have to be made regarding the scope and timing of the measures 
and the resulting restrictions on the use of the associated aircraft."
"MTU’s assessment of 
its obligations in this matter takes into account the estimations made by the OEM in July 
2023, the fundamental development as of September 2023, and reviews up to the final date 
of preparation of the present financial statements."
"Further details of the joint liability for 
assurances relating to the compensation of contractual partners of the PW1100G-JM program 
in connection with the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan can be found in Note 31."
"⁄

The management recognizes valuation allowances for expected credit losses from receiv-
ables, contract assets, other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents."
"Valuation of 
the expected credit loss and the hedging instruments used to offset this requires the use of 
estimations based on assumptions."
"⁄
In certain cases, financial liabilities may be linked to deferred, conditional purchase price 
components."
"Determination of the fair value of such liabilities requires predictions about the 
future development of the parameters affecting their development."
"These comprise, on the 
one hand, publicly available market data (interest rate, U.S."
"dollar exchange rate) and, on the 
other, input parameters that are not publicly available – specifically, in this case, the number 
of flight hours on which payments are based for part of the V2500 engine fleet in the period 
up to 2027."
"To predict the future number of flight hours, MTU makes use of an in-house fore-
casting model that is based on internally as well as externally available information concern-
ing the in-service V2500 fleet."
"The sensitivity analysis takes into account both the absolute 
number of flight hours on which payments are based and the time period within which these 
hours arise."
"Further details of the financial liability relating the increase in the stake in the 
IAE V2500 can be found in Note 28."
"⁄
For revenue recognized at a point in time in connection with the commercial and military 
engine business, it is necessary to make significant estimations of invoice amounts due to 
the delayed timing of invoicing."
"These estimations cover both fixed and variable revenue 
components from the stakes in the revenue of the relevant consortia."
"The variable revenue 
component is determined by the revenue from the sale of engines and parts to program sub-
contractors and subsequent marketing of the engine maintenance services provided by the 
subcontractors to contractual partners of the program."
"Estimations are required, in particu-
lar, with regard to the refund liabilities relating to the variable revenue components and, in 
individual cases, the subsequent measurement of contract assets and liabilities."
"⁄
Revenue recognized over time is accounted for according to progress, if it is sufficiently prob-
able that future economic benefits associated with the business will flow to MTU."
"Because 
in some cases it may not be possible to reliably estimate the outcome, revenue calculated 
according to progress is recognized on the basis of the contract costs incurred up to the re-
porting date, to the extent that it is probable that these costs can be recovered."
"The measure-
ment uncertainty is consistent with the complexity and long-term nature of the respective 
customer contract."
"Management regularly reviews its estimations made in connection with 
these customer contracts, making adjustments to the accounting where necessary."
"⁄

Income taxes must be determined for each tax jurisdiction in which the Group operates."
Estimates are required when measuring actual and deferred taxes.
"The utilization of deferred 
tax assets depends on the possibility of generating sufficient taxable income in a particular 
tax category and tax jurisdiction."
"A variety of factors are used to assess the probability that it 
will be possible to utilize deferred tax assets, e.g., past operating results, operating business 
plans and the periods over which losses can be carried forward."
"Changes in these assumptions affect the 
future amount of pension provisions or the future expenses for pensions."
"Further details of 
pension provisions can be found in Note 25."
"Any subsequent changes occurring before the financial statements are 
prepared are taken into account in the amounts recognized."
"Estimations of future business 
developments also take into account the economic environment of the industry and the regions 
in which MTU is active, such as are deemed realistic at that time."
"In order to obtain new in-
formation, MTU also relies on the services of external consultants such as analysts, actuaries, 
appraisers, and tax and legal advisors."
"Macroeconomic factors
The development of business in the reporting period was affected by macroeconomic factors, 
which have to be taken into account when preparing the financial statements in view of the 
assumptions and estimations made."
"In light of the delayed effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
in combination with crisis-related geopolitical developments, the dynamics of the macroeco-
nomic framework conditions have a negative impact on the ability to forecast MTU’s medium- to 
long-term business performance."
"Corporate planning requires forecasting of the developments 
of relevance for MTU as regards the availability and inflation trend for fuel, supply chain and 
personnel capacities, exchange rates and other capital market terms."
"These factors affect the es-
timations used to derive the fair value of intangible assets, program assets, inventories, contract 
assets, receivables and refund liabilities."
"Against this backdrop, MTU strives 
to apply the parameters affected by macroeconomic factors with due diligence during the 
corporate planning process."
"In its corporate planning, MTU 
assumes that there will be no short-term stabilization of the international energy, commodity 
and capital markets and supply chains relative to the status quo."
"The scenario used for multi-year corporate planning is based on the following principal key 
assumptions:
The IMF forecasts that global GDP growth will increase slightly in 2024."
"Following growth of 
2.1% in 2023, it is projecting a higher global economic growth of 3.1% in 2024."
"One third of the 
world will probably experience a recession in 2024."
"The OECD is predicting a similar economic 
trend in 2024, with a growth rate of 2.9% (source: OECD Economic Outlook, February 2023)."
"The main reason for the forecast increase in global GDP growth is the positive development in 
Asia."
"In view of the declining cost pressure, the gradual downward trend in inflation should 
continue."
The core inflation rate should drop to 2.5% in the advanced G20 countries in 2024.
"The IMF anticipates that annual GDP growth will pick up again in North America and Europe in 
2024: In the USA, growth will rise from 1.1% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024, while in the euro zone it 
will increase from 0.5% to 1.2%."
"For China the IMF forecasts a slight drop in GDP growth from 
5.0% to 4.2% in 2024 as a consequence of the problems on the real estate market, which are 
having a noticeable impact on the economy."
"At present, it is expected that the upswing in the aviation sector will continue in 2024."
"In its forecast of December 2023, IATA predicts a slight upturn in air passenger traffic from 
95% of the pre-pandemic level to 106% in 2024."
Cargo traffic is expected to increase by 3.7%.
"This assessment takes account of the development of China, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the 
emerging global economic slowdown."
"According to the IATA forecast, global revenue in the airline sector should recover from 
U.S.$895 billion in 2023 to U.S.$964 billion in 2024, which would be a good 101.4% of the 
pre-crisis level."
It forecasts that the sector make a profit of U.S.$ 23.3 billion.
"IATA’s latest 
forecast is based on an oil price of U.S.$114 per barrel in 2024, which put the airlines under 
pressure compared with the price of U.S.$92 per barrel in 2023."
"Aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing expect to deliver 800 and 608 passenger aircraft, re-
spectively, in 2024."
"For Airbus, that would be an increase of 65 aircraft."
"The production rates of 
the A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX models are to be increased further."
"The planned increase in 
aircraft deliveries at Airbus and Boeing represents a challenge for suppliers due to personnel- 
and material-related capacity constraints, partly as a consequence of the pandemic."
"Although 
supply chains have continued to recover, they are not yet back at the pre-pandemic level."
"IATA assumes that passenger traffic will increase by 9.8%, 
so it should exceed the pre-criss level of 2019."
"Following national and regional traffic, it also 
anticipates further recovery of the long-haul sector."
"High demand for maintenance work is ex-
pected, especially for the GTF engine program and for the V2500 and CFM56 programs, for all 
of which MTU performs extensive MRO services."
"Cargo traffic should stabilize at the prior-year 
level."
"In this market, MTU participates in the MRO segment through the CF6-80C and PW2000 
engine programs and therefore expects a correspondingly stable level of capacity utilization."
"Alongside the expected spare parts business, the commercial engine business (OEM segment) 
is linked to aircraft deliveries."
"Here, Airbus has announced, for example, that it will be raising 
the production rate for its top-selling A320neo family to 65 aircraft per month."
"MTU partici-
pates in this through its stake in the PW1100G-JM GTF engine."
"Boeing has also increased its 
production targets, for example, for the 787."
Further information on revenue from the commercial engine business can be found in Note 1.
"In the military engine market, the most important programs for MTU at present are the EJ200 
for the Eurofighter, the TP400-D6 for the A400M and the Next European Fighter Engine (NEFE) 
for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS)."
"Further deliveries of the Eurofighter and the A400M 
are planned up to 2030, including through export marketing."
"The FCAS program is current-
ly at demonstrator phase 1B."
"The first flight with a development prototype is scheduled for 
2030."
"MTU is not involved in the €100 billion supplementary funding provided by the German 
government for equipment for the German armed forces."
"However, it can be assumed that de-
fense spending in the NATO member states will increase by about 7% p.a."
"In the coming years 
(compared with about 1% in 2011 to 2020) in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war and increase 
geopolitical tensions (Middle East conflict, Taiwan)."
"This opens up scope for a fifth tranche of 
the Eurofighter and for the planned MTU-Safran joint venture as part of the European Next 
Generation Rotorcraft Technologies (ENGRT) project."
"Moreover, given the more intensive use of 
the military fleet in the NATO countries, MTU stands to benefit from higher demand for spare 
parts for maintenance."
Further information on revenue from the military engine business can be found in Note 1.
"Therefore, MTU assumes that the impact of current macroeconomic factors on global air traffic 
and thus on the business development of MTU and its consolidated financial statements will be 
temporary."
"Here, MTU takes into 
account the EU Green Deal, which is derived from the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement and 
aims for climate neutrality by 2050."
"From the present viewpoint, taking into account maturity level and aviation regulations (focus 
on the avoidance of risk), the fields in which MTU currently operates will not be affected by 
substitution risks in the foreseeable future."
"In 
parallel, MTU is permanently working to improve the efficiency of conventional engine technol-
ogy, thus continuously raising the ecological and economic access barriers for any substitute 
products."
"In addition to the substitution risks, risks could arise from climate-related regulations in the 
future which, in turn, would have to be offset by gradual efficiency improvements in existing en-
gine and fuel technology."
"However, insofar as MTU can see, there are currently no 
indications of specific activity by the international regulatory authorities."
"This assessment is flanked by proactive measures to ensure a seamless transition to the 
climate-neutral provision of MTU products and services."
"These measures are set out in the 
ecoRoadmap, which MTU has been rolling out stepwise at its international sites since 2020."
"The funding necessary to realize the planned measures is included in the multi-year corporate 
planning which forms the basis for the forward-looking information for the financial statements 
and for determining fair values."
"To manage and further improve its activities, MTU continuously 
monitors greenhouse gas emissions in the production and maintenance of engines and modules 
at its sites using the recognized international Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol."
"MTU aims to 
permanently reduce CO2 emissions or provide high-quality compensation for those emissions 
that are unavoidable."
"The Taxonomy Regulation is an EU Regulation, which was adopted by the European Parliament 
and the Council of the European Union on June 18, 2020."
"It aims to establish a framework for 
sustainable investment and create a sustainable financial system."
"The Regulation contains 
criteria that determine which economic activities are deemed to be sustainable and therefore 
taxonomy-eligible."
"The Regulation is part of the European Green Deal and its purpose is to help 
the EU achieve its climate targets by 2050."
"More detailed reporting pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation can be found in the section 
Disclosures on the EU Taxonomy in the non-financial statement."
"To offset the reduction in the service life of the compo-
nents affected, which results in shorter maintenance cycles and thus restricts uninterrupted 
operation of aircraft with the PW1100G-JM engine, the OEM has launched an extended fleet 
management program for the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan."
"Compared with previous mainte-
nance plans for the PW1100G-JM fleet of engines, P&W expects this to result in additional shop 
visits for engine inspection and maintenance in the short term."
"In view of the available mainte-
nance and material supply chain capacities, P&W sees a concrete risk of significant temporary 
restrictions on the use of aircraft fitted with this engine fleet in the period from 2024 to 2026."
"In view of this, P&W felt compelled to make a public assurance of support for PW1100G-JM 
customers: With regard to this matter, compensation will be granted in individual cases and to 
an unlimited extent, even beyond the contractual claims provided by PW1100G-JM consortium."
"However, RTX reported 
that it could reduce these costs by passing U.S.$2.5 billion through to the other partners in the 
PW1100G-JM consortium, such as MTU (18% program stake)."
"The resulting earnings impact 
totaling €932 million in the reporting year comprised a revenue reduction of €917 million and 
an increase in the cost of goods sold of €15 million."
"MTU provided information on this matter, initially in its half-year financial report on June 30, 
2023, and subsequently in an ad-hoc announcement on September 11, 2023, and in its capital 
market and interim reporting."
"Furthermore, in its 10-K filing of February 5, 2024, RTX Corporation reports that, in addition to 
the PW1100G-JM, further P&W engine models use the affected powder metal components."
"RTX 
and P&W do not currently consider that there will be any relevant impact on these programs, 
so no additional financial impact is to be expected."
"These P&W engine programs include, in 
particular, the PW1500G, PW1900G and V2500 engine models, where MTU is also a partner in 
the consortia."
"The estimations required for accounting decisions on this matter are based to a considerable ex-
tent on estimates and information from the OEM P&W (RTX), especially as regards the financial 
impact of the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan to deal with the powder 
metal issue."
"RTX, as the parent company of P&W, states in this context (10-K filing of February 
5, 2024) that the estimations by RTX and P&W are based on historical experience and are sub-
ject to various assumptions and judgments."

"Notes to the consolidated income statement
1."
"For the sake of clarity, note 
that the revenue from leasing transactions, technology funding grants and other support services 
and the currency result that impact revenue are not revenue as defined in IFRS 15."
"The development 
of revenue in 2023 was affected, in particular, by the revenue-reducing accrual of €917 million for 
the expected charges arising from the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet management plan (see 
Note 12."

"Revenue included €745 million (previous year: €558 million) in connection with contract 
liabilities deferred at the beginning of the year."
"Furthermore, revenue of €19 million recognized in the reporting period (previous year: €16 
million) related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods."
"The background to this 
is, in particular, the determination of variable compensation components in the reporting 
period."
"The cumulative transaction price, including estimated variable components, attributable to the 
unfulfilled performance obligations as of December 31, 2023, i.e., the order backlog, was €24.4 
billion (previous year €22.3 billion)."
"Of this cumulative transaction price, €4.6 billion will be rec-
ognized in revenue within one year, €11.0 billion will be recognized in revenue within two to five 
years, and €8.8 billion is expected to be recognized in revenue after five and within 25 years."
"A more detailed presentation of revenue, broken down by external and intersegment revenue 
and their attribution to major customers, is provided in the consolidated segment report."

"Income taxes
Recognized income taxes comprise current income taxes paid or payable in the countries in 
which the Group operates, and deferred tax income or expense."
"The development of deferred income taxes in the reporting period was 
principally affected by temporary differences resulting from the reduction in revenue as a result 
of accrual of the expected expenses in connection with the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan fleet 
management plan (see Note 12."
"Additional disclosures relating to the income statement – Recon-
ciliation to adjusted key performance figures)."
"Information on changes in deferred tax assets and 
liabilities is provided in Note 34."
"Tax reconciliation
As a basic principle, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the applicable tax 
rate for the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on current tax 
legislation in the countries concerned."
"In the reporting period, as in the previous year, the deferred taxes of the German Group com-
panies were measured using a regular income tax rate of 32.2%."
"The income tax rate for the 
domestic tax group of MTU Aero Engines AG is still comprised of the uniform corporation tax 
rate of 15.0% plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% on the calculated corporation tax expense and 
takes into account an average municipal trade tax rate of 16.4%."
"The deferred taxes of companies outside Germany were determined in each case on the basis  
of the relevant tax rates for the countries in question, which range between 15% and 27%."
Information on changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities is provided in Note 34.
"The Group falls within the 
scope of this legislation."
"As of the reporting date, MTU performed a first, indicative analysis to determine the basic 
impact and jurisdictions in which the Group could be exposed to possible effects in connection 
with BEPS Pillar 2."
"If, 
following examination of the safe harbor rules, a jurisdiction of relevance for the Group was not 
deemed to be exempt from the full BEPS Pillar 2 calculation, the effective tax rate within the 
meaning of BEPS Pillar 2 was calculated using a simplified method."
"Based on this indicative analysis, no jurisdictions were identified where the Group would be 
affected by a BEPS Pillar 2 top-up tax."
"At present, it is therefore assumed that the Group will not 
be exposed to any relevant effects from the BEPS Pillar 2 top-up tax on the average effective tax 
rate for the Group in the future, when the BEPS Pillar 2 legislation comes into force."
"The Group is keeping a close eye on the progress of the legislative process in each country 
where it operates."
"MTU applies the exception permitted by IAS 12 and does not recognize deferred tax assets 
and liabilities in connection with the BEPS Pillar 2 income taxes, nor does it make any related 
disclosures."
"Earnings per share
To determine diluted earnings per share, the number of common shares that could potentially 
be issued through the granting of equity instruments is added to the weighted average number 
of outstanding shares."
"The net income attributable to shareholders of MTU Aero Engines AG amounted to €-102 mil-
lion (previous year: €331 million)."
"In the reporting period, the weighted average number of outstanding shares was 53,691,433 
(previous year: 53,366,518 shares)."
"Based on these parameters, basic earnings per share 
amounted to €-1.90 (previous year: €6.21)."
"Dilutive effects arose from 1,395,418 shares (previous year: 1,707,201 shares) that could poten-
tially be issued through the convertible bonds issued by MTU."
"Due to the loss in the reporting 
period, diluted earnings per share in accordance with IAS 33.41 were also €-1,90 (previous 
year: €6.06)."
"Accounting principles and policies / Consolidated group / 
Materiality criterion – Non-material investments) – and, above all, amounts relating to other periods, 
are factored out of the key earnings figures of the Group and its segments."
"The aim is to measure 
the success of managing operating activities in the reporting period and, at the same time, to 
provide information as a further point of reference for efficient comparison with different periods 
and companies."
"Following its standard practice, the central earnings indicators reported by MTU as key perfor-
mance indicators are:
	
⁄
adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), the adjusted EBIT margin and
	
⁄
adjusted net income."
"The adjusted figures do not come under the provisions of the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs); they are to be seen as an addition to the key financial indicators reported 
pursuant to IFRSs."
"The prior-year revenue figure has not been amended 
because adjusted revenue was not reported in the previous year for materiality reasons because 
there was no relevant influence on the adjusted EBIT margin."
"(KKR), following the latter’s purchase of 100% of 
the MTU shares from the then DaimlerChrysler AG."
"In the context of the acquisition, assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities were identified in accordance with IFRS 3 and measured 
at fair value."
"Since then, the identified intangible assets, in particular, have resulted in sub-
stantial amortization."
"The resulting earnings impacts are eliminated as special items in the 
reconciliation to adjusted EBIT."
"⁄
“Effects from the increase in the stake in IAE-V2500”: The increase in MTU’s stake in the 
Pratt & Whitney IAE-V2500 program in 2012 was accounted for as the addition of a program 
asset."
"Since then, this asset has been amortized over the expected remaining useful life of 
the program, thereby reducing revenue, and the corresponding earnings impact is eliminated 
as a special item in the reconciliation to adjusted EBIT."
"In the previous year, the impact of impairment losses in connection with 
the termination of business relationships with Russian partners as a consequence of the 
Russia-Ukraine war was eliminated in adjusted EBIT."
"In 2022, earnings were impacted 
by impairment losses on assets relating to the stake in the PW1400G-JM program and, to 
a smaller extent, the stake in the PW1100G-JM and the commercial maintenance business 
(MRO segment)."
"Claims to insurance compensation payments for materialized damage from the leasing of 
engines to Russian customers, which were impaired in the previous year, were realized in the 
reporting period."
"The corresponding other operating income was eliminated as a special item 
in the reconciliation to adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income in the reporting period."
"In 2022, the earnings impact of impairment losses in connection with changes in forecast 
sales of the GE T408 program – the engine for the Sikorsky CH53-K transport helicopter – 
was eliminated in the calculation of adjusted EBIT."
"⁄
“Restructuring expenses”: Earnings impacted by restructuring measures according to the 
meaning of IAS 37."
"No such effects had to be recognized in the reporting period or the previ-
ous year."
"⁄
“Changes in the consolidated group”: Earnings impacts result from the acquisition, divest-
ment or discontinuation of material investments and processes of a comparable nature."
No such effects had to be recognized in the reporting period or the previous year.
"In the reporting period, this category 
comprised the considerable earnings impact of the accrual for the expected charges for the 
PW1100G-JM “Geared Turbofan fleet management plan”."
"Accounting principles and policies / PW1100G-JM 
Geared Turbofan fleet management plan (powder metal issue) in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"In the reporting period, this category also contained the earnings impact of the provisions for 
“consortial major litigation and claims” in connection with pending arbitration proceed-
ings."
"The resulting reduction in revenue in the reporting period was €26 million and was 
eliminated as a special item in the calculation of adjusted EBIT."
"These effects have been eliminated as a special item in the reconciliation to adjusted revenue 
and adjusted EBIT."
"Adjusted net income
Similarly, the effect of the special items outlined above is eliminated from earnings before 
income taxes."
"To establish adjusted earnings before income taxes, only net interest income/
expense and the interest shares in other financial income/expense, which are mainly connected 
with provisions for pensions and liabilities from pensions and plan assets, are added to adjusted 
EBIT."
"None of the other components of financial income/expense, especially those that are 
influenced by the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate, such as the effects of exchange-rate hedging, are 
taken into account."
Adjusted net income is derived from adjusted earnings before income taxes.
"The normalized 
income taxes are calculated on the basis of the expected average tax rate for the Group derived 
in each case from the current operational planning for the Group."
"This is 27% (previous year: 
26%)."
"The profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity method does not form part of 
the tax base."
"In the table, adjustments are allocated to the 2022 figures for revenue and the cost of goods sold for information."
"Other 
social security expenses amounted to €149 million (previous year: €132 million)."
"The increase 
in wages and salaries is primarily attributable to the increase in active employees in line with 
the growth in the operating business."
"In addition, salary increases and special payments aimed 
at offsetting inflation in both the non-performance-related components and the performance- 
related components increase personnel expenses."
"9 of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB) amounted to €1,873 thousand (previous year: €1,998 thousand)."
"Other assurance services included the limited assurance 
engagement on selected non-financial key performance figures and the non-financial statement 
and the compensation report as well as the EMIR audit."
"The other services relate to handover 
services in connection with non-audit services performed before the start of the audit period."

"Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets comprise program assets, program-independent technologies and customer re-
lationships which were capitalized as part of the purchase price allocation in connection with the 
acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co."
"(KKR) on January 1, 2004, of the shareholding 
in MTU previously held by DaimlerChrysler AG, and acquired goodwill."
"This item also includes 
capitalized, internally generated development assets as well as right-of-use assets and licenses, 
particularly in connection with – mainly technical – software."
"In the reporting period, MTU capitalized a total of €82 million (previous year: €60 million) for 
intangible assets."
"Of this amount, €57 million (previous year: €53 million) was for own develop-
ment work, mainly in connection with the Pratt & Whitney GTF engines and the PW800 engine 
program."

Goodwill was tested for impairment in the reporting period as in previous years."
"For informa-
tion on the basic approach, please refer to Impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and 
equipment, acquired program assets and acquired development work in Section I."
"Accounting 
principles and policies."
"As in previous years, the end of the first half of the year (June 30, 2023) 
was taken as the date for the regular impairment testing of the goodwill of the segments."
The results of this impairment test are presented below.
"MTU applies 
these forecasts systematically as a basis for its revenue and corresponding capacity planning, 
from which the planned EBIT and cash flows for each of the two business segments are derived."
"The values in use, and the corresponding carrying amounts, are determined without 
reference to financing activities."
"In the OEM segment, the calculation of cash flow used to determine the value in use is based on 
average revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentage range in the five-year planning period."
The EBIT margin is expected to grow at average rates in the high single-digit percentage range.
"The weighted cost of capital before taxes (discount rate) applied here was 11.4% (previous year: 
10.7%)."
"The increase in the weighted cost of capital is mainly due to the increase in the risk-free 
interest rate."
"In this way, the Group endeavors to take a balanced 
view of both the low-margin phase for ramping up stakes in newer commercial engine programs 
and the stronger margin phase of the spare parts business in more mature programs."
"Consequent-
ly, the revenue assumption for the perpetuity is derived from the detailed operational planning 
period – the revenue in 2028 – plus a compound annual growth rate of 0.5% and an annuity."
"The annuity takes into account the extent to which revenue in the strategic long-term planning 
exceeds the revenue in the final year of the planning period (plus a growth rate of 0.5%)."
"The op-
erating earnings margin used for the perpetuity is based on a conservative valuation."
"Therefore, a 
margin below the average margin used for strategic long-term planning (2029 to 2037) is applied."
"Analogously to the method used in the previous 
year, given the shorter business cycles of the MRO business, the perpetuity for this segment 
was derived from the revenue and EBIT margin for the final year of the detailed planning period 
(2028) plus a growth rate of 0.5% as in the previous year."
"In addition, various sensitivity analyses were carried out."
"These did not indicate any imminent 
need to recognize impairment losses for segment activities, even in the case of less favorable as-
sumptions than those applied during the original planning phase for key determining factors."
"Further details of the influence of climate policy-related effects on MTU’s 
business model, can be found in section I."
"Accounting policies and principles – Discretionary scope, 
measurement uncertainties and sensitivity."
"Property, plant and equipment
Through its capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, MTU aims to expand its 
production capacity and modernize equipment and machinery to state-of-the-art standards."
"In the reporting period, the Group’s total capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment 
amounted to €429 million (previous year: €387 million)."
"Additions to this item also include the 
recognition of right-of-use assets relating to leases."
Further information is provided in Note 36.
"In the reporting period, additions to land, leasehold rights and buildings, including buildings  
on third-party land, amounted to €53 million (previous year: €7 million) and relate mainly to 
new buildings and right-of-use assets for real estate leases at the Munich location."
"Financial assets
Financial assets accounted for using the equity method
Financial assets accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements 
amounted to €643 million at the reporting date (previous year: €628 million)."
"Associates

"The receivables from suppliers primarily include credit notes, e.g., in connection with returned 
goods, amendments to invoices and trade discounts received."
"The program aftermarket compensation payments contain accrued compensation components 
payable to the consortium leader (OEM) for maintenance business within the GTF engine 
programs, especially the PW1100G-JM."
"These assets are amortized through the share of the 
net revenue from the engine maintenance contracts for the respective GTF engine programs."
"Expected inherent invoicing and credit risks relating to the above assets are taken into account 
by recognizing differentiated value allowances."
"Miscellaneous other financial assets amounting to €176 million (previous year: €117 million) 
relate to numerous individual items that are not material when viewed separately, for example, 
security for leases and rented premises."

"No impairment losses had to be recognized on program 
assets in 2023 or the previous year."
"In the reporting period, translation differences arising from 
the translation of the financial statements of foreign entities contained €24 million for acquired 
program assets (previous year: €-7 million)."
"In line with MTU’s standard practice, impairment losses are determined at the level of the stake 
in OEM engine programs (cash-generating units) by comparing the value in use of the relevant 
engine programs, calculated using the DCF method, with the corresponding net program assets."
"In addition to capitalized development assets, program assets, compensation payments for 
development work (acquired development work), net program assets include the attributable 
property, plant and equipment, inventories, contract assets and trade receivables."
"Relevant 
program obligations, especially refund liabilities, are reflected as reductions in this context."
"In the previous year, earnings were impacted by impairment losses of €71 million on assets 
relating to the stake in the PW1400G-JM engine program for the Russian Irkut MC-21 and the 
T408 engine program for the heavy duty transport helicopter Sikorsky CH-53K."

increased by €3 million (previous year: decreased by €10 million)."
"This increase in this stake 
is recognized analogously to IFRIC 1 because it relates to retrospective purchase costs that 
depend on future economic benefits and are therefore variable costs."

Contract assets account for €8 million (previous year: €6 million) of the reported valuation allow-
ances."
"The increase in valuation allowances in the reporting period are consistent with changes 
in the invoicing and credit risks of specific customers in the commercial engine business and are 
predominantly recognized on a case-by-case basis."
"The expenses resulting from the derecognition 
of trade receivables, offset against the corresponding revenue, amounted to €5 million (previous 
year: €9 million)."
"Income and expenses relating to valuation allowances for contract assets are presented in reve-
nue as the underlying valuation allowances relate to invoicing and credit risks."
"In order to minimize the non-payment risk, an active receivables management system is oper-
ated both in the OEM segment, supported in particular by the responsible engine consortium 
leader, and in the MRO segment."
"Income tax receivables
At the reporting date, income tax receivables amounted to €81 million (previous year: €34 mil-
lion)."
"€78 million of this amount (previous year: €28 million) comprises income tax receivables 
in Germany."
"Cash and cash equivalents
The cash and cash equivalents amounting to €883 million (previous year: €823 million) com-
prise cash in hand and bank deposits."
"This item also includes foreign-currency holdings with an 
equivalent value of €180 million (previous year: €170 million)."
"The increase in foreign currency 
holdings corresponds to the operation development of the commercial OEM and MRO business-
es, where invoicing is normally in U.S."
"As of December 31, 2023, €781 million (previous year: €506 million) of the cash and cash 
equivalents was invested in short-term money market instruments."

"Equity
Changes in Group equity are presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity."
"Subscribed capital
Due to the exercise of conversion options from the convertible bond issued in 2016, the compa-
ny’s subscribed capital increased from €53 million at year-end 2022 to €54 million at year-end 
2023."
It is divided into 54 million non-par-value registered shares.
"The Authorized Capital 2021 was adopted in the Annual General Meeting on 
April 21, 2021; the same resolution annulled the Authorized Capital 2019."
"Conditional capital
In accordance with Article 4 (6) of the articles of association, the company’s capital stock may be 
conditionally increased by up to €3,746,888 through the issue of up to 3,746,888 new registered 
non-par-value shares."
"The purpose of this conditional capital increase is to issue shares to owners 
or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants in accordance with the authorization 
granted to the company under a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on April 15, 2015."
"Shares are issued at a conversion price or warrant exercise price determined on the basis of this 
authorization."
"Until April 14, 2020, the Executive Board was authorized to issue, with the prior approval of the 
Supervisory Board, bearer and/or registered convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants (collec-
tively referred to as “bonds”) with a total nominal value of up to €500 million."
"In 2016, MTU made 
use of this authorization to increase the company’s capital stock by issuing a convertible bond with a 
nominal value of €500 million."
"Further, Article 4 (7) of the articles of association stated that the company’s capital stock may be 
conditionally increased by up to €2,600,000 through the issue of up to 2,600,000 new registered 
non-par-value shares (Conditional Capital 2019)."
"The purpose of this conditional capital increase 
was to issue shares to owners or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants in 
accordance with the authorization granted to the company under a resolution passed by the Annual 
General Meeting on April 11, 2019."
"Shares were issued at a conversion price or warrant exercise 
price determined on the basis of this authorization."
"The bonds could only 
be issued in return for cash contributions."
"They could be issued in euros or – to an equivalent value 
– in any other legal currency, for instance that of an OECD country."
"They could also be issued by an 
affiliated company where MTU exercises control."
"In such cases, and subject to the prior approval of 
the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board was authorized to act as guarantor for the bonds and 
to grant the owners of the bonds the right, obligation or option to convert them into new registered 
non-par-value shares in MTU."
"In 2019, MTU made partial use of this authorization to increase the company’s capital stock by  
issuing a convertible bond with a nominal value of €500 million."
"More details are provided in Note 
28."
"The authorization described above for the Executive Board to issue bonds with a total nominal value 
of up to €600 million was canceled at the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2021, to the extent 
that such authorization had not been used for the €500 million convertible bond issued in 2019."
"The 
Conditional Capital 2019 in the amount of €2,600,000 in accordance with Article 4 (7) of the articles 
of association was also partially withdrawn and now only comprises a partial amount of €1,600,000."
"Further, in accordance with Article 4 (8) of the articles of association, the company’s capital stock 
may be conditionally increased by up to €2,600,000 through the issue of up to 2,600,000 new 
registered non-par-value shares (Conditional Capital 2021)."
"The purpose of this conditional capital 
increase is to issue shares to owners or creditors of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants in 
accordance with the authorization granted to the company under a resolution passed by the Annual 
General Meeting on April 21, 2021."
"Shares are issued at a conversion price or warrant exercise price 
determined on the basis of this authorization."
"The bonds may 
be issued in return for cash contributions only."
"They may be issued in euros or – to an equivalent 
value – in any other legal currency, for instance that of an OECD country."
"They can also be issued by 
an affiliated company where MTU exercises control."
"In such cases, and subject to the prior approval 
of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorized to act as guarantor for the bonds and to 
grant the owners of the bonds the right, obligation or option to convert them into registered non-par-
value shares in MTU."
"Capital reserves
Capital reserves contain premiums from the issue of shares and the equity component (net 
of proportional transaction costs) of convertible bonds that have been redeemed or are still 
outstanding."
"The issue of new shares as a result of the exercise of options to convert the convertible bond 2016 
increased the capital reserves by €45 million in the reporting period (previous year: €2 million)."
"Retained earnings
Retained earnings mainly comprise retained profits generated by the consolidated Group com-
panies on the basis of a resolution by the responsible bodies."
"8 
of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"At no point in time may the value of the acquired 
shares, together with other treasury shares in the company’s possession or which are attributed 
to it pursuant to Section 71a et seq."
"of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), exceed 10% of 
the company’s capital stock."
"These shares may be purchased on the stock market or by means of 
a public offering addressed to all shareholders."
"The consideration paid for these shares must not 
be more than 10% above or below the quoted share price, not taking into account any ancillary 
transaction costs."
"Holdings of treasury shares
No further treasury shares were purchased in 2023 (or in the previous year)."
"The shares pur-
chased by MTU in preceding years still serve the purpose of granting shares in connection with 
the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP)."
"In the reporting period, 10,687 shares (previous year: 15,826 
shares) were transferred to senior executives under the Restricted Stock Plan (RSP)."
"Reconciliation of weighted average number of outstanding shares
In fiscal year 2023, the weighted average number of outstanding shares totaled 53,691,433  
(previous year: 53,366,518)."
"A total of 53,770,914 shares in MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, 
were in circulation as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 53,388,850 shares)."
"The company 
held 53,575 treasury shares as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 64,262 shares)."
"This was due to the increase in the fair value of cash 
flow hedges used in the hedging of foreign currencies as of the reporting date."
"This was offset to 
some extent by the actuarial losses from the measurement of pension provisions and exchange 
rate losses on the translation of the financial statements of foreign entities."
"As part of its capital management, the company observes the 
statutory requirements on capital maintenance."
"Formally, there are no further statutory capital  
requirements."
"Nevertheless, MTU considers itself obligated to maintain an investment-grade 
rating of at least Baa3 from Moody’s or BBB- from Fitch or S&P."
"Based on this, the dividend policy is generally aligned with a distribution between 30% and 40% of 
the adjusted annual net income (see Note 12."
"Additional disclosures relating to the income statement 
– Reconciliation of the consolidated income statement) to shareholders provided that this is permitted 
by the financial situation, especially debt and the development of cash flow, and the corporate bod-
ies approve."
"In view of this, in an ad-hoc statement on February 21, 2024, MTU announced that, 
in view of the expected cash flow burdens in connection with the PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan 
fleet management plan, it is suspending its previous dividend policy."
"The Group’s capital man-
agement activities are focused on optimizing the balance between equity and net financial debt, 
profitable growth of the business, and free cash flow or available liquidity."
"A description of the 
financial indicators MTU is obliged to meet in the context of its liabilities to banks can be found in 
Note 28."
"Pension provisions  
Defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans are in place for MTU employees."
"For Group 
companies in Germany, these benefits are financed primarily by provisions recognized in the 
financial statements, which are covered only to a small extent by plan assets."
"In contrast, MTU 
Maintenance Canada Ltd., Delta, Canada, has a fund-based retirement benefit plan, which con-
stitutes a funded plan within the meaning of IAS 19."
"Defined contribution plans
Since January 1, 2007, no direct pension commitments have been granted to new employees 
in Germany other than senior executives."
"Instead, MTU paid contributions in the amount of 
€4 million in the reporting period (previous year: €4 million) to an external pension fund for 
employees who joined the company after that date."
"In addition, MTU provides direct insurance 
contracts funded by employee contributions."
"Defined benefit plans
The pension obligations of MTU are measured using the projected unit credit method in accor-
dance with IAS 19, taking account of future salary and pension increases and other adjust-
ments expected to be made to benefits and pension plans."
"The provision for defined benefit 
plans recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present value of the benefits payable 
for current and past service (the defined benefit obligation) of beneficiaries less the fair value 
of plan assets at the reporting date."
"An extensive actuarial analysis is carried out annually for 
each pension plan by independent actuaries."
"Actuarial gains or losses may arise in connection with increases or decreases either in the 
present value of the defined benefit obligation or in the fair value of plan assets."
"Causes of actu-
arial gains or losses include the effect of changes in measurement parameters, changes in the 
assessment of risks on pension obligations, and differences between the actual return on plan 
assets and the proportional share of interest on the net liability."
"In order to calculate the funding status and the pension obligations recognized, the present value 
of unfunded and funded obligations is offset against the fair value of the plan assets."
"In Germany, 
there are no legal or regulatory minimum funding requirements."
"The present value and funding status of the defined benefit obligation is as follows:

The market yields on high-quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds with similar maturities in Ger-

"In view of the duration of the obli-
gations, which currently stands at approximately 10 years (previous year: 12 years), pension obli-
gations in Germany were discounted as of December 31, 2023, applying a discount rate of 3.19%."
"The mortality tables issued by Heubeck Richttafeln GmbH (2018G) were used as the biometric 
basis to measure the pension plan obligations in Germany."
"At the foreign Group companies, the 
obligations were calculated using a discount rate of 5.75% and current country-specific biometric 
assumptions."
"The expected salary trend refers to the expected rate of increase in salaries and oth-
er compensation, which is estimated based on inflation, the length of service of employees within 
the Group, as well as other factors."
"Employee turnover, mortality rates and disability risk were es-
timated on the basis of statistical data."
"Further information on this matter can be found in section 
I."

Actuarial losses in connection with financial assumptions correspond in particular to changes 
in the discount rate as well as salary and pension trends."
"Those in connection with assump-
tions based on experience correspond in particular to the empirical behavior of beneficiaries of 
the company pension scheme when choosing the mode of payment for their company pension 
entitlements."
"The obligations resulting from plan settlements/transfers are attributable to the conversion of 
pension benefits into fixed-sum payments and the Group’s employee turnover rate."

"The statement of principles of the foreign plan 
assets defines restrictions to be observed when choosing investments; the investment policy 
was unchanged from previous years."
"The other components of 
the expense from defined benefit pension plans and similar benefit obligations are included in 
other financial income/expense."
"The measurement effects related to actuarial gains and losses 
are recognized in total comprehensive income as part of other comprehensive income."
"The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligation (DBO), apart 
from the mode of payment, are the discount rate, salary and pension trends, and assumed life 
expectancy."
"The sensitivity 
analysis does not take these interdependencies into account."

"Warranty obligations and risks from pending losses on onerous contracts
The main component of this item of provisions is an amount of €12 million (previous year: €15 
million) for liabilities associated with warranty obligations in connection with the delivery of 
goods and services."
"MTU has identified a small amount of onerous contracts in its commercial maintenance busi-
ness (MRO segment) where the unavoidable costs of fulfilling contractual obligations are higher 
than the expected inflow of economic benefits from these contracts."
"A provision of €6 million 
(previous year: €4 million) was recognized to cover the difference."
"Personnel obligations
This item includes provisions for long-service awards amounting to €7 million (previous year: €2 
million) and provisions for pre-retirement part-time working arrangements based on the collective 
agreement on phased retirement and related works agreements."
"On the basis of these agreements, 
obligations amounting to €16 million (previous year: €13 million) were recognized at the end of 
the reporting period."
"The obligations take account of relevant plan assets amounting to €11 million 
(previous year: €11 million)."
"The item also includes provisions for profit-sharing bonuses and performance-related compensation, 
which amounted to €7 million (previous year: €77 million)."
"They relate to bonus and profit-sharing 
payments granted outside of Germany to both employees covered by collective wage agreements 
and exempt employees."
"Outstanding invoices
Outstanding invoices include, in particular, accruals for cost of sales components in the form of 
outstanding invoices arising in particular from contracts with suppliers and service providers."
"In the case of leases with third parties where MTU is obligated to meet specific maintenance 
conditions before returning the aircraft engine, the settlement obligations as of the reporting 
date are recognized as a liability."
"This is measured at the nominal value of the expected mainte-
nance costs required to satisfy the return conditions set out in the lease."
"These provisions are at 
times of a long-term nature."
"Other liabilities
The other liabilities contain obligations relating to the risk of legal action and lawsuits and accru-
als for other obligations, which are, however, immaterial when considered individually."

Registered bond
MTU Aero Engines AG issued a registered bond on June 12, 2013, for a total nominal amount 
of €100 million."
"The registered bond is repayable on June 12, 2028, and is subject to interest of 
3.55% p.a."
"Interest is payable in arrears on June 12 of each year, for the first time on June 12, 
2014."
"The registered bond, net of transaction costs and including a discount of €3 million, is 
measured at amortized cost."
"Corporate bond
On July 1, 2020, MTU Aero Engines AG issued an unsecured corporate bond with a nominal 
value of €500 million."
"The bond has a maturity of five years until July 1, 2025, and is available 
in units of €1,000."
"The coupon is 3.0% p.a., payable annually in arrears."
"At the emission date, 
the bond was rated by Moody’s (Baa3) and Fitch (BBB) and is listed on the regulated market on 
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange."
"Convertible bonds
In 2016, MTU Aero Engines AG issued an unsecured convertible bond for a total nominal amount 
of €500 million."
"This bond was convertible into new and/or existing registered non-par-value 
shares in MTU."
"The initial conversion price was set at €124.7701, which represented a premi-
um of 50% above the reference rate at the bond issue date."
"The bond was divided into units of 
€100,000 and had a nominal interest rate of 0.125% p.a."
"It matured on May 17, 2023."
"In connection with the aforementioned partial redemption of the convertible bond issued in 
2016, MTU Aero Engines AG issued an unsecured convertible bond in 2019 for a total nominal 
amount of €500 million at an issue price of 103%."
"This bond is convertible into registered non-
par-value shares in MTU."
"It bears an interest rate of 0.05% p.a., payable annually in arrears."
"Bondholders are entitled to convert their certificates into common shares in MTU Aero Engines 
AG for the first time on September 18, 2024."
"The initial conversion price was set at €378.4252, 
which represents a premium of 55% above the reference rate."
"In the event of such cancellation by MTU, and within the above-mentioned notice 
period of minimum 30 and maximum 60 days, the bondholders have the right to request that 
MTU convert their bonds into shares, rather than repurchase them."
"For information on the effect of transactions with the convertible bonds on the company’s sub-
scribed capital and capital reserves, see Note 24."
"Equity in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements."
"Financial liabilities to banks
KfW development loans 
In 2023, MTU applied to KfW for development loans for the construction of an installation for 
sourcing deep geothermal energy."
The applications were submitted via one of our banks.
"Three 
loan agreements for a total of €17 million were signed."
"The loans will be drawn at different project 
stages."
"As of December 31, 2023, an amount of €7 million had been drawn."
"The loans are subject 
to interest at customary market rates."
Unused amounts are subject to a loan commitment fee.
"The 
company can obtain repayment grants from KfW if the project is completed in accordance with 
the conditions for such grants."
"These loan repayment grants end on September 30, 2027, and 
September 30, 2029."
"Revolving credit facility
In 2022, a €500 million revolving credit facility was concluded with nine banks."
"This credit facil-
ity had an original term of five years, ending on June 29, 2027, with the option to extend it twice 
by one year in each case at the company’s request."
"In the reporting period, the company used the 
first option to extend this facility to June 29, 2028."
"The credit facility had not been drawn down as 
of the reporting date (previous year: €0 million)."
The available amount secures the mid-term financial flexibility of the MTU Group.
"Any credit 
utilized is subject to interest at the customary market reference rates plus an additional margin."
The unused amount of the revolving credit facility is subject to a loan commitment fee.
The revolving credit facility is linked to a continued investment-grade credit rating.
"If, and only if, 
the rating drops below this level, the Group is required to meet specific financial covenants."
"As of 
December 31, 2023, the credit rating was adequate."
"Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities relate to liabilities under leases, particularly from the areas of real estate and 
engine leasing, recognized using the effective interest rate method."
"For information on their ac-
counting treatment and an overview of the corresponding capitalized right-of-use assets, please 
refer to Note 36."
"Miscellaneous other financial liabilities (financing component)
Financial liabilities arising from acquisition of stakes in engine programs
This item includes the deferred payment components arising from the increase in the stake in IAE 
V2500 and the acquisition of stakes in engine programs."
"In view of the structure of the underlying 
agreements, these liabilities are considered to be financing transactions."
"For information on the 
corresponding program assets, please refer to Note 17."
"Acquired program assets, development work 
and other assets."
"Translated at the closing rate, that was 
€72 million (previous year: €114 million)."
"The carrying amount of the purchase price liability 
was €69 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €108 million)."
"In previous periods, this compensation payment obligation was accounted for as a 
component of current refund liabilities, taking account of the estimations regarding amount and 
maturity."
"The agreement concluded with the OEM in 2022 comprises a fixed settlement amount 
with a nominal value of U.S.$265 million and a payment plan comprising fixed installments 
over a six-year period."
"Taking into account the closing exchange rate as well as an interest rate 
in line with the risks and maturities concerned, the amount capitalized under other financial 
liabilities totals €221 million as of the closing date (previous year: €219 million)."
"Other financial liabilities
Derivatives
The derivatives of €47 million with and without hedging relationships recognized as financial 
liabilities as of the reporting date (December 31, 2022: €128 million) are used to offset currency 
and commodity price risks."
"The decrease in liabilities is mainly attributable to an increase in 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts due to the development of the U.S."
"dollar 
exchange rate as of the reporting date relative to the agreed hedging rates."
"In the 
previous year, an amount of €76 million was recognized for this in other provisions as personnel 
obligations."
"The Executive Board members and senior executives receive target direct compensation 
comprising non-performance-related components (fixed compensation and fringe benefits) and 
performance-related components."
"The performance-related components are divided into the 
STI, as a performance-related component with no long-term incentive effect, and the Restricted 
Stock Plan, as a performance-related component with a long-term incentive effect."
"The STI is based on the extent to which the Group’s financial targets are met in the form of 
adjusted EBIT and free cash flow."
"The extent to which the respective performance-related 
target components are met is measured on a scale of 0% to 200%."
"How these incentives are 
paid is controlled by the achievement of non-financial Group targets – ESG targets – which are 
expressed by a discretionary factor of between 0.8 and 1.2 applied to the performance-related 
bonus payment."
"The Restricted Stock Plan entails a cash payment, which must be immediately re-invested in 
MTU shares."
"These shares are subject to a specific vesting period, defined according to the 
beneficiary’s rank in the management hierarchy."
"Detailed explanatory notes on the compensation system for members of the Executive 
Board are provided in the Management compensation report in the section The MTU share."
"In addition, personnel-related financial liabilities include obligations of €12 million (previous year: 
€12 million) relating to the employee stock option program (MAP), which the Executive Board of 
MTU Aero Engines AG, Munich, offered again in fiscal year 2023."
"Through the employee stock 
option program (MAP), MTU offers all eligible employees within and outside of the collective wage 
agreement and senior executives the opportunity to invest in MTU shares."
"At the end of a two-year 
vesting period, employees within and outside of the collective wage agreement receive a taxable 
“matching” payment corresponding to 50% of the amount invested by the employee in MTU shares 
at the beginning of the program."
"Senior executives receive a taxable “matching” payment at the end 
of the two-year vesting period corresponding to one-third of the amount individually invested."
"The 
total expense for the “matching” payment in connection with the employee stock option program 
(MAP) in fiscal year 2023 amounted to €11 million (previous year: €11 million)."

The contract liabilities contain advance payments by customers for the delivery of engine modules 
and components and for maintenance services."
"In addition to the specific progress with perfor-
mance of the underlying customer contracts, changes in the reporting period were related to 
revenue."
"A further factor affecting contract liabilities was the change in the US dollar exchange 
rate from U.S.$1.07 per euro in the previous year to U.S.$1.11 per euro at year-end 2023."

"Refund liabilities often arise from the multi-step invoicing system for commercial engine pro-
grams (OEM)."
"Consortium leaders (OEMs) frequently make supple-
mentary agreements with program customers that grant effective discounts as the program’s 
supplies and services are utilized."
"New parts business: series engines are sold at the catalog list price to the aircraft manufacturer, 
which sells the entire aircraft – aircraft including engine – to an airline for a total price."
"In turn, 
engine programs frequently grant airlines a fleet introductory allowance (i.e., a credit) for select-
ing their engine for their aircraft."
"As a consortium partner, MTU participates in this invoicing 
sequence initially through its share in the sale to the aircraft manufacturer and subsequently 
through the credit to the airline."
"Revenue from these transactions is recognized in profit or loss by 
accruing a refund liability."
"In turn, the engine program generally grants 
the engine owner or operator that procures the maintenance and repair services a credit (“war-
ranty” or “discretionary” reduction) based on the pre-existing damage or the remaining lifecycle 
of the engine parts."
"As a consortium partner, MTU participates in this invoicing sequence 
initially through its share in the sale of spare parts to the MRO service provider and subse-
quently through the credit to the aircraft owner or operator."
"Revenue from these transactions is 
recognized in profit or loss by accruing a refund liability."
"To this extent, the changes in the balances of the refund liabilities correspond to the growth of 
stakes in commercial engine programs and their revenue structure – share of new engine and 
spare parts business and their respective profitability."
"Invoicing in connection with commercial 
engine programs is regularly carried out in U.S."
"Consequently, changes in the exchange 
rate at the reporting date are a key driver of the measurement of liability balances due to their 
monetary character."
"In the reporting period, U.S.$934 million related to 
the exceptional expenses for the Geared Turbofan fleet management program to compensate for 
the powder metal problem."
"Further details of the special item “Geared Turbofan fleet management 
plan” can be found in section I."
"Accounting principles and policies / PW1100G-JM Geared Turbofan 
fleet management plan (powder metal problem)."
"The increase in refund liabilities for invoice corrections/subsequent costs in the reporting period 
corresponds to the growth in the operational business in 2023."
"As already outlined, accounting for these refund liabilities requires estimates by the manage-
ment, which have to take account, in particular, of information and estimates made by the OEMs 
of the various engine programs in which the Group has a stake."
"Given the complexity of these parameters, equally reliable and meaningful

In the following overview, the carrying amounts of financial instruments are aggregated by 
measurement category."
"The information presented also includes separate amounts for each 
measurement category."
The carrying amounts of the measurement categories are compared with the fair values at the end.
"The financial instruments presented in the table that are not within the scope of either IFRS 7

"The carrying amounts of these assets and liabi-
lities therefore correspond approximately to their fair value at the reporting date."
"The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value was derived from 
stock market prices or, alternatively, using a discounted cash flow method."
"The convertible bond (2019), which is traded on the stock exchange and is carried at amortized 
cost, and the corporate bond were assigned to Level 1."
"All other qualifying financial instru-
ments, especially the derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss are valued using a discounted cash 
flow (DCF) method and are therefore assigned to Level 2."

Amounts reported for derivatives represent net outflows.
"Amounts denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the respecti-
ve reporting date."
"Variable-rate interest payments on the financial instruments are based on the 
most recent interest rate fixed prior to the reporting date."
"The cash flows relating to the liabili-
ties are assigned to the relevant date on the basis of their contractual repayment dates."
"If there 
is no contractually agreed repayment date, they are assigned to the earliest likely repayment 
date."
"Within the scope of its partnerships in engine programs, MTU is a party to aircraft financing 
agreements for the purpose of promoting sales."
"Such commitments are always made collectively 
and in favor of the consortium leader (OEM)."
"They are provided in two basic forms: predelivery 
payments (PDP) and backstop commitments."
"In both cases, any funds made available to the 
aircraft purchaser are always transferred directly to the aircraft manufacturer solely by the 
consortium leader (OEM)."
"MTU classifies loan commitments granted up to the reporting date with a total nominal amount, 
translated into euros, of €831 million (previous year: €776 million), as part of its gross liqui-
dity risk in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 7."
"However, based on experience, it is 
considered to be very unlikely that all these nominal loan amounts will actually be utilized to 
their full extent."
"This is because the financing terms offered take account of the creditworthi-
ness of the purchaser of the aircraft, based on market practice, through clauses in the credit 
agreement."
The terms for backstop commitments are deliberately prohibitive.
"In the case of 
predelivery payments (PDP), the consortium has collateral rights to the aircraft while it is still 
in production and thus in the possession of the aircraft manufacturer."
"In the case of backstop 
commitments, the aircraft is collateral under substantive law."
"It is to be expected that third 
parties arrange relevant portions of the financing commitments directly with the purchaser of 
the aircraft, not least due to the financing conditions."
"In addition, as of the reporting date, there were unutilized financing commitments for equity 
investments in the form of capital contributions or shareholder loans totaling €141 million 
(previous year: €142 million)."
"Financial liabilities), even in the unlikely event of all financing offers being taken up at the 
same time, and monitors scope to extend these credit lines to back up future financing offers."
"In 
the event that loan commitments are utilized, MTU considers the associated liquidity and credit 
risks to be manageable."
"Explanatory comments relating to net gain/loss on financial instruments 
by measurement category
The tables below show the gains/losses arising from transactions involving financial instru-
ments, aggregated by measurement category, for the reporting period and the previous year."
"The interest relating to financial instruments that 
are not within the scope of either IFRS 7 or IFRS 9 is recognized in other financial income/expen-
se."
"The amount stated for “financial liabilities measured at amortized cost” mainly results from 
reversing the discount on this category of financial instruments and is recognized in net interest 
income/expense."
"With the exception of interest expense relating to pension obligations and leases, 
interest expense is generally calculated using the effective interest rate method."
"Explanatory comments on net gain/loss from equity investments
The profit contributions from equity investments comprise profit transfers from MTU Versiche-
rungsvermittlungs- und Wirtschaftsdienst GmbH, Munich, Germany, and the military program 
companies."
"Explanatory comments on net gain/loss from currency translation
The amounts recognized for currency translation of financial assets and liabilities, measured at 
cost, result principally from foreign currency measurement of trade receivables, trade payables, 
and refund liabilities."
"Amounts relating to receivables and refund liabilities are recognized in 
revenue, while amounts relating to trade payables are recognized in the associated function 
costs."
"The gain/loss from remeasurement in connection with valuation allowances for financial assets 
(particularly trade receivables and contract assets) is recognized in selling expenses or revenue 
(revenue-reducing effect)."

"Because its business 
investments help to create jobs, the company has been awarded tax credits in respect of the 
profits it expects to achieve through its production activities, with separate amounts being 
accorded each year through to 2026."
"Deferred tax assets amounting to €33 million (previous 
year: €30 million) were recognized on the basis of the business investments realized up to the 
reporting date, taking into account the currently expected earnings from the activities for which 
tax credits were awarded."
"At the reporting date, there were temporary differences amounting to €91 million (previous 
year: €73 million) for which no deferred tax assets were recognized, in view of the relevant 
income expectations for the next five years."
"The resulting tax relief effect of €17 million (previ-
ous year: €14 million) was therefore not taken into account in the calculation of the income tax 
expense."
The reduction in current tax expense resulting from tax credits was €5 million.
"In Poland, defer-
red tax assets for tax credits were written up by €5 million."
"Tax credits that have not yet been 
utilized and for which no deferred tax assets are recognized on the balance sheet amount to €3 
million."
"Serbia
In connection with the establishment and ramp-up of the facility in Serbia, MTU was granted 
an incentive, including a “tax holiday,” based on the amount invested and the creation of new 
jobs."
"In the reporting period, this incentive did not meet the requirements for recognition in the 
financial statements, so it did not have any impact on the Group’s deferred taxes and thus on 
profit/loss."
"If, in the future, these differences meet the requirements 
for recognizing deferred tax liabilities, they would result in a tax liability amounting to €12 milli-
on (previous year: €15 million), based on the current tax legislation."

"Financial risks
In the ordinary course of business, MTU is exposed to credit risks, liquidity risks and market 
risks."
"The objective of financial risk management is to minimize the risks arising from opera-
ting activities and the resulting financing requirements through the use of selected derivative 
and non-derivative hedging instruments."
"Risks in connection with the procurement, financing and sale of MTU’s products and services are 
described in detail in the management report."
"In order to counter financial risks, MTU has put in 
place an integrated risk management system, which is monitored by the Supervisory Board."
"The 
principles of this system aim at promptly identifying, analyzing, and communicating risks and 
taking countermeasures."
"Market risks, particularly the net exposure from currency risks and com-
modity price risks, are analyzed in respect of their potential impact on the Group’s assets, financial 
position and results of operations and mitigated through the targeted use of derivative financial 
instruments."
"Credit risks
MTU is exposed to credit risks arising from its operating activities in both the OEM and MRO 
segments."
"From the perspective of the MTU Group, the risk situation deteriorated further in the 
reporting period, especially given the geopolitical developments in connection with the Russia-
Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict in the Middle East."
"The more difficult refinancing 
conditions led to a reduction in the credit ratings of some customers of direct relevance for MTU 
and customers of the program consortia in which it has stakes."
"In view of the importance of managing credit risks, engine and aircraft financing arrangements 
to which MTU is a party as a result of its engine program and MRO alliances are managed by a 
team of sales specialists, supported by advice from the central Legal and Treasury departments."
Further details of engine and aircraft financing arrangements can be found in Note 33.
"Additio-
nal disclosures relating to financial instruments."
"Financing transactions in connection with liquidity management, e.g., time deposits or forward 
foreign exchange contracts, also expose the Group to a certain degree of credit risk."
"MTU’s inter-
nal guidelines therefore stipulate that such transactions may only be entered into centrally by 
the central Treasury department, and only with contracting parties with a credit rating of at least 
investment grade."
"Counterparty limits are assigned and monitored on the basis of credit rating 
and company size."
"The reduction in the 
carrying amounts is attributable to lower potential for netting against corresponding liabilities and 
collateral under substantive law, and to the business growth in both the OEM and the MRO segment."
"The unsecured portions of financial assets were included in the calculation of the expected credit 
losses using an impairment matrix."
"For this purpose, the assets were allocated to groups with credit 
standings A, B and C, for which the respective credit loss rate was determined using published infor-
mation and/or credit ratings from international agencies:

material agreements at the reporting date that could reduce the maximum credit risk."
"Nonethel-
ess, MTU is exposed to other, pro rata liability risks as a result of its membership in engine 
consortia and therefore to potential additional credit risks, especially in the commercial engine 
business."
More details are provided in Note 37.
Contingent liabilities and financial liabilities.
"Market risks
Currency risks
More than 85% of MTU’s revenue is currently generated in U.S."
"It is assumed that over 
75% of the currency risk relating to the revenue generated is naturally hedged by expenditures 
in U.S."
"Most other costs are incurred in euros, and to a lesser extent in Canadian dollars 
and Polish zloty."
"As standard practice, the Group applies the hedging strategy outlined below 
for its exposure to U.S."
dollar currency risks that are not naturally hedged.
"With regard to the 
remaining currency risks, which are not deemed to be material and are not part of the hedging 
strategy, changes in exchange rates have a direct impact on net income and the cash flow."
"Hedging strategy
MTU uses a defined hedging model to hedge defined portions of its expected foreign curren-
cy risk from revenue-generating transactions in U.S."
"The purpose is to 
minimize the impact of the volatility of the U.S."
"dollar exchange rate on net income and the cash 
flow."
"The forward foreign exchange contracts generally used for this purpose are designated 
as financial instruments to hedge cash flows from expected sales realized in U.S."
"The 
hedge ratio decreases the longer the hedging horizon is."
"An economic hedging relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, 
since the terms of the forward foreign exchange contracts correspond to the terms of the highly 
probable forecast transactions (this is true for the nominal amount and the expected payment 
date)."
"MTU uses the hypothetical derivative method to measure the effectiveness of the hedge and 
prospectively compares the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument with the changes in 
fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk."
"MTU considers it unlikely that an effective risk could arise in such cases since only the 
amount of the expected foreign currency risk is hedged and sufficient gross foreign currency 
inflows (revenue in U.S."
dollars) are available to service the hedging instruments.
"⁄
different effects of the counterparty credit risk on the changes in fair value of the hedged 
item and the hedging instrument."
"MTU believes that this poses a low effective risk because all banks with which MTU enters 
into hedging transactions and MTU itself must have an investment grade rating."
"The priced 
credit risk between MTU and the commercial banks is therefore very low at present and thus 
immaterial."
"Translation differences arising from the translation of financial statements of international sub-
sidiaries into the Group’s functional currency and effects from measurement at the closing rate 
(translations risks) are not included when deriving the hedging volume."
"As of December 31, 2023, MTU held open forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities up 
to March 2027 in a nominal amount of U.S.$2,920 million."
"That translates into €2,643 million at 
the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date."
"The fair values of the open forward foreign 
exchange contracts maturing in and after 2024 increased by €50 million in the reporting period 
(previous year: decreased by €69 million for maturities in and after 2023)."
"Changes in the value of 
the hedged item correspond to those of the hedging instrument, so that the hedging instruments 
were effective."
"As of December 31 of the previous year, MTU had hedged cash flows for fiscal 
years 2023 through 2026 amounting to U.S.$3,000 million (which translates into €2,813 million 
at the exchange rate prevailing on December 31, 2022)."

"As a further element of its hedging strategy, MTU employs derivative financial instruments to 
which hedge accounting under IFRS 9 is not applied."
"Currency swaps
In the course of the 2023 reporting period, U.S."
"dollars were sold or purchased at the daily 
rate."
The transactions were closed after a short time through swaps.
"As the selling and buying 
rates differ only marginally, these swaps are immaterial in terms of risk."
"The purpose of these 
transactions was to optimize liquidity in U.S."
"There were no open currency swaps as of 
December 31, 2023 (previous year: U.S.$5 million)."
"Exchange rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis showing the effects of hypothetical changes in exchange rates on net 
income and equity relates to the foreign currency positions included in the respective balance 
sheet items at the reporting date."
"In this context, it is assumed that the volume at the reporting 
date is representative of the full year."
"As of December 31, 2023, significant proportions of trade receivables (U.S.$934 million), 
other financial assets (U.S.$779 million), refund liabilities (U.S.$3,467 million), trade payables

After tax."
"After deducting present values, MTU is in a net debt 
position in relation to financial liabilities."
"The interest rates on financial liabilities are currently 
stipulated in the agreements, while interest income from investing cash and cash equivalents 
is aligned with the short-term money market indices."
"MTU has thus limited the existing direct 
interest rate risk for current liabilities while also benefiting from the present increase in money 
market interest rates."
"Interest rate sensitivity analysis
Interest rate risk is presented in accordance with IFRS 7 using sensitivity analysis, which 
shows the effects of changes in market interest rates on interest payments, interest income and 
expense, other income statement items, net income and equity."
"Consequently, all fixed-interest financial instruments measured at amortized cost have no 
interest-rate-induced effects on net income and equity that have to be accounted for, apart from 
future amounts to be charged to net interest income/expense."
"In fiscal year 2023, floating-rate financial instruments and financial instruments measured at 
fair value held at the reporting date were not exposed to any significant interest rate risks."
"Price risks
There is a general risk of price increases for commodities."
"This risk is mitigated mainly by 
procuring goods with appropriate price agreements and only to a small extent by entering into 
derivative financial instruments for nickel forward contracts."
"If the market price for nickel on the respective maturity date exceeds the agreed fixed price, 
MTU will receive a payment for the difference from the bank."
"In the opposite case, MTU is 
obligated to make a payment to the bank."
"Hedge accounting within the meaning of IFRS 9 was 
not applied to these transactions."
"The change in fair value of €-13 million (previous year: €6 mil-
lion) arising from these forward commodity purchases is recognized in other financial income/
expense."
For further information see section II.
"Notes to the consolidated income statement, Note 
9."
Other financial income/expense.
"If the market prices in nickel forward contracts had been 10% higher or lower, net income would 
have been €1 million (previous year: €2 million) higher or lower."
"Liquidity risks
MTU’s liquidity risk relates to the potential inability to meet payment obligations as due, inclu-

"Segment reporting
MTU reports on two operating segments: the OEM segment (commercial and military engine 
business) and the MRO segment (commercial maintenance business)."
"Segmentation is based on 
the internal organizational structure and the corresponding management reporting system, which 
takes into account the different risk and return structures for both segments."
"A detailed descripti-
on of the operating segments is provided in the consolidated segment report."
"Commercial and military engine business (OEM segment)
In the commercial and military engine business, the Group develops, manufactures, assembles 
and delivers commercial and military engines and components."
"The maintenance, repair and 
overhaul of military engines is also included in this segment."
"Commercial maintenance business (MRO segment)
In the commercial maintenance business, the Group maintains, repairs and overhauls aircraft 
engines and industrial gas turbines."
"In addition to complete engine maintenance, the services 
provided include engine module and parts repairs as well as related services, such as engine 
leasing."
"Profit/loss of companies accounted for using the equity method
The carrying amount and the share in profit/loss of Group companies accounted for using the 
equity method are included in the consolidated financial statements if these companies can be 
directly allocated to an operating segment."
"Segment assets and segment liabilities
Segment assets comprise all assets that can be directly allocated to specific operating activities 
and whose positive or negative operating results have an impact on earnings before interest and 
tax (EBIT/adjusted EBIT)."
"Assets and liabilities are allocated to the operating segment in which 
they are used to generate business."
"To determine segment assets, the carrying amounts of sub-
sidiaries and receivables between the segments were consolidated."
"Further details are provided 
in the consolidated segment report."
"The cash and cash equivalents of the German Group companies are managed centrally by the 
parent company in a cash pooling system."
"The parent company’s operating activities are alloca-
ted to the OEM segment, which is why the associated interest income and expense arise mainly 
in that segment."
"Consolidation / reconciliation column
The amounts in the “consolidation/reconciliation” column for earnings before interest and tax 
(EBIT/adjusted EBIT) are used to eliminate the effect of intersegment sales."

"Basis for the Opinions
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined manage-
ment report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation No."
"537/2014 
(referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally 
Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschafts-
prüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those re-
quirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of

"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi-
cance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 
to December 31, 2023."
"These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consoli-
dated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide a 
separate opinion on these matters."
"Please refer to section I of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the accounting 
principles applied."
"Information on the amount of revenue from commercial engine business in the OEM segment 
and reimbursement liabilities in general can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial 
statements under II."
"RISKS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Revenue generated in the commercial engine business in the Group’s OEM segment amount-
ed to EUR 583 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 1,453 million)."
"These 
revenues are generated as part of program partnerships, so-called risk- and revenue-sharing 
partnerships, with other engine manufacturers."
"These program partnerships are controlled by 
other companies (consortium leaders)."
"The main performance obligations relate in particular to 
the production, assembly and delivery of engine parts and the provision of technology."
"In accordance with IFRS 15, the consortium leaders or, in individual cases, specific consortium 
companies were identified as customers."
"The basis for the amount of revenue recognized for 
deliveries and services by the Group is a list price fixed in the consortium agreement."
"By partic-
ipating in risk and revenue sharing partnerships, all income and expenses of the program are 
also allocated to the program participants on a pro rata basis."
"These constitute variable consid-
eration for the performance obligations or payments to the customer and therefore increase or 
decrease the amount of revenue."
"As a rule, they are only finally determined at a later date when 
the consortium leader delivers the product to its end customers or fulfills the other obligations 
arising from the contracts with the end customers."
"A refund liability within the meaning of IFRS 15 is recognized if the company receives consid-
eration from a customer and expects to refund all or part of this consideration to the customer."
"A refund liability is measured in the amount of the consideration received that is not expected 
to be due to the company as at the reporting date."
"This relates to the above-mentioned variable 
consideration and payments to the customer."
"The revenue-reducing accrual is recognized in the 
refund liabilities, which amounted to EUR 3,242 million as at the reporting date, corresponding 
to 31.8 % of total assets."
"The Executive Board’s estimates for the amount of variable consider-
ation and payments to customers are complex and discretionary."
"They are essentially based 
on the customers’ program reports, which are assessed by the Executive Board and adjusted if 
there are deviating estimates."
"There is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that the amount of variable consider-
ation and payments to customers may be inaccurately estimated and thus the sales revenue and 
the refund liability may be incorrectly calculated or measured."
"OUR AUDIT APPROACH
For the audit of revenue recognition, we assessed the design, implementation and effectiveness of 
selected internal controls with regard to the determination of the transaction price, including the 
estimation of variable consideration and payments to the customer."
"In addition, we assessed the 
accounting policy for revenue recognition in the commercial engine business in the OEM segment 
for compliance with IFRS 15."
"On the basis of representatively selected samples, we verified the preliminary revenue recognition 
upon delivery to the customer by inspecting delivery bills and other underlying documentation."
"In 
doing so, we compared the underlying prices with the price lists of the program partnerships."
"In addition, we reconciled a representative sample of variable consideration and payments to the 
customer with the program reports and assessed the valuation methods and significant assump-
tions and data used in the estimate."
We also verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.
"We discussed and evaluated the underlying contracts, agreements and correspondence with the 
program partners as well as other relevant documentation with the responsible parties."
"Further-
more, we assessed the quality of the estimates to date by comparing the originally estimated val-
ues for variable consideration and payments to the customer with the program reports received."
"OUR CONCLUSIONS
The company’s approach to recognizing revenue is appropriate."
"The assumptions and data used to 
estimate the variable consideration and payments to the customer and therefore the measurement 
of the refund liability are appropriate."
"Information on the Geared Turbofan fleet management plan (“GTF fleet management plan”) and 
the resulting refund liabilities can be found in section III."
"31 of the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements and in the combined management report in the “Economic report” section."
"RISKS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As at December 31, 2023, refund liabilities in connection with the GTF fleet management plan 
amounting to EUR 917 million were recognized in the consolidated financial statements of MTU 
Aero Engines AG, reducing revenue."
"The consortium leader of the PW1100G-JM engine program, Pratt & Whitney, has initiated an 
extraordinary GTF fleet management plan that results in MTU’s participation in expected fi-
nancial burdens."
"These charges include obligations arising from the consortium leader’s public 
commitment to pay compensation to PW1100G-JM program customers as a result of restrictions 
on the use of the aircraft resulting from the GTF fleet management plan."
"The Group holds an 
18% stake in the PW1100G-JM engine program (program share) via the associated company IAE 
International Aero Engines LLC (“IAE LLC”)."
"In accordance with the agreements with the pro-
gram partners, the obligations arising from the program are allocated to the program partners 
on a pro rata basis as part of ongoing billings."
"The Group therefore participates with 18% in the 
respective external obligations of the program."
"For the recognition and measurement of the refund liabilities in connection with the GTF fleet 
management plan, the Executive Board must rely on discretionary estimates made by the man-
agement of the consortium leader Pratt & Whitney, which controls IAE LLC."
"As a program partner, 
MTU has only limited rights to inspect the documents on which the valuation is based and limited 
influence on the amount of the program’s external obligation."
"The amount of the reimbursement 
liabilities is therefore based to a large extent on the estimates of the consortium leader Pratt & 
Whitney, which the Executive Board has adopted on the basis of its own assessment."
"There is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that the requirements for the recog-
nition of refund liabilities in connection with the GTF fleet management plan are not met or 
that these are incorrectly measured."
"There is also a risk that the resulting negative impact on 
earnings, which reduces revenue, has been incorrectly recognized in the consolidated income 
statement."
"OUR AUDIT APPROACH
We performed the audit of the refund liabilities in connection with the GTF fleet management 
plan with the support of the component auditor of IAE LLC, as the key assumptions are based 
on estimates made by the consortium leader Pratt & Whitney."
"We obtained an overview of the process for recognizing and determining the refund liabilities 
from the GTF fleet management plan and the related controls with regard to the assessment by 
the consortium leader."
"In addition, we have understood the process for transferring the data 
provided by IAE LLC to the consolidated financial statements."
"We inspected the relevant documentation and assessed whether an external obligation exists 
with regards to the GTF fleet management plan."
"We performed inquiries to obtain an under-
standing of the assumptions made and data used in relation to the expected compensation 
payments to PW1100G-JM program customers."
"We interviewed representatives of MTU’s 
Executive Board and program controlling as well as representatives of Pratt & Whitney’s finance 
and program functions during a site visit to Pratt & Whitney."
"The assumptions made and data 
used in the determination were compared with the consortium leader’s end customer contracts 
in representatively selected samples."
"We also assessed the assumptions made and data used on 
the basis of historical experience, the documentation of the engine fleet and the technical doc-
umentation."
"We verified the calculation of the refund liability resulting from the assumptions 
and data."
"Furthermore, we compared compensation agreements already concluded with end 
customers of the program with the assumptions originally made in order to assess the quality 
of the estimate."
"The estimates regarding the resulting income and cost risks of the portfolio of long-term 
maintenance contracts in the PW1100G-JM program were reviewed in representatively selected 
samples on the basis of the contracts and the associated income and cost estimates of the con-
sortium leader."
Other cost components of the contracts were vouched on a risk-oriented basis.
"OUR CONCLUSIONS
The recognition of the refund liabilities in connection with the GTF fleet management plan is 
appropriate."
The assumptions and data on which the valuation is based are appropriate overall.
"The recognition in the consolidated income statement of the negative impact on earnings result-
ing from the recognition of the refund liability is appropriate."
"The recoverability of program assets and program-related capitalized 
development costs
Please refer to section I of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on 
the accounting policies applied and the assumptions made."
"Information on the amount of program assets and capitalized development costs can be found in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements under III."
"RISKS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Group participates in risk- and revenue-sharing partnerships with other engine manu-
facturers."
"Program entry payments and pro rata cost absorptions are made to enter into these 
partnerships in the commercial OEM segment."
"These program-lifetime-related payments to 
customers are capitalized as “Acquired program assets, development work and other assets” 
under non-current assets in the consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, self-financed 
development services are provided, which are capitalized as development services and reported 
under “Intangible assets & goodwill”."
"The aforementioned assets amounted to EUR 1,330 million as at December 31, 2023 and repre-
sent a significant proportion of assets at 13.0 % of total assets."
"At each reporting date, the company uses a multi-stage process to analyze at the level of the 
programs identified as cash-generating units whether the acquired program assets, develop-
ment work and other assets as well as internally generated development assets could be im-
paired."
"To test for impairment, the company determines the recoverable amount of the program 
if certain indicators are present and compares this with the respective carrying amount."
"A 
discounted cash flow method is used to determine the recoverable amount."
"The impairment test of the acquired program assets, development work and other assets as well 
as internally generated development assets is complex and is based on a number of discretion-
ary assumptions."
"These include, in particular, the expected business and earnings development 
of the programs for the expected remaining program life and the discount rate used, which was 
derived with the help of an external valuation specialist."
"There is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that an existing impairment was not 
recognized."
"OUR AUDIT APPROACH
The Group participates in risk- and revenue-sharing partnerships with other engine manu-
facturers."
"Program entry payments and pro rata cost absorptions are made to enter into these 
partnerships in the commercial OEM segment."
"These program-lifetime-related payments to 
customers are capitalized as “Acquired program assets, development work and other assets” 
under non-current assets in the consolidated financial statements."
"In addition, self-financed 
development services are provided, which are capitalized as development services and reported 
under “Intangible assets & goodwill”."
"The aforementioned assets amounted to EUR 1,330 million as at December 31, 2023 and repre-
sent a significant proportion of assets at 13.0 % of total assets."
"At each reporting date, the company uses a multi-stage process to analyze at the level of the 
programs identified as cash-generating units whether the acquired program assets, develop-
ment work and other assets as well as internally generated development assets could be im-
paired."
"To test for impairment, the company determines the recoverable amount of the program 
if certain indicators are present and compares this with the respective carrying amount."
"A 
discounted cash flow method is used to determine the recoverable amount."
"The impairment test of the acquired program assets, development work and other assets as well 
as internally generated development assets is complex and is based on a number of discretion-
ary assumptions."
"These include, in particular, the expected business and earnings development 
of the programs for the expected remaining program life and the discount rate used, which was 
derived with the help of an external valuation specialist."
"There is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that an existing impairment was not 
recognized."
"The company’s assumptions and data on 
which the valuation is based are appropriate."
"Other Information
Management respectively supervisory board are responsible for the other information."
"The other In-
formation does not include the consolidated financial statements, the combined management 
report information audited for content and our auditor’s report thereon."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report 
do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other 
form of assurance conclusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement 
of this other information, we are required to report that fact."
"We have nothing to report in this 
regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assess-
ing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for 
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for 
financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention 
to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process 
for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management 
report."
"Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report."
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material mis-
statement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control."
"⁄
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reason-
ableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures."
"⁄
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of account-
ing and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related 
to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern."
"If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to 
draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial 
statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to 
modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up 
to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may cause the Group 
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"⁄
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the enti-
ties or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, 
supervision and performance of the group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"⁄
Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the 
combined management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we eval-
uate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the pro-
spective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from 
these assumptions."
"We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and 
on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events 
will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those 
matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of 
the current period and are therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in our 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibility in 
accordance therewith is further described below."
"Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on 
Quality Management 1: Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QS 1)."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process of preparing the ESEF docu-
ments as part of the financial reporting process."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the assurance work."
"⁄
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance on the ESEF docu-
ments in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls."
"⁄
Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file made available 
containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 
2019/815, as amended as at the reporting date, on the technical specification for this elec-
tronic file."
"⁄
Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent 
to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management 
report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation
We were elected as auditor by the annual general meeting on May 11, 2023."
"We were engaged 
by the supervisory board on October 12, 2023."
"We have been the auditor of the MTU Aero En-
gines AG without interruption since the financial year 2023."
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the addition-
al report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form 
audit report)."
"Other matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report
Our auditor´s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial state-
ments and the audited combined management report as well as the examined ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report and our assurance 
opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the examined ESEF documents 
made available in electronic form."
"German Public Auditor Responsible for the Engagement
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Johannes Hanshen."
"This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting 
methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of 
the group that are reasonable in the circumstances."
"Furthermore, management is responsible 
for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable the preparation of a consolidated 
non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error."
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and 
terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifi-
cations have not yet been published in every case."
"Therefore, management has disclosed their 
interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in 
section “Disclosures on the EU taxonomy” of the consolidated non-financial statement."
"They are 
responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that indeter-
minate legal terms may be interpreted differently; the legal conformity of the interpretation is 
subject to uncertainties."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on As-
surance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information” issued by the IAASB."
"1) 
Our engagement applied to the German version of the consolidated non-financial statement 2023."
"This text is a 
translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in German, whereas the German text is authoritative."
"The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgment of 
the assurance practitioner."
"Due to the immanent risk that 
undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation 
and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"Accordingly, we must comply with our 
professional duties and to plan and perform the assurance engagement in such a way that we, 
respecting the principle of materiality, reach our conclusion with a reasonable level of assur-
ance."
The choice of assurance procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgement.
"⁄
Evaluation of the design and implementation of systems and processes for identifying, pro-
cessing and monitoring disclosures, including the consolidation of data for the selected non- 
financial disclosures “Maximum residual CO2 emissions” and “Training days per employee”."

"It formulates possible solutions and 
potential for sustainable commercial engines as part of the shift to emission-free flying."
"The aim 
of these endeavors is to reduce the climate impact, in other words, CO2 and NOX emissions and 
condensation trails."
Reducing energy consumption is also important.
"The focus is on evolutio-
nary development of gas turbine technology based on the Geared Turbofan and completely new, 
revolutionary propulsion concepts like the water-enhanced turbofan and the Flying Fuel Cell."
Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and hydrogen play a key role.
"Compressor
The task of the compressor is to ingest air and compress it before it is fed into the combustor."
"Compressors consist of bladed disks (rotors) that rotate at very high speed between stationary 
guide vanes (stators)."
"In order to achieve a compression ratio of over 40:1, which is standard in 
all modern two-shaft engines, it is necessary to use multi-stage low-pressure and high-pressure 
compressors rotating at different speeds on dual concentric shafts."
"These are driven by the 
corresponding turbines."
"Fan
The first rotor of the low-pressure compressor is called the fan."
"It accelerates the bypass stream 
flowing aftward and provides the engine’s main thrust."
"It is driven by the low-pressure turbine 
via the low-pressure shaft."
"Flying Fuel Cell™
Revolutionary new propulsion concepts are needed to meet the ambitious targets of the Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change."
"MTU is driving forward a revolutionary concept of this type for 
the fullest possible electrification of the powertrain."
"The company considers that converting 
liquid hydrogen into water with the aid of a fuel cell has the greatest potential."
"This concept is 
known as the Flying Fuel Cell™ or FFC for short."
"The FFC would initially be used for short regi-
onal flights."
"It has the potential to reduce climate impact by 95 percent to almost zero, making 
it almost emission-free."
The only emission is water.
"The gearbox allows the fan with its large diameter 
to rotate more slowly and, at the same time, the low-pressure compressor and turbine to rotate 
much faster."
"This enables lower fan pressure ratios and therefore higher bypass ratios to be 
achieved so the individual components can operate at their respective optimum speeds."
"As a 
result, the efficiency of the Geared Turbofan is greatly boosted."
"Therefore, fuel consumption as 
well as carbon dioxide and noise emissions are significantly reduced."
"The propulsion system is 
moreover lighter than a conventional engine owing to the reduced compressor and turbine stage 
count."
"In addition, the maintenance costs are lower."
"Industrial gas turbines
The operating principle of an industrial gas turbine is essentially the same as that of an aero 
engine."
"However, instead of the customary low-pressure turbine used in aircraft, industrial gas 
turbines have a power turbine."
"This turbine delivers the power, either directly or via a gear unit, 
to an additional attached power unit such as a pump or generator."
"Nearly all industrial gas turbi-
nes of the lower and intermediate power classes are aero-engine derivatives."
"MRO business
MRO stands for maintenance, repair and overhaul."
"At MTU, the term “MRO business” is also 
used more specifically to designate one of the company’s operating segments, where it refers to 
maintenance services for commercial engines, or commercial MRO."
"OEM business
OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer."
"At MTU, the term “OEM business” is used 
to designate one of the company’s operating segments, where it refers to the development, 
manufacture and assembly of (new) commercial and military engines."
"Spare parts for (in-ser-
vice) commercial and military engines and maintenance services for military engines are also 
included in this operating segment."
"Risk- and revenue-sharing partnership
In a risk- and revenue-sharing partnership, each partner contributes a certain share of the 
resources needed for a specific engine program (work capacity and funding), thus bearing part 
of the risk."
"In return, each partner is entitled to a corresponding percentage of the overall sales 
revenue from that program."
"These include the high-
pressure and low-pressure compressors, the combustor, the high-pressure and low-pressure 
turbines and the engine control system."
"Turbine
In a turbine, the energy contained in the gases emerging from the combustor is converted into 
mechanical energy."
"Like the compressor, the turbine is subdivided into a high-pressure and a 
low-pressure section, each of which is directly connected to the corresponding compressor via 
the respective shaft."
"The turbine has to withstand much higher stresses than the compressor, as 
it has to deal not only with the high gas temperatures but also with extreme centrifugal forces 
of several tons acting on the outer rim of its disks."
"Turbine center frame
The turbine center frame connects the high-pressure to the low-pressure turbine."
"It has to be 
able to withstand high mechanical and thermal loads."
"The center frame includes struts, clad 
with an aerodynamic fairing, to support the shaft bearings and the air and oil supply lines."
"Turbofan engine
The turbofan is an advancement of the turbojet principle, the main difference being its enlarged 
first compressor stage, the fan."
"While in turbojet engines all of the ingested air flows conse-
cutively through the compressor, the combustor and the turbine, turbofans separate the air 
stream behind the fan."
"Part of the air flows through further compressor stages to the combustor 
and then the turbine, flowing through the core engine."
"The rest, however – which constitutes 
a much larger fraction – is channeled around the inner components, providing the engine’s 
main thrust."
The ratio between these two airflows is known as the bypass ratio.
"The greater the 
bypass ratio, the more economical, environmentally compatible and silent the engine."
"Turboprop engine
The most noticeable external feature of a turboprop is its propeller."
"Inside, however, the engine 
differs only slightly from the turbojet and the turbofan."
"The turbine is larger and drives not only 
the compressor but also the propeller, the latter via a gear unit."
"Consequently, more energy has 
to be drawn from the exhaust gas stream in the turbine of a turboprop than in other engine ty-
pes."
Over 90% of the energy is required for the compressor and the propeller.
"Turboprop airpla-
nes can achieve flight speeds of up to 800 km/h."
"They are thus slower than turbojet or turbofan 
airplanes, but they do have the advantage of consuming far less fuel."
"This predestines them for 
use in roles where speed is less important, such as on short-haul routes or for air freight."
"Turboshaft engine
Turboshaft engines are used in helicopters and are similar to turboprops."
"Water-enhanced turbofan
Revolutionary new propulsion concepts are needed to meet the ambitious targets of the Paris 
Agreement on Climate Change."
MTU is working towards this.
"The concept that it favors is the 
water-enhanced turbofan (WET) – a gas turbine with energy recovery and wet combustion."
"This 
concept can be used in all thrust and power classes."
"The WET can run on SAFs or hydrogen 
and could reduce climate impact by about 80 percent by 2035."
"In addition, enhanced efficiency 
would enable savings in costs and valuable resources."
