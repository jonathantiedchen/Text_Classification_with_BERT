been possible."
"The thanks of the entire Board of Man-
agement goes to all of our colleagues."

our brand promise at all points of contact with our  
customers and create special Mercedes moments."

determined by market conditions and our customers’ 
requirements."
"We will be prepared for every kind of 
market scenario."
"The motto for the production of our 
vehicles with combustion engines is “tactical flexibility”."
"When it comes to electric mobility, our strategic course 
is to create the preconditions for becoming all-electric."
We have laid the foundations for this course.
"The devel-
opment of multiple new vehicle platforms is in full 
swing."

next level."

we can build on an outstanding brand and a powerful 
team."
"All of these are excellent prerequisites for our 
ongoing promotion of the profitable, all-electric and 
software-driven future of Mercedes-Benz."
"We would be 
delighted to have you accompany us on this journey."
"The market 
environment was demanding, and a large number of 
external factors influenced the economy, presenting 
employees with complex tasks."
"Against this backdrop, the past year has clearly proven 
that the true strength of a team only becomes apparent 
when the headwinds increase."
"The team at Mercedes-
Benz Group has once again proven that it is one of the 
best and I would like to take this opportunity to express 
my sincere gratitude to all employees for their out-
standing commitment and dedication."
"In 2024, the company will continue to drive the trans-
formation in line with its sustainable business strategy."
"Whether equipped with a all-electric drivetrain or a 
combustion engine — Mercedes-Benz Group is commit-
ted to offering its customers the most desirable cars  
in the world."

continue to be recognized by the Mercedes star in the 
future."

of the Supervisory Board
In the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG again performed, in full, the 
duties incumbent upon it by law, the articles of associa-
tion and the rules of procedure."
"In this context, the Supervisory Board continuously

During the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board

rate governance."

for the management of division-specific sustainability 
issues remains with the respective Board of Manage-
ment divisions."

"On the employee side, Nadine Boguslawski,

tion Committee, to propose to the 2024 Annual General

get for the proportion of women on the Board of Man-
agement of at least 25% by 31 December 2025."

ment stipulates that at least one woman (and at least 
one man) must be a member of the Board of Manage-
ment in listed companies with parity participation and 
more than three members on the Board of Management."

requirement are no longer obliged to set a target quota 
for the proportion of women on the board of manage-
ment."

eight members of the Board of Management are 
women: Renata Jungo Brüngger, Sabine Kohleisen and 
Britta Seeger."

explained in detail in the Declaration on Corporate Gov-
ernance."

file of requirements, along with the diversity concept 
and competence profile for the entire Supervisory 
Board."

convene the Mediation Committee."

Sustainability at the Mercedes-Benz Group means  
creating permanent value for all of our stakeholders — 
for our customers, investors and employees and for our 
business partners and society as a whole."
"In this pro-
cess, economic, environmental and social responsibility 
belong together — along the entire value chain."

1	 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are caused or that any CO2 emissions
	
arising are compensated for by certified offset projects."

governance) concept throughout all of its divisions."

sions per passenger car over the entire vehicle life cycle 
by the end of this decade by up to 50% as compared to 
2020 levels."
"In addition to the comprehensive use of 
recycling materials and renewable energy in production,

go all electric."

tomer needs, whether it‘s an all-electric drivetrain or a

to the previous year."
"Our goal for the future is a brand that embodies the 
many facets of the lives of our customers — from life-
style and technology to the digital realm, mobility and 
culture — and does this by working together with cul-
tural pioneers in a manner that is as inspired as it is 
unexpected."
"We intend to achieve this goal by creating 
an emotional bond with the Mercedes-Benz Cars 
brands and getting people excited about them in con-
nection with every product and in every encounter we 
have with customers and anyone who is interested in or 
is a fan of the brand."
"Focus on profitable growth
Mercedes-Benz Cars wants to make the transformation 
towards an all-electric future profitable and to continue 
its growth in the lucrative market segments."
"A clear 
positioning as a luxury brand helps to maintain higher 
profitability across all product categories — Entry, Core 
and Top-End."
"Along with a clear focus on the customer, 
the important ways in which this can be accomplished 
are focusing and further developing the portfolio, 
achieving strong pricing, and securing the margins."
"These means will also be employed for the systematic 
electrification of our models throughout the entire 
Mercedes-Benz brand portfolio."
"Further profitable 
growth is also being targeted in the highly profitable 
product categories in particular."
"The consistent posi-
tioning as a luxury brand will also be used to achieve 
Mercedes-Benz Cars’ goal of sustainable high profitabil-
ity as a division that can rely on its resilient business 
system, even in challenging times."
"Expand customer base by growing Top-End Luxury
In the Top-End segment, Mercedes-Benz Cars boasts an 
extraordinary brand portfolio that goes beyond the 
Mercedes-Benz core brand."
"This portfolio also includes 
the Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach brands,  
as well as the iconic G-Class product brand."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Cars Strategy will be used to unfold the 
full potential of the Mercedes-Benz brand portfolio, 
accelerate the development of the Top-End product 
category and achieve additional EBIT growth."
"Brand-specific formats and customer experiences are 
also to be used to address new target groups."
"At the 
same time, even stronger interrelationships are to be 
established between the brands, in order to exploit 
synergies in customer communications, for example."
"One of the basic preconditions for this is comprehen-
sively digitalized sales and service processes that, for 
example, are enabled by the stepwise transformation of 
sales to the agency model."
"In this way, all channels — 
online and offline, and from consulting to service — are 
to be adapted to the dynamic customer requirements 
and flexibly developed further."
"Moreover, customers 
are to be provided with tailored and market-specific 
offers that enthuse them about more than just the pur-
chase of vehicles."
"These offers include such things as 
after-sales services and spare parts as well as over-the-
air (OTA) updates and digital extras."
"In this way, 
Mercedes-Benz Cars intends to continuously enhance 
the attractiveness of its products, safeguard their value 
retention and increase the company’s revenue through-
out the product life cycle."
"The division is creating the essential preconditions for 
becoming all-electric, with ambitious product develop-
ment goals and the market launch of new locally emis-
sion-free and software-driven technologies."
"The ‚elec-
tric-first‘ platform MMA which will be launched next 
year, marks the next step into the electric future of 
Mercedes-Benz Cars."
"The platforms MB.EA and AMG.EA 
will follow."
"Thus, Mercedes-Benz Cars will offer our  
customers an all-electric alternative for each model."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars’ expertise in the field of electric 
mobility is to be extended, and the vertical integration 
will also be increased by insourcing drive-system tech-
nologies for electric vehicles."
"To ensure efficient pro-
duction and promote the future development of battery 
cells and modules, the division plans to work together 
with partners to build various battery cell production 
plants worldwide."
"Mercedes-Benz also purchases  
battery cells from various partners on the world market 
to supply its global production network."
"The company 
thus has access to the latest technologies on the  
market."
"In order to further underscore the claim to leadership 
with regard to the digital experience, and to meet cus-
tomers’ needs even better in future, Mercedes-Benz 
Cars plans to introduce its own data-based and updata-
ble Mercedes-Benz Operating System (MB.OS) when it 
launches the MMA platform."
"In this way, the customers 
will be able to access a unique brand experience that 
includes special new digital extras and product features 
while control of the interface with customers can 
remain in the Mercedes-Benz ecosystem."
"MB.OS will 
create the basis for an even faster and more flexible 
response to customer requirements in the future, 
including during a product’s life cycle."
"Another aim is to 
establish smart connectivity between the vehicle, the 
cloud and the IoT world (Internet of Things)."
"Data secu-
rity and data protection play a key role for Mercedes-
Benz Cars here."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars is also striving to establish leader-
ship in assistance technologies and customer experi-
ence in conditional driving automation."
"Customers are 
offered not only enhanced ride comfort and safety but 
also an increasing reduction of driver stress and the 
freedom to carry out certain activities while driving."
"Today, with DRIVE PILOT, Mercedes-Benz Cars already 
meets the demanding legal requirements for condi-
tional driving automation according to SAE Level 3 (pur-
suant to UN R157) — the first automotive company in 
the world to do so."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars has even gone 
one step further where parking is concerned: the 
INTELLIGENT PARK PILOT preinstallation is a 
series-production system that already enables com-
pletely automatic driverless parking (Automated Valet 
Parking) according to SAE Level 4 in Germany."
"Lower cost base, improve industrial footprint and 
increase supply chain resilience
The continued systematic pursuit of our profitability 
and cash-flow objectives is a fundamental component 
of the successful and sustained transformation of the 
company."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars seeks to further opti-
mize its break-even point and take additional steps 
towards reducing the cost base and improving the 
industrial footprint."
"To this end, work is also proceeding 
on further reducing fixed and variable costs as well as 
on lowering the investments in property, plant and 
equipment."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars is also shifting its capital alloca-
tion with its sustainable business strategy."
"The imple-
mentation of further cost reductions by standardizing 
battery platforms and creating scalable vehicle archi-
tectures is planned."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars also aims to 
play a more active role along its supply chains in order 
to safeguard and increase the resilience of these busi-
ness activities."
"We want the 
vans from Mercedes-Benz to represent far more than  
a capital investment and to continue arousing enthusi-
asm."
"The strategy is based on four pillars:
Target premium segments and focus  
on profitable growth
Mercedes-Benz Vans has extensively shaped the van 
market worldwide since the very beginning."
"As part of 
the Mercedes-Benz brand family, the division continu-
ously sharpens its profile as a supplier of future-ori-
ented transport solutions for commercial and private 
customers."
"Vans in the private segment are aligned with 
the luxury positioning strategy of Mercedes-Benz Cars, 
while commercial vans are marketed within the frame-
work of a premium strategy."
"In both the commercial and the private segments, 
Mercedes-Benz Vans stands for the highest levels of 
quality, reliability and sustainability."
"A key element of 
the strategy is the increased focus on high-sales and 
high-margin markets and segments."
"In parallel with the 
expansion of its activities in Europe, the division also 
intends in future to further intensify its efforts in China 
and North America."
"In addition, Mercedes-Benz Vans 
plans to focus more strongly on the growing premium 
segments in the most profitable sectors and to enter 
into attractive segments at the upper end of the port­
folio through partnerships with body manufacturers."
"Embrace customers and grow lifetime revenues
Mercedes-Benz Vans plans to ensure a high level of 
profitability by means of a modified business model for 
sales and a customer-focused service portfolio."
"The 
focus here will be on pushing direct sales in order to 
reduce selling expenses."
"With regard to the new-vehicle 
business, Mercedes-Benz Vans is increasingly making 
use of online sales channels."
"This involves using the 
existing Mercedes-Benz Cars Online Store platform and 
expanding it to include van-specific features."
"One 
measure here will make it possible for customers to 
place follow-up orders quickly and easily directly online."
"Another goal is to generate additional revenue poten-
tials at all points of customer contact: from advice to 
sales and after-sales services."
"Starting in 
2026, the VAN.EA is a new, electric-only architecture 
which is intended to provide the basis for all future 
mid-size and large vans for both private and commer-
cial use."
"Mercedes-Benz is currently developing its own operat-
ing system MB.OS — a flexible, modular and ser-
vice-based chip-to-cloud architecture that will enable 
B2B-specific software solutions."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans 
expects that MB.OS will also enable it to quickly expand 
and optimize its digital extras and services."
"In addition, 
the operating system will serve as the foundation for 
the development of automated driving functions for 
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2 and up."
"On the basis of MB.OS and the technical possibilities it 
offers, the division plans to achieve conditional driving 
automation for private customers in accordance with 
SAE Level 3 by the end of the decade."
"The objective is 
to be able to offer partially automated driving in 
accordance with SAE Level 2 with the introduction of 
vehicles based on VAN.EA."
"With regard to the commer-
cial segment, Mercedes-Benz Vans is looking to achieve 
highly automated driving in accordance with SAE Level 
4 by the end of the decade in order to exploit the busi-
ness potential of fully automated (driverless) transport."
"Lower the total cost base and improve  
the industrial footprint
Mercedes-Benz Vans has launched a comprehensive 
cost initiative at company, production and product level 
in order to maintain profitability at a high level and to 
improve competitiveness."
"The goals here include signif-
icantly optimizing production processes and lowering 
production costs."
"This is to be achieved mainly by 
reducing the complexity of the product portfolio and 
focusing on efficiency in core production processes."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans is also reorganizing its production 
network in order to become more efficient and flexible 
and to prepare the network for an electric future."
"The 
first manufacturing plant solely for all-electric vans in 
Jawor, Poland, will set new standards worldwide for 
productivity, lean processes and sustainability."
"The 
reorganization of the production network will enable 
Mercedes-Benz Vans to react quickly to changing mar-
ket conditions in the future while at the same time opti-
mizing its cost structure."
"The strategic actions follow three principles:
Guided by economic, environmental  
and social sustainability 
Mercedes-Benz Vans has also made sustainability an 
integral part of its strategy."
"One of the main goals for-
mulated in Ambition 2039 is to make the fleet of new 
private and commercial vans net carbon-neutral over 
the entire life cycle by 2039."
"Accelerated by digitalization and  
data-driven business 
Mercedes-Benz Vans intends to use the comprehensive 
digital strategy to exploit the potential of the digital 
transformation as effectively as possible."
"Among other 
things, this includes the optimal design of the digital 
customer experience, the expansion of the digital prod-
uct and service portfolio as well as the digitalization of 
internal business processes — all while ensuring that 
data is used responsibly."
"In all of its activities, 
Mercedes-Benz Vans aims for the maximum networking 
and synergy effects with Mercedes-Benz Cars."
"We are the key to our success 
The Mercedes-Benz Vans People Principles place peo-
ple and the team at the centre of our transformation."
"These principles create the framework for communica-
tion, leadership and collaboration and require the com-
mitment and the innovative power of our employees."

"The basis for this success lies in the fact that Mercedes-

tomers who decide to switch to an electric vehicle."

ing."
"The high-power charging network will enable cus-
tomers to charge using green electricity."
"Wherever pos-
sible, the preference is to use power purchase 
contracts for green electricity, or to use accredited pro-
viders’ green power certificates for charging."

less experience."

"1	 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are created or any resulting  
CO2 emissions are offset by certified compensation projects."
"2	 Scope 1 emissions are direct CO2 emissions from sources for which the company is  
directly responsible or that it directly controls."
"3	 Scope 2 emissions are indirect CO2 emissions from purchased energy such as electricity  
and district heating that are generated externally but consumed by the company."
4	 In comparison to 2018.
"The company also aims to reduce CO2 emissions in 
production (scope 12 and 23) by 80% by 20304."
"Alongside other measures such as investments in social 
commitment and the environment, the company has 
added additional ESG metrics to the variable compo-
nent of executive compensation and indicated the gov-
ernance structures that were implemented."
"The participation of Supervisory Board member Dame 
Veronica Anne (“Polly”) Courtice reinforces the embed-
ding of sustainability in the company’s strategy, busi-
ness processes and remuneration system."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group engaged CICERO Shades of 
Green, now part of S&P Global, an assessor, to review 
the Mercedes-Benz Group Green Finance Framework."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group framework received the 
highest rating of “Dark Green” from CICERO."
"Sale of shares in the Russian subsidiaries
The Group’s intention to withdraw from the Russian 
market and sell its shares in the Russian subsidiaries to 
the local investor Avtodom AO was reported in the 
Annual Report 2022."
"In March 2022, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group had already stopped exporting cars and vans to 
Russia and ceased local production in Russia."
"As of 31 December 2022, completion of the transaction 
was still subject to authorities’ approval and the imple-
mentation of the contractually agreed conditions."
"With 
the closing of the transaction on 19 April 2023, the 
shares of Russian subsidiaries were deconsolidated."
"Further information on this is provided in Note 3 of the 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The total payout for 2022 was €5.6 billion (2021: 
€5.3 billion)."
"At Mercedes-Benz Group AG, a position on the Supervi-
sory Board was also newly filled: Sari Baldauf stepped 
down from the Board after 15 years at the end of the 
Annual General Meeting of Mercedes-Benz Group AG on 
3 May 2023."
"Stefan Pierer was elected as Baldauf’s suc-
cessor on the Supervisory Board."
"CO2 reduction in the aluminium supply chain
The Mercedes-Benz Group is working with its partners 
to decarbonize the aluminium supply chain."
"As pre-
sented in the Annual Report 2022, Mercedes-Benz AG 
and the Norwegian aluminium producer Norsk Hydro 
ASA (Hydro) signed a memorandum of understanding in 
December 2022 for a low-CO₂ technology roadmap 
between 2023 and 2030."
"As a next milestone, the Group announced on 9 May 
2023 that Hydro is to supply even more CO₂-reduced 
aluminium to the foundry at the Mercedes-Benz plant in 
Untertürkheim."
"With a minimum of 25% recycled mate-
rial in Hydro’s tested aluminium, the CO₂ footprint is to 
be reduced."
"Following the completion of the successful test phase 
for the low CO2-emission aluminium, the Mercedes-
Benz Group is now bringing sophisticated structural 
castings for the body-in-white made from the more sus-
tainable material into series production."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans: Strategy Update
At the Strategy Update on 16 May 2023, Mercedes-Benz 
Vans unveiled its strategy, which is geared towards 
profitable growth in both the private and commercial 
van segments."
"Key objectives include further strength-
ening the brand’s position in the upper market seg-
ments, increasing competitiveness in terms of costs, 
and leading the way in electric mobility and digital 
experiences."
"CO2 reduction in the steel supply chain
The Mercedes-Benz Group announced on 7 June 2023 
that it had signed a supply agreement with the Swedish 
startup H2 Green Steel AB (H2GS) for approximately 
50,000 metric tons of nearly CO₂-free steel per year for 
European stamping plants."
"At the same time, the two 
companies are deepening their partnership with a 
memorandum of understanding to jointly establish a 
sustainable steel supply chain in North America."
"Following the investment in H2GS in 2021, the new sup-
ply agreement will enable Mercedes-Benz to use virtu-
ally CO₂-free steel in series production."
"The strategic 
partner plans to start production in 2025."
"On 14 September 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
signed a supply contract with Steel Dynamics, Inc."
"for 
delivery of CO₂-reduced steel to the production plant in 
Tuscaloosa, Alabama (USA)."
"In this way, the company 
wants to set another milestone on the path to decar-
bonizing the global steel supply chain."
"Access to Tesla Superchargers in North America for 
Mercedes-Benz customers
On 5 January 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group had 
already announced the development of its own global 
high-power charging network with around 400 charging 
stations and more than 2,500 charging points in North 
America."
"In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
announced on 7 July 2023 that Mercedes-Benz custom-
ers will be able to use Tesla Superchargers in North 
America starting in 2024."
"The new joint ven-
ture, which is known as Ionna LLC, is to establish a 
charging network with at least 30,000 charging points."
"The first stations are expected to open in the United 
States in 2024 and in Canada at a later stage."
"In line 
with the sustainability strategies of all seven automak-
ers, Ionna LLC has set itself the objective of powering 
the charging network with renewable energy."
"As Chief Technology Officer, 
Markus Schäfer is responsible for Development & Pro-
curement on the Board of Management."
"The Supervisory Board also resolved to establish a 
cross-divisional steering and coordination function for 
sustainability management in the company at the Board 
of Management level."
"On 1 August 2023, Renata Jungo 
Brüngger took over responsibility for this function as 
part of the Integrity, Governance & Sustainability divi-
sion (previously: Integrity & Legal Affairs)."
"With this 
step, the Mercedes-Benz Group is taking into account 
the steadily increasing complexity and growing legal 
significance of this multi-faceted topic."
"Responsibility 
for the management of division-specific sustainability 
issues remains with the respective Board of Manage-
ment divisions."
"At its meeting, the Supervisory Board also resolved to 
change the name of Dr Jörg Burzer’s division to Produc-
tion, Quality & Supply Chain Management (previously: 
Production & Supply Chain Management)."
"As a result of 
this change, the division’s name will also express the

automation for vehicles”, published in 2021 by the National Technical Committee of  
Auto Standardization."
"division’s comprehensive responsibility for quality as 
well as this topic’s great importance for the Mercedes-
Benz brand."
"Sabine Kohleisen’s division was renamed Human Rela-
tions (previously: Human Resources)."
"This was done in 
order to show that human resources work in the 
Mercedes-Benz Group focuses on cooperation with and 
between people."
"At the meeting on 21 February 2024, the Supervisory 
Board reappointed Renata Jungo Brüngger until the end 
of 2025 and Britta Seeger until the end of 2029."
"Renata Jungo Brüngger is responsible for Integrity, Gov-
ernance & Sustainability and Britta Seeger is responsi-
ble for Marketing & Sales on the Board of Management."
"Creation of a joint high-power charging network 
with BMW Brilliance Automotive in China
On 30 November 2023, Mercedes-Benz Group 
China Ltd."
and BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.
"agreed 
to set up a joint venture for the establishment and 
operation of a joint high-power charging network in 
China in order to provide Chinese customers with pre-
mium charging services."
"The joint venture aims to pro-
cure electricity directly from renewable sources wher-
ever this is possible."
"The joint venture plans to establish a charging network 
of at least 1,000 stations with around 7,000 high-power 
charging points between the year 2024 and the end of 
2026."
"Approval to test conditionally automated  
driving in Beijing
On 16 December 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
became one of the first automakers to receive approval 
to test conditionally automated driving Level 31 in Bei-
jing."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group will begin testing condi-
tionally automated driving systems on designated high-
ways in Beijing."
"The company is working with the 
responsible authorities on the development of Level 3 
systems for the Chinese market in order to be able to 
offer Chinese customers a safe and reliable automated 
driving experience."
"The review is 
open-ended as regards its outcome and will be con-
ducted individually and step-by-step at each retail 
location."
"The company expects the transformation pro-
cess to take several years."
"Contract negotiations with 
potential buyers had not yet taken place as of the bal-
ance sheet date."
"At the present time, it is not possible 
to reliably estimate the effects on the profitability, 
liquidity and capital resources, and financial position."
"Share buyback policy and further share  
buyback programme
On 21 February 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG has 
resolved to implement a share buyback policy."
"Based 
on such policy, the future Free Cash Flow from the 
industrial business (as available post potential smalls-
cale M&A) generated beyond the approx."
"40
 % dividend 
payout ratio of Group net profi shall be used to fund 
share buybacks with the purpose of redeeming shares."
"In this context, Mercedes-Benz Group AG moreover  
has resolved to conduct a further share buyback  
programme, through which it is intended to acquire own 
shares worth up to €3 billion (not including incidental 
costs) on the stock exchange and to then cancel them."
"It is sched-
uled to commence immediately after the conclusion  
of the ongoing share buyback programme announced 
on 16 February 2023, and is expected to be completed 
before the expiry of the Annual General Meeting’s 
above-mentioned authorization."
"Future share buyback programmes are subject to the 
necessary resolutions of the company’s corporate  
bodies required in each individual case."
"The return on net assets (RONA) is calculated from the 
ratio of EBIT to net assets."
"Value is created for our 
shareholders when RONA exceeds the cost of capital."
"The required rate of return on net assets, and thus the 
cost of capital rate, is derived from the minimum rates 
of return that equity investors and lenders expect on 
their invested capital."
"For 2023, the Group’s cost of capital 
rate amounted to 9% after taxes."
"For the automotive 
divisions, this cost of capital rate stood at 13% before 
taxes; for Mercedes-Benz Mobility, a cost of equity of 
13% before taxes was applied."
"Performance measurement system
Various targets are defined on the basis of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group’s corporate strategy and busi-
ness strategy."
"The Group’s performance measurement 
system is oriented towards the achievement of these 
targets."
"Along with financial aspects, they include sus-
tainability-related targets in particular."
"The information provided below primarily relates to the 
Group’s financial performance measurement system."
"Information on the sustainability targets and the meas-
ures being taken to achieve them can be found in the 
chapter Non-Financial Declaration."
"Objective
The financial performance measurement system used at 
the Mercedes-Benz Group is designed to ensure that 
our investors’ interests and expectations are taken into 
account within the framework of a value-based man-
agement system."
"The value added is based on this prin-
ciple."
"It shows the extent to which the Group and its 
divisions achieve or exceed the return requirements of 
the investors."
"Due to the only indirect relationship of 
value added to ongoing business operations, the value 
drivers of the value added are utilized as financial per-
formance indicators for the periodic controlling of the 
Group and its divisions."
"EBIT thus reflects the divisions’ responsibility for profit 
and loss."
"EBIT that is calculated at the Group level 
takes into account centrally managed matters and elim-
inations."
"In order to provide a more transparent presentation of 
our ongoing business, adjusted EBIT is also calculated 
and reported for both the Group and the divisions."
"The 
adjustments include individual items insofar as they 
lead to material effects in a reporting year."
"These indi-
vidual items can relate in particular to legal proceedings 
and related measures, restructuring measures and M&A 
transactions."
"Group EBIT minus the centrally managed income taxes 
equals net operating profit."
"The chapter Profitability 
shows how net operating profit is calculated."
"Return on sales
As one of the main factors influencing value added, 
return on sales is of particular importance for assessing 
the profitability of the automotive divisions."
"Return on 
sales is the ratio of EBIT to revenue, and vehicle sales 
are the primary source of revenue."
"The measure of prof-
itability for Mercedes-Benz Mobility is not return on 
sales but return on equity (the ratio of EBIT to average 
equity on a quarterly basis)."
"On the basis of adjusted 
EBIT, an adjusted return on sales is reported for the 
automotive divisions and an adjusted return on equity 
is reported for Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"Net assets
All assets, liabilities and provisions for which the auto-
motive divisions are responsible in day-to-day opera-
tions are allocated to them."
"Performance measurement 
at Mercedes-Benz Mobility is implemented on an equity 
basis."
"Net assets at the Group level include the net 
operating assets of the automotive divisions and the 
equity of Mercedes-Benz Mobility, as well as assets and 
liabilities from income taxes and other reconciling items 
which are not allocated to the divisions."
"The average 
annual net assets are calculated on the basis of the 
average quarterly net assets."
"Cash flow
A change in net assets — for example as a result of 
investments — generally leads to the application or 
release of liquid funds."
"Along with earnings, net assets 
thus also have a direct effect on the cash flow."
"The operating cash flow 
before interest and taxes (CFBIT) for the automotive 
divisions is derived from EBIT and the change in net 
assets."
"The cash conversion rate (CCR) is the ratio of 
CFBIT to EBIT over a period of time and is an important 
measure for cash-flow management at the automotive 
divisions."
"In order to provide a more transparent presentation of 
our ongoing business, the adjusted free cash flow of 
the industrial business and the adjusted CFBIT of the 
automotive divisions are also calculated and reported."
"An adjusted cash conversion rate (adjusted CCR) on the 
basis of adjusted CFBIT and adjusted EBIT is presented 
for the automotive divisions."
"The adjustments include 
individual items insofar as they lead to material effects 
in a reporting year."
"These individual items can relate in 
particular to legal proceedings and related measures, 
restructuring measures and M&A transactions."
"New business here refers to the volume of 
leasing and financing contracts capitalized during the 
reporting year."
"1 	 Average CO2 emissions of the new car fleet (CO2 pool) of newly registered Mercedes-
Benz cars in Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland) in the reporting year as 
measured on the basis of the WLTP type approval procedure."
"The Mercedes-Benz CO2 
pool also includes vans that were registered as passenger cars and, since 2023, vehicles 
from the joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd."
"Key non-financial performance indicators 
Unit sales at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans are used as an additional non-financial indicator 
for measuring the performance of the automotive divi-
sions."
"The figure for the CO2 emissions of the new car fleet in 
Europe1 represented a key performance indicator until 
31 December 2023."
"As of the year 2024, the share of 
electrified vehicles (xEV) from Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
from Mercedes-Benz Vans respectively, measured on 
the basis of the unit vehicle sales of these divisions, will 
be used as key non-financial performance indicators."
"They are replacing the value of the CO2 emissions of the 
new car fleet in Europe as a key non-financial perfor-
mance indicator because they provide a more compre-
hensive picture of the global activities of the Mercedes-
Benz Group in the area of electromobility."
"The adverse 
effects on growth that resulted from the steep and syn-
chronized tightening of monetary policy by many cen-
tral banks was offset to some degree by supportive fis-
cal policies and lower prices for energy and raw 
materials."
"At the same time, major differences were 
observed between regions, and even within regions in 
some cases."
"The main reason for the positive develop-
ment of the world economy overall was the unexpected 
resilience of the US economy in the face of an 
extremely restrictive monetary policy, although major 
emerging markets such as India and Brazil were also 
able to exceed expectations in this regard."
"On the other 
hand, the European and the Chinese economies dis-
played relatively weak development during the year 
under review."
"Given these circumstances, global trade 
volume not only slowed but also contracted by around 
2% in 2023 as compared to the previous year."
"The US economy successfully defied recession risks 
during the reporting year."
"Growth remained strong 
despite the fact that the country’s central bank — the 
Fed — raised its policy rate throughout the course of 
the year by a further 100 basis points to 5.5%."
"Private 
consumption in particular developed dynamically and 
was supported by generous fiscal programmes and 
pandemic-era excess savings."
"Inflation also continued 
to decline — at an average of 4.1%, it was significantly 
lower than in the prior year, but it still remained above 
the Fed’s target."
"This development, along with substan-
tial wage increases, had a positive effect on disposable 
income."
"Thanks to robust domestic demand, the US 
economy recorded growth of 2.5% for the year as a 
whole in 2023."
"The economy in the euro zone developed much less 
dynamically, although the burden caused by high 
energy prices was noticeably less pronounced in 2023 
than it was in the prior year."
"Still, the industrial sector 
remained under extreme pressure and shrank signifi-
cantly over the year as a whole."
"Private consumption 
stagnated across many sectors due to ongoing high, 
albeit decreasing, inflation and rising interest rates."
"Inflation in the euro zone averaged 5.4% for the year as 
a whole, which was still much higher than the central 
bank target of approximately 2%."
"The European Central 
Bank thus continued its tight monetary policy, raising 
the main refinancing rate throughout the course of the 
year by a further 200 basis points to 4.5%."
"Economic 
activity in the euro zone advanced slightly during the 
first half of the year, due, among other things, to the 
ongoing post-pandemic recovery and fewer supply 
chain disruptions."
"However, output then declined mar-
ginally during the second half of the year, with the 
result that the economy in the euro zone recorded 
growth of only 0.5% for 2023 as a whole."
"Following the end of the zero-COVID policy in China, 
the Chinese economy started the year with a strong 
recovery that it was unable to maintain."
"The recovery 
was ultimately curbed by the pronounced weakness of 
the Chinese real estate sector and the associated crisis 
of confidence among consumers."
"Unlike the case in the 
United States and Europe, the Chinese economy was 
faced with slight deflationary tendencies — consumer 
prices rose by only 0.2% in the country for the year as a 
whole."
"Development of exchange rates 
Exchange rates were volatile in this environment."
"Against the US dollar, the euro moved between USD 
1.05 and USD 1.13 in the course of the year."
"At the end of 
2023, the euro was around 3% stronger than at the end 
of 2022."
"The range of fluctuation of the Chinese ren-
minbi against the euro was 7.2 to 8.1."
"Year-on-year, the 
value of the euro increased by around 6% against the 
renminbi."
"Energy and raw material prices
Prices for oil and gas declined significantly from their 
record levels in 2022, but they remained very volatile 
nevertheless."
"The oil price fell below USD 80 per barrel 
at the end of the year, which was almost 9% lower than 
at the end of 2022."
"The average price for the year as a 
whole was about 17% lower than in the previous year."
Gas prices in Europe also fell noticeably.
"The price at 
the end of the year — approximately €32 — was almost 
60% lower than the price at the end of 2022 but still 
higher than the price before the pandemic."
"Prices for 
industrial raw materials also tended to decrease further 
over the year and at the end of the year were a little 
less than 3% below the prices recorded at the end of 
2022."
"Automotive markets 
 
The economic conditions described above also affected 
the development of the global automotive market in the 
year under review."
"Nevertheless, sales markets were 
able to partially buck the trend of the overall economic 
slowdown."
"In particular, the normalization of global 
vehicle production, as well as the order backlog that 
still existed in some cases in the aftermath of the pan-
demic, boosted the development of sales last year."
"Customer demand, in contrast, weakened in many auto-
motive markets throughout the year."
"Against this background, the global car market volume 
overall was significantly higher than in the previous 
year."
"Several different regions contributed to this global 
increase in volume."
"The European market recovered 
noticeably, with market volume increasing significantly 
by 14% from the low level recorded in the prior year."
"The US market for light vehicles also registered 
significant growth of 12% compared to the previous 
year, while the Chinese market recorded a slight 
increase of approximately 6%."
"The factors mentioned above also affected the develop-
ment of key van sales markets."
"In Europe, the com-
bined segment for mid-size and large vans, as well as 
the segment for small vans, recorded a significant 
increase."
"The US market for large vans also increased 
significantly in volume compared to the previous year."
"Sales figures for mid-size vans in China were also signif-
icantly higher than in the previous year, although 
growth in that market was largely a result of the intro-
duction of new vehicle models by relevant competitors."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars

"1 	 WLTP: combined energy consumption: 20.7–19.3 kWh/100 km; combined CO2 emissions: 
0 g/km; CO2 class: A."
"At 279,400 units, sales in Europe (European Union, 
United Kingdom, Switzerland and Norway) were signifi-
cantly above the prior-year level (2022: 259,400)."
"Unit 
sales in Germany amounted to 114,000 vehicles (2022: 
113,200)."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans also set a new sales 
record in the United States with unit sales of 75,100 
vehicles (2022: 66,400)."
"In China, unit sales totalled 
33,400 vehicles (2022: 34,200)."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility
The Mercedes-Benz Mobility division had a contract vol-
ume of €135.0 billion — slightly above the previous 
year’s figure — at the end of 2023 (31 December 2022: 
€132.4 billion, +2%; +4% after adjusting for exchange-
rate effects)."
"The figure for contract volume shows the 
total monetary amount of all leasing and financing con-
tracts on a certain date."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility concluded 1.4 million new 
financing and leasing contracts worth a total of 
€62.0 billion in the course of 2023."
"The total value of all 
new contracts was thus slightly higher than in the prior 
year (31 December 2022: €58.0 billion, +7%; +10% after 
adjusting for exchange-rate effects)."
"The main reason 
for the positive development was the higher average 
financing and leasing volume per contract, driven by 
improved pricing on the sales side and a higher propor-
tion of electrified and Top-End vehicles in the new busi-
ness."
"In the German market, new business was roughly on a 
par with the previous year at €10.4 billion (+2%)."
Contract volume amounted to €24.5 billion (-3%).
"The 
US market benefited from a higher average financing 
and leasing volume per contract and a significant 
increase in the penetration rate."
"The penetration rate 
indicates the proportion of leased and financed vehi-
cles in the Group’s unit sales."
"At €16.2 billion (+25%), 
the volume of new business at the end of 2023 was 
considerably higher than the figure recorded in the prior 
year."
"At €35.7 billion, contract volume at the end of 
December 2023 was slightly higher than at the end of 
2022 (+3%)."
"In China, on the other hand, increased 
competition in the financial services sector caused new 
business to decrease by 18% compared to the prior year 
to €9.8 billion."
"At €16.7 billion, contract volume was also 
significantly lower than in the previous year (-15%)."
"New 
business in other markets totalled €25.6 billion (+11%), 
while contract volume amounted to €58.1 billion (+10%)."
"Order situation
Incoming orders at Mercedes-Benz Cars at the end of 
2023 were at the same level as in 2022."
"The new 
E-Class in particular made a positive contribution to the 
order situation."
"The volume of incoming orders at Mercedes-Benz Vans 
at the end of 2023 was lower than in the previous year; 
this was due in particular to the overall economic situa-
tion."
"The order situation is thus at a normal level after 
several previous years that were marked by positive 
one-off effects."
"In 2023, investments in property, plant and equipment 
at Mercedes-Benz Cars focused on production prepa-
rations and the initial introductions of the MMA and 
MB.EA platforms."
"Considerable funds were also 
invested in the expansion of our battery production 
facilities."
"At €3.3 billion, investments in property, plant 
and equipment in 2023 were at the previous year’s 
level."
"The investments in property, plant and equipment at 
Mercedes-Benz Vans amounted to €0.4 billion in 2023 
(2022: €0.2 billion) and were thus significantly higher 
than in the prior year."
"This was mainly driven by the 
planned transition to an all-electric Mercedes-Benz van 
fleet and investments for the transformation of produc-
tion operations."
"Research and development
Research and development expenditure at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group amounted to €10.0 billion in 
2023 (2022: €8.5 billion), higher than in the previous 
year."
"€3.8 billion (2022: €2.9 billion) of the research and 
development costs were capitalized, representing a 
capitalization rate of 38% (2022: 34%)."
"Expenditure here focused mainly on the 
development of the new platform generations, which 
are designed for electromobility."
"In addition, the com-
pany intensified its research and development expendi-
ture on digitalization and automated driving."
"Research and development expenditure at  
Mercedes-Benz Vans amounted to €0.9 billion in 2023 
(2022: €0.6 billion), which was significantly higher than 
in the previous year."
"Activities relating to the planned 
electrification of the van fleet played a major role in 
2023."
"This was mostly due to the new eSprinter and  
the all-electric, modular and scalable van architecture 
(VAN.EA)."
"The industrial 
business comprises the automotive segments 
Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans."
"The 
effects from intra-Group eliminations between the 
industrial business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility, as well 
as items at the corporate level, are generally allocated 
to the industrial business."
"In justified individual cases, 
effects on the profitability, liquidity and capital 
resources, and financial position of the corresponding 
segment are presented from an economic rather than a 
legal perspective."
"In order to provide a more transparent presentation of 
the ongoing business, adjusted figures are also calcu-
lated and reported for both the Group and the seg-
ments."
"The adjustments generally include individual 
items insofar as they lead to material effects in a 
reporting year."
"These individual items can relate in 
particular to legal proceedings and related measures, 
restructuring measures and M&A transactions."
"Further 
information on the performance measurement system 
can be found in the Corporate Profile chapter."
"Profitability
Consolidated Statement of Income 
In 2023, the revenue amounted to €153.2 billion (2022: 
€150.0 billion) and was thus slightly higher than in the 
prior-year."
"The increase was primarily due to higher unit 
sales and improved pricing at the Mercedes-Benz Vans 
segment."
"Revenue in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment 
was also higher, primarily due to a further improvement 
in pricing."
"Negative exchange-rate effects caused reve-
nue to decline."
"Cost of sales amounted to €118.8 billion (2022: 
€116.0 billion) in 2023, increased by 2.4% compared 
with the previous year."
"The increase was mainly due  
to expenses to suppliers because of additional costs 
relating to inflation and supply chains."
"Moreover, refinancing costs 
at Mercedes-Benz Mobility rose due to higher interest 
rates."
"In the prior year, cost of sales was negatively 
impacted by expenses in connection with the discon-
tinuation of the business activities in Russia."
"Overall, gross profit in relation to revenue increased 
from €34.0 billion to €34.4 billion."
"Selling expenses increased by €0.2 billion to €9.7 bil-
lion."
"As a proportion of revenue, selling expenses 
remained unchanged at 6.3%."
"In the past year, general administrative expenses 
increased by €0.1 billion to €2.7 billion."
"As a proportion 
of revenue, general administrative expenses increased 
from 1.7% to 1.8%."
"Research and non-capitalized development costs of 
€6.2 billion in 2023 were above the prior-year level 
(2022: €5.6 billion)."
"The increase was mainly due to 
higher expenses in connection with advance expendi-
ture for the renewal of existing models and the further 
development of fuel-efficient and environmentally 
friendly drive systems as well as the digital connectivity 
of the products."
"As a proportion of revenue, research 
and non-capitalized development costs increased from 
3.7% to 4.1%."
"Further information on this topic is pro-
vided in the Investment and research activities chapter 
of this Combined Management Report."
"Other operating income of €1.7 billion (2022: €2.0 bil-
lion) was below the level of the prior year."
"The figure 
included expenses in the amount of €0.2 billion in con-
nection with the discontinuation of business activities 
in Russia."
"The prior-year earnings included total income 
of €0.9 billion in connection with the restructuring of 
the sales activities in Canada and the change in the 
shareholding structure of the motorsport business."
"By 
contrast, other operating income in the prior year was 
impaired by the result attributable to the spin-off and 
hive-down of assets and liabilities of the Daimler com-
mercial vehicles business of the Mercedes-Benz Mobil-
ity segment."
"The resulting loss (before deduction of 
transaction costs) amounted to €0.2 billion."
"In 2023, the gains/losses on equity-method invest-
ments amounted to €2.1 billion (2022: €1.7 billion) and 
were thus above the prior-year level."
"The positive 
development was mainly due to the higher proportion-
ate earning of the investment in Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG."
"In financial year 2023, earnings totalled 
€0.8 billion (2022: €0.2 billion)."
"In addition to higher 
current earnings, the increase compared to the previ-
ous year is partly due to lower negative adjustments at 
the Group from an investor’s perspective."
"In 2022, the 
earnings included income of €59 million from the con-
tribution of approximately 5% of the shares in Daimler 
Truck to the Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust."
"In contrast, 
the result of Beijing Automotive Co., Ltd."
"decreased to 
€1.5 billion (2022: €1.7 billion)."
"The other financial income/expense was below the 
previous year’s level at €0.1 billion (2022: €0.3 billion), 
mainly due to higher expenses from the discounting of 
non-current provisions."
"Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) amounted 
to €19.7 billion in 2023, which is slightly lower than in 
the previous year (2022: €20.5 billion)."
"Due to the global increase in interest rates, net interest 
income/expense improved to an income of €0.4 billion 
(2022: expense of €0.2 billion) in 2023."
"The tax expense of €5.6 billion (2022: €5.5 billion) 
remained at the prior-year level."
"The effective tax rate 
for the reporting year was 27.6% (2022: 27.1%)."
Net profit was thus €14.5 billion (2022: €14.8 billion).
"Net profit of €0.3 billion is attributable to non-con-
trolling interests (2022: €0.3 billion)."
"The net profit 
attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG amounted to €14.3 billion (2022: €14.5 bil-
lion), leading to a decrease in earnings per share to 
€13.46 (2022: €13.55)."
"The calculation of earnings per 
share is based on an average number of 1,059.6 million 
issued shares (2022: 1,069.8 million issued shares)."
"The 
decrease in the weighted average number of shares in 
circulation is due to the share buyback programme 
resolved by the Board of Management on 16 February 
2023."
"Further information on the individual items of the Con-
solidated Statement of Income is provided in Notes 4 ff."
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
"With a revenue of €112,756 million (2022: 
€111,601 million), the adjusted return on sales of 12.6% 
was lower than the adjusted prior-year figure of 14.6%."
"Improved pricing and lower raw material prices had a 
positive impact on gross profit."
"On the other hand, 
gross profit was impacted by expenses paid to suppli-
ers due to additional costs relating to inflation and sup-
ply chains over the course of the year."
"In addition, 
exchange-rate effects had a negative impact on earn-
ings."
"Gross profit in relation to revenue decreased from 
23.9% to 23.4% as a result."
"Other functional costs 
increased in 2023."
"This was mainly due to advance 
expenditure for the renewal of existing models and the 
further development of fuel-efficient and environmen-
tally friendly drive systems as well as the digital con-
nectivity of the products."
"In addition, increased 
expenses from the discounting of non-current provi-
sions as well as lower equity-method gains of the stake 
in Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd."
"contributed to a 
decrease in earnings."
"Adjusted EBIT was slightly higher than EBIT in the year 
2023."
"Effects from ongoing regulatory and legal pro-
ceedings and measures relating to Mercedes-Benz die-
sel vehicles of €94 million (2022: €110 million) nega-
tively impacted the segment’s earnings."
"Earnings in 
connection with the discontinuation of the business 
activities in Russia in the amount of €66 million (2022: 
expense of €658 million) had a positive impact."
"In addi-
tion, in the prior year, M&A transactions in the amount 
of €863 million had a positive effect on the profit due 
to the €478 million from the restructuring of the sales 
activities in Canada and the €385 million from the 
change in the shareholding structure of the motorsport 
business."
"The Mercedes-Benz Vans segment achieved an EBIT of 
€3,138 million (2022: €1,897 million); adjusted EBIT was 
€3,063 million (2022: €1,927 million)."
"With a revenue  
of €20,288 million (2022: €17,217 million), the adjusted 
return on sales of 15.1% was higher than the adjusted 
prior-year figure of 11.2%."
"The substantial rise in unit sales as well as improved 
pricing had a very positive impact on gross profit."
"How-
ever, the result was impacted by higher material costs 
and expenses for higher transportation costs to global 
sales markets."
"Furthermore, earnings reflected the 
highly inflationary macroeconomic situation, particu-
larly the hyperinflation in Argentina."
"Overall, gross profit 
in relation to revenue increased from 21.3% to 24.6%."
"Other functional costs were slightly above the level of 
the previous year."
"Adjusted EBIT was slightly lower than EBIT in the year 
2023."
"Effects in connection with ongoing governmental 
and court proceedings and measures taken relating  
to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles led to an impact in 
the amount of €70 million (2022: expense of €15 mil-
lion) on earnings."
"In addition, income in the amount of 
€5 million (2022: expense of €51 million) resulted in 
connection with the discontinuation of business activi-
ties in Russia."
"In the prior year, M&A transactions in 
connection with the restructuring of the sales activities 
in Canada contributed €36 million to earnings."
"In 2023, EBIT of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment 
amounted to €1,302 million (2022: €2,428 million); 
adjusted EBIT was €1,695 million (2022: €2,428 million)."
"Revenue amounted to €26,718 million (2022: 
€26,954 million)."
"Adjusted return on equity of 12.3% was 
below the adjusted prior-year figure of 16.8%."
"The main reasons for the development of EBIT in 2023 
were an decreased interest margin due to higher inter-
est rates and increased competition in the financial  
services sector."
"Falling used car prices reduced Athlon’s 
remarketing result."
"Exchange-rate effects and expenses 
for the expansion of the charging activities also reduced 
EBIT."
"The equity-method gains of the mobility invest-
ments improved due to a better operating business 
result and restructuring measures."
"Despite a challeng-
ing macroeconomic environment, credit risk costs were 
slightly below the previous year’s level."
"In 2023, items at the corporate level resulted in earn-
ings of €858 million (2022: expense of €225 million)."
"This includes the positive effect on earnings of 
€797 million (2022: €226 million) from the equi-
ty-method investments in Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"On the other hand, in the previous year, earnings were 
affected by adjustments in connection with the sale  
of individual investments and business activities to 
Daimler Truck (€268 million after subtracting transac-
tion costs)."
"Further information on this is provided  
in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"The elimination of intra-Group transactions resulted in 
earnings of €138 million in 2023 (2022: €18 million)."
Adjusted EBIT in 2023 was above the reported EBIT.
"Expenses of €276 million in connection with the discon-
tinuation of the business activities in Russia had a neg-
ative effect on earnings."
"In addition, the equity-method 
gains/losses were negatively impacted by an impair-
ment (€117 million)."
The adjusted return on equity is determined as the ratio of adjusted EBIT to the average equity of the quarters.
"The cost of capital used in the calculation of value 
added is based on average net assets multiplied by the 
cost of capital rate."
"The ratio of earnings to net assets 
results in the profitability of net assets, i.e."
"the return 
on capital employed (return on net assets, RONA)."
"The measure of earnings for the segments is EBIT and 
for the Group is net operating profit, which in addition 
to the EBIT of the segments also includes earnings 
effects for which the segments are not accountable, 
such as income taxes and other reconciling items."
"The following table shows value added for the 
Mercedes-Benz Group and for the individual segments."
"This was once again significantly higher 
than the Group’s required cost of capital rate of 9% 
(2022: 8%)."
"The value added of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group decreased, mainly due to the negative develop-
ment of EBIT of the segments Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"The €1.3 billion increase in 
average net assets also had a slightly negative effect  
on value added."
"This was partly offset by the positive 
development of EBIT at Mercedes-Benz Vans."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment, value added of 
€8.8 billion was below the prior-year amount of 
€11.8 billion."
RONA amounted to 34.4% (2022: 42.8%).
"This was primarily due to the negative earnings devel-
opment."
"The segment’s average net assets, which at 
€3.2 billion, were higher than in the previous year, 
increased the negative effect on the value added."
"This 
was mainly due to higher average inventories and 
decreasing average provisions for other risks."
"The value added of the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment 
increased significantly from €1.8 billion to €3.0 billion."
RONA amounted to 250.4% (2022: 214.4%).
"This was 
mainly due to the very positive earnings development."
"The average net assets showed an opposing increase to 
€1.3 billion, which was primarily due to increased aver-
age inventories and decreasing average provisions for 
other risks."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment, value added 
amounted to minus €0.5 billion (2022: €0.7 billion)."
"The 
segment’s return on equity was 9.5% (2022: 16.8%)."
"The 
development of the return on equity primarily reflects 
the decrease in earnings."
"By contrast, the decrease in 
average total equity had a slightly positive effect on the 
return on equity."
The following table shows the average net assets.
2 	 To the extent not allocated to the segments.
3	 To the extent not allocated to Mercedes-Benz Mobility.
"The following table shows the derivation of net assets 
on 31 December from the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position."
"Worldwide financial management is per-
formed within the framework of legal requirements con-
sistently for the Group entities by the Treasury depart-
ment of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Financial 
management operates within a framework of guidelines, 
limits and benchmarks, and on the operational level is 
organizationally separate from other financial functions 
such as settlement, financial controlling, reporting and 
accounting."
"Capital structure management designs the capital 
structure of the Group and its subsidiaries."
"Decisions 
regarding the capitalization of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group companies are based on the principles of 
cost-optimized and risk-optimized liquidity and capital 
resources."
"Liquidity management aims to ensure the Group can 
meet its payment obligations at any time."
"For this pur-
pose, the Group records the cash flows from operating 
and financial activities in a rolling plan."
"The resulting 
financial requirements are covered by the use of appro-
priate instruments for liquidity management (e.g."
"bank 
credit, commercial paper and notes); liquidity surpluses 
are invested in the money market or the capital market 
taking into account risk and return expectations."
"Our 
goal is to ensure the level of liquidity regarded as nec-
essary at optimal costs."
"Besides operational liquidity, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group maintains additional sources 
of liquidity which are available in the short term."
"Those 
additional financial resources include a pool of receiva-
bles from the financial services business which are 
available for securitization in the capital market and a 
contractually confirmed syndicated credit facility."
"Since 
December 2021, the Group also has liquidity reserves in 
the form of its shareholding in Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG, which can only be sold with the consent of 
Daimler Truck Holding AG until the end of 2024."
"Con-
sent to the sale is not required in the event of a crisis or 
after December 2024."
"Cash management centrally determines the cash 
requirements and surpluses."
"By means of cash-pooling 
procedures, liquidity is in general centrally concen-
trated on bank accounts of the Mercedes-Benz Group in 
various currencies."
"Most of the payments between 
companies of the Group are made through internal 
clearing accounts so that the number of external cash 
flows is reduced to a minimum."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group has established standardized processes and sys-
tems to manage its bank accounts and internal 
cash-clearing accounts, and to execute automated pay-
ment transactions."
"Management of market-price risks aims to limit the 
impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange-rates and 
interest rates on the earnings of the divisions and the 
Group."
"The Group’s overall exposure to these mar-
ket-price risks is initially determined in order to provide 
a basis for hedging decisions."
"These include the volume 
to be hedged, the period to be hedged and the choice 
of hedging instruments."
"The hedging strategy is speci-
fied at Group level and uniformly implemented."
"The 
decision-making body is the Treasury Risk Management 
Committee, which meets regularly."
"The plan assets are legally sepa-
rated from the Group’s assets and are invested primarily 
in funds; they are not available for general business 
purposes."
"The plan assets are spread across a broad 
range of investment categories such as equities, 
fixed-interest securities, alternative investments and 
real estate, depending on the expected development of 
pension obligations and with the help of risk-return 
optimization."
"The performance of the asset manage-
ment is measured by comparison with defined bench-
mark indices."
"The investment risks are limited via a 
Group-wide policy."
"In addition, there are local regula-
tions for risk management for the individual plan assets."
"Additional information on pension plans and similar 
obligations is provided in Note 22 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The risk volume that is subject to credit risk manage-
ment includes the Mercedes-Benz Group’s worldwide 
creditor positions with financial institutions, issuers of 
securities and customers in the financial services busi-
ness, as well as trade receivables."
"Credit risks with 
financial institutions and issuers of securities arise pri-
marily from investments executed as part of our liquid-
ity management and from the application of derivative 
financial instruments."
"The management of these credit 
risks is mainly based on an internal limit system that 
reflects the creditworthiness of the respective financial 
institution or issuer."
"The credit risk with customers of 
the automotive business results from relationships with 
contracted dealerships and general agencies, other cor-
porate customers and retail customers."
"In connection 
with the export business, general agencies that accord-
ing to the creditworthiness analyses are not sufficiently 
creditworthy are generally required to provide collater-
als such as first-class bank guarantees."
"The credit risk 
with end customers in the financial services business is 
managed by Mercedes-Benz Mobility on the basis of a 
standardized risk-management process."
"In this process, 
minimum requirements are defined for the sales-financ-
ing and leasing business and standards are set for 
credit processes, as well as for the identification, meas-
urement and management of risks."
"Key elements for the 
management of credit risks are appropriate creditwor-
thiness assessments supported by statistical risk-clas-
sification methods, as well as structured portfolio anal-
ysis and portfolio monitoring."
"Financial country risk management includes various 
aspects: the risk from investments in subsidiaries and 
joint ventures, the risk from the cross-border financing 
of Group companies in high-risk countries and the risk 
from direct sales to customers in those countries."
"The 
Group has an internal rating system that assigns the 
countries in which it operates to risk categories."
"Risks 
from cross-border receivables are partially protected 
with the use of letters of credit and bank guarantees in 
favour of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and other Group 
companies."
"In addition, an internal committee sets and 
restricts the level of hard-currency credits granted to 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies in high-risk coun-
tries."
"Further information on the management of market-price 
risk, credit risk and liquidity risk is provided in Note 33 
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The free cash flow of the industrial business is 
derived from the cash flows from operating and invest-
ing activities."
"The following table also shows the recon-
ciliation to the adjusted free cash flow of the industrial 
business."
"On the other hand, effects in con-
nection with the recognition and measurement of right-
of-use assets, which result from lessee accounting and 
are largely non-cash items, are included in the free cash 
flow of the industrial business."
"Other adjustments 
relate to effects from the financing of the Group’s own 
dealerships and effects from internal deposits within 
the Group."
"In addition, the calculation of the free cash 
flow of the industrial business includes the cash flows 
to be shown under cash flow from financing activities in 
connection with the acquisition or disposal of interests 
in subsidiaries without loss of control."
"In 2023, the free cash flow of the industrial business 
amounted to €11.3 billion and was thus higher than the 
previous year’s figure of €8.1 billion."
"The increase in the free cash flow of the industrial busi-
ness by €3.2 billion to €11.3 billion compared to the pre-
vious year is characterized by an improvement in profit 
before income taxes of the industrial business."
"During 
the reporting period, a positive effect resulted from the 
development of the working capital, mainly due to a 
lower inventory build-up and a decrease in the trade 
receivables compared to the previous year."
"A smaller 
increase in trade payables compared to the previous 
year had an opposing effect."
"Another positive effect resulted from a lower 
increase in the number of leased vehicles compared to 
the previous year."
"Moreover, higher dividend payments 
were received during the reporting period from equi-
ty-method investments, in particular Daimler Truck 
Holding AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd."
"Investments in and disposals of shareholdings and 
other business operations resulted in slightly higher 
cash inflows in the reporting period than in the previ-
ous year."
"There was an increase in income taxes paid in compari-
son to the prior year, which resulted from the improve-
ment in earnings before taxes in the industrial business."
"In addition to payments to the tax authorities, income 
tax payments also include intra-Group payments and 
refunds based on contractual arrangements within the 
tax groups."
"A further negative effect on the free cash 
flow of the industrial business resulted from the higher 
investment in intangible assets and capital expenditure 
on property, plant and equipment."
"The adjustments from restructuring 
measures include payments made in connection with 
the personnel-cost-optimization programmes in the 
reporting period."
"The adjustments from M&A transac-
tions encompass the cash inflow from the purchase 
price payment for the sale of shares in Mercedes-Benz 
Grand Prix Ltd."
"(2022: cash inflows from the restructur-
ing of retail activities in Canada, opposing cash out-
flows from investment in Automotive Cells Company 
SE)."
"The adjusted free cash flow of the industrial  
business amounted to a total of €11.7 billion (2022: 
€9.3 billion)."
"Free cash flow of the Mercedes-Benz Group
In 2023, the free cash flow of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group resulted in a cash inflow of €6.7 billion (2022: 
€12.8 billion)."
"The decrease in the free cash flow of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group was mainly due to the higher 
leasing and sales-financing business of Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility compared to the previous year."
"This was offset 
by a year-on-year increase in the free cash flow of the 
industrial business."
"An opposing repay-
ment of the financing liabilities in the same amount 
was recognized in the cash flow from financing activi-
ties of Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"In 2023, there were no 
reclassifications of cash flows between the cash flows 
from investing activities of the industrial business and 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"Cash flow from financing activities of the ­
 
Mercedes-Benz Group
A cash outflow of €8.4 billion (2022: €19.0 billion) 
resulted from the cash flow from financing activities 
(see condensed statement of cash flows) during the 
reporting period."
"The lower cash outflow relative to  
the same period of the prior year is primarily due to  
the significantly lower net refinancing in the prior  
year."
"This was offset during the reporting period by  
the payments of €1.9 billion made in connection with 
the share buyback programme."
"Taking account of 
exchange-rate effects, cash and cash equivalents 
decreased by €1.7 billion since 31 December 2022."
"Total liquidity, which also includes marketable debt 
securities and similar investments, decreased by 
€1.9 billion to €22.8 billion."
"The following table shows the reconciliation from EBIT 
for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans to 
the CFBIT of the corresponding segment."
"The reconcili-
ation from CFBIT to adjusted CFBIT and the adjusted 
cash conversion rate are also shown."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars achieved an adjusted cash conver-
sion rate of 0.9 (2022: 0.7) and Mercedes-Benz Vans an 
adjusted cash conversion rate of 1.0 (2022: 1.1)."
"As well as being calculated on the basis of the dis-
closed cash flows from operating and investing activi-
ties, the free cash flow of the industrial business can 
also be calculated on the basis of the cash flows before 
interest and taxes (CFBIT) of the automotive segments."
"The reconciliation from the CFBIT of the automotive 
segments to the free cash flow of the industrial busi-
ness includes the sum of receipts and payments of 
taxes and interest of the industrial business."
"The other 
reconciling items primarily comprise eliminations 
between the segments and items that are allocated to 
the industrial business but for which the automotive 
segments are not responsible."
"The year-on-year 
increase was mainly due to the dividend of Daimler 
Truck Holding AG, which was included in the other rec-
onciliation items in the reporting period."
"Since 31 December 2022, the net liquidity of the indus-
trial business increased by €5.0 billion to €31.7 billion."
"The increase is mainly due to the positive free cash flow 
of the industrial business, which was partially offset by 
the dividend payment made to the shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"Net debt at Group level, which primarily results from 
refinancing the leasing and sales-financing business, 
decreased compared with 31 December 2022 by 
€1.5 billion to €86.6 billion."
"The derivation of net debt is 
shown in the following table."
"The 
decrease is mainly a result of discontinuing the busi-
ness activities in Russia and the disposal of the contin-
gent liabilities upon completion of the transaction."
"In the context of its ordinary business activities, the 
Group has also entered into other financial obliga-
tions in addition to the liabilities shown in the Consoli-
dated Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 
2023."
"These financial obligations result from contrac-
tual commitments to acquire intangible assets; prop-
erty, plant and equipment; equipment on operating 
leases and irrevocable loan commitments."
"Detailed information on contingent liabilities and other 
financial obligations is provided in Note 31 of the Notes 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Refinancing 
The funds raised by the Mercedes-Benz Group in the 
year 2023 primarily served to refinance the leasing and 
sales-financing business."
"For that purpose, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group made use of a broad spectrum of 
various financing instruments in various currencies and 
markets."
"They include bank loans, commercial paper in 
the money market, bonds, promissory-note loans and 
the securitization of receivables in the financial services 
business (asset-backed securities)."
"Various issuance programmes are available for raising 
longer-term funds in the capital market."
"They include 
the Euro Medium Term Note programme (EMTN) with a 
total volume of €70 billion, under which Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and several subsidiaries can issue bonds in 
various currencies."
"Other local capital-market pro-
grammes exist, which are significantly smaller than the 
EMTN programme."
"Capital-market programmes allow 
flexible, repeated access to the capital markets."
"The situation in the bond markets in the reporting year 
was significantly influenced by factors such as inflation 
and the volatility of interest rates as well as decisions 
by central bank."
"In the reporting period, the Group covered its refinanc-
ing requirements through the issuance of bonds and 
other means."
"As can be seen in the following table they 
include so-called benchmark issuances (bonds with a 
high nominal volume) by Mercedes-Benz Finance North 
America LLC in the US-dollar area and Mercedes-Benz 
International Finance B.V."
"In the reporting period, asset-backed securities (ABS) 
transactions with a volume of €1.4 billion were carried 
out successfully in Germany."
"ABS transactions with a 
total volume of CNY 17.4 billion were carried out in 
China."
"In the United States the asset-back securities 
credit line with a volume of USD 4.0 billion was 
extended and further ABS transactions of USD 3.5 bil-
lion were placed."
"Bank credit was another important source of refinanc-
ing in 2023."
"These loans were provided by globally 
active banks as well as by banks operating nationally."
"The syndicated credit line in the amount of €11 billion 
in existence since July 2018 had not been utilized as of 
the balance sheet date."
"The carrying amounts of the main refinancing instru-
ments and the volume-weighted average interest rates 
are shown in the following table."
"At 31 December 2023, these carrying amounts are 
mainly denominated in the following currencies: 42% in 
euros, 28% in US dollars and 13% in Chinese renminbi."
"At 31 December 2023, the total of financing liabilities 
shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Posi-
tion amounted to €108.6 billion (2022: €111.8 billion)."

"Note 33 of the Notes to the Con-

"In 
the course of the year, all five agencies raised the long-
term credit ratings for the Group by one notch."
"Four of 
them also raised their short-term credit ratings by one 
notch at the same time."
"At the same time, Moody’s raised its short-
term rating from P-2 to P-1."
"With this upgrade, Moody’s 
recognized Mercedes-Benz Group’s improved margins 
over the past two years, the company’s strategy of 
focusing on higher margin premium and luxury vehicles 
while transforming its product portfolio to all-electric 
vehicles and its reduced financial indebtedness."
"S&P Global Ratings (S&P) raised the long-term corpo-
rate rating of Mercedes-Benz Group AG from A- to A 
with stable outlook on 5 May 2023."
"The short-term rat-
ing was also raised, from A-2 to A-1."
"S&P considers the 
Mercedes-Benz Group’s cash flow generation to be the 
best in its class among the traditional automakers."
"S&P 
also considers that the Group will continue to success-
fully manage the pricing, the model mix, the costs and 
the investments in the event of weaker conditions for 
the sector."
"After the conclusion of the rating review, S&P 
confirmed the long-term and short-term ratings for the 
Mercedes-Benz Group according to the new criteria for 
issuers with captive financial services businesses on 
23 November 2023."
"On 27 July 2023, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) raised the long-
term issuer rating for Mercedes-Benz Group AG from A- 
to A with a stable outlook."
"At the same time, the short-
term rating was raised from F1 to F1+."
"On 16 November 2023, the Canadian agency DBRS 
Morningstar (DBRS) raised the long-term rating of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries incorpo-
rated in the rating from A (low) to A with a stable out-
look."
"At the same time, the corresponding short-term 
rating was confirmed as R-1 (low)."
"DBRS explained this 
assessment with the continuing solid development of 
the company’s earnings regardless of various significant 
headwinds, including interest rate and inflationary pres-
sures, geopolitical uncertainty and continuing supply 
chain bottlenecks."
"On 23 December 2023, the European rating agency 
Scope Ratings (Scope) upgraded the long-term issuer 
rating of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its financing 
companies included in the rating from A to A+ with a 
stable outlook and concurrently increased the short-
term rating from S-1 to S-1+."
"Scope justified this 
upgrade with the Group’s improved business risk profile, 
which can be attributed to structurally higher operating 
profitability through the strategic shift into the luxury 
space and the continuous streamlining of the fixed cost 
base."
"Current liabilities 
accounted for 31% of the balance sheet total, which is 
below the prior-year level of 34%."
"During the reporting 
year, all intra-Group eliminations between the industrial 
business and Mercedes-Benz Mobility regarding the 
balance sheet were allocated to the industrial business."
"The reported size of the industrial business is deter-
mined by generally subtracting the unconsolidated bal-
ance sheet total of Mercedes-Benz Mobility from the 
consolidated balance sheet total of the Group."
"Conse-
quently, intra-Group matters relating to the relationship 
between the industrial business and Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility are generally allocated to Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility and included in its balance sheet."
"This method 
of presentation reduces the balance sheet total of the 
industrial business."
"At the same time, this means that 
the share of Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s balance sheet 
total in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Posi-
tion is shown as being higher than would be the case if 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility were presented on a consoli-
dated basis."
"Assets
The intangible assets of €17.6 billion (2022: €15.9 bil-
lion) particularly include €15.1 billion of capitalized 
development costs (2022: €13.5 billion)."
"Of the devel-
opment costs, a share of €14.0 billion (2022: €12.6 bil-
lion) was attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars seg-
ment and €1.1 billion (2022: €0.8 billion) to the 
Mercedes-Benz Vans segment."
"Development costs cap-
italized in the reporting year amounted to €3.8 billion 
(2022: €2.9 billion) and represent 38% (2022: 34%) of 
the Group’s total research and development expendi-
ture."
"The increase in capitalized development costs is 
mainly attributable to development work for the new 
platform generations geared towards electric mobility."
"Property, plant and equipment decreased to  
€26.1 billion (2022: €27.3 billion)."
"The increase adjusted for cur-
rency translation effects was €5.8 billion."
"At 49%, the 
leasing and sales-financing business as a proportion of 
total assets was at prior year level."
"Equity-method investments decreased to €13.1 billion 
(2022: €13.5 billion)."
"Investments accounted for using 
the equity method comprise in particular the carrying 
amounts of our investments in Daimler Truck Hold-
ing AG and Beijing Benz Automotive Co., Ltd."
"Inventories increased from €25.6 billion to €27.3 bil-
lion."
"As a result the share of total assets remains at the 
prior year level of 10%."
"The increase relates in particular 
to finished goods, spare parts and products held for 
resale at €2.2 billion as a result of the introduction of 
the direct sales model in additional markets and model 
year-related production ramp-ups."
"Furthermore, the fin-
ished goods include higher-value vehicles on average."
"At €7.3 billion, trade receivables were lower than the 
prior-year-figure of €8.1 billion."
"Compared to 31 December 2022, cash and cash equiv-
alents decreased by €1.7 billion to €16.0 billion."
"Marketable debt securities and similar investments 
decreased compared with 31 December 2022 from 
€7.1 billion to €6.9 billion as part of the liquidity man-
agement."
"Those assets include the debt instruments 
that are allocated to liquidity, most of which are traded 
in active markets."
"They generally have an external rating 
of A or better."
"Other financial assets of €7.9 billion were at the pri-
or-year level."
"They consist primarily of derivative finan-
cial instruments, equity and debt instruments, shares in 
non-consolidated subsidiaries, and loans and other 
receivables from third parties."
"The other assets of €10.2 billion (2022: €9.9 billion) 
particularly include deferred taxes and tax refund 
claims."
"In connection with the planned disposal of sales com-
panies in other European countries, the Group is show-
ing assets held for sale of €0.8 billion and liabilities 
held for sale of €0.2 billion as of 31 December 2023."
"Equity and liabilities
Compared to 31 December 2022, the Group’s equity 
increased from €86.5 billion to €92.8 billion, mainly as a 
result of the positive earnings development."
"Addition-
ally gains of €0.5 billion are recognized directly in equity 
from the measurement of derivative financial instru-
ments after tax."
"An opposing effect arose from the divi-
dend of €5.6 billion paid to the shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the aquisition of treasury 
shares of €2.3 billion as part of the share buyback pro-
gramme."
"Equity attributable to the shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG increased accordingly to 
€91.8 billion (2022: €85.4 billion)."
"Whereas the balance sheet total remained at the pri-
or-year level, equity increased by 7% compared with the 
previous year."
"The Group’s equity ratio of 35.3% was 
accordingly above the level at the end of 2022 (31.1%); 
the equity ratio for the industrial business was 67.6% 
(2022: 57.4%)."
"It is necessary to take into account the 
fact that the equity ratios at the end of 2022 and 2023 
have been adjusted for the paid and proposed dividend 
payments respectively."
"At 6%, they were also below 
the prior-year level of 7% of the balance sheet total."
"The 
decrease is mainly due to lower provisions for liability 
and litigation risks and regulatory proceedings."
"Financing liabilities of €108.6 billion were below the 
€111.8 billion of the previous year."
"The decrease was 
due to the lower net refinancing as a result of the posi-
tive cash flow situation."
"The financing liabilities break 
down to 51% bonds, 23% liabilities to financial institu-
tions, 14% liabilities from ABS transactions and 5% 
deposits in the direct banking business."
"The decrease 
in deposits from the direct banking business is related 
to the planned discontinuation of the retail deposit 
business by the end of 2024."
"The financing liabilities 
available on 31 December 2023 relate primarily to the 
refinancing requirements of the leasing and sales-fi-
nancing business."
"Trade payables increased compared to 31 December 
2022 from €12.2 billion to €12.8 billion."
"Other financial liabilities amounted to €7.1 billion 
(2022: €7.9 billion)."
"They mainly comprise liabilities from 
residual-value guarantees, from payroll accounting, 
from derivative financial instruments, deposits received, 
and liabilities from accrued interest on financing liabili-
ties."
"The decrease in other financial liabilities is mainly 
attributable to lower liabilities from derivative financial 
instruments, the carrying amount of which declined due 
to interest and exchange-rate developments."
"The contract and refund liabilities of €10.4 billion 
were below the €10.6 billion of the previous year."
"They 
include in particular deferred revenue from service  
and maintenance contracts and extended warranties, 
as well as obligations from sales transactions that are 
within the scope of IFRS 15."
"Other liabilities of €14.6 billion (2022: €13.9 billion) 
primarily include deferred taxes, tax liabilities and pre-
paid expenses."
"The increase was primarily attributable 
to higher deferred tax liabilities."
"They relate to the operating  
assets and ­
liabilities for which the automotive  
segments are responsible."
"In addition to reporting on the Mercedes-
Benz Group, the development of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG in the year 2023 is also described in this  
section."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG is closely linked with 
Mercedes-Benz AG and functions as an operating busi-
ness entity that defines the Group’s strategy."
"It also 
makes strategic decisions for business operations and, 
as the Group’s parent company, ensures the effective-
ness of organizational, legal and compliance-related 
functions throughout the Group."
"The Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG are compiled in accordance with the provi-
sions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the 
provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union 
(EU)."
"This results in some differences with regard to 
recognition and measurement methods, primarily in 
connection with provisions, financial instruments, the 
leasing business and deferred taxes."
"The financial state-
ments can be viewed on the website of the company 
register as well as on the Mercedes-Benz Group web-
site at w group.mercedes-benz.com/investors/reports-
news/annual-reports/2023."
"The economic situation of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
mainly depends on the development of its subsidiaries."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG participates in the operating 
profits and losses of its subsidiaries through dividend 
distributions and profit-and-loss transfers."
"Its eco-
nomic situation therefore corresponds with that of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group, which is described in the chap-
ter Overall Assessment of the Financial Year."
"Net profit or loss is the key performance indicator for 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"Profitability
Net profit amounted to €12.1 billion, which was signifi-
cantly higher than the figure of €8.9 billion recorded in 
the previous year and corresponds to the expected 
range of the previous year’s Outlook chapter."
"The earn-
ings of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in the year under 
review were particularly affected by a higher level of 
financial income."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG generated revenue of 
€1.4 billion, primarily from the provision of services to 
companies of the Group (2022: €1.4 billion)."
"Cost of sales amounted to €1.4 billion (2022: €1.4 bil-
lion) and primarily comprises expenses incurred for the 
services provided to companies of the Group."
"General administrative expenses amounted to 
€0.8 billion (2022: €0.8 billion)."
"Other operating income from the previous 
year included income from the sale of approximately 5% 
of the shares of Daimler Truck Holding AG to Mercedes-
Benz AG and their subsequent transfer to the 
Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust e."
"Financial income increased by €3.8 billion to €15.6 bil-
lion."
"The increase in the financial income with respect 
to the previous year is primarily due to higher income 
from investments in subsidiaries and associated com-
panies."
"This was the result in particular of higher profit 
transfers from subsidiaries, lower impairments of sub-
sidiaries and investments and higher income from asso-
ciated companies."
"Moreover, the rise in interest rates 
led to an increase in financial income."
"The income tax expense amounted to €2.8 billion 
(2022: €2.5 billion)."
"The rise despite a decrease in taxa-
ble operating profit within the tax group is mainly expli-
cable by the last use of tax-loss carryforwards in 2022."
"Non-current assets increased by €0.6 billion to 
€40.6 billion in the course of the year."
"This was due to 
the increase of €0.6 billion in financial assets."
"Receivables, securities and other assets decreased 
compared with 31 December 2022 by €3.7 billion to 
€32.9 billion."
"This is the result of the decrease in receiv-
ables from subsidiaries of €2.7 billion, which in turn was 
caused by lower intra-Group financial receivables."
"In 
addition, the other assets decreased by €0.8 billion, in 
particular due to the maturity of fixed-term deposits."

Equity increased by €4.6 billion to €41.6 billion in the 
reporting year."
"This increase was a result of the net 
profit amounting to €12.1 billion, of which €6.0 billion 
was transferred to retained earnings pursuant to Sec-
tion 58 Subsection 2 of the German Stock Corporation 
Act (AktG)."
"Equity, in contrast, decreased due to the 
dividend payment of €5.6 billion to the shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the ongoing share buy-
back programme."
"The equity ratio as of 31 December 
2023 was 51.8% (31 December 2022: 43.9%)."
"Mercedes-
Benz Group AG held treasury shares of €1.9 billion as of 
31 December 2023."
"Disclosures pursuant to Section 160 
Subsection 1 No."
"2 of the German Stock Corporation Act 
(AktG) are contained in the Annual Financial Statements 
of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in accordance with the 
statutory requirements."
Provisions decreased by €0.5 billion to €2.6 billion.
"This was mainly due to lower provisions for taxes and 
the decrease in provisions for contingent losses result-
ing from derivative financial instruments."
Liabilities decreased by €8.0 billion to €36.2 billion.
"This change is primarily the result of the decrease in  
liabilities to subsidiaries of €7.2 billion, which in turn 
was caused by lower intra-Group financial liabilities."
"In addition, bonds amounting to €0.5 billion were 
redeemed."
"The same 
applies to capital increases and capital repayments 
from subsidiaries being presented in Cash Flow from 
investing activities."
"An offsetting recognition of cash 
pooling procedures takes place in Cash Flow from 
financing activities."
"Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €7.5 billion 
to €6.6 billion."
"The decrease in cash and cash equiva-
lents of €0.9 billion was influenced by the following 
developments: 
Cash flow from operating activities resulted in a net 
cash outflow of €0.7 billion in the reporting year (2022: 
€1.9 billion)."
"The cash outflow primarily resulted from 
income tax payments, which increased by €0.9 billion 
compared to the previous year."
"The lower cash outflow 
relative to the preceding year can mainly be attributed 
to the maturity of short-term time deposits and higher 
distributions to subsidiaries and associated companies."
"On the one hand, the change was due to 
lower net cash inflows from the acquisition and dis-
posal of securities within the context of liquidity man-
agement (2023: €0.1 billion; 2022: €1.1 billion)."
"On the 
other, capital repayments from subsidiaries resulted in 
higher cash inflows in the previous year."
"Cash flow from financing activities resulted in a cash 
outflow of €0.1 billion in the reporting period (2022: 
€1.3 billion)."
"The decreasing cash outflow compared to 
the previous year was mainly due to the lower repay-
ment of external financing liabilities."
"However, a lower 
cash inflow compared to the previous year resulted 
from the financing provided to subsidiaries in connec-
tion with central financial and liquidity management."
"Alongside this, the cash outflows increased as a result 
of the share buyback transactions in the reporting year 
as well as the dividend payment to shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"Outlook
The financial position, cash flows and profitability of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG depend on the business 
developments and the performance of its operating 
subsidiaries, in whose development it participates 
through profit-and-loss transfer agreements and divi-
dend distributions."
"Due to the interrelations between Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the companies of the Group, the state-
ments in the Outlook chapter therefore reflect our 
expectations for the parent company as well."
"For the year 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG expects to 
post a significantly higher net profit than for the year 
2023, primarily as a result of significantly improved 
financial income to be brought about by higher profit 
transfers from major subsidiaries."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG generally participates in the 
risks of its subsidiaries and associated companies in 
line with the percentage of its respective equity inter-
est."
"The risks and opportunities are described in the 
Risk and Opportunity Report."
"Furthermore, pursuant to Section 133 Subsections 1 and 
3 of the German Transformation Act (UmwG), Mercedes-
Benz Group AG is jointly and severally liable for liabili-
ties of €4.7 billion that were transferred to Mercedes-
Benz AG and Daimler Truck AG in 2019."
"According to the 
current appraisal, due to the assessment of the credit 
ratings of Mercedes-Benz AG and Daimler Truck AG, an 
actual cash outflow for Mercedes-Benz Group AG is 
considered to be unlikely."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
publishes the Non-Financial Declaration in accordance 
with the provisions of Sections 315b, 315c in connection 
with Sections 289b–289e of the German Commercial 
Code (HGB)."
"The Non-Financial Declaration contains the 
main information on the aspects of environmental, 
employee and social issues, combating corruption and 
bribery, and respect for human rights."
"The information 
provided in this declaration is presented in conformity 
with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initia-
tive, insofar as this complies with applicable law."
"Some 
aspects are presented in accordance with internal 
guidelines and definitions."
"Insofar as not otherwise 
specified, all information concerning the Mercedes-
Benz Group refers to the Consolidated Group in the 
context of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"1	 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are created or any resulting  
CO2 emissions are offset by certified compensation projects."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group integrates the Non-Financial 
Declaration into the Combined Management Report of 
this Annual Report."
"Each year, it examines whether and 
how the integration of financial and non-financial key 
figures should be further developed."
"For the year under 
review, it was decided to continue to publish more 
in-depth information about sustainability at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group in a separate Sustainability 
Report for the previous reporting year."
"It will be availa-
ble on the Group’s website on the Internet (additional 
information w group.mercedes-benz.com/sustainabil-

"Further information on the business model of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group can be found in the chapter Cor-
porate Profile."
"Sustainability as a driver of change 
The Mercedes-Benz Group aims to create value that is 
sustainable — economically, environmentally and 
socially."
This is one of the core principles of the Group.
"It applies not only to the Group’s own products and 
production sites but also to its entire upstream and 
downstream value chain."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
translates this approach into its sustainable business 
strategy and thus firmly embeds its sustainability issues 
into its daily business."
"Among other things, the goal is 
to fulfil the demands and expectations of the stake-
holders — i.e."
"customers, investors, employees, busi-
ness partners, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) 
and society as a whole."
"One of the most important goals at the Mercedes-Benz 
Group is decarbonization, which the Group has made a 
firm component of its sustainable business strategy."
"The Group’s strategy includes the Ambition 2039 target, 
which aims to make the entire Mercedes-Benz new 
vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral1 across all stages of the 
value chain by 2039."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans are creating the necessary condi-
tions to become all-electric."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans are getting ready to be able to meet the various 
customer requirements, be it an all-electric drivetrain or 
an combustion engine — into the 2030s if necessary."
"Areas of action and the foundations of sustainability 
The Mercedes-Benz Group acts in line with the sustain-
able business strategy adopted by the Board of  
Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG in 2019 with 
the agreement of the Supervisory Board."
"Sustainability 
issues are an integral part of the business strategy."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group’s sustainable business strat-
egy takes into account the regulatory requirements that 
are relevant to its business operations, as well as rec-
ognized international frameworks, the expectations of 
external and internal stakeholders, and global trends."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also conducts materiality 
assessments on a regular basis in order to identify stra-
tegic areas of action."
"Here the Mercedes-Benz Group 
bases its activities on the United Nation’s (UN) 17 Sus-
tainable Development Goals (SDGs) — especially SDGs 
8 and 9 and 11 to 13 — among other factors, and in the 
process concentrates on the areas where it can create 
value added."
"It discusses the material areas of action 
with the involvement of relevant stakeholder groups."
"During the year under review, the Group confirmed the 
six strategic areas of action shown below and, where 
necessary, further specified the strategic ambitions 
associated with these areas of action."
"–	 
Climate Change mitigation and air quality: Plans 
call for the Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet to be net 
carbon-neutral across the entire value chain by 2039 
and to no longer have any impact on NO2 levels in 
urban areas by 2025."
"–	 
Resource conservation: The Mercedes-Benz Group 
wants to decouple resource consumption from busi-
ness volume growth."
"–	 
More sustainable urban mobility: The Mercedes-
Benz Group wants to contribute to the improvement 
of the quality of life in cities through mobility and 
transport solutions."
"–	 
Traffic safety: The Mercedes-Benz Group is working 
to make its vision of accident-free driving a reality as 
it develops automated driving systems while also tak-
ing social and ethical issues into account."
"–	 
Data responsibility: Customer trust and the respon-
sible handling of customer data are the basis for sus-
tainable digital products and services."
"–	 
Human rights: The Mercedes-Benz Group assumes 
responsibility and is committed to safeguarding 
human rights along its own automotive value chain."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has defined three principles, 
or enablers, that are crucial for achieving success in the 
six areas of action: integrity, people and partnerships."
"Materiality assessment
The Group conducted a comprehensive materiality 
assessment in 2021 in order to determine which sus-
tainability topics are particularly relevant for the 
Mercedes-Benz Group and its stakeholders."
"The analy-
sis was completed in summer 2022 and, following a 
review of the areas of action, is applicable for the year 
2023
This materiality assessment addressed the six strategic 
areas of action as well as further potentially relevant 
sustainability topics and trends."
"A total of 17 topics 
were evaluated, and these were further divided into 
sub-topics."
"In addition, the sustainability issues resulting from the 
analysis were reviewed with regard to their impact on 
financial position, profitability and business develop-
ment."
"On this basis, the topics for the Non-financial 
Declaration were defined."
"For this reason, not all strate-
gic areas of action are reflected in this Non-financial 
Declaration."
"This process shall be supported  
by clear lines of responsibility in the management and 
organizational structures used at all of the divisions."
"At the end of July 2023, the Supervisory Board decided 
to establish at the Board of Management level a 
cross-divisional steering and coordination function for 
sustainability management throughout the Group."
"Renata Jungo Brüngger then took over this function of 
Sustainability Coordinator on 1 August 2023."
"Her execu-
tive division was renamed Integrity, Governance & Sus-
tainability (previously Integrity and Legal)."
"The previous central management body for sustainabil-
ity — the Group Sustainability Board (GSB) — was 
replaced by the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) 
during the year under review."
"This new body meets on a 
quarterly basis and is chaired by Renata Jungo Brüngger 
in her capacity as Sustainability Coordinator."
"The com-
mittee, which is made up of representatives from top 
management, is responsible for the holistic manage-
ment of ESG topics across all functions, divisions and 
regions in line with goals and targets, KPIs and areas of 
responsibility."
"The members of the GSC are also 
responsible for addressing sustainability topics in the 
functions they manage."
"SCMs are conducted 
regularly every 14 days and are chaired by the Sustaina-
bility Competence Office (SCO)."
"The SCO itself provides 
advice to the specialist units and helps them complete 
the tasks assigned to them by the Board of Manage-
ment or the GSC."
"The SCO also monitors the progress 
made in the six areas of action and the three enablers 
defined in the sustainable business strategy."
"The 
results of these analyses during the year are reported 
to the GSC and the Board of Management of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG in the form of detailed scorecards at 
least twice a year."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also uses the ten principles 
of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) as a fundamental 
guide for its business activities."
"As a founding member, 
it is strongly committed to the UN Global Compact."
"Remuneration for the Board of Management and execu-
tives was adjusted in 2023."
"The changes were made in 
order to reduce the complexity of the remuneration 
system, create transparency and ensure an integrated 
approach with regard to the incentives used to promote 
sustainable business operations at the Group."
"In addi-
tion to financial targets, the variable remuneration for 
members of the Board of Management and Level 1–3 
executives, as well as for certain Level 4 managers, 
contains short-term transformation targets relating to 
CO2 emissions, safety innovations and ESG stakeholder 
management."
"The vari-
able remuneration components also continue to include 
non-financial targets relating to customers, employees 
and integrity."
"Sustainability-related risks and opportunities are an 
integral component of the Group-wide risk and oppor-
tunity management system."
"In identifying these risks 
and opportunities, the Mercedes-Benz Group is guided 
by the topics identified by the materiality assessment 
and thus includes the areas of action of the sustainable 
business strategy, for which concrete goals have been 
assigned."
"These risks and opportunities are understood 
to be conditions, events or developments involving ESG 
factors, the occurrence of which may have an actual or 
potential impact on the Mercedes-Benz Group’s profita-
bility, liquidity, capital resources, financial position and 
reputation."
"This further includes any risks and opportu-
nities whose occurrence may have a positive or nega-
tive impact on the economy, the environment or society."
"ESG topics — as they relate to the environment — 
include, among other things, the effects of climate con-
ditions and changes."
"Risks can arise for the Group’s 
transformation process as a result of changed political 
conditions, technological developments and changing 
markets."
"Labour law standards, occupational and prod-
uct safety, product liability and suppliers’ compliance 
with labour law standards are examples of circum-
stances categorized as social issues that can harbour 
risks."
"The area of governance is concerned with matters 
such as stipulations arising from competition law and 
measures to prevent corruption, for example, which can 
lead to risks."
"Risks and opportuni-
ties in connection with the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) are environment factors and are thus also iden-
tified and assessed as part of the risk management pro-
cess."

Sustainable investment
The implementation of the Mercedes-Benz Group’s sus-
tainable business strategy requires massive amounts of 
investment."
"For this reason, one of the Group’s goals is 
to ensure that its securities are viewed even more 
strongly by the capital market as a sustainable invest-
ment."
"To this end, the Mercedes-Benz Group maintains 
a continuous dialogue with players on the capital mar-
ket as representatives of investors in equity and debt."
Various platforms are used here.
"For example, the sec-
ond digital ESG Conference was one of the formats 
used by the Mercedes-Benz Group in the 2023 report-
ing year to provide information to investors and 
analysts on the latest developments relating to its sus-
tainable business strategy."
"With regard to ESG communication, the Investor Rela-
tions & Treasury unit at Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
works closely together with the company’s in-house 
sustainability departments and is also integrated into 
the relevant committees (e.g."
"This is how  
the company is responding to the fact that sustainable 
investment has become a central investment strat-
egy — in particular for institutional investors, who set 
especially high standards of transparency for external 
reporting according to ESG criteria."
"During the year under review, the Group updated its 
Green Finance Framework from 2020 in order to posi-
tion the Mercedes-Benz Group even more effectively as 
a company worthy of sustainable investment and to 
enable it to utilize ESG-based capital for its business 
development."
"This framework makes it possible for the 
Group to finance investment targeted at the develop-
ment, production and customer financing of all-electric 
vehicles through bonds and loans, for example."
"It was 
on this basis that the Mercedes-Benz Group once again 
issued bonds with terms of three and eight years in May 
2023."
"The 
updated framework has also received certification with 
the highest rating — “Dark Green” — from the Centre for 
International Climate and Environmental Research 
(CICERO), which also issued an “Excellent” rating for the 
governance structure defined in the framework."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group operates as an investor itself 
when it invests the company’s pension assets."
"ESG  
criteria are also playing an increasingly important role 
in this area."
"For German pension assets, the following objectives 
have been defined for the consideration of ESG criteria: 
creation of transparency in dealing with sustainability 
aspects, utilization of opportunities from sustainable 
developments and the appropriate consideration of 
sustainability risks."
"For the majority of German pension 
assets the investments are made by asset managers to 
whom the Group issues individual mandates."
"In coordination with the Investment Committees, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group pays, as part of its sustainability 
concept, increased attention to the consideration and 
transparency of sustainability aspects in the investment 
process."
"When the company makes sustainable invest-
ments, it also takes the associated risk and return 
aspects into account."
"For liquid asset classes, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group only works with investment man-
agers who have signed the UN Principles for Responsi-
ble Investment (PRI)."
"The use of a negative list is 
intended to exclude investing in companies and coun-
tries that do not fulfil the Group’s core requirements."
"By 
implementing ESG-themed investments, the Mercedes-
Benz Group utilizes the opportunities offered by sus-
tainable developments."
"Furthermore, the Mercedes-
Benz Group focuses on gradually integrating 
sustainability aspects — via benchmarks or sustainabil-
ity performance indicators, for example — into its man-
dates."
"To this end, the Group included sustainability 
targets in some of its mandates with external asset 
managers in 2023 and also firmly incorporated these 
goals and targets into its investment guidelines."
"Taking 
into account the available data coverage, the Group 
was thus able to achieve a lower carbon footprint for its 
asset classes equities and corporate bonds of the  
German pension assets compared to the aggregated 
benchmark."
"Whereas the aggregated benchmark is 
determined by the indices awarded to the asset manag-
ers, the carbon footprint is calculated based on exter-
nally bought ESG data."
"In addition, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group also established an internal reporting system for 
various sustainability metrics for its German pension 
assets."
"The measures we have implemented as part of our sus-
tainability concept are regularly assessed and adapted 
to current developments."
"Mercedes-Benz Pensions-
fonds AG takes into account adverse effects on sustain-
ability factors within the framework of the Sustainable 
Finance Disclosure Regulation."
"For investing foreign 
pension assets, country-specific requirements regard-
ing consideration of ESG criteria apply."
"Tax obligation 
The Mercedes-Benz Group views itself as a responsible 
company that endeavours to meet all of its global tax 
obligations and use public funding responsibly."
"In this 
way, the Group can also fulfil its social and ethical 
responsibilities."
"–	 
In line with the principle of being a good corporate 
tax citizen (i.e."
"fulfilling its responsibility as a tax-
payer), the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts legal, 
proactive and non-aggressive tax planning activities 
on the basis of operational considerations (“tax  
follows business”)."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also 
strives to work even more cooperatively, transpar-
ently and constructively with the tax authorities."
"In this process, it maintains its legal standpoints  
and defends its interests wherever it believes such 
actions are appropriate and legitimate."
"The tax strategy is regularly reviewed for appro-
priate adjustments."
"The tax policies define the responsibilities, tasks and 
obligations of those individuals in the Group who deal 
with tax issues and also contain specific provisions for 
ensuring that legal requirements are met."
"Management 
is kept informed about relevant tax issues by means of 
monthly reports and regular communications, as well as 
when required."
"The same applies to any 
failure to make corrections to procedures performed in 
an erroneous manner, as outlined in our internally valid 
Treatment of Violations Policy."
"Further information can 
be found in the Integrity and Compliance chapter."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has established a Tax Com-
pliance Management System (Tax CMS) in order to 
ensure effective tax compliance throughout the Group."
"The Tax CMS is a separate sub-unit of the general intra-
Group Compliance Management System."
"The Tax CMS 
also operates an active tax-risk management system 
that is consistently applied throughout the Group in 
order to monitor and check whether tax obligations are 
being fulfilled, and also to support those responsible 
for ensuring such fulfilment."
"Another goal here is to 
identify and reduce tax risks at the Group, and thus the 
associated personal risks that may be faced by the 
employees active in this area."
"The system includes 
numerous measures – for example, continuous moni-
toring of tax risks and the incorporation of tax risk 
issues into the internal control system and the Group-
wide risk management process in line with the compa-
ny’s risk management policy."
"Based on the Code of 
Conduct the Mercedes-Benz Group did not become 
aware of any material violations during the reporting 
year."
"Sustainability in the supply chain
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to the respon-
sible procurement of production materials, non-produc-
tion materials and services."
"The Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustain-
able supply chain management into the Responsible 
Sourcing Standards (RSS)."
"These are contractually stip-
ulated with direct suppliers and are applied worldwide."
"The goal here is to prevent, minimize or, if possible, put 
a stop to any negative effects on human rights world-
wide."
"The RSS define the minimum requirements for 
suppliers."
"They are already used as a basis for the ten-
dering process for suppliers of production materials."
"The RSS require direct suppliers to communicate the 
RSS provisions to their own employees and to their 
direct suppliers, and ensure that the RSS are complied 
with in their business processes and in the areas in 
which they exert an influence."
"Suppliers are to conserve 
natural resources and avoid environmental damage, 
repair any damage that does occur, and compensate for 
such damage that cannot be avoided or repaired."
"Measures in the supply chain
The Mercedes-Benz Group uses a variety of measures 
and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due dili-
gence obligations in the supply chain."
"This includes 
training, preventive and corrective measures, risk analy-
ses, documentation for tracking and reporting purposes 
and effectiveness checks."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
uses these tools in order to increase the transparency 
of the supply chain and ensures that the internationally 
recognized human rights are upheld by business part-
ners as well, and that other social standards and envi-
ronmental requirements are met."
"The procurement 
units for production materials, non-production materi-
als and services play a key role here."
"Further informa-
tion in the chapters Social Compliance and Environ-
mental Issues."
"With regard to supply chains, sus-
pected violations of the Responsible Sourcing Stand-
ards can be reported via the BPO."
"If the misconduct or 
problem falls within the supplier’s area of responsibility, 
the supplier must take measures to immediately correct 
or eliminate the problem."
"Further information about the 
Compliance Programme can be found in the Integrity 
and Compliance chapter."
"It is 
convinced of the goals of the agreement and is working 
to implement them in all of its divisions."
"About one fifth 
of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe are produced 
as a result of the transport of people and goods on 
streets and roads."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is taking 
deliberate measures to counteract this trend and has 
made climate protection a core element of its business 
strategy."
"The Group’s ambition is to make the entire 
Mercedes-Benz new vehicle fleet net carbon-neutral1 
across all stages of the value chain by 2039."
"In order to achieve this goal, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
is transforming the products and services that are at 
the heart of its business activities."
"The company also 
takes into account climate protection in all of the life 
cycle phases of its automobiles — from the supply 
chain and its own manufacturing operations to the use 
and disposal of the vehicles."
"1	 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are created or any resulting  
CO2 emissions are offset by certified compensation projects."
"Climate protection for ­
vehicles 
The Mercedes-Benz Group believes that the complete 
electrification of its product range is the most impor-
tant lever of making its entire new vehicle fleet net car-
bon-neutral across all stages of the value chain by 2039."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is continuing to seek to 
shape the transformation to an all-electric and soft-
ware-driven future."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group remains 
focused and tactically flexible in terms of its strategy."
"Accordingly, the Mercedes-Benz Group has adjusted 
some of its electrification targets and target corridors 
based on market conditions and customer require-
ments."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are tak-
ing the necessary steps to go all-electric."
"The pace of 
transformation is determined by market conditions and 
customers."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans plan to be in a position to cater to different cus-
tomer needs, whether it‘s an all-electric drivetrain or a 
combustion engine, until well into the 2030s."
"Climate 
protection is a key cornerstone of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s sustainable business strategy."
"As early as 
November 2021, the Mercedes-Benz Group under-
scored its commitment to this transformation during 
the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference."
"The Prod-
uct Steering Board (PSB) at Mercedes-Benz Cars is 
responsible for the car fleet."
"In particular, this body 
monitors the development of CO2 emissions of the 
Mercedes-Benz car fleet by comparing them with the 
legally defined targets in markets subject to CO2-emis-
sion regulations."
"The PSB is assigned to the Committee 
for Model Policy and Product Planning (AMP)."
"The Division and Product Strategy unit at Mercedes-
Benz Vans ensures compliance with the CO2 fleet emis-
sion limits and reports on this regularly to the Van Exec-
utive Committee."
"The Committee for Model Policy and Product Planning 
and the Van Executive Committee regularly report to 
the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
about the development of CO2 emissions."
"The Board of 
Management then decides which measures need to be 
implemented."
"On the market side of the equation, price 
and volume control measures can also affect our ability 
to achieve our CO2 targets."
"Electrified product range
The Mercedes-Benz Group’s goal is to further expand its 
range of electric vehicles."
"The Group’s commitment to 
research and development is correspondingly strong."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has been offering all-electric 
vehicles since 2018."
"During the year under review, the 
Group presented the Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV, 
which brought the number of all-electric models in the 
Mercedes-Benz Cars portfolio to nine in 2023."
"Plug-in 
hybrids are also an important transitional technology 
on the road to an all-electric future."
"Customers could 
choose between more than 25 plug-in hybrid model 
variants in the reporting year."
"Electrified vehicles (xEV) at Mercedes-Benz Cars 
accounted for 20% of the Group’s worldwide unit sales 
in the year under review."
"All-electric models (BEVs) 
accounted for 12% of the Group’s worldwide unit sales 
in the year under review."
"In the van segment as well, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
is convinced of the ecological and economic advan-
tages of all-electric vehicles and has firmly anchored its 
claim to leadership in electric mobility in its strategy."
"In 
this way, Mercedes-Benz Vans is also setting the course 
for an all-electric future, and beginning in 2026 all new 
vans are to be developed as all-electric models exclu-
sively."
"All model series have already been systemati-
cally electrified, and today body manufacturers and 
customers can choose an all-electric van in every seg-
ment — for both commercial and private use."
"The mod-
els here include the eVito, the EQV, the eSprinter, the 
eCitan and the EQT."
"(WLTP: combined energy consump-
tion: 20.7–19.3 kWh/100 km; combined CO₂ emissions: 
0g/km; CO2 class: A)."
"Electrified vehicles from Mercedes-Benz Vans 
accounted for 5% of the Group’s worldwide unit sales  
in the year under review."
"Development of CO2 emissions in Europe
The Mercedes-Benz Group has defined the CO2 emis-
sions of its new passenger car fleet in Europe as one of 
its most important non-financial performance indica-
tors."
"Taking 
the vehicles of the joint venture smart Automo-
bile Co., Ltd."
"into account in the Mercedes-Benz CO2 
pool, the average CO2 emissions in Europe (European 
Union, Norway and Island) amounted to 109 g/km 
according to internal calculations."
"This means that the 
CO2-emission figures for the Mercedes-Benz Group 
were significantly below the CO2 targets in Europe in 
2023."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also expects that the 
average CO2 emissions of the Mercedes-Benz fleet in 
Europe (European Union, Norway and Iceland) will be 
further reduced in 2024."
"This development will be 
especially favoured by the fact that the share of total 
car sales accounted for by all-electric and plug-in 
hybrid vehicles will continue to increase."
"Further infor-
mation can be found in the Outlook chapter."
"This means 
that the figures for Mercedes-Benz will be below the 
CO2 target."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group expects that 
increased unit sales of all-electric vehicles will lead to  
a further reduction of CO2 emissions in 2024."
"Development of CO2 emissions in the United States
In the United States, fleet values are regulated by two 
separate federal standards for limiting greenhouse 
gases and fuel consumption in vehicle fleets: the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and the Corporate 
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard."
"For the 2023 
model year, the GHG fleet figure is 170 g CO2/mi for the 
car fleet and 259 g CO2/mi for the light duty truck (LDT) 
fleet (vans and SUVs - based on latest forecast)."
"Due to 
an increase in the share of the total fleet in the United 
States accounted for by electrified vehicles (xEV), the 
Mercedes-Benz Group came in below its average fleet 
target of 179 g CO2/mi for the car fleet."
"The target  
value of 233 g CO2/mi for the light duty truck (LDT) fleet 
(vans and SUVs) could not be reached."
"However, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group was able to offset the remaining 
difference through the purchase of external credits."
1	 Mercedes-benz China Ltd.
"(MBCL) is a joint venture between MB and Lei Shing Hong, 
     which is the importer and general sales company for imported finished vehicles in China."
"2	 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are created or any resulting  
CO2 emissions are offset by certified compensation projects."
"The models of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are subject 
to the GHG regulation for Classes 2b and 3 with a gross 
vehicle weight (GVW) of between 3.86 tons and 6.35 
tons."
"The CO2 targets in these classes depend on the 
payload, the towing capacity and the drive type of the 
vehicles."
"In the reporting year, the CO2 emissions of 
Mercedes-Benz medium duty vehicles (MDV) were 
436 g CO2/mi, which is lower than the target value of 
476 g CO2/mi."
"The Group expects its figures to also be 
lower than the CO2 target values in the years ahead."
"Development of CO2 emissions in China
In China, domestic and imported cars are reported sep-
arately and according to fleet consumption values, 
unlike in Europe and the United States."
"This means the 
figures for the imported fleet are the relevant figures for 
Mercedes-Benz China (MBCL)1, which does not manu-
facture vehicles in the country."
"The target was 
6.95 l/100 km; the figure that was actually achieved was 
8.46 l/100 km taking into account off-cycle technolo-
gies (8.52 l/100 km not taking into account off-cycle 
technologies)."
"MBCL plans to purchase external credits 
in order to close consumption gaps in the fleet’s target 
achievement at short notice."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group implements various projects 
and measures in order to avoid and reduce CO2 emis-
sions in its supply chains for services as well as for pro-
duction and non-production materials."
"This is why in 
the future the Group intends to work only with partners 
that share its view of sustainability with regard to the 
climate, the environment and human rights and has 
also incorporated net carbon neutrality2 into the terms 
of its contracts."
"As early as 2020, Mercedes-Benz Cars 
and Mercedes-Benz Vans sent out to suppliers of pro-
duction materials the ambition letter, which is a decla-
ration of intent regarding net carbon-neutral products."
"Signing the ambition letter is today a key criterion for 
the awarding of contracts."
"As a milestone, for example, contracts 
were signed with two steel suppliers from Europe and 
America in the year under review, which provide for 
deliveries of CO2-reduced steel for current and future 
model series."
"Progress on climate protection in the sup-
ply chain is reported at regular intervals in the Group 
Sustainability Committee (GSC)."
"Resource conservation  
in the supply chain
The supply chain also plays an important role in efforts to 
conserve resources."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to 
decouple resource consumption from economic growth."
"To achieve this goal, it is relying on the support of its sup-
pliers."
"With their help, the Group wants to continuously 
increase the proportion of secondary and renewable 
materials in its vehicles."
"Plastics, steel and aluminium have been identified as par-
ticularly important such materials in Mercedes-Benz vehi-
cles."
"We need large volumes of these materials for the 
production of our vehicles, and their extraction and pro-
cessing also consume large amounts of energy and 
resources."
"Plastics and recyclates: throughout their entire life 
cycles, vehicles from the Mercedes-Benz brand are in 
future to be more environmentally friendly and less 
resource-intensive than before."
"The cornerstones of this 
approach involve the use of recyclates and lightweight 
materials, as well as recyclability."
"Mercedes-Benz Group 
requirement specifications already define a minimum pro-
portion of recycled material for each component in new 
Mercedes-Benz cars."
"This proportion varies depending on 
the vehicle model and series in question."
"As part of its 
sustainable business strategy, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
also relies on the use of natural fibres and textiles as a 
means of replacing conventional plastics with renewable 
raw materials."
"Steel: The use of secondary materials such as steel scrap 
can reduce primary resource requirements in line with a 
circular economy."
"For example, Mercedes-Benz AG and its 
partner therefore ensure the recycling of scrap steel from 
the Mercedes-Benz Cars plant in Sindelfingen, Germany."
"Aluminium: Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans already use recycled materials, including recycled 
aluminium, in numerous series-production vehicles."
"Alu-
minium is a light metal that can be recycled without any 
loss of quality, and the recycling process for aluminium 
uses less energy than would be required to produce new 
aluminium."
"In order to continue increasing its use of recy-
cled materials, Mercedes-Benz AG is working with its sup-
pliers to develop aluminium alloys with high end-of-life 
scrap potential — from old vehicles or packaging, for 
example."
"In addition, by amending existing supply agree-
ments, Mercedes-Benz AG and its suppliers continued to 
work on the decarbonization of the aluminium supply 
chain for all of their production operations in Europe."
"At 
least one third of the primary aluminium that will be used 
for new electric models in Europe is to be produced using 
energy from renewable sources."
"In 2020, secondary material targets were defined for 
Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, and these 
were then firmly incorporated into the requirements for 
contract awards."
"In the reporting year, the Company car-
ried out a model series-specific analysis at component 
level in order to realize further potential for increasing 
secondary materials."
"Project milestones and the status of 
projects with regard to the use of secondary materials are 
presented on a quarterly basis in the executive bodies for 
the various model series."
"With its Responsible Sourcing Standards, the Mercedes-
Benz Group has also defined other environmental require-
ments in its supplier agreements."
"Further information can 
be found in the “Sustainability in the supply chain” section."
"Suppliers of production materials to Mercedes-Benz Cars 
and Mercedes-Benz Vans are expected to operate with an 
environmental management system that is certified 
according to ISO 14001 or EMAS."
"Depending on the spe-
cific risks, this also applies to suppliers of non-production 
materials and services."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans are also 
cooperating with organizations such as CDP (formerly Car-
bon Disclosure Project) so that they can depict the envi-
ronmental impact of their supply chains even more trans-
parently."
"CDP provides the corresponding tools for 
recording, assessing and publishing environmental and 
climate data."

"The Mercedes-Benz Group formulates the holistic goal 
of making the mobility of the future more sustainable in 
its sustainable business strategy."
"One of the most 
important targets is the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group’s goal is to 
achieve carbon-neutral production at its own produc-
tion plants by 2039."
"This is to be achieved by covering 
energy consumption with 100% renewable energies."
"In this way, the Mercedes-Benz Group intends to act in 
accordance with the Paris Agreement on climate 
change."
"As it moves towards achieving this goal, CO2 emissions 
are to be consistently reduced or, wherever possible, 
completely eliminated."
"In order to accomplish this, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group is relying on the purchase of 
green electricity, the expansion of renewable energy 
sources at its locations and the implementation of a 
sustainable heating supply system."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group plans to reduce CO2 emissions at its own plants 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 80% by 2030 compared to 
2018."
"Production at all manufacturing locations oper-
ated by the Mercedes-Benz Group has been net car-
bon-neutral regarding Scope 1 and Scope 2 since 20221."
"Since 2022, all CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) at 
these production facilities that have been as yet una-
voidable have been offset by means of carbon offsets 
from qualified climate protection projects1."
"Remaining 
emissions are released in particular by the combined 
heat and power facilities that use natural gas to pro-
duce electricity and heat."
"For the procurement of green electricity, the Mercedes-
Benz Group in Germany currently relies on a mix of 
solar, wind and hydroelectric power for external elec-
tricity purchases."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is also tak-
ing measures to expand the use of energy from renewa-
ble sources at its locations."
"In 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group already achieved 
the goal of reducing CO2 emissions at its own plants 
(Scope 1 and 2) by 50% by 2030 compared to 2018 (tar-
get confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative, 
an initiative to set science-based climate targets)2."
"During the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans employed various measures that 
enabled them to reduce CO2 emissions in production 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) from 5391 thousand tons in 2022 
to 5111 thousand tons in the year under review3, and 
thus by 5%1."

"The increasing demand for mobility is also leading to an 
increase in the worldwide consumption of resources — 
with effects on the environment and society."
"That’s why 
the goal of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to increasingly 
decouple its consumption of resources from the growth 
of its production volume."
"The consumption of resources in production plays an 
important role in the environmental compatibility of 
vehicles."
"For this reason, the Mercedes-Benz Group is 
working continuously to make production more efficient 
and more environmentally compatible."
"In order to 
improve its environmental footprint in production 
operations, the Group has set reduction targets for 
energy, water and waste at all of its production sites 
worldwide."
"In order to achieve its goals, the Group uses Group-
wide resource management with its environmental and 
energy management systems to ensure that appropriate 
measures are developed, adapted to challenges where 
necessary, and monitored."
"In order to ensure efficient, high-quality, and environ-
mentally friendly manufacturing operations, the Group 
has established an environmental management system 
certified in accordance with ISO 14001 at its production 
sites around the world."
"All German manufacturing loca-
tions and the two European production sites in 
Kecskemét, Hungary, and Vitoria, Spain, have also been 
validated in accordance with EMAS."
"In addition, the 
German production sites have had energy management 
systems conforming to DIN EN ISO 50001 in place since 
2012, and the Group has these systems certified every 
three years."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is currently also 
implementing ISO 50001 systems at a number of indi-
vidual sites outside Germany, for example in Kecskemét 
in Hungary, Jawor in Poland and Vitoria in Spain."
"In 
addition, during the year under review the Mercedes-
Benz Group also moved ahead with the introduction on 
an international scale of energy management systems 
certified in accordance with ISO 50001."
"New manage-
ment systems were implemented in Pune, India, and 
Sebes, Romania, for example."
"The effectiveness of the management systems is moni-
tored by external auditors as part of the certification 
process (ISO 14001, EMAS, ISO 50001), as well as in the 
environmental sector by internal environmental risk 
assessments (environmental due diligence process)."
"The Group also has a standardized process in place for 
reviewing and assessing its consolidated production 
sites every five years."
"The results of this process are 
reported to the respective plant and company manage-
ment so that any necessary optimizations can be car-
ried out."
"Reduction of energy consumption
The optimization of energy efficiency enables the 
Mercedes-Benz Group to decrease its energy consump-
tion and conserve resources, while reducing the CO2 
emissions of its production processes."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly measures and 
assesses essential energy consumption in order to 
identify and take advantage of savings potential in the 
areas of production and infrastructure."
"An innovative 
energy management software system has been intro-
duced at Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans 
in order to create transparency with regard to energy 
procurement and energy consumption."
"As a result of the implementation of these and other 
energy efficiency measures, energy consumption  
(incl."
"electricity, natural gas, district heat, heating oil 
and liquefied petroleum gas) per vehicle at Mercedes-
Benz Cars in the reporting year was 12%1 lower than in 
2022."
"Due to similar effects, energy consumption per 
vehicle at Mercedes-Benz Vans fell by 8%1 compared to 
the previous year2."
"Efficient water utilization
The Mercedes-Benz Group developed the “Storm Water 
Protection — Pollutant Discharge Elimination” standard 
all the way back in 2014 so that its sites could initiate 
targeted water protection measures."
"It contains guide-
lines on how rainwater management at production sites, 
branches and workshops can prevent and reduce 
potential pollution from previously contaminated rain-
water."
"In 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group adopted a 
Water Policy so that it might continue to effectively 
contribute to the creation of a more sustainable water 
management system."
"In addition, the Group set itself 
the goal of no longer using drinking water in production 
operations at any Mercedes-Benz manufacturing loca-
tions worldwide."
"In order to further minimize fresh

"water consumption, the Mercedes-Benz Group also 
intends to use hybrid cooling systems."
"The Group 
launched an initial project in this area in Sindelfingen, 
Germany, in June 2023 in cooperation with the munici-
pal wastewater management and disposal company."
"The goal here is to employ a closed cycle to largely 
replace the fresh water used in production with treated 
municipal wastewater."
"For years now, the Mercedes-Benz Group has been 
using its own accounting method, which focuses in par-
ticular on fresh water, to monitor and assess its water 
consumption."
"On this account, water consumption per 
vehicle at Mercedes-Benz Cars decreased 8%1 as com-
pared to 2022."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans was able to reduce 
water consumption per vehicle by 6%1 compared to the 
previous year2."
"Less waste
The goal of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to keep the 
waste volumes generated in its production operations 
as low as possible."
"To this end, the Group seeks to  
continuously reduce overall waste, including waste for 
disposal."
"As it does so, the Mercedes-Benz Group’s top 
priority is to prevent waste."
"In order to reduce total waste, it is important to ensure 
transparency concerning the waste value streams  
and to correctly separate the various types of waste."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group generally works with 
licensed and regularly certified waste disposal compa-
nies to ensure the professional disposal of our waste 
materials in accordance with legal requirements."
"Furthermore, it continues to reduce waste such as clip-
pings, sands, filter media and slurries through the 
implementation of new or optimized production pro-
cesses."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also works with some suppli-
ers in order to avoid waste."
"For example, load carriers 
and the materials used for securing loads and cargo are 
now, where possible, reused in a closed cycle, as are 
steel barrels (e.g."
"for thermal conductive paste, adhe-
sives and lubricants)."
"In the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz Cars reduced the 
total amount of waste per vehicle by 9%1 and the 
amount of waste for disposal per vehicle by 42%1 com-
pared to 2022."
"At Mercedes-Benz Vans, total waste per 
vehicle increased by 16%1 as compared to 2022, while 
waste volume for disposal per vehicle fell by 21%1 dur-
ing the reporting year2."
"HR work in the ­
transformation
As a result of electrification, digitalization and the 
increasing use of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) 
systems, the job profiles of employees are also chang-
ing."
"Working processes and structures are changing just 
as fundamentally as employee tasks and cooperation 
within the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The aim of the Mercedes-Benz Group is to manage the 
upcoming changes for its total of 166,0561 employees 
worldwide in a responsible, socially compatible and 
future-oriented way."
"It meets the challenges and 
requirements of the personnel transformation with a 
corresponding personnel strategy, among other things."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continuously invests in the 
qualification of its employees, is constantly expanding 
its range of further qualification courses and at the 
same time recruits new talent with appropriate skills 
profiles."
"In order to attract such employees and retain 
them for the long term, the Mercedes-Benz Group takes 
measures to create and further enhance an attractive 
and future-oriented working environment for its 
employees, among other ways by offering them flexible 
forms of work."
"Particularly in challenging times, 
respectful and trust-based cooperation between the 
workforce and the management is extremely important."
"At the same time, the Group also wants to  
provide its employees with a healthy and safe working 
environment."
"Firmly establishing work and social standards
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to fulfilling its 
social responsibilities."
"As a participant in the UN Global 
Compact, the Mercedes-Benz Group AG has committed 
itself, among other things, to respecting key employee 
rights."
"Based on the labour and social standards of the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG revised and supplemented its own Group-
wide principles of social responsibility in 2021 and pub-
lished them as the Principles of Social Responsibility 
and Human Rights."
"Reported violations of the Integrity Code or other inter-
nal Group regulations, as well as legal regulations, that 
pose a high risk to the Mercedes-Benz Group and its 
employees or to other people are followed up by the 
whistleblowing system BPO (Business & People Protec-
tion Office)."
"Responsible transformation 
Depending on their product portfolio and the size of 
their operations, the Mercedes-Benz Group sites, and 
thus the company’s various groups of employees, are 
affected to different degrees by digitalization and the 
electrification of the automotive industry."
"To this end, various sites — primarily the 
Powertrain and manufacturing plants, but also the sales 
department — developed goals for their transformation 
process."
"On the basis of these goals, the sites identified 
key topics with corresponding measures."
"These meas-
ures primarily include training and retraining opportuni-
ties for employees."
"The company also makes it possible 
for employees to move between different sites in order 
to take on new jobs or continue to work at the corre-
sponding level of qualification."
"One focus of HR work at the Mercedes-Benz Group is to 
win over, motivate and empower employees for change."
"For example, the TransformatiON initiative was 
launched in the “Powertrain Network”1 in 2022."
"With 
this initiative, the company wants to explore new com-
munication channels in order to better inform, involve 
and support employees during the transition."
"Transfor-
matiON focuses increasingly on information, interaction, 
dialogue and feedback as central components."
"In addition to courage, commitment and a willingness 
to change, successful transformation requires security 
above all."
"That’s why the company signed an agreement 
in 2017 that gives the employees at Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG and Mercedes-Benz 
Intellectual Property GmbH & Co."

guarantee for the period until the end of 2029."
"This 
works agreement generally excludes the possibility of 
business-related layoffs until 31 December 2029."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group in Germany has also made 
agreements that will enable it to react flexibly to market 
fluctuations and to retain the core workforce and jobs 
within the Group."
"The provisions of the general works 
agreement “DMove” have been extended until the end 
of 2024 for the Mercedes-Benz Group AG and 
Mercedes-Benz AG sites (plants and headquater) in 
Germany2."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group, temporary 
workers supplement the core workforce; they do not 
replace it."
"Leadership culture 
Managers have a special role and responsibility in the 
transformation process."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group, 
the leadership culture and the way people work 
together are therefore constantly evolving."
"The various 
units and departments use the shared basis of the 
Group-wide People Principles to focus on their own 
specific areas and develop appropriate measures."
"The 
principles serve as a basis for leadership and coopera-
tion at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Current offers and 
suggestions support managers in their sustainable fur-
ther development and help them engage in lifelong 
learning."
"Because learning and cultural development 
take place at all levels, the Group introduced a format 
tailored to top management in the reporting year in the 
form of Executive Inspiration Talks."
"It combines exter-
nal suggestions on the topic of leadership culture with 
networking and cross-functional exchange."
"The hybrid working environment has changed the 
demands placed on managers within the Group."
"In 
order to support managers as much as possible in their 
roles and their tasks, the Mercedes-Benz Group offers 
them training courses that focus on the opportunities 
and the framework of leadership."
"In these courses, 
managers learn in a targeted manner about the new 
challenges relating to leadership with regard to innova-
tion, cooperation, sustainable development and per-
sonal resilience."
"In order to continually improve its leadership and cor-
porate culture and further develop its work culture 
within the framework of the transformation process, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group conducts an extensive survey of 
its employees worldwide every two years."
"This was 
most recently done in 2023."
"The survey is a key indica-
tor of where the Group stands with regard to various 
issues from the point of view of its employees, and 
where there is still potential for improvement."
"Other 
channels are also open for employees and managers to 
provide feedback."
"The global Corporate Compensation 
Policy, which is valid for all groups of employees, estab-
lishes the framework conditions and minimum require-
ments for the design of the remuneration systems."
"However, it does not take 
account of gender, origin or other personal characteris-
tics."
"In doing so, the Group also takes into considera-
tion local market conditions and benchmarks."
"The short-
term component is based not only on financial targets 
but also on transformation goals and non-financial  
targets."
"Since 2023, the long-term component has also 
been based on ESG targets."
"To measure the company’s success, sustainability 
aspects are also be taken into account."
"Depending on 
the results, employees who are covered by collective 
wage agreements at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, 
Mercedes-Benz AG and Mercedes-Benz Intellectual 
Property GmbH & Co."
"KG and managers at management 
level four (Executive) receive a success and profit-shar-
ing bonus since 2023."
"The internal auditing department conducts random 
annual internal audits to determine whether selected 
aspects of the Corporate Compensation Policy are 
being complied with."
"As part of these audits, no mate-
rial breach of the guideline was identified in 2023."
"Flexible working-time models
The Mercedes-Benz Group continuously further devel-
ops its working culture — and thus its working-time 
arrangements as well."
"It is increasingly relying on hybrid 
forms of work, a mix of on-site and mobile working 
depending on tasks and work processes."
"The “Remote 
Working” general works agreement, valid since 2016, 
was converted into a group works agreement at the 
beginning of 2023."
"Thereby, and through the ongoing 
exchange with the works council, the Group is creating 
the necessary framework conditions for hybrid working 
models in Germany and developing them further."
"For 
example, employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group in 
Germany have also been able to temporarily work 
remotely from abroad for private reasons since March 
2023."
"Depending on local conditions, Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG, Mercedes-Benz AG, Mercedes-Benz Mobil-
ity AG and Mercedes-Benz Bank AG offer different 
working-time arrangements."
"part-
time work and job sharing."
"In addition, employees at Mercedes-Benz Group AG, 
Mercedes-Benz AG, Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG, 
Mercedes-Benz Bank AG and other subsidiaries can 
agree to take a sabbatical ranging from three months to 
one year."
"Employees who wish to obtain additional 
qualifications — including pursuing a course of study at 
a university — can also make arrangements to take a 
three to five-year leave with a reinstatement guarantee."
"Dialogue with employee representatives 
The Mercedes-Benz Group acknowledges its employees’ 
right to form employee representative bodies and con-
duct collective bargaining in order to regulate working 
conditions."
"It also recognizes their right to strike in 
accordance with the applicable laws."
"Important part-
ners here include the local works councils, the General 
Works Council, the Group Works Council, the European 
Works Council and the World Employee Committee 
(WEC)."
"Collective bargaining agreements exist for the 
majority of employees throughout the Group."
"In Germany, the company and employee representative 
bodies also maintain an ongoing and structured dia-
logue."
"The parties make every effort to take into 
account both the economic interests of the Group and 
the interests of its employees."
"The results of the ongo-
ing dialogues, and thus the rights of employees as well, 
are defined, among other things, in a number of plant 
and company-wide agreements."
"In the reporting year, 
company and employee representative bodies reached 
various agreements and arrangements."
"These include 
the policy on remote work abroad for personal reasons 
and the general works agreement on the Germany-wide 
job ticket for public transportation."
"The parties also 
concluded a Group-works agreement on employee par-
ticipation in digitalization."
"In particular, this includes a 
business e-mail address for all employees in the pro-
duction environment of the Mercedes-Benz Group in 
Germany."
"The interests of trainees and young employees at the 
various German sites are looked after specifically by the 
local youth and trainee representatives, who in turn 
organize themselves across all sites as part of a General 
Youth and Trainee Representation (GJAV)."
"It 
therefore continuously invests in training and profes-
sional development programmes for its employees and 
continues to adjust its qualification and HR develop-
ment programmes."
"The range of training professions 
offered by the Mercedes-Benz Group and the courses 
of study offered in dual work-study programmes in Ger-
many are also changing as a result, as are the qualifica-
tion and personnel development programmes."
"Organization and agreements
Various company and collective-bargaining regulations 
form the basis of the Germany-wide training and quali-
fication processes at Mercedes-Benz Group."
"They serve to 
standardize the qualification process, structure it more 
efficiently and integrate external training elements into 
the learning portfolio."
"Trainees and students
In Germany, the Mercedes-Benz Group offers profes-
sional training and a dual work-study programme for 
internationally recognized bachelor courses of study at 
various company sites."
"The courses are supplemented 
by practical assignments, both in Germany and abroad."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has established a Mercedes-
Benz Training System for Germany that standardizes 
company-related training content across all sites and 
divisions."
"The goal here is to create high-quality and 
efficient training programmes that are attractive to train-
ees and participants of dual work-study programmes."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group provides future-oriented 
training as needed and continuously reviews its portfo-
lio of training professions and courses of study in Ger-
many."
"In this review process it not only reacts to cur-
rent developments but also anticipates future 
requirements and technological innovations."
"Since 2021, 
Mercedes-Benz AG has been increasing the number of 
IT trainees, and in autumn of 2022 it also integrated the 
additional qualification Artificial Intelligence from the 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry."
"Since the report-
ing year, internally designed qualification modules such 
as Data-based action, Programming and Cyber security 
have also been taught as part of technical vocational 
training."
"The new dual study programme “Sustainable 
Management” will start in 2024."
"It com-
bines a wide range of learning opportunities via external 
learning platforms with customized training and strate-
gic learning paths."
"This allows employees to combine 
different options to suit their needs — digitally and in 
person."
"The Group’s own specialized TechAcademies, also 
organized under the umbrella of Turn2Learn, provide 
targeted and needs-oriented training for employees in 
research and development and in production-related 
areas."
"For example, the TechAcademy Production and 
Supply Chain Management at Mercedes-Benz AG analy-
ses current and future personnel requirements for pro-
duction areas and cross divisional functions — for 
example, in quality assurance."
"The TechAcademy uses 
the analyses to develop future-oriented qualification as 
well as retraining measures in line with the needs of 
specific target groups."
"A Tech Academy that offers needs-based future-ori-
ented training components has also been established 
for employees in the development units at the 
Mercedes-Benz AG in Germany."
"These training compo-
nents are specifically tailored to the requirements of 
the development units."
"In order to actively promote the digital transformation 
in production, the D.SHIFT part-time qualification pro-
gramme was launched in 2021."
"D.SHIFT is a retraining 
programme specifically for production employees at 
German sites that focuses on acquiring digital skills and 
ultimately involves employees switching to a future-ori-
ented job profile."
"The programme was continued in 
November 2023 and the number of available slots was 
expanded."
"Within the sales organization of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG, the Mercedes-Benz Global Training business 
unit serves as the central pillar for the development and 
qualification of employees of the German and interna-
tional sales organization."
"The focus is on the training 
and certification of sales and service personnel as well 
as dealer management."
"In addition, comprehensive fur-
ther training and various product training courses are 
offered."
"The unit also focuses on training content on 
electrics/electronics (E/E) and high-voltage, especially 
for employees in the repair and service sector."
"In 2023, the emphasis continued to be on qualifications 
that are crucial for the successful implementation of 
the Group’s sustainable business strategy and digitali-
zation."
"Diversity and inclusion
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to tolerance, 
openness and fairness, and promotes diversity and 
inclusion."
"This approach is embedded in the Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s Integrity Code and in the Principles of Social 
Responsibility and Human Rights, among other things."
"Strategic areas of action
Diversity and inclusion are part of the sustainable busi-
ness strategy of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The strate-
gic areas of action for promoting diversity and inclusion 
involve the advancement of women, internationality 
and inclusion."
"–	 
The advancement of women: the Mercedes-Benz 
Group would like to fill more senior management 
positions (Level 3 and up) with women."
"The target 
here is to increase the share of women in such posi-
tions to 30% by 2030."
"As of 
31 December 2023, women occupied 25.7%1 of the 
senior management positions at the Mercedes-Benz 
Group worldwide."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group uses rel-
evant data from its human resources reporting sys-
tems to review the progress made in increasing the 
proportion of women in top management positions."
"The results are reported to the Board of Management 
of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG in a standardized 
form on a regular basis."

"Management of diversity and inclusion at the Group
The Mercedes-Benz Group expects its employees to 
treat one another in a respectful, open and fair manner."
"Managers serve as role models here and thus have a 
1	  Headcounts, fully consolidated companies
special responsibility for ensuring a corporate culture 
marked by appreciation."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group pre-
sented its understanding of diversity and inclusion in its 
“Uniqueness makes us strong” mission statement, which 
was signed by all members of the Board of Manage-
ment."
"The framework and processes here are designed by the 
Group-wide Integrity function and the Diversity & Inclu-
sion Management function."
"The latter is part of Human 
Relations."
"It defined the three strategic areas of action 
in cooperation with the members of the Board of Man-
agement of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and initiates 
overarching projects, training programmes and aware-
ness-raising measures."
"The diversity and inclusion management system is 
grounded in the principle of inclusion for all employees."
"The idea here is to always attract highly qualified spe-
cialists and managers to the Group and support their 
professional development."
"Additional 
points of contact include the Group’s Business & People 
Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system and the 
Infopoint Integrity."
"In addition to these internal contact points, there has 
been an external online information and advice plat-
form for Mercedes-Benz Group employees in Germany 
since 2022."
"It provides information on the topics of 
sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying and 
includes the option of anonymous counselling."
"Awareness-raising and qualification measures  
for employees
The Mercedes-Benz Group utilizes various measures to 
make employees around the world more aware of issues 
relating to diversity and inclusion."
"These include, among 
other things, qualification programmes, information 
events and special mentorship programmes for women."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group’s annual Diversity Day, 
employees can consciously experience diversity, take in 
new perspectives and understand how all employees 
can profit from diversity and equal opportunity."
"For Diversity Day 2023, employees were able to  
go through four diversity online training courses in  
the Global Diversity Community on the employee  
portal, which offer specific content for employees  
and managers."
"It aims to prevent work 
accidents, work-related illnesses and occupational dis-
eases to the greatest extent possible and also counter-
act health risks."
"The Group also wants to maintain the 
health and performance of its employees in the long 
term and promote their well-being."
"The focus here is 
mainly on preventative measures that the Group contin-
uously reviews and develops further."
"Requirements, policies, organization and 
responsibilities
The Mercedes-Benz Group’s occupational safety strat-
egy includes standards for the design of workplaces 
and work processes in order to systematically reduce 
occupational and health-related risks."
"There are inter-
national Group policies on occupational health and 
safety as well as uniform principles that must be 
adhered to."
"The internal guidelines are based on inter-
national standards and require compliance with 
national laws."
"They emphasize the responsibility of 
managers and the personal responsibility of employees."
"The international Group Occupational Health and Safety 
Policy specifies binding tasks, duties, necessary bodies 
and communication requirements for all controlled and 
consolidated companies."
"This policy is based on the 
ISO 45001 standard."
"The policy is valid for all employ-
ees as well as temporary workers whose work and/or 
workplace is controlled by the organization."
"Occupational health and safety issues throughout the 
Group are managed by the Health & Safety unit, which 
is part of Human Relations."
"The topics are regularly dis-
cussed and decided on in various committees."
"Risk management
Risk management follows the Group policy on occupa-
tional health and safety and defines instruments and 
risk assessment processes that are to be implemented 
locally."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group’s Health & Safety unit 
takes a preventative approach so that employees do 
not have accidents or suffer from impaired health."
"In 
order to identify significant risks at an early stage, an 
evaluation (safety due diligence) is carried out every 
five years at all consolidated and controlled production 
sites with more than 500 employees."
"Risk assessment 
is an important tool for evaluating potential risks and 
defining measures."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group, this is 
done with the help of standardized and globally availa-
ble software, for example."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
also assesses the mental and ergonomic stress caused 
by workplaces and the working environment."
"Company health management and mental health
The Mercedes-Benz Group offers its employees in Ger-
many occupational health advice and screening as well 
as measures and services from the company’s own 
health programme and social counselling service."
"The 
company health management system in Germany aims 
to promote the mental and physical health and well-be-
ing of the employees."
"Internationally, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group focuses on medical care, preven-
tion strategies and the ergonomic design of workplaces."
"Management of occupational safety 
At various sites, the Mercedes-Benz Group has its man-
agement systems for occupational health and safety 
(OHS) voluntarily certified in accordance with the ISO 
45001 standard."
"In 2023, the Jawor site (Poland) 
received voluntary certification of its management sys-
tem in accordance with ISO 45001 for the first time."
"The international Mercedes-Benz CKD sites in 
India, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia as well as the 
AMG production plants in the UK and Germany were 
evaluated as planned in 2023."
"The results were com-
municated to and followed up in the relevant commit-
tees."
"The Group also raises its employees’ awareness of ergo-
nomics and occupational safety."
"In order to create a 
sustainable “safety-first culture” and permanently 
reduce the number of accidents at work, the Mercedes-
Benz Group launched the “We work SAFE!” initiative in 
2022 and continued it in the reporting year."
"The focus 
was initially on sites in Germany."
"As part of the initiative, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group also assesses risks in coop-
eration with external companies."
"To further increase 
safety in this context, it has stepped up checks on con-
struction sites and introduced a consequences man-
agement system for any incorrect behaviour detected."
"A reporting procedure helps the Mercedes-Benz Group 
achieve its occupational health and safety targets."
"Since 2023, a uniform accident documentation system 
has been available to the Group worldwide, from which 
standardized key figures can be derived in compliance 
with applicable data protection regulations."
"Every accident is analysed in order to determine the 
sequence of events and initiate preventative measures."
"Data on accidents from which other sites can learn and 
derive measures is sent to all occupational safety 
experts at all sites worldwide."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group uses the information provided by the system  
to produce monthly reports on Group-wide accident 
statistics."
"During the reporting year, the Mercedes-Benz Group’s 
production sites had an accident frequency of 3.81,2."
"2	 The key figures were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate  
assurance engagement of the sustainability report."
"Accident-free driving — this vision drives the Mercedes-
Benz Group and is a fixed component of its sustainable 
business strategy."
"The Group’s driver assistance sys-
tems are intended to offer drivers and other occupants 
a high level of safety."
"These systems can help drivers 
avoid or safely manage critical situations on the road in 
order to protect both vehicle occupants and other road 
users."
"Holistic safety concept
Real-life safety is the safety philosophy at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group."
"For decades, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s own systematic accident research, which is 
integrated into vehicle development, has formed the 
basis for new safety systems."
"This research also analy-
ses real accidents and uses the knowledge gained from 
such analyses to assess new technologies from a vehi-
cle safety perspective."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group utilizes its holistic Integral 
Safety concept in its vehicle development activities."
"This concept describes how Mercedes-Benz divides the 
utilization of safety systems into four phases: assis-
tance during driving, preparation for a possible acci-
dent, protection during an accident and help after an 
accident."
"The Group’s safety measures establish a 
bridge between active and passive safety within these 
four phases — i.e."
"between accident prevention (phases 
1 and 2) and protection when an accident occurs 
(phases 3 and 4)."
"The objectives and decisions in the 
area of road safety are assured by the Steering Commit-
tee Integral Safety (LK IS) and implemented in conjunc-
tion with the participants of the product projects."
"The 
LK IS reports directly to the Research & Development 
Executive Committee of Mercedes-Benz AG."
"Cooperation to further improve vehicle safety
The goal of increasing safety on the road can only be 
achieved though collaboration, and that is why the 
Mercedes-Benz Group establishes partnerships and 
participates in research projects."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group has been involved in the “Tech Center i-protect” 
strategic cooperation project since 2016."
"The project 
includes partners from business, government and sci-
entific institutes."
"Within this cooperation the Mercedes-
Benz Group is working on projects such as new restraint 
systems for future vehicle interiors."
"It is also utilizing 
digital accident research methods and trying out new 
approaches, such as the use of accident simulations 
involving digital models of human beings."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also uses educational pro-
grammes to raise public awareness of vehicle safety 
and road safety."
"Advantages and risks of the new systems
Fewer accidents, greater road safety: this is one of the 
objectives associated with the utilization of automated 
and autonomous vehicle systems."
"In pursuing these 
goals, the Mercedes-Benz Group also considers ethical 
and legal risks associated with automated systems."
"Thus they are already taken into account in product 
development."
"The company is implementing data pro-
tection principles and standards along the entire value 
chain in accordance with the “privacy by design” maxim."
"The Group uses an integrated approach to answer the 
technical, legal, ethical and certification and safety-rel-
evant questions relating to automated driving at 
Mercedes-Benz Cars."
"This approach is part of the tech-
nical Compliance Management System."
"To this end, an 
interdisciplinary committee structure has been set up 
to deal with issues such as the responsible use of data 
and taking into account the needs of all road users who 
encounter automated vehicles on the road."
"The objec-
tive of this approach is to increase both the safety and 
the acceptance of the Group’s products."
"Assistance and safety systems
Innovations in assistance and safety systems are evalu-
ated on the basis of the contribution they make to road 
safety, both at the vehicle level and for road safety in 
general."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group’s specialists are 
continuously working on increasing road safety and 
equipping vehicles — across several SAE levels right up 
to automated driving — with ever more powerful 
assistance systems that can help to prevent accidents 
or reduce their severity."
"For example, Mercedes-Benz 
vehicles equipped with driving assistance systems can 
support drivers when they steer, brake and accelerate 
(SAE Level 2)."
"Driving assistance systems can react differently to the 
danger of a collision, depending on the situation."
"The 
Active Brake Assist system, which comes as standard 
equipment in Mercedes-Benz cars, is a good example of 
this."
"Active Brake Assist can help reduce the severity 
of — or entirely prevent — accidents involving vehicles 
ahead or pedestrians crossing the carriageway."
"Speed 
Limit Assist, for example, notifies the driver of the cur-
rent speed limit."
"It has been standard equipment in the 
Mercedes-Benz A-Class since 2018."
"Since then, it has 
also been integrated into further models and its fea-
tures have been expanded."
"Ratings and awards
Models from Mercedes-Benz Cars repeatedly earn top 
marks in safety tests conducted by independent insti-
tutes, such as the holistic testing program NCAP and 
the holistic ratings of the U.S."
"Insurance Institute for 
Highway Safety (IIHS)1."
"The latter assesses not only 
crash safety but also accident-prevention and lighting 
systems."
"The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, GLC-Class and GLE-Class 
received the IIHS 2023 TOP SAFETY PICK+ award for 
the 2023 model year."
"In addition, the Mercedes EQE received top Euro NCAP2 
ratings twice: the maximum rating of five stars in the 
Euro NCAP safety ratings and the overall rating of “very 
good” for the optional driving assistance package in the 
special rating for assistance systems."
"The E-Class also 
received an overall rating of “very good” in the special 
assessment for assistance systems."
"Assistance and automation functions 
The DRIVE PILOT3 has been available to order in Ger-
many since May 2022."
"Under certain conditions, the 
system enables conditional driving automation on 
motorways (SAE Level 3)."
"Mercedes-Benz AG plans to deliver the first vehicles 
with DRIVE PILOT at the beginning of 2024."
"The special 
2024 model year EQS sedans and S-Classes will be 
available through participating authorized Mercedes-
Benz dealerships in California and Nevada."
"DRIVE PILOT 
takes over the driving task in heavy traffic or in traffic 
jam situations on suitable motorway sections at speeds 
of up to 40 mph (up to 60 km/h in Germany)."
"To overcome these challenges, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group attaches great importance to a 
partnership-based dialogue between politics, business 
and society."
"This is exactly what the External Affairs unit 
at the Mercedes-Benz Group seeks to accomplish."
"As an actor in the transport sector, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group supports the Paris Climate Agreement and is 
convinced of its goals."
"That’s why the sustainable  
business strategy of the Mercedes-Benz Group also 
defines the representation of the Group’s interests in 
the political arena."
"The legally required registration in the German Lobby 
Register, as well as the Group’s own lobbying principles, 
commit Mercedes-Benz Group AG to comply with the 
Code of Conduct for Interest Representatives under the 
Lobby Register Act."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG is also 
entered in the transparency register of the Baden-Würt-
temberg state parliament."
"Entries in other transparency 
registers at the level of German states are currently 
being considered and may be made in the near future."
"By accrediting its political representatives in the Euro-
pean Parliament’s Transparency Register, Mercedes-
Benz Group AG fulfils the transparency requirements  
at the EU level."
"The Group also uses its own Mercedes-Benz Group  
Climate Policy Report to inform about its political  
positions."
"In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group pub-
lishes further information regarding its stance on rele-
vant and strategic issues as well as issues affecting  
its stakeholders on the corporate website (w group."
mercedes-benz.com/responsibility/advocacy).
"The Mercedes-Benz Group bases its political advocacy 
on principles of transparency and responsibility and is 
guided by the Integrity Code, which is valid throughout 
the Group (further information on this can be found on 
the Group website w group.mercedes-benz.com/inves-
tors/share/esg)."
"Governance
The External Affairs (EA) unit is the central coordinating 
body for political dialogue at the national and interna-
tional levels as well as for other politically relevant 
interest groups along the value chain."
"It is located in 
Stuttgart (Germany) and falls under the responsibility  
of the Chairman of the Board of Management."
"The EA 
unit shapes the Mercedes-Benz Group’s relations via a 
global network with offices in Berlin (Germany), Brus-
sels (Belgium), Beijing (China) and Washington (USA), as 
well as corporate representations in respective markets."
"The Head of External Affairs is a permanent member of 
the Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) and supports 
the committee’s work on political issues."
"In addition, 
External Affairs cooperates closely with the members of 
the Board of Management and the specialist depart-
ments on questions related to the representation of our 
interests in the political arena."
"To this end, the unit 
organizes the meetings of the Governmental Affairs 
Committee for various Board of Management divisions 
and specialist departments."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group uses Group-wide established 
compliance processes to address risks in connection 
with the political representation of its interests."
"The 
Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistle-
blower system accepts complaints and reports relating 
to compliance issues."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group conducts mandatory training 
courses on a regular basis to ensure that employees 
comply with statutory requirements and internal guide-
lines and policies."
"The executive division Integrity,  
Governance & Sustainability is responsible for the con-
tent of the training courses."
"EA supports the courses 
when needed by contributing its political expertise."
"At the beginning of their employment, employees out-
side External Affairs whose positions also require them 
to represent the Mercedes-Benz Group in the political 
environment of their market (e.g."
"plant management 
positions) generally participate in a special onboarding 
process that prepares them for their tasks and makes 
them aware of relevant policies."
"The company also has a Donations and Sponsorships 
Policy in place."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG did not make any financial or 
non-financial donations to political parties during the 
reporting period."
"This decision was not based on cur-
rent political or economic events."
"Stakeholder dialogue
Together with stakeholders, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
supports the opinion-forming process at both the 
national and international level in order to promote the 
sustainable business goals and the transformation of 
the automotive industry."
"The Group also addresses rel-
evant future-oriented questions that go beyond the 
issues that are important to the automotive industry 
and incorporates the results into its strategy."
"In order to ensure political discussions with a broad 
range of interest groups, representatives from the 
Mercedes-Benz Group take part in key events at the 
regional, national and international level."
"-	 In the reporting year, representatives of the Group 
took part in the Urban Future Global Conference in 
Stuttgart (Germany)."
"The Conference’s agenda 
included, among other topics, resource-conserving 
consumption, heat-resilient urban districts, cli-
mate-neutral energy supply and social participation."
"-	 The Mercedes-Benz Group took part in the European 
Round Table of Industry (ERT) in the reporting year."
"The aim of the forum is to develop long-term busi-
ness-friendly strategies in cooperation with the Euro-
pean Commission."
"-	 The China Development Forum (CDF) is an annual 
international forum organized by the State Council of 
China."
"At the CDF, the CEO of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group emphasized the importance of further imple-
menting China’s open-door policy and of maintaining 
a balanced data regulation in order to ensure eco-
nomic growth and technological innovation."
"During the Sustainability Dialogue in Stuttgart (Ger-
many) in 2023, representatives from the Advisory Board 
for Integrity and Sustainability and representatives from 
government, business and NGOs took part in a work-
shop where they drew up criteria for the development 
of partnerships."
"Partnerships that have a more global 
degree of application may be more effective."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group engages in a targeted dia-
logue with local stakeholders from government and 
society when planning new projects or when the need 
arises to address issues relating to its sites."
"Board 
members are also involved in the local dialogue."
"The 
aim here is to reconcile the interests of the sites in 
question with the wishes and concerns of local resi-
dents and establish conditions that benefit all of the 
parties involved."
"The External Affairs unit is responsible for direct discus-
sions with people from the political arena and members 
of interest groups and associations that are committed 
to sustainable development."
"Together with the ESG 
Stakeholder Management unit, External Affairs is also 
involved in various sustainability initiatives and net-
works."
"Some of the most important initiatives here are 
the UN Global Compact (UNGC), econsense – German 
Business Forum for Sustainable Development, and the 
World Business Council for Sustainable Development."
"Further information on the work in associations can be 
found in the Mercedes-Benz Group Climate Policy Report."
"This is especially 
the case during times of upheaval and transformation."
"Hence, integrity and compliance are very important to 
the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"A corporate culture of integrity 
Putting integrity into practice contributes to the suc-
cess of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"That’s why integrity 
is a central element of the Mercedes-Benz Group’s cor-
porate culture and an enabler that is an integral part of 
the company’s sustainable business strategy."
"For the 
Group, this involves more than just obeying laws and 
regulations."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also aligns all its 
actions with its corporate principles, which in particular 
include fairness, diversity, responsibility, respect, open-
ness and transparency."
"Organization and areas of responsibility 
At the Mercedes-Benz Group, integrity, compliance and 
legal affairs are combined into the executive division 
Integrity, Governance & Sustainability."
"It supports all 
corporate units in their efforts to embed these topics in 
daily business activities."
"“Integrity Management & Corporate Responsibility” is 
part of this Board of Management division."
"Among other 
things, it works to promote and enhance integrity within 
the Mercedes-Benz Group and create a shared under-
standing of integrity."
"The aim is to assist the business 
units in embedding integrity into their day-to-day work 
on their own responsibility."
"The goal is to avoid possible 
risks that can arise due to unethical behaviour and thus 
to contribute to the long-term success of the Mercedes-
Benz Group."
"The Head of Integrity Management & Cor-
porate Responsibility reports directly to the member of 
the Board of Management responsible for Integrity, 
Governance & Sustainability."
"Integrity Code and corporate principles
The Mercedes-Benz Group requires and empowers its 
employees to consistently uphold its corporate princi-
ples."
"The Integrity Code, which is valid throughout the 
Group, provides them with guidance because it serves 
as the shared standard of values, defines the guidelines 
for all conduct and helps the company make the right 
decisions."
"The Integrity Code is binding on all employees of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and all the Group companies 
worldwide."
"It includes, among other things, regulations 
concerning corruption prevention measures, respect for 
human rights, data management and compliance with 
technical product requirements."
"The Integrity Code that 
was revised in 2022 was communicated to employees 
at the beginning of the reporting year; it is available on 
the employee portal in eleven languages along with all 
the key information on its application."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has also formulated a special 
set of requirements for managers in the Integrity Code."
"In particular, it expects managers to serve as role mod-
els through their ethical behaviour."
"The Infopoint works with experts for legal 
and human resources topics, data protection, compli-
ance as well as diversity and sustainability, among  
others, and serves as the central point of contact for 
questions concerning ethical behaviour for all of the 
Group’s employees."
"It either provides direct support or 
connects employees with the appropriate contacts."
"The Integrity Network, which is made up of representa-
tives from the business units, aims to embed integrity 
in day-to-day business and make it tangible for employ-
ees."
"The semi-annual member reports also provide 
insights into the integrity activities of the business 
units."
"The Integrity Network implemented the package 
of measures of the “Integrity Experience”."
"This was 
based on individually combinable modules on various 
integrity topics, which were provided by the Integrity 
Management department."
"With the help of these meas-
ures, employees were able to consciously reflect on 
their own actions in their day-to-day work."
"In addition, the Annual Integrity Meeting was held in 
May 2023 with members of the Board of Management, 
members of the Integrity Network and an external 
expert."
"Under the motto “Integrity meets… TRANSFOR-
MATION”, the participants discussed how integrity can 
be implemented in one’s day-to-day professional life in 
times of change."
"In addition, the employees in administrative areas at 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and in the consolidated  
Group companies regularly have to complete a manda-
tory online training course about integrity that is based 
on the Integrity Code."
"Because managers serve as role 
models, they perform an especially important task with 
regard to compliance, integrity, legal matters and sus-
tainability."
"In order to help them as much as possible to 
carry out this role, the online training programme also 
includes a special mandatory management module."
"Employee survey
The Mercedes-Benz Group consistently works on its 
understanding of integrity, continually refines it further 
and repeatedly reviews itself."
"In addition to the feed-
back from the Integrity Network, the employee survey  
is an important measure for these activities."
"The results of the PULSE23 employee survey showed 
that the perception of the culture of integrity among 
employees has improved since the last employee sur-
vey."
"The basis for this is an environment of trust in 
which managers are also open to criticism, and unethi-
cal behaviour and mistakes in the working environment 
can be openly and constructively addressed."
"The 
results are used in the follow-up process to derive 
measures and thus further strengthen the culture of 
integrity."
"The survey results have a direct influence on the remu-
neration of the management."
"All managers and employees can access the Integrity 
Toolkit via the employee portal."
"It includes tools for 
possible follow-up activities based on the respective 
results of the employee survey."
"Plans call for the culture of integrity within the 
Mercedes-Benz Group to be reassessed as part of the 
next employee survey, among other things."
"The Advisory Board as an important driving force
Another driving force for the Group’s sustainability work 
is the Advisory Board for Integrity and Sustainability."
"The members 
of the Advisory Board support the Mercedes-Benz 
Group with constructive criticism on questions related 
to integrity, sustainability and corporate responsibility."
"The Advisory Board convenes several times a year in 
meetings that are chaired by the member of the Board 
of Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & 
Sustainability."
"One of these annual meetings specifically 
serves to exchange information with other members of 
the Board of Management and members of the Supervi-
sory Board."
"The Advisory Board also 
holds regular meetings with managers and other 
employees to discuss specific topics."
"In 2023, the Advi-
sory Board dealt with topics such as human rights, data 
responsibility, the responsible use of artificial intelli-
gence and the further development of the sustainable 
business strategy."
"Value-based compliance 
­
management 
Value-based compliance is an indispensable part of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group’s daily business activities and is 
firmly embedded in its corporate culture."
"The Group is 
strongly committed to responsible conduct."
"It expects 
its employees to comply with laws, regulations and vol-
untary self-commitments, and helps them do so."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Group has laid down these expecta-
tions in a binding form in its Integrity Code."
"Through its 
Compliance Management System (CMS), the Mercedes-
Benz Group aims to promote compliance with laws and 
policies."
"The necessary measures are defined by the 
compliance organization in a process that also takes 
the company’s business requirements into account in 
an appropriate manner."
"The CMS consists of basic prin-
ciples and measures that promote compliant behaviour."
"The CMS encompasses seven 
elements that build on one another: Compliance Val-
ues; Compliance Targets; Compliance Organization; 
Compliance Risks; Compliance Programme; Training; 
and Monitoring and Improvement."
"Each year, the Mercedes-Benz Group checks the pro-
cesses and measures of the CMS and conducts analy-
ses to find out whether the measures are appropriate 
and effective."
"For these activities, it relies on informa-
tion from the Group companies as well as additional 
locally gathered information."
"The Group also monitors 
their processes on the basis of key performance indica-
tors."
"To determine these indicators, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group checks, among other things, whether formal 
requirements are being met and whether the content is 
complete."
"It also takes into account the knowledge 
gained through both internal and independent external 
assessments."
"Whenever new legal requirements or findings from risk 
analyses call for adjustments, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group adapts the CMS accordingly."
"The Group compa-
nies are required to implement the improvement meas-
ures derived from this process."
"In addition, the respon-
sible management committees are informed about the 
results of their monitoring process."
"Compliance organization
The compliance organization at the Mercedes-Benz 
Group is structured functionally, regionally and along 
the value chain."
"As a result, it can provide effective 
support — for example, by means of guidelines and 
advice."
"Contact persons are available to each function 
and region."
"In addition, a global network of local 
officers makes sure that the Group’s compliance stand-
ards are met."
"The contact persons help the manage-
ment at the Group companies implement the compli-
ance programme at their respective sites."
"The Compliance Board provides guidance regarding 
overarching compliance topics and monitors whether 
the associated Group measures are effective."
"The 
Board’s mission is to react promptly to changes in busi-
ness models and the business environment, deal with 
regulatory developments and continuously enhance the 
CMS."
"The Compliance Board consists of representatives 
of the compliance, integrity and legal affairs area."
"It 
meets regularly and as needed, and is chaired by the 
Chief Compliance Officer (CCO)."
"The CCO reports directly to the member of the Board of 
Management responsible for Integrity, Governance & 
Sustainability as well as to the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board."
"He or she also reports regularly to 
the Board of Management at regular intervals and as 
needed on matters such as the status of the CMS and 
its further development, as well as the Business & Peo-
ple Protection Office (BPO) whistleblower system."
"The 
CCO is also the Vice President Legal Product & Technol-
ogy and the Human Rights Officer."
"In addition, the CCO reports to the Group Risk Manage-
ment Committee."
"The Corruption Prevention Compliance Programme at 
the Mercedes-Benz Group is based on its CMS."
"Promoting fair competition
The Group-wide Antitrust Compliance Programme is ori-
ented to national and international standards for ensur-
ing fair competition."
"The programme establishes a bind-
ing, globally valid Group standard that defines how 
matters of antitrust law are to be assessed."
"In addition 
to Mercedes-Benz Group AG’s central Legal and Com-
pliance department, the Group’s global divisions can 
turn to local legal and compliance advisers."
"Employees 
receive further support through advice hotlines, guide-
lines and practical support."
"Ensuring compliance with product requirements 
For the Mercedes-Benz Group, technical Compliance 
means adhering to technical and regulatory require-
ments, laws and standards."
"The objective here is to 
identify risks within the product creation process (prod-
uct development and certification) at an early stage and 
to implement preventive measures."
"For this purpose, 
the Group established a technical Compliance Manage-
ment System (tCMS) in its automotive divisions."
"Its 
objective is to ensure that Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans comply with all legal and regula-
tory requirements throughout the entire product devel-
opment and certification process."
"The tCMS defines 
values, principles, structures and processes in order to 
provide employees with guidance and orientation, 
especially with regard to challenging questions on how 
to interpret technical regulations."
"The “Speak up” and “Judgement calls” commitment 
statements provide all employees in the development 
and certification units with a basis for a common 
understanding of responsible behaviour in the product 
creation process."
"They were drawn up jointly by Integ-
rity Management and R&D departments and are further 
embedded by internal departmental measures."
"Responsible handling of data 
Ensuring the protection of personal data (data privacy) 
and information security is a top priority at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
regards the protection of personal data and the security 
of IT systems as essential components of comprehen-
sive data governance."
"The key aims are the sustainable 
design of data-based business models and the respon-
sible, ethical and legally compliant use of data in the 
interests of customers, employees and other stakehold-
ers."
"To achieve these strategic goals, the Mercedes-
Benz Group is pursuing a systematic approach."
"Key ele-
ments are the data governance structure, the data 
vision, the data culture and the aforementioned Data 
CMS."
"The implementation of data governance in the divisions 
of the Mercedes-Benz Group is the responsibility of  
the various bodies for data and data analytics."
"Within 
the Mercedes-Benz Group there is also a Digital Gov-
ernance Board that includes members of the Board of 
Management."
"This body defines the framework for 
Group-wide core topics of digital governance and thus 
supports the digital transformation of the Group."
"The 
Chief Officer Corporate Data Protection at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group is responsible for the perfor-
mance of the tasks required by law to ensure compli-
ance with data protection rules."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group’s commitment to the respon-
sible use of data is anchored in its data vision."
"In the 
period from November 2022 to May 2023, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group focused on revising this guide-
line, which is known as the Mercedes-Benz Data Vision, 
and deriving and launching measures to increase cus-
tomer confidence."
"It takes into account the existing 
applicable data-protection regulations."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group wants to further strengthen 
its customers’ trust in Mercedes-Benz’s data processing."
"To this end, the Mercedes me Privacy Center is con-
stantly being enhanced, with the aim of making the pri-
vacy settings as clear and intuitive as possible."
"Custom-
ers use the Mercedes me Privacy Center to obtain an 
overview of what personal data of theirs is processed 
for which purpose."
"They should be able to easily decide 
and set the purposes for which Mercedes-Benz and 
certain third parties may use this data."
"The Privacy 
Center already covers various such processing activi-
ties, and more are planned."
"The portal can be accessed 
on the web and via the new version of the Mercedes me 
App launched in the year under review."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is also working on the further 
development and implementation of data sharing solu-
tions."
"In cooperation with partners such as cities, 
municipalities and insurers, it tries to make data availa-
ble in a way that benefits the general public while pro-
tecting privacy — for example, by sharing vehicle data 
with cities in order to increase road safety."
"In addition, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously working on 
technologies to promote privacy, and it made new 
developments available internally in the reporting year."
"The aim is to include privacy-enhancing technologies, 
among others, in the product design process right from 
the start."
"Prevention of money laundering and terrorist 
financing 
Money laundering and the financing of terrorism cause 
tremendous damage to the economy and society."
"Even 
an accusation of money laundering can compromise a 
company’s reputation and could have financial conse-
quences for the Mercedes-Benz Group, as well as for its 
stakeholders."
"For this reason, the Mercedes-Benz Group established a 
two-pillar model (trade in goods and mobility services) 
which takes into account the different regulatory 
requirements in the area of goods trading on the one 
hand and the area of financial services on the other."
"Moreover, the Mercedes-Benz Group defines prevention 
and combating of money laundering and the financing 
of terrorism as central compliance goals in the Group’s 
Integrity Code."
"The integrated compliance approach also checks appli-
cable sanction lists and restrictions on certain goods 
and implements measures for the prevention of money 
laundering and the financing of terrorism."
"On the one 
hand, these measures aim to prevent supranational and 
national sanctions and goods-related embargoes from 
being violated or evaded."
"On the other, it seeks to com-
bat third-party activities that are suspected of involving 
money laundering, the financing of terrorism, organized 
crime and other types of corporate crime."
"Compliance risks
The Mercedes-Benz Group evaluates its companies and 
corporate departments systematically each year in 
order to reduce compliance risks."
"In this process, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group uses, for example, centrally 
available information about its companies, such as rev-
enue, business models and relations with business 
partners."
"If necessary, other locally sourced information 
is supplemented."
"The results of the compliance risk 
analysis form the basis of compliance risk management 
and are therefore also the basis for defining measures."
"Compliance programme 
The compliance programme comprises principles and 
measures that are designed to reduce compliance risks 
and counteract violations of laws and regulations."
"The 
individual measures are based on the knowledge 
gained through the Group’s systematic compliance risk 
analysis."
"These audits, which were based 
on the principles of appropriateness, implementation 
and effectiveness, were successfully completed for our 
CMS Corruption Prevention in late 2019, for our tCMS 
(focus on emissions) in late 2020 and for our CMS Anti-
trust in late 2021."
"The latter was the second such audit, 
the first having been conducted in 2016."
"The whistleblower system BPO
The Business & People Protection Office (BPO) whistle-
blower system enables all employees worldwide, as 
well as external informants, to report violations of the 
rules."
"The BPO is available around the clock to receive 
information, which can be sent by e-mail or normal mail 
or by filling out a special online form."
"External toll-free 
hotlines are also available in Brazil, Japan, South Africa 
and the United States."
"Reports can also be submitted 
anonymously if local laws permit this."
"In Germany, 
whistleblowers have access to additional contact points 
such as an external neutral intermediary and other 
external reporting channels (e.g."
"the federal govern-
ment’s external reporting office at the Federal Office of 
Justice, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s 
(BaFin’s) whistleblower office, and the whistleblower 
system of the Bundeskartellamt (federal competition 
authority)."
"The information provided to the BPO whistleblower sys-
tem enables the Mercedes-Benz Group to learn about 
potential risks and thus to prevent damage to the Group 
and its employees or to third parties, as well as to pro-
tect individuals who might be harmed by misconduct."
"A 
globally valid Group policy defines BPO procedures and 
the corresponding responsibilities."
"It aims to ensure a 
fair and transparent procedure that takes into account 
both the protection of the whistleblower and the princi-
ple of proportionality for the persons affected by the 
allegation."
"The policy also defines the standard by 
which the Mercedes-Benz Group assesses breaches of 
the rules and decides on the consequences."
"If, following a risk-based initial assessment, the BPO 
classifies an incident as a breach of regulations with a 
high risk for the Mercedes-Benz Group, its employees or 
other persons, it refers the case to an investigation unit."
"The BPO accompanies the subsequent investigation 
until the case is closed."
"Examples of high-risk rule vio-
lations include offences related to corruption, breaches 
of antitrust law and violations of anti-money laundering 
regulations, as well as infringements of binding techni-
cal provisions or environmental protection regulations."
"Personal matters, such as incidents of sexual harass-
ment or human rights violations, are also considered 
high-risk rule violations."
"The BPO refers information on all other breaches involv-
ing risk to the responsible department — such as HR, 
Corporate Security or Data Privacy."
"The relevant depart-
ments follow up the information and clarify the cases 
on their own responsibility."
"Examples include theft, 
breach of trust, and undue enrichment valued at less 
than €100,000 — if the violation does not fall into the 
category of corruption."
"In an effort to constantly increase trust in the BPO 
whistleblower system and make it even better known to 
employees, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses various 
communication measures to provide extensive informa-
tion materials in a variety of languages."
"In addition, the 
company regularly informs employees about the type 
and number of reported violations and makes case 
studies available in an anonymous form on a quarterly 
basis."
"Reported violations 
In the reporting year, 55 new cases were opened with 
75 persons affected by the allegation (previous year:  
58 cases/72 persons)."
"In total, 54 persons were proven 
to have committed violations with a high risk for the 
company, its employees or other persons."
"Of these, six 
violations belonged in the category of passive corrup-
tion."
"Six violations fell into the category of undue 
enrichment or theft in excess of €100,000, seven into 
the category of damage over €100,000."
"12 violations fell 
into the category of reputational damage."
"In 15 cases of 
violations, accusations of inappropriate behaviour of 
employees toward other employees were confirmed — 
e.g."
"violation of psychological/physical integrity, sexual 
harassment or racism."
"Eight confirmed violations with 
high risk referred to other categories."
"The personnel measures in 2023 included 
admonishments, warnings and terminations without 
notice."
"Sales partners and suppliers
The Mercedes-Benz Group expects not only its employ-
ees to comply with laws and regulations."
"The Group 
also places clear compliance requirements on its sales 
partners and suppliers, because it regards integrity and 
conformity with regulations as a precondition for trust-
based cooperation."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group formu-
lates in detail what it expects from its business partners 
in the Business Partner Standards (BPS) and specifically 
for its suppliers in the Responsible Sourcing Standards 
(RSS); both documents are publicly available on the 
Group website."
"In the selection of direct sales partners and in existing 
sales partnerships, the Mercedes-Benz Group ensures 
that its business partners comply with laws and 
observe ethical principles."
"For this purpose, we use a 
globally standardized, risk-based Sales Business Partner 
Due Diligence Process."
"All new sales partners are sub-
jected to a due diligence process."
"A partnership is only 
possible if this process is successfully completed."
"The 
risk-based review takes into account, among other 
things, the planned business model, the country risk 
and the involvement of third parties and government 
contacts."
"The concrete risks are determined using 
additional specific questionnaires."
"During the ongoing 
cooperation with the sales partners, the existing due 
diligence processes are reviewed on an ad hoc or cycli-
cal basis depending on the risks identified."
"Another 
component of the due diligence process is permanent 
monitoring, in which the Group continuously checks 
existing sales partners in relevant databases and valid 
sanctions lists in order to identify potential breaches of 
integrity."
"If a partner fails to comply with the Group 
standards or if there are breaches of integrity that can-
not be resolved, the Mercedes-Benz Group reserves the 
right to terminate the selection process or the coopera-
tion."
"In conjunction with the procurement departments, 
the Group is constantly enhancing the existing pro-
cesses for the selection of and cooperation with its 
suppliers."
"On the basis of the BPS and RSS standards and the 
Integrity Code, the Mercedes-Benz Group makes web-
based Compliance Awareness Modules (CAMs) avail-
able to both for sales business partners and suppliers."
"These modules are intended to sensitize them to rele-
vant integrity and compliance requirements such as 
those related to anti-corruption measures and technical 
Compliance."
"Through these measures, the Mercedes-
Benz Group also offers its sales business partners and 
suppliers extensive assistance for dealing with possible 
relevant compliance risks."
"The contents and topics of the training courses are tai-
lored to the roles and functions of the respective target 
group."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly analyses the 
need for its training programme, expands or adapts it as 
necessary and conducts evaluations."
"The expansion of electric mobility in particular is also 
putting a spotlight on the respect for human rights 
within the automotive supply chain, because the pro-
duction of battery cells requires the use of raw materi-
als such as lithium and cobalt."
"These raw materials 
often come from countries where there is a risk that 
they are mined under conditions that could be critical 
from a human rights standpoint."
"In addition to its own commitment to respecting 
human rights, the Mercedes-Benz Group is observing 
growing interest in the topic of human rights among 
consumers, civil society organizations, investors and 
rating agencies."
"Respect for human rights has key importance for the 
Mercedes-Benz Group and is an obligation as well as a 
mission for the Group."
"For this reason, upholding 
human rights is an area of action of its sustainable busi-
ness strategy."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also intro-
duced a corresponding risk-based system to uphold  
ongoing human rights due diligence obligation."
"The 
measurable targets and key figures for the system are 
defined in the sustainable business strategy."
"Policy commitment
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to ensuring 
that human rights are respected and upheld along the 
entire value chain in all Group companies and by part-
ners, particularly suppliers."
"The Principles of Social 
Responsibility and Human Rights reflect this self-com-
mitment."
"They supplement and specify the Integrity 
Code with respect to the principles of human rights and 
good working conditions and are binding for all manag-
ers and employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG as 
well as the consolidated Group companies worldwide."
"Organizational embedding 
Overarching activities relating to human rights issues 
are managed by the Mercedes-Benz Group AG execu-
tive division Integrity, Governance & Sustainability."
"This 
division is responsible for the Principles of Social 
Responsibility and Human Rights as well as for enhanc-
ing the human rights due diligence obligations within 
the Mercedes-Benz Group via the Group’s Human Rights 
Respect System (HRRS)."
"The responsible member of the 
Board of Management continues to develop the topic in 
line with the targets set by the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board."
"To this end, this member 
regularly obtains information and corresponding reports 
about the Company’s human rights activities."
"The Chief Compliance Officer of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group is also the Group’s Human Rights Officer."
"He is a 
member of the Group Sustainability Committee and 
reports to the Board of Management member responsi-
ble for Integrity, Governance & Sustainability."
"The 
Human Rights Officer is responsible for monitoring 
compliance with the Principles of Social Responsibility 
and Human Rights and the HRRS."
"He reports annually 
and as needed to the Mercedes-Benz Group AG Board 
of Management and other bodies on particularly rele-
vant human rights issues and the status of implementa-
tion of the Principles of Social Responsibility and 
Human Rights."
"Moreover, it works closely with the specialist units 
responsible for operational implementation of the com-
pany’s human rights due diligence obligations, and with 
the procurement units in particular."
"Human Rights Respect System (HRRS)
The HRRS is the Mercedes-Benz Group’s approach to 
fulfilling its human rights due diligence obligations."
"The HRRS should be understood as a due diligence 
cycle that basically consists of four steps: 1."
"Programme implementation, 3."
"It is designed to systematically 
identify risks and potential and actual negative impacts 
of business activities on the respect for human rights 
early on, avoid such effects and, if necessary, to initiate 
countermeasures."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to expand the 
HRRS step by step and also involves external stake-
holders and experts in this process."
"The stakeholders 
include rights holders such as employees and their 
representatives, as well as local residents."
"For example, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group also holds talks with interna-
tional NGOs and other organizations concerning the 
human rights risks arising from the extraction of certain 
raw materials."
"Social Compliance Management System
Through the Social CMS, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
identifies and addresses in particular those human 
rights risks that may arise in the workforces of its own 
Group companies."
"Employee rights are also addressed 
systematically and on a risk basis as part of the Social 
CMS."
"With the Social CMS, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
has integrated the issue of human rights into the 
Group-wide, systematic compliance risk management 
process for the Group companies."
"Supplier compliance risk management
As part of Supplier Compliance Risk Management 
(SCRM), the Mercedes-Benz Group conducts a risk 
assessment of its Tier 1 suppliers of its procurement 
departments for production materials, non-production 
materials and services at least once a year."
"Following 
an initial overarching risk assessment, the specific risks 
are determined using specific questionnaires."
"Should 
there be any indication revealed, the responsible pro-
curement department initiates an extensive examina-
tion of the situation."
"Identification of risk raw materials and services
In order to examine the risks associated with raw mate-
rials, the Mercedes-Benz Group first analysed the raw 
materials present in a vehicle and prioritized them on 
the basis of various factors."
"It has identified 24 critical 
raw materials."
"The list is reviewed annually on the basis 
of certain criteria, such as the country risk of the main 
mining countries, and updated if necessary."
"The Group plans to gradually examine these 24 critical 
raw materials in more detail between now and 2028 
and to define corresponding measures."
"This review 
consists of three steps:
1."
"Increasing transparency along the raw material supply 
chains — especially with regard to certain compo-
nents in a Mercedes-Benz, such as battery cells."
"To 
this end, Mercedes-Benz AG contacts, among others, 
the suppliers of the relevant components and asks 
them to disclose their supplier structure."
"Identification of risk hotspots in the raw material sup-
ply chains, e.g."
"on the basis of the specific risks in the 
individual mining countries."
"Definition and implementation of measures for the 
risk hotspots and review of whether they are effective 
over the long term."
"The 
achievement describes the progress in the overall pro-
cess of assessing all 24 raw materials, which includes 
fully complete and partially complete assessments."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also carefully checks the 
services it uses."
"Services that are particularly critical 
from a human rights perspective were identified as part 
of an impact assessment."
"The analysis resulted in a list 
of 27 services that are potentially critical in terms of 
human rights."
"We regularly conduct such risk mapping in order to 
address current developments and adapt our risk clas-
sification if necessary."
"The main human rights risks for 
the identified services are then determined on a step-
by-step and supply chain-specific basis and appropri-
ate measures are defined."
"Requirements for suppliers
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to the respon-
sible procurement of production materials, non-produc-
tion materials and services."
"The Group has incorporated the guidelines for sustaina-
ble supply chain management into the Responsible 
Sourcing Standards (RSS)."
"The goal here is to prevent, minimize or, if possible, 
bring to an end any negative impacts on human rights 
worldwide."
"The RSS are an integral part of all new 
orders for Tier 1 suppliers and the key contractual docu-
ment for minimum and sustainability requirements."
They are applied worldwide.
"Measures in the supply chain
The Mercedes-Benz Group uses a variety of measures 
and concepts to ensure the fulfilment of its due dili-
gence obligations in the supply chain."
"This includes 
training, preventive and corrective measures, risk analy-
ses, documentation for tracking and reporting purposes 
and effectiveness checks."
"With these instruments, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group intends to increase transparency 
in the supply chain and to ensure that internationally 
recognized human rights are upheld by business part-
ners as well, and that other social standards and envi-
ronmental requirements are met."
"The procurement 
units for production materials, non-production materi-
als and services play a key role here."
"In addition, Tier 1 suppliers were continuously screened 
for human rights violations and breaches of environ-
mental standards in the reporting year."
"The objective is 
to identify possible violations at an early stage on the 
basis of the latest supplier data."
"Should there be any 
indication revealed, the responsible procurement 
department initiates an extensive examination of the 
situation."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group also continued to conduct 
audits at Tier 1 suppliers in 2023, when it made 744 
on-site inspections."
"Among other things, anomalies were 
detected with regard to working hours, the communica-
tion of our sustainability standards and business ethics."
"If on-site inspections reveal deficiencies at a supplier, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group calls on the supplier to 
improve the relevant processes."
"If the supplier does  
not sufficiently remedy the criticised processes, the 
Group makes individual decisions regarding the next 
steps."
"In especially severe cases, these decisions can 
be made by management bodies."
"As a last resort, this 
can also lead to the discontinuation of the Mercedes-
Benz Group’s business relationship with a supplier."
"Raising awareness of human rights issues 
The Integrity Code and the Principles of Social Respon-
sibility and Human Rights are binding for all employees 
of the Mercedes-Benz Group as well as the consoli-
dated Group companies."
"Both are the subject of the 
mandatory basic online module Integrity@Work, which 
also covers topics related to integrity and compliance 
and must be completed every three years by all 
employees of the administration of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG as well as the consolidated Group companies."
"Since 2018, Mercedes-Benz AG has been cooperating 
with the Drive Sustainability initiative on the implemen-
tation of measures to make production material suppli-
ers in various focus countries more aware of the impor-
tance of sustainability and provide them with 
information on this issue."
"The Group selected the 
respective countries jointly with the initiative."
"Complaints management
The BPO whistleblower system enables employees and 
external whistleblowers worldwide to report rules viola-
tions."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group can thus become 
aware of potential human rights risks, can prevent dam-
age to the Group and its employees or to third parties, 
and protects individuals who might be harmed by mis-
conduct."
"With regard to supply chains, suspected violations of 
the Responsible Sourcing Standards can be reported 
via the BPO."
"If the misconduct or problem falls within 
the supplier’s area of responsibility, the supplier must 
take measures to immediately correct or eliminate the 
problem."
"This is also the logic behind 
the EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU 2020/852) that came 
into force in mid-2020."
"According to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regula-
tion, the Taxonomy-aligned proportions of revenue, 
capital expenditure and operating expenditure 
accounted for by environmentally sustainable economic 
activities are to be reported on an annual basis."
"Taxonomy-eligibility
Taxonomy-eligibility is assessed in an initial step."
"For an 
economic activity to be Taxonomy-eligible, that activity 
must be mentioned and explained in further detail in 
the delegated acts for the Taxonomy Regulation."
"The supplement to the delegated regulation includes 
new technical screening criteria that refer to both the 
existing economic activities and to new economic activ-
ities."
"Furthermore, a new EU delegated act (Commis-
sion Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486) containing 
economic activities and technical screening criteria rel-
evant for the remaining environmental objectives, was 
published in 2023."
"The economic activities relevant to the Mercedes-Benz 
Group in this context are to be found under the envi-
ronmental objectives climate change mitigation, climate 
change adaptation and transition to a circular economy."
"With regard to car 
manufacturer in particular and as an example, the 
document shows that the activity “manufacture of 
low-carbon vehicles” also includes vehicles with com-
bustion engines."
"For the Mercedes-Benz Group, this 
clarification by the European Commission means that 
the manufacture of all Group vehicles is to be classi-
fied as Taxonomy-eligible."
"Economic activity 6.6 essentially covers the remaining 
commercial vehicle portfolio of Mercedes-Benz Mobility 
after the spin-off and hive-down of the Daimler com-
mercial vehicle business (see Note 3 of the Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements)."
"Economic activity 6.15 relates to the establishment  
and operation of company-owned charging infrastruc-
ture by means of high-power charging stations, which 
are a prerequisite for zero tailpipe CO2 operation of 
zero-emissions road transport."
"The economic activities in specific energy sectors con-
tained in the supplement to the delegated act relating 
to the climate goals are only present to an immaterial 
extent at the Mercedes-Benz Group and are per-
formed exclusively in support of carrying out eco-
nomic activity 3.3."
"The economic activities contained in the delegated acts 
relating to climate change adaptation are only present 
to an immaterial extent at the Mercedes-Benz Group 
and are reported exclusively under the environmental 
objective climate change mitigation."
"The Taxonomy-eligible economic activity 5.4 that 
encompasses the sale of second-hand goods, which 
are purchased by the Mercedes-Benz Group from third 
parties, was identified on the basis of the descriptions 
in the delegated act relating to the transition to a cir-
cular economy."
"For the 2023 reporting year, simplified 
reporting obligations apply for economic activities 
newly introduced by the delegated acts."
"These stipulate 
that only reporting in relation to Taxonomy-eligibility is 
required."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group reports economic 
activity 5.4 as Taxonomy-eligible but not environmen-
tally sustainable."
"An assessment of Taxonomy-align-
ment has not been carried out."
"The individual economic activities are additionally to be 
classified according to enabling activities and transi-
tional activities."
"An enabling activity is an economic 
activity that makes a substantial contribution to one or 
more environmental objectives by directly enabling fur-
ther activities to also make a substantial contribution."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group this mostly applies to the 
economic activities 3.3 and 6.15."
"A transitional activity, 
in contrast, is an economic activity for which there is no 
technological and economically feasible low-carbon 
alternative but which makes a substantial contribution 
to climate change mitigation by supporting the transi-
tion to a climate-neutral economy."
"Taxonomy-alignment
In a further step, Taxonomy-alignment must be 
assessed for Taxonomy-eligible economic activities."
"Only Taxonomy-eligible activities can be considered as 
environmentally sustainable activities, or as being Tax-
onomy-aligned, provided they meet certain technical 
screening criteria."
"It must also be ensured that mini-
mum standards are met with regard to issues such as 
upholding human rights or combating corruption (mini-
mum safeguards)."
"At 
Mercedes-Benz Group all-electric vehicles as well as 
the majority of plug-in hybrid vehicles are below this 
threshold."
"These vehicles are hereafter referred to as 
“low-carbon vehicles”."
"With regard to economic activity 3.3, the fulfilment of 
these criteria was basically assessed at the level of 
those consolidated production sites where low-carbon 
vehicles or associated components are currently being 
manufactured or plans call for them to be manufac-
tured in the future."
"With regard to economic activity 6.5, the analysis of the 
criteria is to be performed on the basis of the low-car-
bon vehicles in the leasing and financing portfolio."
"In 
addition to Group-brand vehicles, the vehicle portfolio 
also includes vehicles from other manufacturers."
"The 
latter are reported as Taxonomy-eligible but not Taxon-
omy-aligned, as it is not currently possible to carry out 
an adequate DNSH analysis due to the current data 
availability."
"With regard to economic activity 6.15, the fulfilment of 
the DNSH criteria was reviewed at the level of the oper-
ational high-power charging stations."
"Climate change adaptation  
With regard to economic activity 3.3, the EU Taxonomy 
requires a climate risk analysis to be carried out."
"The analysis took into 
account climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and different time hori-
zons, including 2040."
"Adaptation measures were ana-
lysed on the basis of the results."
"In addition, the verificiation of the DNSH criteria for 
economic activity 6.5 is essentially based on the con-
sideration of use and environmental conditions, such  
as heat and cold requirements in the context of vehicle 
development and testing."
"The company has established 
environmental management systems at its own produc-
tion sites around the world in accordance with ISO 
14001."
"In addition, all German and the two European 
manufacturing locations in Kecskemet (Hungary) and 
Vitoria (Spain) have also been validated in accordance 
with EMAS."
"As part of the internal environmental risk 
assessment, consolidated production sites are evalu-
ated according to a number of factors, including those 
relating to water quality, in a five-year cycle."
"Recom-
mendations for minimizing risks are then drawn up, pri-
oritized and tracked."
"The Group also uses external data 
sources to identify sites that harbour potential risks 
relating to water scarcity."
"With regard to economic activity 6.15, the analysis shall 
assess that the use of the charging infrastructure does 
not give rise to any significant risk to the water quality 
and the water scarcity corresponding to the DNSH cri-
teria."
"When developing products, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group considers the concept of circular 
economy from the very start and has set itself the over-
arching goal of increasing its use of secondary materials 
in vehicles."
"In addition, the DNSH criteria for economic 
activity 6.5 are taken into account through the imple-
mentation of the legal requirements on recyclability and 
reusability for passenger car models and light commer-
cial vehicles."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is intensifying its efforts to 
use lower volumes of raw materials and other materials 
in its production operations."
"In accordance with the 
waste hierarchy, the company’s primary goal is to avoid 
waste."
"For its own production sites worldwide, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group has set reduction targets for fac-
tors such as total waste volume and waste volume for 
disposal per vehicle."
"Waste management is also a com-
ponent of the Group’s internal environmental risk 
assessment."
"For economic activity 6.15, the applicable DNSH criteria 
were analysed and checked for adherence."
"This 
includes the verification of the recycling or disposal of 
waste generated during construction and demolition."
"The implementation 
of internal processes for specification, approval and 
control is intended to ensure compliance with European 
regulations (according to Appendix C) and respective 
national legislations."
"The Global Automotive Declarable 
Substance List (GADSL) forms the basis for the prohibi-
tion and declaration requirement of substances in 
Mercedes-Benz products."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
also defines specifications for substitution analyses, 
and thus for the use of less critical hazardous sub-
stances."
"With regard to economic activity 6.5, the DNSH criteria 
refer to compliance with various product-related Euro-
pean regulations and directives."
"As a result, all-electric 
vehicles are currently considered in the Taxono-
my-aligned scopes of economic activity 6.5."
"For the assessment of the respective classes available 
on the market, the data of the European Product Data-
base for Energy Labelling (EPREL) shall be used."
"The 
time of market placement of the vehicles in the leasing 
and financing portfolio was used for the analysis, and a 
percentage share of the vehicles with the respective 
highest tyre classes according to EPREL was deter-
mined on the basis of a representative time period."
"This 
proportion is applied to the leasing and financing port-
folio of all-electric vehicles worldwide wherever the 
corresponding data is available."
"For economic activity 6.15, the applicable requirements 
from the Taxonomy Regulation on noise, vibration, dust 
and pollutants must be complied with."
"Fur-
thermore, environmental impact assessments or com-
parable audits outside the EU are carried out in the 
context of a new site or the extension of an existing site, 
if legally required."
"In addition, the Group has estab-
lished environmental management systems in accord-
ance with ISO 14001 at its production sites."
"During the reporting year, an environmental impact 
assessment was not required for the charging infra-
structure (economic activity 6.15) that was put into 
operation."
"The analysis of the DNSH requirements for economic 
activities 3.3 and 6.15 forms the basis for considering 
the taxonomy-compliant shares."
"With regard to eco-
nomic activity 6.5, the reductions due to the DNSH 
requirements of the environmental objective pollution 
prevention and control were taken into account in the 
Taxonomy-alignment of revenues and investments."
"Fulfilment of minimum safeguards 
An economic activity can only be classified as environ-
mentally sustainable within the meaning of the Taxon-
omy if it is also conducted in accordance with certain 
minimum standards that are based on international 
frameworks."
"The Taxonomy Regu-
lation itself does not further specify the standards."
"The report published by the Platform on Sustainable 
Finance in October 2022 (Final Report on Minimum 
Safeguards) assists companies with the interpretation 
of the scope and application of the minimum standards."
"This report forms the foundation for the application of 
minimum standards and the associated reporting at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The verification of compliance here basically 
involves demonstrating compliance with the existence of 
corresponding due diligence processes at the Group 
level and the fact that no judicial rulings relating to seri-
ous violations in the aforementioned areas have been 
made in the final instance."
"The individual figures for revenue, capital expenditure 
and operating expenditure are precisely allocated to a 
specific economic activity and environmental objective."
"The calculations for the key figures are based on the 
Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance  
with IFRS."
"The provision of comparative information, 
except where concerning the economic activities 
newly introduced by the delegated acts supplement-
ing the Taxonomy Regulation, was legally required in 
the reporting year."

"This applies to almost all of  
the revenue generated by the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"In the previous year, the revenues from the sale of  
second-hand goods, which Mercedes-Benz Group  
purchased from third parties, were assigned to the  
revenue from Taxonomy non-eligible activities."
"Since 
the reporting year, this revenue has been assigned to 
the economic activity 5.4."
"Compliance with 
the DNSH criteria was also monitored."
"For the major proportion of the revenue, in particular 
from the new and used vehicle business and leasing 
and sales financing activities, a direct attribution was 
made of the revenue accounted for by low-carbon  
vehicles."
"With regard to other revenue components, 
especially revenue from the spare parts business and 
service and maintenance contracts, or attribution of 
discounts granted for large procurement volumes, it is 
not possible to directly assign revenue to low-carbon 
vehicles."
"In these cases, suitable allocations were 
therefore used for the various revenue components."
"These classifications are based on current or historical 
vehicle sales data for the fleet that is currently on the 
market and data on production volumes."
"In the reporting 
year, the share of Taxonomy-aligned revenue increased 
to 14%1."
"The main reasons for this were an increase in 
unit sales of all-electric vehicles and the expansion of 
the product portfolio for low-carbon vehicles."
"The revenues shown below are included as an  
aggregation across the various economic activities."
"in 
the table Revenue), the Taxonomy-eligible revenue is 
considered in relation to the total revenue of the Group."
"In this process, the denominator takes into account the 
consolidated revenue generated by Group companies 
that are to be included in the calculations."
"The revenue, 
as disclosed in the consolidated statement of income,

"Taxonomy-eligibility of capital expenditure 
For the share of Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure 
(under A."
"in the table Capital expenditure), the Taxono-
my-eligible capital expenditure is considered in relation 
to the total relevant capital expenditure of the Group."
"Equipment on operating 
leases only takes into account vehicles acquired by deal-
ers from outside the Group."
"Goodwill acquired is not 
taken into account here."
"If a divestment is planned, capi-
tal expenditure on non-current assets is only taken into 
account until the point in time at which they were first 
classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5."
"The relevant additions to the assets to be taken into 
account amounted to €21,471 million in the reporting 
year (2022: €18,369 million) (see Notes 11, 12 and 13 in 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements)."
"Additions that result from a purchase in the context of 
a company acquisition are of secondary importance in 
the reporting year."
"According to the Commission Notice (2022/C 385/01) 
that the European Commission published on 6 October 
2022, the definition of an economic activity is charac-
terized by the achievement of an output."
"This applies to 
nearly all of our investments."
"Table Capital 
expenditure (p."
"121) shows the Taxonomy-aligned capi-
tal expenditure, aggregated across all economic activi-
ties."
"Compliance with the DNSH criteria was  
also monitored."
"The size of the share of Taxonomy-aligned expenditure 
of total capital expenditure is mainly due to the dispro-
portionately low share of Taxonomy-aligned vehicles  
in the additions to the equipment on operating leases."
"As a result, this share only partially reflects our invest-
ments in sustainable products for the future."
"When looking at Taxonomy-aligned investments in 
intangible assets (mainly in capitalized development 
costs) and property, plant and equipment of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group shows much higher shares of 
Taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure (table Capital 
expenditure)."
"For 
most of the capital expenditure relating to the industrial 
business, a direct attribution was made to all-electric 
vehicle projects."
"In the case of capital expenditure in 
low-carbon plug-in hybrids and assets that are used to 
produce both vehicles with combustion engines and 
low-carbon vehicles, suitable allocations based on 
planned vehicle sales figures for the respective model 
series or vehicle platforms were used."
"With regard to 
financial services, it is possible to match the additions 
to equipment on operating leases directly to low-car-
bon vehicles."
"At 24%1, the percentage of Taxono-
my-aligned capital expenditure was at the prior-year 
level."
"There was a sharp addition to capitalized devel-
opment costs, the effect of which was offset by the 
higher total capital expenditure compared to the previ-
ous year."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group this 
affects capital expenditure for economic activity 6.15 
Infrastructure enabling low-carbon road transport and 
public transport (charging infrastructure) that is 
expected to fall under the environmental objective cli-
mate change mitigation."
"The Board of Management of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG has adopted the planned 
capital expenditure for the construction of Mercedes-
Benz own high-power charging stations as part of the 
corporate planning covering the period 2024 to 2028."
"The CapEx plan contains total capital expenditure in the 
amount of around €1.4 billion (whereof €30 million are 
accounted for in the reporting year)."

costs as well as purchased services) relating to prop-

"These compo-
nents of the relevant operating expenditures were col-
lected exclusively from the manufacturing companies 
on the basis of materiality considerations."
"This applies to the operat-
ing expenditure described."
"Compliance with the DNSH criteria was also 
monitored."
"It was also not 
possible to directly match the other components of rel-
evant operating expenditure to low-carbon vehicles."
"The inclusion in the numerator was based on suitable 
allocations of current production volumes."
"The share of 
Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure was 32%1 in 
the reporting year."
"The reason for the lower proportion 
of Taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure is essen-
tially the decrease in non-capitalized research and 
development costs attributable to low-carbon vehicles 
with a simultaneous increase in the total non-capital-
ized research and development costs."
"1 	 The key figures were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate

"As a result, revenue was slightly above 
the prior-year figure."
"This was primarily due to improved 
pricing at the automotive segments."
"In the past year, the Group achieved EBIT on a par with 
the previous year."
"At the beginning of the year, it had 
expected EBIT to be slightly below the prior-year figure."
"The Group’s EBIT forecast was already raised during the 
year, primarily due to the positive results performance 
in the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment."
"The free cash flow of the industrial business even sig-
nificantly exceeded the previous year’s figure as a result 
of lower working capital than expected."
"At the begin-
ning of the reporting year, the figure had been expected 
to remain at the previous year’s level."
"The forecast was 
already raised during the year to a figure slightly above 
the previous year’s level."

The Mercedes-Benz CO2 pool not only includes newly registered Mercedes-Benz cars,  
but also vans that were registered as passenger cars and, since 2023, vehicles from  
the joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd."
"The average CO2 emissions  
are determined using the WLTP type test procedure."
"According to internal calculations, the average CO2 
emissions of the Mercedes-Benz CO2 pool1 in Europe 
(European Union, Norway and Iceland) amounted to 
109 g/km in the reporting year."
"The emissions were thus 
significantly below the prior-year value of 115 g/km."
"It should be noted that the internal calculation of the 
value of 109 g/km was the first time that vehicles from 
the joint venture smart Automobile Co., Ltd."
"were 
included in the Mercedes-Benz CO2 pool."
"Excluding 
these smart vehicles, the value of 111 g/km was only 
slightly below the previous year’s figure."
"This is due to  
a more difficult than expected market environment for 
electrified vehicles in Europe."
"Robust demand for Top-End and all-electric vehicles 
from Mercedes-Benz Cars supported the development 
in unit sales and revenue, which, as expected, remained 
at the previous year’s level."
"The segment had expected an adjusted return on sales 
of between 12 and 14%."
"Improved pricing, particularly in 
the first half of the year, combined with continued high 
cost discipline led to an adjusted return on sales of 
12.6%."
"This confirmed the assessment made at the 
beginning of the year."
"At 0.9, the adjusted cash conversion rate was also 
within the forecast range."
"Sustained cost discipline enabled investments in prop-
erty, plant and equipment, which at the start of the year 
had been expected to be significantly above the pri-
or-year level, to be held at the same level."
"Research and 
development expenditure was also significantly higher 
than in the previous year, because the new, electromo-
bility-oriented platform generation and the associated 
drive concept, as well as the focus on digitalization and 
automated driving, led to a higher-than-expected 
increase."
"The company had expected research and 
development expenditure to be slightly above the pri-
or-year level."
"A continued very high demand for 
Mercedes-Benz vans resulted in unit sales and revenue 
significantly above those of the previous year."
"This 
underlines the strategy of focussing on profitable 
growth in the premium segment."
"At the beginning of the 
year, unit sales were expected to be at the previous 
year’s level; revenue was expected to be slightly above 
the previous year’s level."
"This figure was thus 
slightly above the range of between 13% and 15%, 
which had already been raised significantly during the 
year."
"The adjusted cash conversion rate also increased to 1.0 
as a result of the business performance being signifi-
cantly better than expected at the beginning of the year."
"As expected, investments in property, plant and equip-
ment and research and development expenditure were 
significantly higher than in the previous year."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility closed 2023 within the 
expected range despite a declining interest margin due 
to higher interest rates and increased competition in 
the financial services sector."
"Furthermore, the business 
activities in Russia were sold as planned, but nonethe-
less negatively impacted results."
"The opening of the 
first Mercedes-Benz Charging Hubs in the fourth quarter 
laid the foundation for the Group’s own global high-
power charging network."
Contract volume was slightly above the prior-year level.
"At the beginning of the reporting year, Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility had expected contract volume to decline 
slightly."
"The main reasons for the deviation from the 
forecast were the growth in the area of dealer financing 
and higher average financing and leasing volumes for 
new contracts."
"Revenue at Mercedes-Benz Mobility was on a par with 
the previous year."
"The original forecast of a level signifi-
cantly below the previous year was exceeded due to 
higher customer income as a result of passing on 
increased interest rates and a higher average financing 
and leasing volume for new contracts."
"With an adjusted return on equity of 12.3%, the forecast 
range was achieved."

when it is exercised."
"The 
terms of the derivatives may not exceed 18 months and 
must be terminated at the latest on 7 July 2025."
"This authorization was made use of to acquire the Com-
pany’s own shares during the reporting period."
"With the

"to the other 
parties to the agreement (shareholders)."
"A change of control also occurs if 
competitors of the HERE Group or certain possible 
competitors of the HERE Group in the technology 
industry acquire a shareholding of at least 25% of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"If none of the other parties 
acquire these shares, the agreement gives them the 
right to dissolve There Holding B.V."
"A change of control is 
defined as the acquisition by a third party of more 
than 50% of the voting rights or shares, or the conclu-
sion of a control agreement over Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG by a third party."
"In the event of a change of 
control, the contract includes mechanisms that can 
lead to sole ownership by one of the shareholders 
(shoot-out process)."
"These plans are based 
on the premises the company sets regarding the eco-
nomic situation and the development of automotive 
markets."
"It involves assessments made by the Group, 
which are based on analyses by various renowned eco-
nomic research institutes, international organizations 
and industry associations, as well as on the internal 
market analyses of the Group sales companies."
"The premises regarding the economic situation and the 
development of automotive markets continue to be 
characterized by an exceptional degree of uncertainty."
"In addition to unexpected macroeconomic develop-
ments, uncertainties for the global economy and the 
business development of the Mercedes-Benz Group 
may arise in particular from geopolitical events and 
trade policy."
"Among them are the current Middle East 
conflict, the Russia-Ukraine war and other potential 
regional crises."
"Other uncertainties that are particularly 
worth mentioning include an exacerbation of tensions 
between the United States and China and a further 
deterioration of political relations between the Euro-
pean Union and China."
"Further supply chain disruptions and, in particular, 
availability bottlenecks for critical components remain 
significant risk factors."
"The risks and opportunities that can arise as a result of 
deviations from the forecasts of the development of the 
world economy and automotive markets that are pre-
sented below are described in the Risk and Opportunity 
Report."
"The continuous planning process makes it possible for 
the Group to ensure that available opportunities can be 
exploited and that the organization can respond appro-
priately to unexpected risks."
"This in turn means that 
expectations regarding anticipated business develop-
ment can be adjusted in line with the latest forecasts of 
the development of automotive markets."
"The world economy  
and ­
automotive markets
The world economy
The Group expects the world economy to continue to 
grow at a slower pace in 2024."
"This slowdown will mainly 
be driven by the major industrial countries, whose eco-
nomic development, at least in the first half of the 
year, will likely be affected by persistently high inter-
est rates."
"In contrast, the monetary easing cycle that 
started in numerous emerging markets in 2023, should 
serve to support economic growth in those countries."
"With regard to the euro zone, the absence of monetary 
and fiscal policy stimuli can be expected to lead to  
continued economic weakness in the first half of the 
year at least."
"Given the insufficient order situation and 
persistently high interest rates, no real recovery to 
speak of can be expected for industrial sectors in par-
ticular."
"Similarly to the situation in 2023, economic out-
put for the year as a whole is expected to increase only 
slightly in 2024."
"For the year as a whole, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
therefore expects the US economy to grow by less than 
in 2023."
"The Chinese economy is likely to be weighed down 
again in 2024 by the continued consolidation of the 
country’s real estate sector and by less dynamic 
demand from abroad."
"China can therefore be expected 
to record lower overall growth this year than in 2023."
"In the light of these developments, the growth of the 
world economy is expected to be 2 to 2.5% in the cur-
rent year — significantly below the long-term average."
"This is all the more likely in light of the fact that no posi-
tive effects to speak of can be expected in 2024 as a 
result of government stimulus measures or a further fall 
in prices for energy and raw materials."
"Automotive markets
These restrained macroeconomic conditions are likely 
to have an increasingly negative effect on the growth of 
automotive markets around the world."
"Last year, the 
normalization of global vehicle production and the 
reduction of order backlogs that had accumulated dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic had a favourable effect on 
sales development in various markets."
"This year, how-
ever, the impact of weaker consumer demand will likely 
become increasingly noticeable on the world’s automo-
tive markets."
"We can therefore expect to see only slight growth in the 
global car market compared with the previous year."
"Following a double-digit increase in 2023, a market vol-
ume only slightly above the prior year’s level is now 
expected for Europe in the current year."
"Unit sales for 
the US light vehicle market are also likely to slightly 
exceed the level recorded in the previous year."
"A slight 
increase in market volume is also expected for China."
"Growth in key van markets is expected to slow notice-
ably in 2024."
"In Europe, the market segment for mid-
size and large vans is likely to remain at the previous 
year’s level."
"The segment for small vans in Europe is 
expected to expand slightly."
"The US market for large 
vans will likely remain at the same level as in the prior 
year."
"On the other hand, significant growth can be 
expected for the mid-size van segment in China."
"Outlook for the  
key performance ­
indicators
Mercedes-Benz Group 
The Mercedes-Benz Group expects to generate revenue 
in 2024 that is on the level of the previous year."
"Based on the development of the different segments, 
the Group expects EBIT to be slightly lower than in the 
previous year in what will remain a challenging market 
environment."
"The free cash flow of the industrial business reached 
a very high level in 2023."
"The automotive segments are 
also planning significantly higher investments in prop-
erty, plant and equipment than in the previous year."
"As a result, the Mercedes-Benz Group expects the free 
cash flow of the industrial business in 2024 to be 
slightly below the prior-year level."
"The share of electri-
fied vehicles (xEV) in total unit sales is expected to 
range between 19% and 21%."
"The development of revenue at Mercedes-Benz Cars is 
in line with the sales forecast and is expected to be at 
the previous year’s level."
"The adjusted cash conversion rate for Mercedes-Benz 
Cars is expected to be within a range of between 0.8 
and 1.0 for the year 2024."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars anticipates a significant increase 
in investments in property, plant and equipment in 
2024."
"The key drivers here are primarily investments in 
new vehicle architectures, the electrification of the 
product portfolio, and the expansion of digitalization."
"The transformation towards a sustainable business 
strategy means that research and development costs 
in 2024 are expected to be at the previous year’s level."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans
Due to macroeconomic uncertainties, Mercedes-Benz 
Vans expects unit sales in 2024 to be slightly below 
the prior-year level."
"The share of electrified vehicles 
(xEV) in total unit sales is expected to be increased to 
between 6% and 8% by the all-electric models eCitan 
and EQT (WLTP: combined energy consumption 100 
kWh/km: 20,7-19,3; combined CO2 emissions: 0 g/km; 
CO2 class: A) and the new eSprinter."
"Due to its focus on profitable growth, Mercedes-Benz 
Vans expects revenue in 2024 to be at the prior-year 
level."
"The continued high level of cost discipline is having 
positive effects, while opposing advance expenditure 
for the new all-electric van architecture VAN.EA is hav-
ing a negative impact."
"In total, this results in a planned 
adjusted return on sales of between 12% and 14%."
"The adjusted cash conversion rate for the Mercedes-
Benz Vans division is expected to be within a range of 
0.6 to 0.8."
"The Mercedes-Benz Vans division anticipates a signifi-
cant increase in investments in property, plant and 
equipment in 2024."
"This increase will be primarily 
driven by the further transition to an all-electric 
Mercedes-Benz Vans fleet of the next generation."
"Mercedes-Benz Vans also expects a significant 
increase in the area of research and development 
expenditure in 2024."
"The focus of research and 
development is on electric drive systems, automated 
driving and digitalization."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility expects a slight increase in 
new business in 2024, while contract volume and 
revenue will remain at the prior-year level."
"Adjusted return on equity is expected to be within a 
range of between 10% and 12% in 2024."
"The forecast 
decrease compared to the previous year is mainly due 
to an expected drop in interest result and expenses for 
the further expansion of charging activities."
"The free cash flow 
from the industrial business is also taken into consider-
ation when setting the dividend."
"At the Annual General Meeting to take place on 8 May 
2024, the Board of Management and the Supervisory 
Board will propose the payment of a dividend of €5.30 
per share entitled to a dividend for the year 2023 (2022: 
€5.20)."
"Subject to further share buybacks prior to the 
Annual General Meeting 2024, this represents a total 
distribution of €5.5 billion (2022: €5.6 billion)."
"2	 Replaces the previous key performance indicator, CO2 emissions of the new car fleet in Europe, from 2024."
"The Group believes that the focus 
on vehicles in the Top-End and Core product categories 
will make it possible to achieve sustainable solid 
results, even in a challenging market environment."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is consistently moving 
ahead with its efficiency measures in order to ensure  
it can cover the high level of advance expenditure that  
is required for the necessary transformation towards 
an all-electric future."
"Furthermore, the Group believes 
that the gradual and sustainable improvement of price 
and product positioning, especially with regard to the 
electrified vehicle portfolio, will enable it to overcome 
the challenges it will face as part of the transformation 
towards an all-electric future."
"Against this backdrop and supported by the Group’s 
brand strengths and innovative capabilities, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group looks forward with confidence  
to the year 2024."
"The Group under-
stands a risk as the danger that events, developments 
or actions will prevent the Group or one of its segments 
from achieving its targets."
"The risks include both mone-
tary and non-monetary risks."
"At the same time, it is important to identify opportuni-
ties in order to safeguard and enhance the competitive-
ness of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The Group defines 
an opportunity as the possibility, due to events, devel-
opments or actions, of safeguarding or surpassing the 
planned targets of the Group or of a segment."
"In order to identify business risks and opportunities at 
an early stage and to assess and manage them actively, 
the Board of Management applies appropriate and 
effective management and control systems, which have 
been brought together in an overall risk and opportunity 
management system."
"Risks and opportunities are not 
offset."
"Risk and opportunity  
management system and  
internal control system
Overview of the Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s control and monitoring  
system
The Mercedes-Benz Group as a whole pursues the 
three-line model to ensure an integrated control and 
monitoring system."
"The operating units in the form of the individual seg-
ments, Group functions, organizational units and Group 
companies form the first line."
"Their task is to ensure the 
implementation of internal and external guidelines, and 
they are responsible for the implementation of controls, 
operational risk management and risk management 
processes in their respective units."
"In the second line, the risk management system, the 
accounting-related internal control system, the compli-
ance management system, Group Security and Global 
Cyber & Information Security act as governance func-
tions."
"They define the corresponding minimum requirements 
and standards for methods, processes and systems for 
use in the first line and set the framework for coopera-
tion."
"Their tasks also include regular reporting to the 
Board of Management and the Supervisory Board."
"They 
also support the first line in the corresponding imple-
mentation."
"In the third line, Corporate Audit monitors the appro-
priateness and effectiveness of the implemented  
processes and the governance functions of the first 
and second lines through independent and risk-ori-
ented audits."
"It monitors whether the statutory condi-
tions and the Group’s internal policies concerning the 
control and risk management system of the Group are 
adhered to and the associated processes are appro-
priately designed."
"If required, measures are initiated in 
cooperation with the respective management."
"It is chaired by the 
members of the Board of Management of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG responsible for Finance & Controlling/
Mercedes-Benz Mobility and Integrity, Governance & 
Sustainability."
"The Corporate Audit 
department contributes material findings on the inter-
nal control and risk management system."
"The Board of Management, Audit Committee and 
Supervisory Board are informed regularly and as 
needed about potential significant control weaknesses, 
the appropriateness and effectiveness of the imple-
mented controls and the risk situation."
"The Audit Com-
mittee and the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the Supervisory Boards of Mercedes-
Benz AG and Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG are responsi-
ble for monitoring the internal control and risk manage-
ment system, including its appropriateness and 
effectiveness."
"In addition, in 
the context of the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements, they report to the Audit Committee and the 
Supervisory Board on any significant weaknesses that 
have been recognized in the accounting-related internal 
control and risk management system."
"This also includes risks and opportu-
nities related to environmental and employee issues as 
well as social factors (environmental, social and gov-
ernance — ESG)."
"The opportunity management system at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group is based on the risk management 
system."
"The objective of opportunity management is to 
recognize the possible opportunities arising in business 
activities resulting from positive developments at an 
early stage, and to use them in the best possible way 
for the Group by taking appropriate measures."
"By taking 
advantage of opportunities, planned targets should be 
met or exceeded."
"The risk and opportunity management system is inte-
grated into the value-based management and planning 
system of the Mercedes-Benz Group and is a fixed com-
ponent of the overall planning, management and 
reporting process in the companies, segments and cor-
porate functions."
"The responsibility for operational risk management and 
for the risk management processes is borne by the first 
line and thus by the segments, corporate functions, 
organizational units and companies."
"They report on the 
specific risks and opportunities to the next-higher level 
unit on a regular basis."
"Significant unexpected risks 
must be reported immediately."
"Risks and opportunities 
are managed within the Group by means of measures 
taken by the units responsible."
"The profitability of a 
measure is assessed before its implementation."
"The possible impact and probability of occurrence of all 
risks and opportunities and the related measures that 
have been initiated are continually monitored."
"This 
information is passed on to Group Risk Management for 
reporting to the Board of Management, the Audit Com-
mittee and the Supervisory Board."
"Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG monitors implementation by the segments as 
part of its legal, regulatory and compliance functions."
"As part of the planning process, risks and opportunities 
are recorded within an observation horizon of up to five 
years."
"Matters that have already been fully taken into 
account in planning or for which a provision has been 
recognized are not considered in connection with the 
risk management process."
"In addition, strategic risks 
and opportunities are also taken into account in the risk 
management process."
The Risk and Opportunity Report relates to 2024.
"The 
assessment of individual risks and opportunities takes 
place on the basis of their probability of occurrence and 
possible impact on the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Multiply-
ing the probability of occurrence by the possible impact 
results in the expected value, which forms the basis for 
the classification in risk and opportunity categories."
"In 
principle, the quantification of risks and opportunities in 
this report is carried out by summarizing the expected 
values of the individual risks and opportunities in cate-
gories."
"The assessment of the level of risks and oppor-
tunities takes into account both planned and already 
effective risk-reducing measures (net view) and is con-
sidered in relation to EBIT, unless otherwise indicated."
"Risk and opportunity management is based on the prin-
ciple of completeness."
"This means that all identified 
risks and opportunities are incorporated into the risk 
management process via the operating units of the seg-
ments, the significant associated companies, joint ven-
tures and joint operations as well as the corporate 
departments."
"The scope of consolidation for risk and 
opportunity management generally corresponds to the 
scope of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The 
risks are compared with the reported equity of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group as a risk cover."
"In identifying sustainability-related risks and oppor-
tunities, Mercedes-Benz Group AG is guided by the 
topics identified by the materiality assessment and thus 
includes the areas of action of the sustainable business 
strategy, for which concrete goals have been assigned."
"ESG-related risks associ-
ated with business activities, business relationships 
and products and services, and which are very likely to 
have a serious negative impact on non-financial 
aspects in accordance with Section 289c of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB), are not currently apparent."
"Climate-related risks and opportunities in connec-
tion with the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) are associ-
ated with environmental issues and are thus also iden-
tified and assessed as part of the risk management pro-
cess."
"Internal control system
The Mercedes-Benz Group’s internal control system 
encompasses, in addition to the accounting-related 
internal control system, controls for further business 
processes."
"There are also internal controls for Group-
wide processes of Corporate Security, Global Cyber & 
Information Security, and the Group-wide compliance 
management system."
"Sustainability-related aspects are 
also part of the internal control system."
"Moreover, the 
structure and processes of the internal control system 
are independently checked by Corporate Audit."
"The security risk management of Corporate Security is 
integrated into the risk management system of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The aim is to identify and evalu-
ate security-relevant risks at the company’s global loca-
tions on the basis of a risk-oriented view and to control 
them by means of mitigating measures."
"To this end, 
Corporate Security implemented internal controls for 
various security-related issues."
"These include the areas 
of property security, fire protection and crisis manage-
ment and serve to protect the lives and physical integ-
rity of people and to protect company assets, business 
processes and company knowledge."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group operates an Information 
Security Management System (ISMS) with the aim of 
adequately protecting important information and criti-
cal IT services."
"The ISMS is based on internationally 
recognized standards and is continuously developed 
further."
"Operationally, the ISMS is supported by proac-
tive and reactive operational measures."
"One focus of the reactive 
operational measures is the Cyber Intelligence & 
Response Center, which is staffed around the clock to 
defend against cyber attacks and deal with cyber secu-
rity incidents."
"The compliance management system, which has an 
interface to the risk management system, is aligned 
with the risk situation of the Mercedes-Benz Group and 
aims to promote rule-compliant behaviour within the 
company."
"The compliance management system makes 
a significant contribution to the integration of compli-
ance into our operating business units and their pro-
cesses."
"Further information on the compliance manage-
ment system of the Mercedes-Benz Group can be found 
in the Non-Financial Declaration chapter."
"As of the reporting date, taking into 
account the scope of the business operations and the 
risk situation of the company, in all material respects 
there are no indications of an overall inappropriateness 
or ineffectiveness of the internal control and risk man-
agement system."
"The effectiveness of any risk management and control 
system is subject to inherent limitations."
"No system — 
even if it has been assessed as appropriate and effec-
tive — can guarantee that all risks that actually occur 
will be detected in advance or that all process viola-
tions will be excluded under all circumstances."
"The internal control system with regard to the 
accounting process has the objective of ensuring the 
appropriateness and effectiveness of accounting and 
financial reporting."
"The system 
includes principles and procedures as well as preven-
tive and detective controls."
"The effectiveness of the internal control system with 
regard to the accounting process is systematically eval-
uated."
"It begins with a risk analysis and a control defini-
tion with the aim of identifying significant risks for the 
accounting and financial reporting processes in the 
main legal entities and corporate functions."
"The neces-
sary controls are then defined and documented in 
accordance with Group-wide guidelines."
"In order to 
assess the effectiveness of the controls, tests are car-
ried out regularly on the basis of random samples."
"These form the basis for a self-assessment of whether 
the controls are appropriately designed and effective."
"The results of this self-assessment are documented and 
reported in a Group-wide IT system."
"Identified control 
weaknesses are eliminated, taking into account their 
potential impact."
"The selected legal entities and corpo-
rate functions confirm the effectiveness of the internal 
control system with regard to the accounting process at 
the end of the annual cycle."
"In general, the reporting 
of risks and opportunities not covered in the Outlook 
takes place in relation to the individual segments 
Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mercedes-Benz Vans and 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"If no segment is explicitly 
mentioned, the risks and opportunities described relate 
to all the segments."
"Based on the expected value, the 
reported risks and opportunities per category are 
aggregated into the levels “low”, “medium” and “high” 
for the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"In addition to the risks and opportunities described 
below, risks and opportunities that are not yet known or 
classified as not material can also influence profitability, 
cash flows and financial position in the future."
2	 The classification of legal risks and tax risks and opportunities is shown in the table for the first time as of 31 December 2023.
"The 
assessment of market risks and opportunities is linked 
to forecasts about the overall economic conditions and 
the development of the automotive markets in which 
the Mercedes-Benz Group is active."
"These assumptions 
are described in detail in the “Outlook” section."
"The 
possibility of markets developing better or worse than 
in the internal forecasts and assumptions, or of chang-
ing market conditions, generally exists for all segments 
of the Group."
"Possible declines in vehicle sales may be caused in 
particular by an unfavourable macroeconomic environ-
ment for the Mercedes-Benz Group and in the context 
of political or economic uncertainties."
"In addition to 
weaker economic growth overall, factors such as high 
energy prices, high inflation and interest rates, and vol-
atile exchange rates may lead to market uncertainty or 
a loss of purchasing power and have a negative impact 
on demand in the automotive sector."
"A lower-than-ex-
pected market acceptance of electric vehicles can also 
lead to risks in the development of unit sales and have 
a negative impact on earnings."
"This could also endanger 
the achievement of specific CO2 targets."
"Industrial pol-
icy measures to strengthen local value creation in vari-
ous countries, as well as government purchase 
incentives for locally produced electric vehicles, can 
result in competitive disadvantages and declining vehi-
cle sales in the respective markets."
"The development of 
markets, unit sales and inventories is continually ana-
lysed and monitored by the automotive segments; if 
necessary, specific marketing and sales programmes 
are implemented."
"Volatilities with regard to market developments can 
also lead to the overall market or regional conditions for 
the automotive industry developing better than 
assumed in the internal forecasts and premises, result-
ing in business opportunities in the market."
"Opportuni-
ties may also arise from an improvement in the compet-
itive situation or a more positive development of 
demand."
"The utilization of opportunities is supported 
by sales and marketing campaigns."
"The launch of new products by competitors, more 
aggressive pricing policies and less effective pricing for 
products such as electric vehicles can lead to increas-
ing competitive and price pressure in the automotive 
segments and have a negative impact on profitability."
"The discontinuation or reduction of government subsi-
dies for electric vehicles can also negatively affect their 
pricing and cut profit margins."
"There is also a risk of 
delayed market introduction of new technologies in 
vehicles."
"Continuous monitoring is carried out in order 
to recognize risks at an early stage."
"Depending on the 
situation, product-specific and possibly regionally dif-
ferent measures are taken to support weaker markets."
"Opportunities exist in particular in the Mercedes-Benz 
Cars segment due to better-than-planned effective 
pricing of vehicles."
"In connection with the sale of vehicles, the Mercedes-
Benz Group offers customers a wide range of financ-
ing and leasing options."
"The resulting risks for the 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment are mainly due to 
borrowers’ worsening creditworthiness, so receivables 
might not be recoverable in whole or in part because  
of customers’ insolvency (default or credit risk)."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group counteracts credit risks by 
means of creditworthiness checks on the basis of 
standardized scoring and rating methods, the collater-
alization of receivables, and effective risk manage-
ment with a firm focus on monitoring both internal 
and macroeconomic leading indicators."
"In connection with leasing agreements, risks and 
opportunities also arise due to the development of the 
used vehicle markets."
"These result when the market 
value of a leased vehicle at the end of the agreement 
term differs from the residual value that was originally 
calculated and forecast on the basis of specific 
assumptions at the time the agreement was concluded 
and used as a basis for the leasing instalments."
"Residu-
al-value management processes have been defined to 
counteract these risks relating to vehicles’ residual 
values."
"Depending on the region and the current mar-
ket situation, the measures taken generally include con-
tinuous market monitoring as well as, if required, 
price-setting strategies or sales promotion measures 
designed to regulate vehicle inventories."
"Risks and opportunities relating to the legal and 
political framework 
Risks and opportunities from the legal and political 
framework have a considerable influence on the 
Mercedes-Benz Group’s future business success."
"Regu-
lations concerning vehicles’ emissions, fuel consump-
tion, safety and certification, as well as tariff aspects 
and taxes in connection with the sale or purchase of 
vehicles or vehicle parts, play an important role."
"Geo-
political tensions can also have a significant impact on 
the business activities of an international company 
such as the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group constantly monitors the 
development of the legal and political framework and 
attempts to anticipate foreseeable requirements and 
long-term objectives at an early stage in the product 
development process."
"In particular, changes in the legal 
and political framework at short notice can be associ-
ated with additional costs or higher investments."
"Legal limits on the fuel consumption and/or CO2 emis-
sions of car fleets exist in many markets, although the 
target values differ from market to market."
"Non-compli-
ance with regulations applicable in the various markets 
might result in significant penalties and reputational 
harm, and might even mean that vehicles with conven-
tional drive systems could not or could no longer be 
registered in the relevant markets."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group counteracts this risk through the transformation 
towards electric mobility and the associated realign-
ment of its product portfolio."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans face the described risks with 
respect to regulations concerning mandatory targets for 
the average fleet fuel consumption and CO2 emissions 
of new vehicles especially in the markets of China, 
Europe and the United States."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group gives these targets due consideration in its prod-
uct and sales planning."
"The market success of alterna-
tive drive systems is greatly influenced not only by cus-
tomer acceptance but also by regional market 
conditions such as the battery-charging infrastructure, 
state support and tax conditions."
"Political tensions and the associated danger of geopo-
litical conflicts continue to be high and are associ-
ated with far-reaching risks for the business develop-
ment of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"A further escalation and possible geo-
graphical expansion of the Russia-Ukraine war could 
especially have a negative impact on purchasing and 
logistics processes and on the production and sales 
programme."
"A possible bottleneck in energy supply in 
the EU could also lead to potential production losses 
at the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans 
plants."
"For example, setting up or expanding 
production facilities, increasing local purchasing or 
introducing a requirement to carry out local research 
and development can result in significantly increased 
investment or higher running costs."
"In addition, barriers 
to market access such as more difficult or delayed cer-
tification processes or very complicated tariff proce-
dures can make it more difficult to import into those 
countries."
"Investing in those countries can limit the 
impact of protectionist measures."
"Procurement market risks and opportunities 
Risks and opportunities relating to procurement arise 
for the automotive segments in particular from fluctua-
tions in prices of commodities, raw materials and 
energy."
"Certain raw materials and components are 
required for the manufacture of vehicles and parts and 
are purchased on the world market."
"The level of costs 
depends on the price development of commodities, 
raw materials and energy, and can result in both oppor-
tunities and risks for the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"For 2024, there are still risks from inflation-related 
increases in raw material and energy prices, which 
could lead to higher procurement costs."
"Furthermore, 
intense competition for specific raw materials in the 
course of the introduction of new technologies can lead 
to increasing costs or possible shortages in the supply 
chain."
"Raw-material markets can always be impacted  
by uncertainties and political crises — combined with 
possible supply bottlenecks — as well as by volatile 
demand for specific raw materials."
"The ability to pass 
on the higher costs of commodities and other materials 
in the form of higher prices for manufactured vehicles is 
limited because of strong competitive pressure in the 
international automotive markets."
"Rising raw-material 
prices may therefore have a negative impact on the 
profit margins of the vehicles sold and thus lead to 
lower earnings in the respective segment."
"In order to 
counteract possible loss of revenue, the Mercedes-
Benz Group continuously monitors the development of 
raw-material and energy prices and is in close touch 
with suppliers."
"Company-specific  
risks and opportunities 
Risks and opportunities from research  
and development 
Technical developments and innovations are of key 
importance for the safe and sustainable mobility of the 
future."
"The transformation towards electric mobility and 
the comprehensive digitalization of vehicles has 
resulted in ambitious development targets and the mar-
ket launch of new technologies."
"In addition to the 
resulting opportunities, decisions in favour of certain 
technologies and the continuously growing scope of 
emission, consumption and safety requirements to be 
met are associated with risks."
"There are risks that vehicles cannot be developed 
within the planned time frame, in the appropriate qual-
ity or at the specified costs."
"This is particularly the case 
with regard to electric mobility and increasing digitali-
zation as well as software in the vehicle architecture."
"There is also a risk that certain digital functions could 
be launched on the market later than planned."
"Supply 
chain disruptions can also lead to delays in vehicle 
development processes and postpone the launch of 
individual model series."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
counters these risks by continuously and systematically 
monitoring all vehicle projects."
"In 2020, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz 
USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements with various  
US authorities to settle civil and environmental claims 
regarding emission control systems of certain diesel 
vehicles, which have taken legal effect."
"If the obliga-
tions from the settlements are not complied with, there 
will be the risk that cost-intensive measures will have 
to be taken and/or significant stipulated penalties will 
become due."
"The risks from research and development have risen 
from “low” to “medium” due to the increasing electrifi-
cation and digitalization of the vehicle portfolio."
"The launch of new products involves risks with regard 
to the availability of required components, the scope of 
equipment and the necessary production capacities — 
especially in the course of the transformation toward 
electric mobility and the integration of new technology."
"To reduce the attendant risks, the related processes are 
continuously evaluated and improved."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group recognizes 
appropriate provisions for warranty and goodwill cases."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that recalls and 
field measures will lead to expenses."
"Possible claims in 
connection with such risks are examined and, if neces-
sary, the appropriate measures are initiated for the 
affected products."
"Possible production interruptions that were still associ-
ated with the Covid-19 pandemic and the related uncer-
tainties have become less likely in the meantime."
"As a 
result, the production risks are reduced from “medium” 
to “low”."
"Opportunities 
may arise, for example, through the implementation of 
efficiency-enhancing measures in internal logistics pro-
cesses."
"Possible interruptions in global supply chains, espe-
cially those caused by bottlenecks for electronic com-
ponents and other important intermediate goods, can 
cause bottlenecks at Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans."
"To avoid such bottleneck situa-
tions for intermediate goods, scarce capacities are 
countered by planning ahead."
"Lack of availability and 
quality problems with certain vehicle parts can lead to 
production downtimes and cause costs that result in 
negative effects on profitability."
"As a globally operating 
company with an international production and sales 
network, the Mercedes-Benz Group is dependent on 
functioning and efficient logistics processes."
"In particu-
lar, capacity restrictions or surcharges for the transpor-
tation of vehicles can disrupt logistics processes, 
increase their costs and have a negative impact on the 
company’s results."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-
Benz Vans analyse these risks on an ongoing basis."
"Supplier management is undertaken for the prevention 
of risks with the aim of ensuring the quantity and qual-
ity of the components required to produce the vehicles."
"The financial situation of some suppliers remains diffi-
cult."
"The reasons for this are continuing uncertainties in 
connection with high commodity, raw-material and 
energy prices, as well as the lack of availability of com-
ponents."
"As a result, production stoppages are possi-
ble along the entire supply chain and could prevent 
vehicles from being completed and delivered to cus-
tomers on time."
"Supplier risk management aims to 
identify potential financial bottlenecks at suppliers at 
an early stage and to initiate suitable countermeasures."
"Specifically, depending on the warning signals recorded 
and the internal classification, regular reporting dates 
on which key performance indicators are reported to 
the Mercedes-Benz Group and any support measures 
can be determined if necessary, are agreed upon with 
suppliers."
"Risks may also 
arise from uncertainties in the planned quantities."
"This 
could have negative effects on profitability."
"Information technology risks and opportunities
The systematically pursued digitalization strategy ena-
bles the Mercedes-Benz Group to utilize new opportu-
nities to increase customer utility and the value of the 
company."
"Nonetheless, the high degree of penetration 
of all business units by information technology (IT) also 
harbours risks for our business and production pro-
cesses and the units’ products and services."
"Extensive 
changes in the existing system landscape, for example 
the focus on strategic partnerships for the transforma-
tion of the IT infrastructure, can also lead to risks."
"The ever-growing threat from cybercrime and the 
spread of aggressive malicious code brings risks that 
can affect the availability, integrity and confidentiality 
of information and IT-supported operating resources."
"Despite extensive precautions, in the worst-case sce-
nario this can lead to a temporary interruption of 
IT-supported business processes with severe negative 
effects on the Group’s earnings."
"In addition, the loss or 
the misuse of sensitive data may under certain circum-
stances lead to a loss of reputation."
"In particular, 
stricter regulatory requirements such as the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation and related legislation may, 
among other things, give rise to claims by third parties 
and result in costly regulatory requirements and penal-
ties with an impact on earnings."
"It is essential for the globally active Mercedes-Benz 
Group and its wide-ranging business and production 
processes that information is available and can be 
exchanged in an up-to-date, complete and correct form."
"The internal IT security framework is oriented according 
to international standards and also draws on industry 
standards and good practices for its protective meas-
ures."
"New regulatory requirements for cyber security 
and cyber security management systems are taken into 
account in the further development of processes and 
policies."
"Appropriately secure IT systems and a reliable 
IT infrastructure must be used to protect information."
"Cyber threats must be identified and dealt with as 
appropriate for their criticality over the entire life cycle 
of the applications and the IT systems."
"Special atten-
tion is paid to risks that in the event of their occurrence 
give rise to an interruption of business processes due 
to IT system failures and to the loss and the falsification 
of data."
"The advancing digitalization and networking of 
the means of production is accompanied by coordi-
nated technical and organizational security measures."
"Due to growing requirements concerning the confiden-
tiality, integrity and availability of data, the Mercedes-
Benz Group has implemented various preventive and 
corrective measures so that the related risks, such as 
possible reputational damage, are minimized."
"For exam-
ple, the Group reduces potential disruptions to opera-
tional processes in computer centres by mirroring data, 
decentralizing data storage, maintaining off-site data 
backups and configuring IT systems for high availability."
"Emergency plans are drawn up and employees are 
trained and regularly made aware in order to remain 
capable of action."
"Specific threats are analysed and 
countermeasures are coordinated at a globally active 
Cyber Intelligence and Response Centre."
"The protection 
of products and services against the danger of hacking 
and cybercrime is continually further developed."
"The information technology risks are increasing from 
“low” to “medium”."
"The level of digitalization at the 
Mercedes-Benz Group and its suppliers is constantly 
increasing and is facing an ever greater external threat 
situation worldwide."
"Despite the stringent implementa-
tion of proactive and reactive measures, this leads to 
an increased assessment of IT risk."
"The Group’s 
future success also depends on the extent to which it 
succeeds over the long term in recruiting, integrating 
and retaining specialist employees."
"The established 
human resources instruments take such personnel risks 
into consideration."
"One focus of human resources man-
agement is the targeted personnel development and 
further training of the workforce."
"Among other things, 
employees benefit from a wide range of training oppor-
tunities and the transparency created within the frame-
work of performance management."
"In order to remain 
successful as a company, the way we work together and 
our leadership culture undergo continuous develop-
ment."
"Risks exist in particular due to upcoming negotiations 
on collective bargaining conditions and the associated 
potential loss of production."
"Besides the demographic 
development, the digital transformation also requires 
that the company continues to adapt to changes and 
derives measures such as securing a qualified next 
generation of specialists and managers, especially with 
regard to technical developments."
"This requirement is 
addressed through various measures, including tar-
geted qualification."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group counters 
economic, market and competitive fluctuations by 
means of established time and flexibility instruments in 
order to react appropriately to the situation."
"Coopera-
tion and investments also make up an important pillar 
in connection with the provision of mobility solutions."
"Especially with new technologies, these shareholdings 
help us utilize synergies and improve cost structures in 
order to respond successfully to the competitive situa-
tion in the automotive industry."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group generally participates in the 
risks and opportunities of shareholdings in line with its 
equity interest, and is also subject to share-price risks 
and opportunities if such companies are listed on a 
stock exchange."
"After the spin-off and hive-down of the 
Daimler commercial vehicle business, this also applies 
to the Group’s remaining minority shareholding in 
Daimler Truck Holding AG."
"The remeasurement of a holding can lead to risks and 
opportunities for the segment to which it is allocated."
"Furthermore, ongoing business activities, especially the 
integration of employees, technologies and products, 
can result in risks."
"In addition, further financial obliga-
tions or an additional financing requirement can arise."
"The shareholdings are subject to a monitoring process 
so that, if required, decisions can be promptly made on 
whether or not measures can be taken to support or 
ensure profitability."
"The recoverable value of invest-
ments in shareholdings is also regularly monitored."
"Financial risks and  
opportunities 
The following section deals with the financial risks and 
opportunities of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"These risks 
and opportunities can have negative or positive effects 
on the profitability, cash flows and financial position of 
the Group."
"In principle, the Group’s operating and financial risk 
exposures underlying its financial risks and opportuni-
ties can be divided into symmetrical and asymmetrical 
risk and opportunity profiles."
"With the symmetrical  
risk and opportunity profiles (e.g."
"currency exposures), 
risks and opportunities exist equally, while with the 
asymmetrical risk and opportunity profiles (e.g."
"credit 
and country exposures), the risks outweigh the oppor-
tunities."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is generally exposed to risks 
and opportunities from changes in market prices such 
as currency exchange rates, interest rates and com-
modity prices."
"Market price changes can have a nega-
tive or positive influence on the Group’s profitability, 
cash flows and financial position."
"Risks and oppor-
tunities arising from a change in commodity prices are 
reported in the “Procurement market risks and opportu-
nities” category since 31 December 2023."
"In addition, the Group is exposed to credit-, country- 
and liquidity-related risks, risks of restricted access to 
capital markets and risks from changes in credit ratings."
"As part of the risk management process, the Mercedes-
Benz Group regularly assesses these risks by consider-
ing changes in key economic indicators and market 
information."
"Consideration of the pension plan assets 
to cover retirement and healthcare benefits is included 
in the section “Risks and opportunities relating to pen-
sion plans”."
"Exchange-rate risks and opportunities 
The Mercedes-Benz Group’s global orientation means 
that its business operations and financial transactions 
are connected with risks and opportunities related to 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates."
"This applies in 
particular to fluctuations of the euro against the US dol-
lar, Chinese renminbi, British pound and other curren-
cies such as those of growth markets."
"An exchange-rate 
risk or opportunity arises in business operations pri-
marily when revenue is generated in a currency differ-
ent from that of the related costs (transaction risk)."
"Regularly updated currency risk exposures are succes-
sively hedged with suitable financial instruments (pre-
dominantly currency forwards) in accordance with 
exchange-rate expectations, which are continually 
reviewed, whereby both risks and opportunities are lim-
ited."
"Any over-collateralization caused by changes in 
exposure is reversed by suitable measures without 
delay."
"Exchange-rate risks and opportunities also exist 
in connection with the translation into euros of the net 
assets, revenues and expenses of the companies of the 
Group outside the euro zone (currency translation risk); 
these risks are not generally hedged."
"Interest-rate risks and opportunities 
Changes in interest rates can create risks and opportu-
nities for business operations as well as for financial 
transactions."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group employs a vari-
ety of interest rate-sensitive financial instruments to 
manage the cash requirements of its business opera-
tions on a day-to-day basis."
"Most of these financial 
instruments are held in connection with the financial 
services business of Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"Inter-
est-rate risks and opportunities arise when fixed-inter-
est periods are not congruent between the asset and 
liability sides of the balance sheet."
"By means of refi-
nancing coordinated with the terms of the financing 
agreements, the risk of maturity mismatch is minimized 
from both an interest-rate and a liquidity perspective."
"Remaining interest-rate risks are managed with the use 
of derivative financial instruments."
"The funding activi-
ties of the industrial business and the financial services 
business are coordinated at the Group level."
"Derivative 
interest-rate instruments such as interest-rate swaps 
are used to achieve the desired interest-rate maturities 
and asset/liability structures (asset and liability man-
agement)."
"Credit risks
Credit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting 
from a counterparty failing to meet its contractual pay-
ment obligations."
"Credit risk encompasses both the 
direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of 
creditworthiness as well as concentration risks."
"The Group is exposed to credit risks which result primar-
ily from its financial services activities and from the 
operations of its vehicle business."
"The risks from leasing 
and sales financing are dealt with in the General market 
risks and opportunities section."
Credit risks also arise from the Group’s liquid assets.
"Should defaults occur, this would adversely affect the 
Group’s profitability, liquidity and capital resources,  
and financial position."
"The limit methodology for liquid 
funds deposited with financial institutions has been 
continuously further developed in recent years."
"In con-
nection with investment decisions, priority is placed on 
the borrower’s very high creditworthiness and on bal-
anced risk diversification."
"Most liquid assets are held in 
investments with an external rating of A or better."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is 
exposed to country risks that primarily result from 
cross-border financing or collateralization for subsidiar-
ies or customers, from investments in subsidiaries and 
joint ventures, and from cross-border trade receivables."
"Country risks also arise from cross-border cash depos-
its at financial institutions."
"The Group addresses these 
risks by setting country limits (e.g."
"for hard-currency 
portfolios of Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies)."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Group also has an internal rating sys-
tem that divides all countries in which it operates into 
risk categories."
"Compared to the previous year, the 
country risk has fallen from “high” to “medium” due to 
the discontinuation of business activities in Russia."
"Risks of restricted access to capital markets 
Liquidity risks arise when a company is unable to fully 
meet its financial obligations."
"In the normal course of 
business, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses bonds, com-
mercial paper and securitized transactions, as well as 
bank loans in various currencies, primarily with the aim 
of refinancing its leasing and sales-financing business."
"Access to capital markets in individual coun-
tries may be limited by government regulations or by a 
temporary lack of absorption capacity."
"In addition, 
pending legal proceedings as well as the Group’s own 
business policy considerations and developments may 
temporarily prevent the Group from covering any liquid-
ity requirements by means of borrowing in the capital 
markets."
"Contractually agreed credit lines are available 
as refinancing instruments."
"Risks and opportunities from changes in  
credit ratings 
Risks and opportunities exist in connection with poten-
tial downgrades or upgrades to credit ratings by the rat-
ing agencies, and thus to the Mercedes-Benz Group’s 
creditworthiness."
"Downgrades could have a negative 
impact on the Group’s financing if such a downgrade 
leads to an increase in the costs for external financing 
or restricts the Group’s ability to obtain financing."
"A 
credit rating downgrade could also discourage inves-
tors from investing in Mercedes-Benz Group AG or from 
purchasing bonds issued by Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
or another company of the Group."
"Risks and opportunities relating to pension plans 
The companies of the Mercedes-Benz Group grant 
defined-benefit pension commitments, which are 
largely covered by plan assets, as well as healthcare 
commitments to a small extent."
"The balance of pension 
obligations less plan assets constitutes the carrying 
amount or funded status of those employee benefit 
plans."
"The measurement of pension obligations and the 
calculation of net pension expense are based on 
certain assumptions."
"Even small changes in those 
assumptions such as a change in the discount rates or 
changed inflation assumptions have a negative or posi-
tive effect on funded status and Group equity in the 
current year, and lead to a change in the periodic net 
pension expense in the following year."
"The fair value of 
plan assets is determined to a large degree by develop-
ments in the capital markets."
"Unfavourable or favoura-
ble developments, especially relating to share prices 
and fixed-interest securities, reduce or increase the 
carrying value of plan assets."
"Risk management for the 
plan assets takes place through broad diversification of 
investments, the selection of various asset managers 
on the basis of quantitative and qualitative analyses, 
and the ongoing monitoring of returns and risks."
"The 
structure of pension obligations is taken into considera-
tion during the determination of the investment strat-
egy for the plan assets in order to reduce fluctuations of 
the funded status."
"Risks and opportunities relating to 
pension plans have declined, due mainly to lower vola-
tility levels on the capital market."
"Provisions are recognized for those risks if and 
insofar as they are likely to be utilized and the amounts 
of the obligations can be reasonably estimated."
"Legal risks 
Regulatory risks
The automotive industry is subject to extensive govern-
mental regulations worldwide."
"Laws in various jurisdic-
tions govern occupant safety and the environmental 
impact of vehicles, including emissions levels, fuel 
economy and noise, as well as the emissions of the 
plants where vehicles or parts thereof are produced."
"Furthermore, regulation, particularly in the European 
Union, governs the external reporting on ESG topics 
(environmental, social or governance topics), whereby 
the complexity of such regulation is continuously 
increasing."
"The introduction of certain new regulations 
may initially be associated with uncertainties relating to 
their interpretation."
"In case regulations applicable in 
the different regions are not complied with, this could 
result in significant penalties, damages claims and rep-
utational harm or, in case of regulations applicable to 
vehicles, the inability to certify vehicles in the relevant 
markets."
"The cost of compliance with these regulations 
is considerable, and in this context, Mercedes-Benz 
continues to expect a significant level of costs."
"Product-related liti-
gation involves among other things claims alleging 
faults in vehicles."
"Some of these claims are asserted by 
way of class actions."
"If the outcome of such legal pro-
ceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group or 
such proceedings are settled, the Group may encounter 
substantial financial burdens, e.g."
"from damages pay-
ments or service actions, recall campaigns, monetary 
penalties or other costly actions."
"Some of these pro-
ceedings and related settlements may also have an 
impact on the company’s reputation."
"The corresponding activities of various authorities 
world-wide, which were already reported in the past, 
are partly ongoing, as described below."
"In the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and 
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements 
in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to 
settle civil environmental claims regarding the emission 
control systems of certain diesel vehicles."
"These agree-
ments have become final and effective."
"The authorities 
took the position that the Mercedes-Benz Group had 
failed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control Devices 
(AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and that 
several of these AECDs were illegal defeat devices."
"The failure to meet certain of 
those obligations may trigger additional stipulated pen-
alties."
"In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group paid the civil penalties."
"As already reported, in April 2016, the U.S."
"Department 
of Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz 
Group conduct an internal investigation."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group conducted such an internal investigation in 
cooperation with the DOJ’s investigation; the DOJ’s 
investigation remains open."
"In addition, further US state 
authorities have opened investigations pursuant to 
both local environmental and consumer protection laws 
and have requested documents and information."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to coop-
erate with the investigating authorities."
"In Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office 
issued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in Septem-
ber 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory 
duties, thereby concluding the related administrative 
offense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz."
"In July 
2021, the local court of Böblingen issued penal orders 
against three Mercedes-Benz employees based on, 
amongst others, fraud, which have become final."
"The 
criminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart pub-
lic prosecutor’s office against further Mercedes-Benz 
employees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud 
have meanwhile been discontinued."
"Between 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor 
Transport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary 
provisions for the EC type approvals of certain 
Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory 
recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first regis-
tration."
"In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the KBA 
issued further decisions regarding vehicles equipped 
with various EU6 or EU5 diesel engines."
"In each of 
those cases, it held that certain calibrations of speci-
fied functionalities are to be qualified as impermissible 
defeat devices."
"Mercedes-Benz has a contrary legal 
opinion on this question and has filed timely objections 
against the KBA’s administrative orders and determina-
tions mentioned above."
"Insofar as the KBA has not rem-
edied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has filed lawsuits 
with the competent administrative court to have the 
controversial questions at issue clarified in a court of 
law."
"Irrespective of such objections and the lawsuits 
that are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz Group con-
tinues to cooperate fully with the KBA."
"To a large extent, 
the remidial actions requested by the KBA were devel-
oped by the Mercedes-Benz Group and assessed and 
approved by the KBA; the necessary recalls were initi-
ated."
"For some of the vehicles affected by the KBA’s 
decision from December 2023, developments, exami-
nations and approvals of the remidial measures are still 
pending."
"It cannot be ruled out that under certain cir-
cumstances, software updates may have to be 
reworked, or further delivery and registration stops may 
be ordered or resolved by the company as a precau-
tionary measure, also with regard to the used-car, leas-
ing and financing businesses."
"In the course of its regular 
market supervision, the KBA routinely conducts further 
reviews of Mercedes-Benz vehicles and asks questions 
about technical elements of the vehicles."
"In addition, 
the Group continues to be in a dialogue with the Ger-
man Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) 
to conclude the analysis of the diesel-related emissions 
matter and to further the update of affected customer 
vehicles."
"In light of the aforementioned administrative 
orders issued by the KBA, and continued discussions 
with the KBA and the BMDV, it cannot be ruled out 
completely that additional administrative orders may be 
issued in the course of the ongoing and/or further 
investigations."
"In 
this context, these South Korean authorities have made 
determinations and imposed sanctions against 
Mercedes-Benz which Mercedes-Benz has appealed."
"In 
the same context, national antitrust authorities of vari-
ous countries are also conducting investigations, 
including the South Korean antitrust authority, which 
has made certain findings and imposed fines on some 
car manufacturers."
"In February 2024, the criminal pro-
ceeding in South Korea was concluded."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate 
with the authorities and institutions."
"Additionally, further delays in 
obtaining regulatory approvals necessary to introduce 
new or recertify existing vehicle models could occur."
"Regarding the proceedings and processes still in pro-
gress, the Mercedes-Benz Group cannot at this time 
make any statement to their outcome."
"In light of the 
legal positions taken by U.S."
"Likewise, such authorities could take the view that cer-
tain functionalities and/or calibrations are not proper 
and/or were not properly disclosed."
"It cannot be ruled 
out that the Mercedes-Benz Group will become subject 
to, as the case may be, significant additional fines and 
other sanctions, measures and actions."
"The occurrence 
of the aforementioned events in whole or in part could 
cause significant collateral damage including reputa-
tional harm."
"Further, due to negative allegations or find-
ings with respect to technical or legal issues by one of 
the various governmental agencies, other agencies — or 
also plaintiffs — could also adopt such allegations or 
findings."
"Thus, a negative allegation or finding in one 
proceeding carries the risk of being able to have an 
adverse effect on other proceedings, also potentially 
leading to new or expanded investigations or proceed-
ings, including lawsuits."
The lawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022.
"The plaintiff’s appeal to this decision was dismissed in 
the third quarter of 2023."
"The decision is final, and the 
proceedings are concluded."
"Consumer class actions were filed against Mercedes-
Benz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as 
against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group 
companies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in 
the Netherlands, in Portugal as well as since November 
2022 in Australia."
"The plaintiffs inter alia assert that the 
Mercedes-Benz Group had used devices that impermis-
sibly impair the effectiveness of emission control sys-
tems in reducing nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions and 
which cause excessive emissions from vehicles with 
diesel engines."
"Furthermore, they claim that Mercedes-
Benz Group AG deceived consumers in connection with 
advertising in relation of Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles."
"The proceedings in England and Wales consist of sev-
eral individual lawsuits that have been consolidated 
into one class action."
"A class action lawsuit is also 
pending in Scotland."
"In these proceedings, allegedly 
injured parties must actively register for the 
enforcement of claims (opt-in)."
"The plaintiffs in the con-
sumer class action in England and Wales also allege, 
amongst others, anti-competitive behaviour relating to 
technology for the treatment of diesel exhaust emis-
sions."
"In Germany, a large number of customers of diesel vehi-
cles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission of 
sales contracts based on similar allegations."
"They refer 
in particular to the KBA’s recall orders mentioned above."
"Although the number of pending lawsuits is declining, a 
future increase cannot be ruled out."
"Based on similar 
allegations, the Federation of German Consumer Organ-
izations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e."
"V.) filed 
a model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungsklage) 
against Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the Stuttgart 
Higher Regional Court in July 2021."
"Such an action seeks 
a ruling that certain preconditions of alleged consumer 
claims are met."
"In 2022, the proceedings in the United 
States were concluded in favour of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and MBUSA."
"In addition, in 2023, several 
class actions in Canada were finally dismissed as the 
plaintiffs discontinued their claims."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group also expects the last lawsuit pending in Canada 
to be discontinued and it will continue to defend itself 
against it until the discontinuance is final."
"This develop-
ment leads to a material reduction of the risk associ-
ated with the class actions."
"They therefore no longer 
qualify for separate reporting, which is why the 
Mercedes-Benz Group will no longer report on them in 
the future."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the respective other 
affected companies of the Group regard the pending 
lawsuits set out above as being without merit and con-
tinue to defend themselves against them."
"In addition, investors from Germany and abroad have 
filed lawsuits for damages with the Stuttgart Regional 
Court alleging the violation of disclosure requirements 
(main proceedings) and also raised out-of-court claims 
for damages."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards these 
lawsuits and out-of-court claims as being without merit 
and will defend itself against them."
"In December 2021, 
the Stuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case 
proceedings under the German Act on Model Case Pro-
ceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Kap-
MuG) (model case proceedings)."
"Multiple investors 
have used the possibility to register claims in a consid-
erable amount with the model case proceedings in 
order to suspend the period of limitation."
"Mercedes-
Benz Group AG remains of the view to have duly ful-
filled its disclosure obligations under capital markets 
law and defends itself against the investors’ allegations 
also in these model case proceedings."
"from damages pay-
ments, remedial works or other cost-intensive meas-
ures."
"Court proceedings can also have an adverse 
effect on the reputation of the Group."
"Risks from other legal proceedings
In September 2021, individual persons associated with 
Deutsche Umwelthilfe e."
"(DUH) filed a lawsuit before 
the Stuttgart Regional Court against Mercedes-Benz AG."
"They claim injunctive relief, demanding that Mercedes-
Benz AG refrain from distributing passenger cars with 
combustion engines after November 2030 and reduce 
its respective sales prior to this point in time."
"In the 
third quarter of 2022, the Regional Court of Stuttgart 
dismissed the claim in its entirety."
"The plaintiffs have 
appealed the decision."
"In the fourth quarter of 2023, 
the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart upheld the deci-
sion and dismissed the plaintiffs’ appeal as manifestly 
unfounded."
"The plaintiffs have lodged an appeal to the 
German Federal Court of Justice against the denial of 
leave to appeal."
"Mercedes-Benz AG will continue to 
defend itself against the plaintiffs’ allegations."
"As legal proceedings are fraught with a large degree of 
uncertainty, it is possible that after their final resolution, 
some of the provisions we have recognized for them 
could prove to be insufficient."
"As a result, substantial 
additional expenditures may arise."
"This also applies to 
legal proceedings for which the Group has seen no 
requirement to recognize a provision."
"It cannot be ruled out that the regulatory risks and risks 
from legal proceedings discussed above, individually or 
in the aggregate, may materially adversely impact the 
profitability, cash flows and financial position of the 
Group or any of its segments."
"Although the final result of any such litigation may influ-
ence the Group’s earnings and cash flows in any par-
ticular period, the Mercedes-Benz Group believes that 
any resulting obligations are unlikely to have a sus-
tained effect on the Group’s financial position."
"Further information on legal proceedings is provided in 
Note 30 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"Tax risks and opportunities
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries operate 
in many countries worldwide and are therefore subject 
to numerous different statutory provisions and tax 
audits."
"Tax risks and opportunities can affect the profit-
ability, cash flows and financial position of the Group."
"As of 31 December 2023, the quantification of tax risks 
and opportunities affecting the net profit will be dis-
closed for the first time in this Risk and Opportunity 
Report."
"Additionally, there are minor tax risks to the 
operating result."
"Any changes in legislation and jurisdiction, as well as 
different interpretations of the law by the fiscal authori-
ties, especially in the field of cross-border transactions, 
may be subject to considerable uncertainty."
"It is there-
fore possible that the provisions recognized will not be 
sufficient, which could have negative effects on the 
Group’s net profit and cash flows."
"Positive effects on the Group’s net profit and cash flows 
are also possible as a result of retroactive legislation, 
future court rulings or changes in the opinions of the 
tax authorities."
"Any changes or interventions by the fiscal authorities 
are continuously monitored by the tax department and 
measures are taken if required."
"The monitoring, man-
agement and avoidance of tax risks is supported by a 
tax-compliance management system (tax CMS)."
"However, there is an accounting opportunity that tax 
benefits currently not recognized in full may be utilized 
or recognized in future years and could thus also have a 
positive impact on the Group’s net profit."
"Overall assessment of the risk  
and opportunity situation 
The overall view of the Group’s risk and opportunity sit-
uation is the sum of the described individual risks and 
opportunities in all risk and opportunity categories."
"No risks are recognizable — neither on the reporting 
date nor at the time of preparing the Consolidated 
Financial Statements — that either alone or in combina-
tion with other risks could endanger the continued 
existence of the Group."
"Among others, this refers to the interpretation of the 
classification of economic activities, the do-no-significant-harm criteria and the assess-
ment of the economic substance of financial investments."
"On account of the immanent risk 
that certain abstract legal terms can be interpreted in various ways, the conformity of the 
interpretation with the law is subject to uncertainty."
"The disclosures on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control and risk 
management system in the Risk and Opportunity Report chapter, which are not part of the 
Management Report, were also not included in the audit of the financial statements."
"Key figures that were audited in order to obtain limited assurance as part of a separate 
assurance engagement of the sustainability report are indicated by a footnote."
"Accountability
On the basis of the statutory provisions, the German 
Corporate Governance Code and the rules of procedure 
of the Supervisory Board and its committees, the Audit 
Committee deals in particular with issues of accounting, 
financial reporting and non-financial reporting."
"In addi-
tion, it is concerned with the audit of the financial 
statements and it reviews the quality, qualifications and 
independence of the auditor."
"It also discusses the 
appropriateness, effectiveness and operation of the risk 
management system, the internal control system, the 
internal audit system and the compliance management 
system."
"After the election of the auditor by the Annual 
General Meeting, the Audit Committee engages the 
auditor to conduct the annual audit and the auditor’s 
review of interim financial statements."
"In addition, the 
Audit Committee agrees on the important audit issues 
and negotiates the audit fees with the auditor."
"The 
Audit Committee also engages the auditor to conduct 
the voluntary audit of the Non-Financial Declaration as 
part of the management report."
"Equal representation
In the 2023 financial year, Olaf Koch (Chairman of the 
Audit Committee) and Timotheus Höttges served as 
members of the Supervisory Board on the shareholder 
side."
"The persons mentioned are independent of the 
company and the Board of Management and have 
expertise in the field of accounting and the auditing of 
financial statements, including sustainability reporting 
and the auditing of such reporting."
"In the past financial 
year, the employees were represented by Ergun Lümali 
and also by Michael Brecht until his departure from the 
Supervisory Board."
"Roman Romanowski was elected to 
succeed Michael Brecht on the Audit Committee and 
Ergun Lümali was elected Deputy Chairman of the Audit 
Committee."
"Meetings and participants
The Audit Committee met six times in the 2023 finan-
cial year."
"The Chairman of the Supervisory Board 
attended all meetings as a permanent guest."
"Other 
permanent participants, in compliance with the statu-
tory requirements, were the Chairman of the Board of 
Management, the members of the Board of Manage-
ment responsible for Finance and Controlling and for 
Integrity, Governance & Sustainability, and the 
representatives of the auditor."
"The heads of specialist 
departments such as Accounting, Internal Audit, Com-
pliance and Legal also provided information on individ-
ual items on the agenda."
"Regular executive sessions 
also took place with the auditor without the presence 
of the Board of Management."
"Information for the Supervisory Board
The Chairman of the Audit Committee informed the 
Supervisory Board in each of its subsequent meetings 
of the activities of the Committee as well as the content 
of the meetings and discussions."
"After careful review, the Committee took note of and 
approved the figures presented, determined that there 
were no objections to the proposed publication and 
recommended that the Supervisory Board, which met 
afterwards, endorse this view."
"The preliminary key fig-
ures and the preliminary proposal for the appropriation 
of profits were published at the annual press confer-
ence on 17 February 2023."

olution of the Annual General Meeting, the Committee

ments."

ticular addressed the key audit matters and the rele-
vant audit procedures, including the conclusions 
drawn, and were available to answer additional ques-
tions and provide information."
"The audit opinions on 
the company and Consolidated Financial Statements 
(including the key audit matters in the audit opinions) 
and on the accounting-related internal control system, 
as well as significant accounting matters, were dis-
cussed together with the auditor."
"Furthermore, the 
Audit Committee discussed the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management system."
"The Audit Com-
mittee also adopted the Report of the Audit Committee 
on the 2022 financial year."
"The discussion of the quality of the audit and the results 
of the independence review, which did not reveal any 
indications of bias or threats to independence, were 
taken into account."
"During 2023, the Audit Committee discussed the 
interim financial reports and the results of the audit 
review with the Board of Management and the auditor 
in the quarterly meetings prior to their publication."
"In addition, the Committee received reports from the 
Internal Audit, Compliance and Legal departments."
"The Board of Management also regularly reported to  
the Committee on the current status of material legal 
proceedings, including antitrust and diesel emis-
sions-related proceedings."
"In addition, the Audit Com-
mittee received regular reports on possible violations  
of rules, which employees and external parties reported

initiatives with the possible future use of artificial intel-
ligence."

ing the new ESG and sustainability reporting require-
ments and the establishment of a uniform business 
performance management system for sustainability and 
ESG were a focal point of the meeting."
"In addition, the 
Audit Committee received an exhaustive report from 
the tax department."
"Information was provided on the 
further development of the tax compliance manage-
ment system and new regulatory requirements related 
to ESG and sustainability."
"Another topic of the meeting 
was a discussion of the planning of the audit of the 
financial statements, including the main audit areas for 
the 2023 financial year."
"In this context, the committee 
also considered the quality of the audit of the financial 
statements and the status of the transition in connec-
tion with the upcoming rotation of the auditor."
"Finally, 
the Audit Committee received reporting on current

report."
"Furthermore, the Committee received the quar-
terly reports from the Compliance, Internal Audit and

result."

resentation and more than three members on the Board 
of Management."
"Nevertheless, the Supervisory 
Board has decided that the target quota set in 2020 
should remain in place as one aspect of the overall pro-
file of requirements for appointments to the Board of 
Management."
"Details on the overall profile of requirements and the 
participation of women on the Board of Management 
are presented in separate sections in this Declaration 
on Corporate Governance."
"Without prejudice to the overall responsibility of the 
Board of Management, the individual members of the 
Board of Management shall manage their divisions on 
their own responsibility within the framework of the 
guidelines adopted by the Board of Management as a 
whole."
"Certain matters defined by the Board of Man-
agement as a whole shall nevertheless be discussed by 
the Board of Management as a whole and shall require 
its approval."
"In addition, each member of the Board of 
Management has the right to demand that any matter 
he or she deems important be discussed by the Board 
of Management as a whole or that a decision be made 
on that matter by the Board as a whole."
"The work of the 
Board of Management is coordinated by the chairman 
of the Board of Management."
"No committees of the 
Board of Management were established during the 
reporting period."
"Information about the areas of responsibility and the 
curricula vitae of the members of the Board of 
Management is available on the website of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG at w group.mercedes-benz.com/com-
pany/corporate-governance/board-of-management."
"The Board of Management manages Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and the Group, in consideration of the inter-
ests of the shareholders, the employees and the other 
stakeholders, with the goal of sustainable added value."
"With the approval of the Supervisory Board, it deter-
mines the strategic orientation of the company, which 
also takes into account long-term economic targets and 
environmental and social targets and objectives."
"The 
use of this approach has led to the definition of the 
strategic areas of action climate change mitigation and 
air quality, resource conservation, sustainable urban 
mobility, traffic safety, data responsibility and human 
rights as components of the sustainable business strat-
egy."
"Along with financial targets, the corporate planning 
decided on by the Board of Management with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board also includes corre-
sponding sustainability-related targets."
"The internal control and risk management system 
established by the Board of Management also 
addresses sustainability-related targets."
"Further infor-
mation on sustainability can be found on the company’s 
website at w group.mercedes-benz.com/sustainability."
"The Board of Management is responsible for ensuring 
compliance with statutory provisions and internal poli-
cies within the company, and works to ensure that they 
are also observed by the Group companies (compli-
ance)."
"It has established a comprehensive Compliance 
Management System geared to the risk situation of the 
company, the basic features of which are presented in 
the Non-Financial Declaration chapter of the 2023 
Annual Report."
"The components of the Compliance 
Management System also include the BPO (Business & 
People Protection Office) whistleblowing system, which 
gives employees and external whistleblowers world-
wide the opportunity to report violations of the rules."
"The Board of Management compiles the interim finan-
cial reports of the company, the Annual Financial State-
ments of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and the Combined Management 
Report with Non-Financial Declaration of the company 
and the Group."
"Together with the Supervisory Board, it 
prepares the Remuneration report and issues an annual 
Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
work to ensure the well-being of the company in a rela-
tionship based on trust."
"The Supervisory Board 
has defined the information and reporting duties of the 
Board of Management in more detail."
"Each member of the Board of Management is bound to 
serve the interests of the company and is subject to a 
comprehensive restraint of competition throughout the 
entire term of their contract."
"When making decisions, 
they may not pursue personal interests and they may 
not exploit the company’s business opportunities for 
their own benefit."
"Members of the Board of Management may only per-
form external ancillary activities if these are approved 
by the Supervisory Board’s Presidential Committee."
"Diversity and equal opportunity 
The Mercedes-Benz Group is committed to tolerance, 
openness and fairness, and promotes diversity and 
equal opportunity because these values form the basis 
of an efficient and successful company."
"Diversity is a 
firm component of the business strategy of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group; activities to promote diversity 
focus on the overarching strategic areas of action for 
the advancement of women, internationality and equal 
opportunities."
"In this way, diversity and inclusion 
management contribute significantly to the further 
development of the corporate culture at the Mercedes-
Benz Group."
"The targeted promotion of women had already been a 
central focus of attention in diversity management 
before the German Act on the Equal Participation of 
Women and Men in Leadership Positions came into 
force."
"In compliance with the statutory requirements, 
the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
has set targets for the proportion of women at the two 
management levels of the Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
below the Board of Management and a deadline for 
attaining these targets."
"The specific details are pre-
sented in a separate section of this Declaration on Cor-
porate Governance."
"Independently of the statutory requirements, in 2006 
the company had already set itself the goal of increas-
ing the proportion of women in senior management 
positions within the Group to at least 20% by 2020."
"This goal was achieved, and in 2022 the company set 
itself the new goal of appointing women to fill at least 
30% of its senior management positions by 2030."
"As of 
31 December 2023, the proportion of women in senior 
management positions at the Mercedes-Benz Group 
worldwide was 25.7% (active workforce of the fully con-
solidated Group companies without holiday workers)."
"Half of them are 
elected by the shareholders at the General Meeting and 
half by the employees of the German companies of the 
Group."
"Shareholder representatives and employee rep-
resentatives are by law equally bound to serve the 
interests of the company."
"Curricula vitae of the individual members of the Super-
visory Board and their other mandates are published on 
the Internet at w group.mercedes-benz.com/company/
corporate-governance/supervisory-board."
"This informa-
tion is also updated every year."
"The Supervisory Board shall be composed in such man-
ner that its members as a whole are familiar with the 
industry in which the company operates and have the 
knowledge, skills and professional experience neces-
sary for the proper performance of their duties."
"In 
accordance with applicable law, the Supervisory Board 
of Mercedes-Benz Group AG must be composed of at 
least 30% women and at least 30% men."
"The specific 
details are presented in a separate section of this Dec-
laration on Corporate Governance."
"In addition, the Supervisory Board has developed an 
overall profile of requirements for its own composition, 
which includes a competence profile and a diversity 
concept for the Board as a whole, including an age limit."
"The specific details of the overall profile of require-
ments are also summarized in a separate section of this 
Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"The proposals of 
the Supervisory Board for the election of shareholder 
representatives by the General Meeting, for which the 
Nomination Committee submits recommendations, aim 
to fulfil the overall profile of requirements for the 
Supervisory Board as a whole."
"The members of the Supervisory Board assume respon-
sibility for the training and further education measures 
required for their tasks, e.g."
"on topics relating to 
changes in the legal framework and new, forward-look-
ing technologies, and are supported in this by the com-
pany."
"The key components of this programme include 
ESG (environmental, social and governance) and sus-
tainability-related thematic blocks."
"In the reporting 
period, for example, the company held information 
events on sustainable corporate governance and sus-
tainability reporting as well as on the Mercedes-Benz 
operating system MB.OS."
"Both internal and external 
experts were involved in these events."
"The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the 
Board of Management in the management of the busi-
ness."
"Monitoring and advisory activities also relate to 
sustainability issues."
"At regular intervals, the Supervi-
sory Board discusses business development, the situa-
tion of the company, and planning and strategy, includ-
ing the sustainability strategy and its implementation."
"The Supervisory Board also reviews and discusses the 
internal control and risk management system and moni-
tors compliance with statutory provisions, official regu-
lations and internal policies within the company."
"The Supervisory Board has also specified in more detail 
the information and reporting duties of the Board of 
Management vis-à-vis the Supervisory Board, the Audit 
Committee and — between meetings of the Supervisory 
Board — vis-à-vis the Chairman of the Supervisory 
Board."
"The Supervisory Board has reserved the right of 
approval for transactions of fundamental importance."
"The Supervisory Board’s monitoring and advisory activi-
ties also relate to sustainability issues associated with 
the ESG dimensions (environmental, social and govern-
ance factors)."
"The Supervisory Board also addresses sustainability 
reporting in the form of the Non-Financial Declaration 
in the Combined Management Report."
"Prior to 2021, 
initial appointments were generally made for a maxi-
mum of three years."
"Since then, they have always 
been made subject to this maximum."
"In 2022, the 
Supervisory Board also adopted a more flexibly struc-
tured further reduction of the appointment period in 
the case of appointments and reappointments of indi-
viduals 58 years of age and older at the time their 
term of office begins."
"With regard to the composition of the Board of Manage-
ment, the Supervisory Board observes the statutory 
requirements for the equal participation of women and 
men."
"The specific details are presented in a separate 
section of this Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"Furthermore, with regard to the composition of the 
Board of Management, the Supervisory Board adopted 
a diversity concept embedded in an overall profile of 
requirements."
"Its specific details are also summarized 
in a separate section of this Declaration on Corporate 
Governance."
"On the basis of a proposal issued by the Presidential 
Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the sys-
tem of remuneration for the Board of Management and 
on the basis of this system also determines the total 
individual remuneration of the individual members of 
the Board of Management."
"It also defines the targets for 
variable remuneration components, including non-fi-
nancial and sustainability-oriented parameters."
"Further-
more, the Supervisory Board regularly reviews both the 
remuneration system and the total individual remunera-
tion of the individual members of the Board of Manage-
ment in order to ensure that these remain appropriate."
"The adjusted remuneration system for the members of 
the Board of Management, which was approved by a 
majority of 91% at the Annual General Meeting in 2023, 
can be viewed at w group.mercedes-benz.com/remu-
neration-bom."
"The Remuneration report that was pre-
pared jointly by the Board of Management and the 
Supervisory Board (including the opinion of the auditor 
pursuant to Section 162 of the German Stock Corpora-
tion Act) is also available there."
"The Supervisory Board examines the Annual Financial 
Statements, the Consolidated Financial Statements, 
and the Combined Management Report with Non-Fi-
nancial Declaration of the company and the Group, as 
well as the proposal for the appropriation of the distrib-
utable profits."
"After discussions with the auditor and in 
consideration of the audit opinions of the auditor and 
the audit results of the Audit Committee, the Supervi-
sory Board shall declare whether any objections are to 
be raised after the final result of its own review."

is not the case, the Supervisory Board approves the 
Annual Financial Statements and the Combined Man-
agement Report; the financial statements are deemed 
to have been adopted with the approval of the Supervi-
sory Board."
"The Supervisory Board shall report to the 
Annual General Meeting on the results of its own review 
as well as on the nature and scope of the supervision of 
the Board of Management during the past financial year."

ernance/supervisory-board."
"The Rules of Procedure of 
the Supervisory Board are available on the internet at 
w group.mercedes-benz.com/company/corporate-gov-
ernance."
"For the meetings of the Supervisory Board during the 
reporting period, regular Executive Sessions were again 
scheduled in order to be able to discuss topics in the 
absence of the Board of Management."
"Meetings of the Supervisory Board and its 
committees should as a rule take place in person."
"In 
justified exceptional cases the meetings can be held in 
the form of a video conference or a conference call or 
with the use of other comparable means of telecommu-
nication or individual members can participate in a 
meeting using such means."
"Conflicts of 
interest and the manner in which they are dealt with are 
disclosed in the Report of the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board regularly evaluates how effec-
tively it and its committees fulfil their tasks."
"In the 
reporting period, a comprehensive self-assessment of 
the Supervisory Board and its committees took place 
with the involvement of an external consultant on the 
basis of an extensive questionnaire and additional 
interviews carried out."
"The Board of Management’s per-
spective was also included in this assessment."
"The 
Supervisory Board addressed the results in detail in its 
meeting on February 21st, 2024."
"The results confirm 
very good, professional cooperation characterised by a 
high degree of trust within the Supervisory Board and 
its committees as well as with the Board of Manage-
ment."
"In addition, the results attest to the very efficient 
organisation and holding of meetings as well as appro-
priate reporting by the Board of Management."
"There 
was no fundamental need for change."
"Some individual 
ideas and recommendations were discussed."
"Addition-
ally, a further internal and comprehensive evaluation 
took place during the reporting period in the Audit 
Committee."
"This was done on the basis of a compre-
hensive questionnaire without external support."
"As of 31 December 2023, in addition to the Mediation 
Committee to be established by law, there are four 
other committees of the Supervisory Board that per-
form the tasks assigned to them in the name of and on 
behalf of the Supervisory Board as a whole, to the 
extent permitted by law."
"The relevant committee 
chairpersons shall report on the work of the commit-
tees to the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board at 
the latest at the next meeting of the Supervisory Board 
following the committee meeting."
"The Supervisory 
Board has adopted separate rules of procedure for all 
its committees."
"They are available on the internet at 
w group.mercedes-benz.com/company/corporate-gov-
ernance."
"Presidential Committee
The Presidential Committee consists of the Chairman of 
the Supervisory Board, the Deputy Chairman of the 
Supervisory Board, and two other members elected by 
the Supervisory Board."
"As of 31 December 2023, the 
Presidential Committee consisted of Dr Bernd Pischets-
rieder (Chairman), Ergun Lümali (Deputy Chairman), Ben 
van Beurden and Roman Zitzelsberger."
"It submits proposals to the Supervi-
sory Board for the structure of the remuneration system 
for the Board of Management and for the appropriate 
individual total remuneration of the individual members 
of the Board of Management."
"The Presidential Commit-
tee is responsible for the contractual matters of the 
members of the Board of Management and decides on 
the granting of approval for ancillary activities of mem-
bers of the Board of Management outside the Group."
"In addition, the Presidential Committee advises and 
decides on corporate governance issues, on which it 
also makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board."
"It supports and advises the Chairman of the Supervi-
sory Board and his Deputy and prepares the meetings 
of the Supervisory Board within the scope of its respon-
sibilities."
"Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee consists of the Chairman of 
the Supervisory Board and two other members elected

Board by a majority of the votes cast."
"As of 31 December 
2023, they are Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder (Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee), Dr Martin Brudermüller and 
Ben van Beurden."
"The Nomination Committee is the 
only committee of the Supervisory Board composed 
exclusively of shareholder representatives."
"It makes 
recommendations to the Supervisory Board for propos-
als to the General Meeting for the election of share-
holder representatives on the Supervisory Board."
"In this 
respect, it takes the statutory requirements for the par-
ticipation of women into account and strives to fulfil 
the overall profile of requirements for the Supervisory 
Board as a whole."
"Audit Committee
The Audit Committee consists of four members elected 
by the Supervisory Board by a majority of the votes 
cast."
"As of 31 December 2023, they are the shareholder 
representatives Olaf Koch (Chairman of the Audit Com-
mittee) and Timotheus Höttges as well as the employee 
representatives Ergun Lümali and Roman Romanowski."
"Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), 
at least one member of the Audit Committee must have 
expertise in the field of accounting and at least one 
other member must have expertise in the audit of 
financial statements."
"In addition, specialized knowledge 
of and experience with financial reporting and financial 
statement auditing shall include sustainability reporting 
and the audit of sustainability reports."
"The Chairman of 
the Audit Committee shall have expertise as described 
in at least one of the aforementioned fields."
"He thus has special-
ized knowledge and experience with regard to the use 
of financial reporting principles and internal control and 
risk management systems and the audit of financial 
statements."
"This also includes sound knowledge of sus-
tainability reporting and the audit of sustainability 
reports."
"For example, Olaf Koch introduced a sustaina-
bility target system and sustainability reporting at 
Metro AG, which led to the company maintaining a top 
position in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for many 
years."
"He also monitors and contributes to the develop-
ment of sustainability reporting and the audit of sus-
tainability reports and he actively contributes his 
expertise to the work conducted by the Audit Commit-
tee."
"This also includes extensive knowledge of 
sustainability reporting and the audit of sustainability 
reports, which he gained in his principal activity as CEO 
of Deutsche Telekom AG."
"He also monitors and contrib-
utes to the development of sustainability reporting and 
the audit of sustainability reports and he actively con-
tributes his expertise to the work conducted by the 
Audit Committee."
"Both Olaf Koch, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
and Timotheus Höttges, in his capacity as the other 
shareholder representative on the Audit Committee, are 
independent of the company and its Board of Manage-
ment."
"Further information on the evaluation of the inde-
pendence of members of the Supervisory Board is sum-
marized in the section on the overall profile of 
requirements for the composition of the Supervisory 
Board in this Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
accounting and the accounting process, and for the 
audit of the financial statements, in particular the 
selection and independence of the auditor and the 
quality of the audit."
"At least once a year, it discusses 
the effectiveness and operation of the internal control 
and risk management system, the internal auditing sys-
tem and the Compliance Management System with the 
Board of Management."
"It receives regular reports on the 
work of internal auditing and the compliance organiza-
tion."
"In addition, each member of the Audit Committee 
may obtain information directly from the heads of those 
corporate departments that are responsible within the 
company for tasks relating to the Audit Committee in 
accordance with its Rules of Procedure via the Chair-
man of the Committee."
"The Chairman of the Committee 
shall communicate the information obtained to all 
members of the Audit Committee."
"If such information is 
obtained, the Board of Management shall be informed 
accordingly without delay."
"At least quarterly, the Audit Committee receives the 
report of the BPO (Business & People Protection Office) 
whistleblowing system on complaints and information 
on possible violations of rules by top executives and 
violations of a defined catalogue of statutory provisions 
by other employees."
"It regularly obtains information on 
the processing of the said complaints and information."
"On the basis 
of the opinion of the auditor, the Audit Committee 
reviews the annual company Financial Statements, the 
annual Consolidated Financial Statements, and the 
Management Report with Non-Financial Declaration of 
the company and the Group and discusses them 
together with the auditor."
"The Audit Committee submits 
its recommendations regarding the adoption of the 
Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG, the approval of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, and the proposal for the appropriation of 
profits to the Supervisory Board."
"In this respect, it also agrees 
on the fee and coordinates the key areas of the audit 
with the auditor."
"The Chairman of the Audit Committee meets regularly 
with the auditor to discuss the progress of the audit 
and then reports to the Audit Committee on the results 
of these discussions."
"The Audit Committee also dis-
cusses topics with the auditor in the absence of the 
Board of Management."
"The auditor shall report to the Audit Committee on any 
and all accounting matters considered critical and on 
any material weaknesses in the internal control and risk 
management system relating to the accounting process 
that are identified during the audit."
"The Audit Commit-
tee also addresses reporting on non-financial topics in 
the Management Report."
"Finally, the Audit Committee approves in advance per-
missible services that the auditors or their subsidiaries 
perform for Mercedes-Benz Group AG or its Group com-
panies and that are not directly related to the audit of 
the annual accounts (or the review of interim financial 
statements)."
"Legal Affairs Committee
The Legal Affairs Committee is composed of six mem-
bers elected by the Supervisory Board by a majority of 
the votes cast."
"As of 31 December 2023, the members 
of the Committee are the shareholder representatives 
Olaf Koch (Chairman), Liz Centoni and Dame Polly Cour-
tice as well as the employee representatives Ergun 
Lümali, Michael Häberle and Roman Romanowski."
"The 
Committee coordinates the exercising of the rights and 
obligations of the Supervisory Board with regard to the 
ongoing emission and cartel-related proceedings 
against the company and Group companies."
"It prepares 
resolutions of the Supervisory Board in this regard and 
makes corresponding resolution recommendations."
"The said other 
tasks include, inter alia, the steering and monitoring of 
the Post Settlement Audit Teams that were set up in the 
context of the agreement in principle."
"As of 31 December 2023, they are Ben van 
Beurden for the shareholder side and Roman Zitzels-
berger for the employee side."
"The Committee was 
established for the sole purpose of performing the task 
set out in Section 31 Subsection 3 of the German 
Co-Determination Act (MitbestG)."
"As in previous years, 
the Mediation Committee had no reason to take action 
in 2023."
"The following information 
therefore relates to the Board of Management of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG, two management levels of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG below its Board of Manage-
ment, and the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG."
"By resolution of 3 December 2020, the Supervisory 
Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG set a target for the 
proportion of women on the Board of Management of at 
least 25% by 31 December 2025."
"Since August 2022, a 
legally mandated minimum participation requirement 
must be complied with when appointing members of 
the board of management."
"This requirement stipulates 
that at least one woman and at least one man must be 
a member of the board of management in a listed com-
pany with co-determination and equal representation 
and more than three members on the board of manage-
ment."
"Companies that are subject to the minimum pro-
portion requirement are no longer obliged to set a tar-
get quota for the proportion of women on the board of 
management."
"As at 31 December 2023, 
three of the eight members of the Board of Manage-
ment are women: Renata Jungo Brüngger, Sabine 
Kohleisen and Britta Seeger."
"The proportion of women 
on the Board of Management is now 37.5%, which 
means it exceeds the target that was set."
"As of 
31 December 2023, the first level of management of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG below the Board of Manage-
ment consists of 13 executives, of whom 3 are women, 
corresponding to a percentage of women of 23%."
"At the 
second level of management of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG below the Board of Management, as of 
31 December 2023, 17 out of a total of 50 executives are 
women, corresponding to 34%."
"Based on the assumption of a total of 13 executives at 
management level 1 of Mercedes-Benz Group AG as of 
31 December 2025, the set target quota of at least 20% 
results in a target of 3 women for this level."
"Based on 
the assumption of a total of 50 executives at manage-
ment level 2 of Mercedes-Benz Group AG as of 
31 December 2025, the set target quota of 25% results 
in a target of 13 women for this level."
"The supervisory boards of listed companies subject to 
co-determination and equal representation of share-
holders and employees on the supervisory board must 
be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% 
men."
"The quota is to be met by the Supervisory Board 
as a whole."
"If the representatives of the shareholders or 
the representatives of the employees object to the 
Chairman of the Supervisory Board prior to the election, 
then the minimum share for this election shall be ful-
filled separately by the shareholders and the employ-
ees."
"At the Supervisory Board meeting on 27 April 2022, 
the shareholder representatives objected to the overall 
fulfilment with regard to the election to the Supervisory 
Board of employee representatives whose term of 
office began at the end of the Annual General Meeting 
on 3 May 2023."
"As at 31 December 2023, women make up 30% of the 
shareholder side of the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG (Liz Centoni, Dame Polly Courtice and 
Professor Dr Helene Svahn), while the remaining 70% 
are men."
"At that point of time, on the employee side, 
Nadine Boguslawski, Gabriela Neher and Monika Tielsch 
also make up 30% women and the remaining 70% are 
men."
"If she is elected as a shareholder representative 
by the Annual General Meeting 2024, the membership 
of Dr. Doris Höpke on the Supervisory Board will 
increase the proportion of women on the shareholder 
side to 40%."
"The statutory quota for women for the Supervisory 
Board thus remains fulfilled."
"The Supervisory Board has combined these profiles 
and concepts in the overall profiles of requirements for 
the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board 
described below."
"The profiles of requirements are 
reviewed annually and also serve as a basis for long-
term succession planning."
"Board of Management
The objective of the profile of requirements for the 
Board of Management is to ensure that the Board of 
Management has excellent leadership skills and that its 
composition is as diverse and complementary as possi-
ble."
"The Board of Management as a whole shall possess 
the knowledge, skills and experience necessary for the 
proper performance of its duties and at the same time 
embody the company’s management philosophy on the 
basis of the various personal backgrounds and skills of 
its members."
"The key factor for the decision on filling a 
specific board position is always the interest of the 
company, taking any and all circumstances of the indi-
vidual case into account."
"As of 31 December 2023, the Board of 
Management includes two graduate engineers, 
Markus Schäfer and Dr Jörg Burzer."
"Ola Källenius has 
demonstrated his technical expertise on a sustained 
basis since taking over the Group Research & 
Mercedes-Benz Cars Development department on 
1 January 2017."
"–	 
On 3 December 2020, the Supervisory Board set a 
target for the proportion of women on the Board  
of Management of at least 25% by 31 December 2025."
"The 
proportion of women on the Board of Management is 
now 37.5%, which means it exceeds the target that 
was set."
"–	 
For the last possible age-related appointment or 
reappointment of a member of the Board of Manage-
ment, the completion of the 62nd year of life at the 
time of the beginning of a (new) term of office gener-
ally serves as a guideline."
"When determining this age 
limit, the Supervisory Board deliberately opted for a 
flexible benchmark in order to preserve the necessary 
leeway for appropriate decisions in individual cases."
"With the exception of Renata Jungo Brüngger, all 
members of the Board of Management fall below this 
standard age limit as of 31 December 2023."
"–	 
In addition, attention shall be paid to a sufficient 
generational mix among the members of the Board 
of Management; if possible, at least three members of 
the Board of Management shall be 57 years of age or 
younger at the beginning of the relevant term of 
office."
"As of 31 December 2023, this applies to, 
among others, Ola Källenius, Britta Seeger and Dr Jörg 
Burzer."
"For the purpose of the profile of 
requirements, mandates on supervisory boards in 
joint ventures, the performance of which is part of the 
departmental responsibility of a member of the Board 
of Management, are not considered to be comparable 
functions."
"
Of the non-Group memberships of Supervisory 
Boards and other supervisory bodies held by Huber-
tus Troska, only BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd."
"is listed 
on the stock exchange."
"With the exception of the 
mandate at Beijing Foton Daimler Automo-
tive Co., Ltd., his other mandates outside the Group 
are mandates in non-listed joint ventures within his 
departmental responsibility."
"The same applies to the non-Group mandates of 
Markus Schäfer."
"
Of the non-Group memberships of supervisory 
boards and other supervisory bodies held by Britta 
Seeger, only Deutsche Lufthansa AG is listed on the 
stock exchange."
"
Renata Jungo Brüngger is a member of the Supervi-
sory Board of the listed company Münchener 
Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft 
and Harald Wilhelm is a member of the Supervisory 
Board of BAIC Motor Corporation Ltd, which is also 
listed on the stock exchange."
"In addition, both are 
represented on the Supervisory Board of the non-
group listed Daimler Truck Holding AG as well as on 
the Supervisory Board of the non-listed Daimler 
Truck AG, a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler Truck 
Holding AG."
"The shareholder representatives on the 
Supervisory Boards of Daimler Truck Holding AG and 
Daimler Truck AG are identical."
"The criteria of the profile of requirements shall be taken 
into account when filling positions on the Board of 
Management."
"The Presidential Committee draws up a 
short-list of available candidates on the basis of a tar-
get profile, taking into account the specific qualification 
requirements and the requirements profile."
"It conducts 
interviews with these candidates, and it then submits a 
candidate proposal to the Supervisory Board together 
with the reasons for its recommendation for the deci-
sion-making."
"The decisive factor is always the interest 
of the company, in consideration of any and all circum-
stances of the individual case."
"Together with the Board of Management, the Supervi-
sory Board also ensures long-term succession planning 
for the Board of Management, with due consideration of 
the profile of requirements and the circumstances of 
the individual case."
"The Presidential Committee of the 
Supervisory Board regularly discusses talents and 
exceptional leaders of the company."
"The contract terms 
and renewal options of current members of the Board 
of Management are discussed, as well as possible suc-
cessors."
"The process of succession planning also 
includes regular reporting by the Board of Management 
on the proportion and development of female manag-
ers, especially at the first and second management lev-
els below the Board of Management."
"The Board of Man-
agement is responsible for proposing a sufficient 
number of suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG aims to predominantly fill 
positions on the Board of Management with managers 
developed within the company."
"Nevertheless, potential 
external candidates are also evaluated and included in 
the selection process on a case-by-case basis, with the 
support of external recruitment consultancy firms."
"Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board as a whole must be familiar with 
the industry in which the company operates."
"The aim of the profile of requirements for the Supervi-
sory Board in its entirety is also to ensure that the com-
position of the Supervisory Board is as diverse and 
complementary as possible."
"Overall, the members of the Supervisory Board shall 
complement one another in terms of their expertise and 
professional experience in such a way that the Board as 
a whole can draw on the broadest possible pool of 
experience and diverse specialist knowledge."
"Further-
more, the Supervisory Board considers the diversity of 
its members in terms of age, gender, internationality 
and other personal characteristics as an important pre-
requisite for an effective working relationship."
"The deci-
sion of the Supervisory Board on an election proposal 
to the General Meeting shall always be based on the 
interests of the company, taking any and all circum-
stances of the individual case into account."
"–	 
Diversity
	 –	
Gender ratio: By law, at least 30% of the members 
of the Supervisory Board must be women and at 
least 30% must be men."
"The quota is to be met by 
the Supervisory Board as a whole, unless the repre-
sentatives of the shareholders or the representa-
tives of the employees object to the overall fulfil-
ment."
"If such an objection is made, then the 
minimum proportion for the next election in the 
given case is to be fulfilled separately by the share-
holder side and the employee side."
"As of 
31 December 2023, there are three women on both 
the side of the shareholders and the side of the 
employees."
"At the Supervisory Board 
meeting on 27 April 2022, the shareholder repre-
sentatives objected to the overall fulfilment with 
regard to the election to the Supervisory Board of 
employee representatives whose term of office 
began at the end of the Annual General Meeting on 
3 May 2023."
"There was no objection to the overall 
fulfilment with regard to the election of a share-
holder representative by the Annual General Meet-
ing on 3 May 2023."
"The same applies with regard to 
the election of shareholder representatives by the 
Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2024."
"–	
Generational mix: In addition, attention shall be 
paid to a sufficient generational mix amongst the 
members of the Supervisory Board."
"At least 30% of 
the members of the Supervisory Board shall be no 
more than 62 years of age at the time of their elec-
tion or re-election."
"–	
Internationality: At least 30% of shareholder rep-
resentatives shall be of international origin (interna-
tional citizenship) or have international experience."
"All shareholder representatives in office on 
31 December 2023 have international experience."
"–	
Educational and professional background: The 
members of the Supervisory Board should have dif-
ferent educational and professional backgrounds."
"As of 31 December 2023, the members of the 
Supervisory Board display a broad range of educa-
tional and professional backgrounds."
"Other 
employee representatives have completed relevant 
professional training."
"Several members of the 
Supervisory Board have university degrees in eco-
nomics, including Timotheus Höttges and Olaf Koch 
on the shareholder side and Michael Bettag on the 
employee side."
"The assessment of independence is incum-
bent on the shareholder representatives on the 
Supervisory Board themselves."
"as a customer, supplier, lender or consultant; a 
close family relationship to a member of the Board 
of Management; membership of the Supervisory 
Board for more than twelve years (all criteria relate 
to both the members of the Supervisory Board and 
their close family members)."
"However, the share-
holder side is expressly at liberty to regard the 
member of the Supervisory Board in question as 
independent if one or even several negative indica-
tors are fulfilled — however, this assessment 
should then be substantiated in the Declaration on 
Corporate Governance."
"During the reporting 
period, the shareholder representatives Dr Martin 
Brudermüller, Liz Centoni, and Timotheus Höttges 
in particular did not have any such material busi-
ness relationship with Mercedes-Benz Group AG or 
any company dependent on Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG (e.g."
"as a supplier, customer, lender or 
consultant) in a responsible function of a company 
outside the Group."
"The same applies - also in view 
of the information provided in the chapter Consoli-
dated Financial Statements in the note Related 
party disclosures - to Stefan Pierer in his role as a 
shareholder and board member of companies in the 
Pierer and Leoni Groups."
"No former member of the 
Board of Management was a member of the Super-
visory Board during the reporting period."
"No mem-
ber of the Supervisory Board holds board functions 
or performs advisory tasks for significant competi-
tors."
"
No other mandates formerly held by Dr Bernd Pis-
chetsrieder could be seen during the reporting 
period as constituting a material and not merely 
temporary conflict of interest."
"–	
Standard age limit: As a rule, only candidates who 
are not older than 72 years at the time of their (re-)
election shall be proposed for election to the 
Supervisory Board for a full term of office."
"None of the members of the 
Supervisory Board in office on 31 December 2023 
exceeded the standard age limit at the time of their 
election."
"–	 
Expertise and experience
	 –	
Two finance experts: At least one member of the 
Audit Committee must have expertise in the field of 
accounting and at least one other member must 
have expertise in the audit of financial statements."
"In addition, specialized 
knowledge of and experience with financial report-
ing and financial statement auditing shall include 
sustainability reporting and the audit of sustainabil-
ity reports."
"The same applies to their specialized knowledge of 
and experience with sustainability reporting and 
the audit of sustainability reports."
"Further details 
on the expertise of the two finance experts can be 
found in the information on the composition and 
working method of the Audit Committee in this 
Declaration on Corporate Governance."
"–	
Other special areas of expertise: The Supervisory 
Board shall, as a whole, possess expertise and 
experience in areas of particular relevance to the 
company."
"At least three members of the Supervi-
sory Board shall bring knowledge and experience in 
each of the following areas:
	 	 –	
Finance (e.g."
"accounting, controlling, risk manage-
ment, auditing, M&A)
	 	 –	
Strategy
	 	 –	
Digitalization/IT (e.g."
"software, processes, data 
security)
	 	 –	
Transformation (e.g."
"products, working models)
	 	 –	
Human resources (e.g."
"
On the basis of the table Qualification matrix of the 
Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board 
as a whole in its current composition meets the 
defined requirements pertaining to its expertise/
experience."
"More than three members of the Super-
visory Board have relevant knowledge and/or expe-
rience in each of the areas of expertise shown 
above."
"The explanations shown below regarding the 
members of the Supervisory Board who are men-
tioned by name should therefore be viewed as 
examples."
"
In the area of finance, Ben van Beurden and Dr 
Martin Brudermüller in particular possess special 
expertise, as do the two finance experts Olaf Koch 
and Timotheus Höttges and the other members of 
the Audit Committee – Ergun Lümali and Roman 
Romanowski."
"
With regard to strategy, Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder in 
particular has proven sector-specific expertise as a 
result of his previous professional experience."
"In 
terms of the corporate strategy that is geared 
towards sustainability and the luxury vehicle seg-
ment, the ESG expertise of Dame Polly Courtice, as 
well as Marco Gobbetti’s experience in the luxu-
ry-goods industry, deserve special mention."
"In 
addition, Roman Zitzelsberger and Ergun Lümali in 
particular have extensive experience with strategy 
issues – Roman Zitzelsberger due to the mandates 
he has held in various supervisory boards and 
Ergun Lümali due to the many years he has served 
on the company’s Supervisory Board."
"
In the area of digitalization/IT, Liz Centoni and 
Timotheus Höttges, among others, are able to con-
tribute expertise and experience gained through 
their professional activities at Cisco and Deutsche 
Telekom, respectively."
"The same can be said for 
Monika Tielsch due to her activity as a Works Coun-
cil member in the R&D unit, where the MB.OS oper-
ating system is being developed."
"Both push or pushed ahead with 
the process of transformation at the companies 
where they serve or served as chairman of the 
board of management."
"In their capacity as works 
council chairmen at key Mercedes-Benz production 
plants, both Ergun Lümali and Michael Häberle use 
their expertise to help manage the transformation 
at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"
Dr Martin Brudermüller in particular possesses 
sound knowledge of human resources due to his 
extensive previous professional experience in this 
area, and he has contributed his knowledge as a 
Board member, especially as a member of the Nom-
ination Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"Dr 
Frank Weber also possesses expertise in the area of 
human resources, as he has served for many years 
as Chairman of the Management Representative 
Committee at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The 
knowledge and experience of the IG Metall (German 
Metalworkers’ Union) representatives Nadine 
Boguslawski, Roman Romanowski and Roman Zit-
zelsberger in the area of human resources has also 
proved valuable for the work conducted by the 
Supervisory Board."
"
In the area of sustainability/ESG, Dame Polly 
Courtice contributes the expertise she has gained 
in ESG matters as a result of having served for many 
years as Director of the University of Cambridge 
Institute for Sustainability Leadership."
"Dr Martin 
Brudermüller, Ben van Beurden and Timotheus 
Höttges in particular contribute to the Supervisory 
Board their knowledge of and experience with envi-
ronmental (E) issues."
"All of them deal or dealt 
extensively with sustainability issues (in particular 
those relating to climate change mitigation and 
decarbonization) at the companies in which they 
serve or served as chairman of the board of man-
agement."
"Dame Polly Courtice and in particular the 
employee representatives on the Supervisory Board 
possess expertise in the fields shown above that 
relate to the social (S) component of ESG."
"With 
regard to governance (G), Olaf Koch and Roman 
Romanowski contribute to the Supervisory Board 
the expertise they have gained throughout their 
professional careers."
"
In the area of industry, Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder in 
particular has extensive sector-specific knowledge 
that he has gained as a member of the Supervisory 
Board as well as through the many years he served 
in executive positions at other companies in the 
automotive industry."
"Dr Martin Brudermüller’s many 
years of experience in the chemical industry also 
deserve special mention here."
"In addition, Ergun 
Lümali possesses expertise relevant to the area of 
industry due to the many years he has spent as 
Chairman of the Works Council at the Mercedes-
Benz Sindelfingen plant."
"
With respect to innovation, research and devel-
opment, the proven expertise of Professor Dr 
Helene Svahn deserves to be especially highlighted."
"Liz Centoni also possesses specialized knowledge 
in this area due to the many years she has spent in 
executive positions at Cisco."
"Finally, Monika Tielsch 
and Michael Häberle, among others, also contribute 
to the Supervisory Board the expertise they have 
gained in this area throughout their careers."
"
Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder possesses extensive sec-
tor-specific knowledge in the area of sales/brands, 
and Marco Gobbetti contributes his extensive 
brand expertise to the work conducted by the 
Supervisory Board."
"Michael Bettag has many years 
of experience in sales."
"
The area of capital markets is extremely well cov-
ered by Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, Dr Martin Bruder-
müller, Ben van Beurden, Olaf Koch and Timotheus 
Höttges in particular, as all of them serve or have 
served as chairmen of listed companies."
"
Ergun Lümali and Roman Zitzelsberger, among oth-
ers, also possess expertise with regard to capital 
markets after having served as members of the 
Supervisory Board for many years."
"Proposals by the Supervisory Board for the election of 
shareholder representatives by the General Meeting, for 
which the Nomination Committee makes recommenda-
tions, shall take the aspects outlined above into 
account and aim to fulfil the profile of requirements for 
the Board as a whole."
"The dates of 
important publications, such as the annual report and 
interim financial reports, as well as the dates of the 
General Meeting, the annual press conference and ana-
lysts’ conferences, are announced well in advance in 
the financial calendar."
"Shareholders and General Meeting
The shareholders exercise their membership rights, in 
particular their voting rights, at the General Meeting."
"Each share of Mercedes-Benz Group AG entitles the 
holder to one vote."
"Documents and information about 
the General Meeting are available at w group."
"In the context of comprehensive investor and public 
relations, the company is in close contact with its 
shareholders."
"Shareholders, financial analysts, share-
holder associations, the media and interested members 
of the public are regularly and comprehensively 
informed about the company’s situation and are 
promptly informed about important business changes."
"Such discus-
sions took place in the run up to the shareholder meet-
ings in 2023 and 2024."
"In addition to other channels of communication, the 
company makes very good use of the company website 
for investor relations."
"Subsequently, the 
Nomination Committee submits a candidate proposal 
to the Supervisory Board together with the reasons for 
its recommendation for decision-making."
"The decision 
of the Supervisory Board on the election proposal to 
the General Meeting shall always be based on the inter-
ests of the company, taking any and all circumstances 
of the individual case into account."
"The terms of office of the shareholder representatives 
on the Supervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
end at different times (“staggered board”)."
"Every year, 
on the General Meeting elects one or more shareholder 
representatives."
"The staggered board opens up the 
possibility of adapting the composition of the Supervi-
sory Board more flexibly to a changing environment."
"In 
addition, it facilitates the search for suitable candidates, 
because not all seats on the shareholder side have to 
be filled at a single General Meeting."
"The Nomination 
Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly reviews 
which mandates end at which point in time and whether 
the relevant mandate holders are eligible and willing to 
serve a further term of office, taking the aforemen-
tioned criteria into account."
"In the search for new can-
didates, the Nomination Committee may rely on inde-
pendent external recruitment consultancy services if it 
chooses to do so."

General information 
The Mercedes-Benz Group is a vehicle manufacturer 
with a worldwide product range of premium cars."
"Its 
product portfolio is rounded off by a range of financial 
services, product-related mobility services and the 
installation of a charging infrastructure."
"The Group 
comprises the segments Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans and Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG is the parent company of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG is a stock corporation orga-
nized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germa-
ny."
"The Company is entered in the Commercial Register 
of the Stuttgart District Court under No."
"HRB 19360 and 
its registered office is located at Mercedesstraße 120, 
70372 Stuttgart, Germany."
"The Consolidated Financial Statements of Mercedes-
Benz Group AG are presented in euros (€)."
"Unless oth-
erwise stated, all amounts are stated in millions of eu-
ros."
All figures shown are rounded.
"The Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
authorized the Consolidated Financial Statements for 
publication on 15 March 2024."
"IFRS issued, EU endorsed and adopted in the 
reporting period 
In May 2021, the IASB published Deferred taxes relat-
ing to assets and liabilities arising from a single 
transaction (amendments to IAS 12)."
"When assets and 
liabilities are recorded for the first time, under certain 
conditions deferred taxes previously did not have to be 
recognized due to an exception."
"The amendment to IAS 
12 has the effect of cancelling this exception, which was 
important for the lessee's accounting of finance leases 
among other things."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group applied 
the changes for the first time in the financial year that 
commenced on 1 January 2023."
"There were no effects 
on the profitability, liquidity and capital resources, and 
financial position."
"In December 2021, the OECD published guidelines for 
a new global minimum tax framework aimed at curb-
ing base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multina-
tional corporations."
"EU member states unanimously 
agreed in December 2022 to implement these rules in 
the form of a directive (BEPS Pillar 2 regulations)."
"As part of an analysis of possible 
effects on the Group, no countries were identified as at 
the reporting date from which significant effects are to 
be expected with regard to the possible payment of a 
minimum tax."
"To introduce a mandatory temporary exemption from 
the requirements in IAS 12 Income Taxes for the record-
ing and disclosure of information about deferred tax 
assets and liabilities, the IASB published International 
Tax Reform - Pillar 2 Model Rules (Amendments to 
IAS 12) in May 2023."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group applies 
the exception rule according to IAS 12, which stipulates 
that no deferred tax assets and liabilities are accounted 
for in connection with the income taxes of the second 
pillar (“Pillar 2”) of the OECD."
"In May 2017, the IASB published the standard IFRS 17 
Insurance Contracts."
"IFRS 17 establishes more trans-
parency and comparability with regard to the recogni-
tion, measurement, presentation and disclosure of in-
surance contracts with the insurer."
"The application of 
IFRS 17 is mandatory for reporting periods beginning on 
or after 1 January 2023."
"The first-time application of 
IFRS 17 had no impact on the profitability, liquidity and 
capital resources and financial position of the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group."
"In addition, other standards and interpretations were 
published which are not expected to have any signifi-
cant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Presentation 
Presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Financial 
Position differentiates between current and non-current 
assets and liabilities."
"Assets and liabilities are generally 
classified as current if they are expected to be realized 
or settled within one year."
"Deferred tax assets and lia-
bilities as well as assets and provisions for pensions 
and similar obligations are presented as non-current 
items."
"The Consolidated Statement of Income is presented 
using the cost-of-sales method."
"Principles of consolidation 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the fi-
nancial statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and the 
financial statements of all subsidiaries, including struc-
tured entities, which are directly or indirectly controlled 
by Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"Control exists if the par-
ent company has the power of decision over a subsidi-
ary based on voting rights or other rights, if it partici-
pates in positive and negative variable returns from a 
subsidiary, and if it can affect these returns by its power 
of decision."
"Structured entities are entities which have been de-
signed so that voting or similar rights are not relevant in 
deciding who controls the entity."
"This is the case for 
example if voting rights relate to administrative tasks 
only and the relevant activities are directed by means of 
contractual arrangements."
"The financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries 
which are included in the Consolidated Financial State-
ments are generally prepared as of the reporting date  
of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The financial 
statements of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its compa-
nies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements 
are prepared using uniform recognition and measure-
ment principles."
"Intra-Group assets and liabilities, equi-
ty, income and expenses as well as cash flows from 
transactions between consolidated entities are elimi-
nated in the course of the consolidation process."
"Business combinations and changes in equity 
interests 
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
purchase method."
"In connection with obtaining control, 
non-controlling interest in the acquiree is in principle 
recognized at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets, which are measured at fair value."
"Changes in equity interests in subsidiaries that reduce 
or increase the Mercedes-Benz Group’s percentage 
ownership without a change of control are accounted 
for as equity transactions between owners."
"Amounts 
that were previously recognized in other comprehensive 
income/loss are recognized in other operating income 
or expense upon loss of control."
"If realization is not 
permitted, they are reclassified to retained earnings."
"Investments in associated companies, joint ventures 
or joint operations  
An associated company is an entity over which the 
Group has significant influence."
"Significant influence is 
the power to participate in the financial and operating 
policy decisions of the investee."
"Associated companies 
are generally accounted for using the equity method."
"For entities over which the Mercedes-Benz Group has 
joint control together with a partner (joint arrange-
ments), it is necessary to differentiate between whether 
a joint operation or a joint venture exists."
"In a joint ven-
ture, the parties that have joint control of the arrange-
ment have rights to the net assets of the arrangement."
"For joint ventures, the equity method has to be applied."
"A joint operation exists when the jointly controlling 
parties have direct rights to the assets and obligations 
for the liabilities."
"In this case, the prorated assets and 
liabilities and the prorated income and expenses are 
generally to be recognized (proportionate consolida-
tion)."
"Foreign currency translation 
Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the 
relevant foreign exchange-rates prevailing at the trans-
action date."
"Assets and liabilities of foreign companies for which the 
functional currency is not the euro are translated into 
euros using period-end exchange-rates."
"The translation 
adjustments are presented in other comprehensive 
income/loss."
"The components of equity are translated 
using historical rates."
"The statements of income and 
cash flows are translated into euros using the quarterly 
average exchange-rates during the respective periods."
"The exchange-rates providing the basis for the currency 
translation of the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi – 
the most significant foreign currencies for the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group – developed as shown in the follow-
ing table."
"If a country is in hyper-
inflation, IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflation-
ary Economies has to be applied from the beginning of 
the respective reporting period, i.e., from 1 January of 
the respective reporting year."
"Argentina and Turkey are 
currently considered as in hyperinflation."
"The effects of taking into account the devaluation of 
the monetary balance sheet items of subsidiaries in 
countries in hyperinflation are therefore recognized in 
profit or loss and are included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income under other operating expenses 
or other operating income."
"Due to the close economic relationship, the effects 
from the recognition of the inflation effect together 
with the conversion effect from the translation are 
presented as a currency effect in accordance with IAS 
21."
"Both effects are presented on a net basis in other 
comprehensive income or directly in retained earnings."
"For companies that use hyperinflation accounting, the 
profit and loss statements and the cash flow state-
ments are converted into euros using the exchange-
rates at the end of the period."
"This generally 
occurs at the time the customer takes possession of 
the products."
"If a dealer is not classified as a principal but as an 
agent and therefore control of vehicles is not trans-
ferred to him, sales revenue is only recorded when  
the end customer obtains control."
"The brokerage com-
missions payable to the dealer are shown in selling 
expenses."
"Revenue recognition from the sale of vehicles for which 
the Group enters into a repurchase obligation is de-
pendent on the form of the repurchase agreement."
"- Sales of vehicles by which the Mercedes-Benz Group 
is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are 
accounted for as operating leases."
"This also applies 
to a call option that grants the Mercedes-Benz Group 
the right to repurchase."
"- Sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity’s 
obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer’s 
request) are reported as operating leases if the cus-
tomer has a significant economic incentive to exer-
cise that right at contract inception."
"Otherwise, a sale 
with a right of return is reported."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group considers several factors when assessing 
whether the customer has a significant economic in-
centive to exercise his or her right."
"Among others, 
these are the relation between the agreed repur-
chase price and the expected future market value  
(at the time of repurchase) of the asset, or historical 
return rates."
"Arrangements such as when the Mercedes-Benz Group 
provides customers with a guaranteed minimum resale 
value that they receive on resale (residual-value guar-
antee) do not constrain the customers in their ability to 
direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the 
benefits from the asset."
"At contract inception of a sale 
with a residual-value guarantee, revenue therefore has 
to be recognized, reduced by a potential compensation 
payment to the customer (revenue deferral)."
"Under a contract manufacturing agreement, the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group sells assets to a third-party manu-
facturer from which the Mercedes-Benz Group buys 
back the manufactured products after completion of 
the commissioned work."
"If the provision of material is 
not associated with the transfer of control to the ser-
vice provider, no revenue is recognized."
"For certain products sold by the Group, it offers ex-
tended, separately priced warranties that go beyond 
the statutory period, as well as service and mainte-
nance contracts."
"Usual for such contracts is an advance 
payment or the payment of constant instalments over 
the term of the contract."
"If the customer has made an 
advance payment, the revenue from these contracts is 
deferred as a contract liability and recognized as reve-
nue over the term of the contract in proportion to the 
costs expected to be incurred based on historical in-
formation."
"A future loss on these contracts is recog-
nized in the current reporting year if the expected 
costs for outstanding services under the contract ex-
ceed unearned revenue."
"For multiple-element arrangements, such as when ve-
hicles are sold with free or reduced-in-price mainte-
nance contracts or with free online services, the Group 
generally allocates revenue to the various elements 
based on their estimated relative stand-alone selling 
prices."
"To determine stand-alone selling prices, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group primarily uses price lists with 
consideration of average price reductions granted to its 
customers."
"Depending on the sales model, vehicles may be initially 
sold to non-Group dealers."
"When control of the vehicle 
is transferred to the non-Group dealer, the Mercedes-
Benz Group recognizes revenue from the sale of the 
vehicle."
"Irrespective of this, an end customer can de-
cide to enter into a leasing contract with Mercedes-
Benz Mobility regarding such a vehicle."
"The vehicle is 
then sold by the non-Group dealer to Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility."
"Revenue also includes revenue from the rental and 
leasing business as well as interest from the financial 
services business at Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"Revenue 
generated from operating leases is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the periods of the contracts."
"In 
addition, sales revenue is generated at the end of lease 
contracts from the subsequent sale of the vehicles."
"Revenue from receivables from financial services is 
recognized using the effective-interest method."
"These programmes comprise cash offers to 
dealers and customers as well as lease subsidies or 
loans at reduced interest rates which are reported as 
follows: 
- Revenue is recognized net of sales reductions such 
as cash discounts and sales incentives granted."
"- When loans are issued below market rates, related 
receivables are recognized at present value (using 
market rates) and revenue is reduced for the interest 
incentive granted."
"- If subsidised leasing fees are agreed upon in connec-
tion with finance leases, revenue from the sale of a 
vehicle is reduced by the amount of the interest in-
centive granted."
"Research and non-capitalized development costs 
Expenditure for research and development that does 
not meet the conditions for capitalization according to 
IAS 38 Intangible Assets is expensed as incurred."
"Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, unless they 
are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of a qualifying asset and are therefore 
part of the acquisition or manufacturing costs of that 
asset."
"Depreciation of the capitalized borrowing costs 
is presented within cost of sales."
"Government grants 
Government grants related to assets are deducted 
from the carrying amount of the asset and are recog-
nized in earnings over the life of a depreciable asset as 
a reduced depreciation expense."
"Government grants 
which compensate the Group for expenses are recog-
nized as other operating income in the same period as 
the expenses themselves."
"In addition to the prorated profits and losses 
from financial investments, it also includes profits and 
losses resulting from the sale of equity interests or the 
remeasurement of equity interests following a loss of 
significant influence or joint control."
"Non-participation or subpro-
portional participation in capital reductions is recorded 
as fictitious acquisition transactions."
"This item also 
includes impairment losses and/or gains on the rever-
sal of such impairments of equity-method investments."
"Other financial income/expense 
Other financial income/expense, includes all income 
and expense from financial transactions which are 
included neither in interest income nor in interest ex-
pense, and which for Mercedes-Benz Mobility are in-
cluded neither in revenue nor in cost of sales."
"Furthermore, income and expenses from equity inter-
ests are included in other financial income/expense if 
such income or expenses are not presented under 
gains/losses on equity-method investments."
"Interest income and interest expense 
Interest income and interest expense include interest 
income from investments in securities and from cash 
and cash equivalents as well as interest expense from 
liabilities."
"Furthermore, interest and changes in fair 
values related to interest rate hedging activities as well 
as income and expense resulting from the allocation of 
premiums and discounts are included."
"The interest 
components of defined benefit pension commitments 
and similar obligations, as well as of the plan assets 
available to cover these obligations and interest on 
supplementary income tax payments or reimburse-
ments are also presented in this line item."
"Interest income and expense and gains or losses from 
derivative financial instruments related to the financial 
services business are disclosed under revenue and 
cost of sales respectively."
"Expense from the compounding of interest on provi-
sions for other risks is presented in other financial 
income/expense."
"Income taxes 
Income taxes are comprised of current income taxes 
and deferred taxes."
"Current income taxes are calculated based on the re-
spective local taxable income and local tax rules for the 
period."
"The calculation of income taxes of  
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and its subsidiaries is based 
on the legislation and regulations applicable in the 
various countries."
"In addition, current income taxes 
presented for the reporting year include adjustments 
for uncertain tax payments or tax refunds for periods 
not yet finally assessed; however, excluding interest 
expenses and interest refunds and penalties on the 
underpayment of taxes."
"In cases for which it is proba-
ble that amounts declared as expenses in the tax re-
turns might not be recognized (uncertain tax positions), 
a liability for income taxes is recognized."
"The amount is 
based on the best estimate of the expected tax pay-
ment (expected amount or most likely amount)."
"Tax-
refund claims from uncertain tax positions are recog-
nized when it is probable that they can be realized."
"Only in the case of tax-loss carryforwards or unused 
tax credits, no liability for taxes or tax claim is recog-
nized for these uncertain tax positions."
"Instead, the 
deferred tax assets for the unused tax-loss carryfor-
wards or tax credits are adjusted."
"Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated on the 
basis of temporary differences between the tax basis 
and the financial reporting of assets and liabilities in-
cluding differences from consolidation, on unused tax-
loss carryforwards and unused tax credits."
"Measure-
ment is based on the tax rates expected to be effective 
in the period in which an asset is recognized or a liabil-
ity is settled."
"For this purpose, the tax rates and tax 
rules are used which have been enacted at the report-
ing date or are soon to be enacted."
"Deferred tax assets 
are recognized to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be future taxable income available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, tax-loss 
carryforwards and tax credits can be utilized."
"For the calculation of deferred tax assets, assumptions 
have to be made regarding future taxable income and 
the time of realization of the deferred tax assets."
"In this 
context, the Mercedes-Benz Group takes into consider-
ation, among other things, the projected earnings from 
business activities, the effects on earnings of the re-
versal of taxable temporary differences, and realizable 
tax strategies."
"On each balance sheet date, the  
Mercedes-Benz Group carries out impairment tests on 
deferred tax assets on the basis of the planned taxable 
income in future years."
"Deferred tax assets are only 
recognized if it is more likely than not that future tax 
benefits can be realized."
"Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing 
profit attributable to shareholders of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG by the weighted average number of shares 
outstanding."
"Intangible assets 
Intangible assets are measured at acquisition or manu-
facturing cost less accumulated amortization."
"If neces-
sary, accumulated impairment losses are recognized."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are re-
viewed annually to determine whether indefinite-life 
assessment continues to be appropriate."
"If not, the 
change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to 
finite is made on a prospective basis."
"Development costs for vehicles and components are 
capitalized if the recognition criteria according to IAS 
38 are met."
"Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset 
is carried at acquisition or manufacturing costs less 
accumulated amortization and accumulated impair-
ment losses."
"Capitalized development costs include  
all direct costs and pro-rata allocable overheads."
"Capi-
talized development costs for vehicles and vehicle 
components are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
the expected product life cycle."
"The planned product 
lifespan only exceeds ten years in individual cases."
"The assessment also takes into account possible im-
pacts from the transformation of the automotive indus-
try, such as the transition to electric drive systems."
"Amortization of capitalized development costs is an 
element of manufacturing costs and is allocated to 
those vehicles and components by which they were 
generated and is included in cost of sales when the 
inventory (vehicles) is sold."
"The amortization period 
for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed 
at least at the end of each reporting year."
"Changes in 
expected useful lives are treated as changes in ac-
counting estimates."
"The amortization expense on in-
tangible assets with finite useful lives is recorded in 
functional costs."
"With acquisitions of businesses, goodwill represents 
the excess of the consideration transferred over the 
fair values assigned to the identifiable assets propor-
tionally acquired and liabilities assumed."
"Goodwill is 
accounted for at the subsidiaries in the functional cur-
rency of those subsidiaries."
Emission allowances (e.g.
"emission permits from the EU 
emissions trading system or the vehicle-related emis-
sions regulations in the USA or China) to compensate 
for CO2 emissions are also reported under intangible 
assets."
"These certificates and rights are stated at ac-
quisition cost."
"Derecognition occurs at the time the 
certificates or rights are returned or upon sale or expi-
ration."
"Obligations to surrender emission allowances 
are recognized as provisions valued at the acquisition 
costs of emission allowances that have already been 
purchased."
"Any excess obligation that may exist is 
valued at the market value of the emission allowances 
still to be acquired."
"Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are measured at acqui-
sition or manufacturing costs less accumulated depre-
ciation."
"If necessary, accumulated impairment losses 
are recognized."
"The costs of internally produced equipment and facili-
ties include all direct costs and allocable overheads."
"Acquisition or manufacturing costs include the esti-
mated costs, if any, of dismantling and removing the 
item and restoring the site as well as borrowing costs."
"Depreciable property, plant and equipment are written 
down by scheduled depreciation over the correspond-
ing useful life, generally on a straight-line basis."
"The 
useful lives of property, plant and equipment are 
shown in the following table."
"The Group is a lessee mainly of real estate 
properties and a lessor of its products."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group as lessee 
The Mercedes-Benz Group as a lessee recognizes for 
generally all lease contracts right-of-use assets as well 
as leasing liabilities for the outstanding lease pay-
ments."
"Variable lease payments that are not included in 
the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset are rec-
ognized as an expense for the period."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group applies both recognition 
exemptions for leases with a lease term of twelve 
months or less (short-term leases) and for leases for 
which the underlying asset is of low value, not to rec-
ognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability."
"The 
lease payments associated with those leases are gen-
erally recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term."
"The cost of a right-of-use asset comprises the amount 
of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any 
lease payments made at or before the commencement 
date, any initial direct costs and an estimate of costs to 
be incurred in dismantling or removing the underlying 
asset."
"All leasing incentives already received from the 
lessor are deducted."
"Lease liabilities, which are assigned to financing liabili-
ties, are measured initially at the present value of the 
lease payments still to be made."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group generally also applies the 
option for contracts comprising lease components as 
well as non-lease components not to split these com-
ponents."
"Lease payments are discounted at the rate implicit in 
the lease if that rate can readily be determined."
"Other-
wise, discounting is at the incremental borrowing rate."
"This incremental borrowing rate as a risk-adjusted in-
terest rate is derived on a maturity- and currency spe-
cific basis."
"As the cash flow pattern of the reference 
interest rates (bullet bonds) does not correspond to 
the cash flow pattern of a lease contract (annuity), a 
duration adjustment in order to account for that differ-
ence is used."
"A right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated depreciation and, if necessary, 
any accumulated impairment."
"If the lease transfers 
ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the 
end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use 
asset reflects that the lessee will exercise a purchase 
option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end 
of the useful life of the underlying asset."
"Otherwise, the 
right-of-use asset is depreciated to the end of the 
lease term."
"In the subsequent measurement of a lease liability, the 
carrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the 
lease liability and reduced to reflect the lease pay-
ments made."
"According to IFRS 16, the depreciation of 
right-of-use assets is recognized within functional 
costs."
"The interest due on the lease liability is a com-
ponent of interest expense."
"Extension and termination 
options are part of a number of leases particularly of 
real estate."
"In determining the lease term, those op-
tions are only considered if their exercise is reasonably 
certain."
"During the term, these options are regularly 
checked with regard to their probability of being exer-
cised."
"For operating leases the economic ownership of the 
vehicle remains at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Addition-
ally, an operating lease may have to be reported with 
sales of vehicles for which the Group enters into a 
repurchase obligation."
"- Sales of vehicles by which the Mercedes-Benz Group 
is obliged to repurchase the vehicles in the future are 
accounted for as operating leases."
"This also applies 
to a call option that only grants the Mercedes-Benz 
Group the right to repurchase."
"- Sales of vehicles including a put option (an entity’s 
obligation to repurchase the asset at the customer’s 
request) are reported as operating leases if the cus-
tomer has a significant economic incentive to exer-
cise that right."
"Otherwise, a sale with a right of return 
is reported."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group considers 
several factors when assessing whether a customer 
has a significant economic incentive to exercise his 
or her right at contract inception."
"Among others, 
these are the relation between the repurchase price 
and the expected future market value (at the time of 
repurchase) of the asset, or historical return rates."
"As part of the residual-value management process, 
especially for operating lease contracts, certain as-
sumptions are regularly made regarding the expected 
level of prices, based upon which the cars to be re-
turned in the leasing business are evaluated."
"If chang-
ing market developments at the balance sheet date 
lead to a negative deviation from previously estimated 
assumptions, the residual value must be adjusted or an 
impairment carried out."
"Depending on the region and 
the current market situation, the risk-mitigation 
measures taken generally include continuous market 
monitoring as well as, if required, price-setting strate-
gies or sales-promotion measures designed to regulate 
vehicle inventories."
"Market forecasts are verified by 
regular comparisons of internal and external sources, 
and, if required, the determination of residual values is 
adjusted and further developed with regard to meth-
ods, processes and systems."
"In the case of accounting as an operating lease, these 
vehicles are capitalized at the (amortized) cost of pro-
duction under equipment on operating leases and are 
depreciated over the contract term on a straight-line 
basis with consideration of the expected residual val-
ues."
"Changes in the expected residual values lead ei-
ther to prospective adjustments of the scheduled de-
preciation or, if necessary, to an impairment loss."
"The 
vehicles are allocated to the segment which bears sub-
stantially all of the residual-value risk."
"Operating leases also relate to vehicles, primarily 
Group products that Mercedes-Benz Mobility acquires 
from non-Group dealers or other third parties and 
leases to end customers."
"These vehicles are presented 
at (amortized) cost of acquisition under equipment on 
operating leases in the Mercedes-Benz Mobility seg-
ment."
"If these vehicles are Group products and are 
subsidized and these subsidies are passed on in the 
lease agreement with the external customer, the subsi-
dies are deducted from the acquisition cost."
"After rev-
enue is received from the sale to independent dealers, 
these Group products generate revenue from lease 
payments and subsequent resale on the basis of the 
separate leasing contracts."
"In the case of finance leases, the Group presents the 
receivables under receivables from financial services in 
an amount corresponding to the net investment of the 
lease agreements."
"The net investment of a lease 
agreement is the gross investment (future lease pay-
ments and non-guaranteed residual value) discounted 
at the rate upon which the lease agreement is based."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility continues the leasing and 
sales-financing business for Daimler Truck’s commer-
cial vehicles in some markets."
"To this end, Mercedes-
Benz Mobility acquires these vehicles from Daimler 
Truck and leases them to the end customers."
"Insofar as 
a mandatory vehicle return to Daimler Truck has been 
agreed, a leasing contract (head lease) between Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility and Daimler Truck is shown."
"Accounting for and classification of a sublease depend 
on whether the contracts were concluded before or 
after the legal spin-off and hive-down of Daimler's 
commercial vehicle business."
"The leases that were 
concluded before the legal spin-off and hive-down are 
continued as operating leases."
"The head lease is pre-
sented under equipment on operating leases as a right 
of use, which was recognized at fair value at the spin-
off date and subsequently depreciated on a straight-
line basis."
"In addition, a residual-value receivable from 
the companies of the Daimler Truck Group is recog-
nized."
"However, the leasing contracts concluded after 
the legal spin-off and hive-down are classified and 
accounted for as finance leases."
"The net investment in 
the lease corresponds to the right-of-use asset from 
the head lease."
"In addition to the finance lease, Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility recognizes a residual-value re-
ceivable from the Daimler Truck Group in the amount 
of the guaranteed residual value."
"The head lease is not 
recorded separately."
"Impairment of non-current non-financial assets 
The Mercedes-Benz Group assesses at each reporting 
date whether there is an indication that an asset may 
be impaired or whether there is an indication that a 
previously recognized impairment loss may be re-
versed."
"If such indication exists, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset."
"The recoverable amount is determined for each indi-
vidual asset unless the asset generates cash inflows 
that are not largely independent of those from other 
assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating 
units)."
"An assessment is made at each reporting date as to 
whether there is any indication that previously recog-
nized impairment losses may no longer exist or may be 
reversed."
"If this is the case, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
records a partial or entire reversal of the impairment; 
the carrying amount is thereby increased to the recov-
erable amount."
"However, the increased carrying 
amount may not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined (net of scheduled depre-
ciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in 
prior years."
"Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives are tested at least annually for impairment."
"This takes place at the level of the cash-generating 
units."
"The cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Cars 
and Mercedes-Benz Vans basically correspond to the 
segments."
"At Mercedes-Benz Mobility, impairment 
testing is carried out below segment level."
"A distinction 
is made between the two cash-generating units Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility Classic (traditional financial ser-
vices business) and Charging Solutions (development 
of a high-power charging network)."
"As the Charging 
Solutions cash-generating unit had neither goodwill nor 
other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives in 
2023 and there was no indication of impairment in 
2023, it was not necessary to calculate the recoverable 
amount."
"If it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset 
or of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable 
amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the dif-
ference."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs of disposal and value in use."
"For cash-generating 
units, the Mercedes-Benz Group in a first step deter-
mines the respective recoverable amount as value in 
use and compares it with the respective carrying 
amount (including goodwill)."
"If value in use is lower 
than the carrying amount, fair value less costs of dis-
posal is additionally calculated to determine the recov-
erable amount."
"Future cash flows are determined on the basis of the 
long-term planning, which is approved by management 
and which is valid at the date when the impairment test 
is conducted."
"In the detailed planning period, an overall moderate 
increase in unit sales and revenue is assumed for the 
cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans, with a significant increase in the 
proportion of electric vehicles."
"Based on the sales 
planning of the cash-generating units Mercedes-Benz 
Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans, the planning of the 
cash-generating unit Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic 
assumes an increase in the portfolio in the detailed 
planning period."
"The assumptions used for planning are 
checked for plausibility both against historical devel-
opments and against external sources of information 
(e.g."
"The rounded, risk-adjusted inter-
est rates determined specifically for the respective 
cash-generating unit and used to discount the cash 
flows are 9.5% (2022: 9%) after taxes for the Mer-
cedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans cash-
generating units."
"A risk-adjusted interest rate of 10% 
(2022: 10%) after taxes is used for the Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility Classic cash-generating unit."
"While the dis-
count rate for the Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic 
cash-generating unit represents the cost of equity, the 
risk-adjusted interest rate for the Mercedes-Benz Cars 
and Mercedes-Benz Vans cash-generating units is 
based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC)."
"This is calculated based on the capital asset pricing 
model (CAPM), taking into account current market ex-
pectations."
"In calculating the risk-adjusted interest rate 
for impairment-test purposes, specific peer group in-
formation is used for beta factors, capital-structure 
data and cost of debt."
"Periods not covered by the fore-
cast are taken into account by recognizing a residual 
value (terminal value), which does not include any 
growth rates."
"When deriving the terminal value, as-
sumptions regarding the effects of the transformation 
of the automotive industry are also taken into account, 
analogous to the detailed planning period."
"When deriv-
ing the value in use, a risk assessment is also carried 
out for both the detailed planning period and the ter-
minal value, which includes, for example, market risks 
as well as risks resulting from legal and political 
framework conditions (e.g."
"in connection with sustaina-
bility aspects)."
"This risk assessment shows for the rele-
vant cash-generating units that even in the case of 
reasonably possible changes in operational key as-
sumptions (e.g."
"profitability of the products, unit sales 
and portfolio) compared to the original planning, no 
need for impairment exists."
"While the recoverable 
amount of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-
Benz Vans cash-generating units significantly exceeds 
the carrying amount, the recoverable amount of the 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility Classic cash-generating unit is 
close to the carrying amount."
"In addition, sensitivity 
analyses are carried out (e.g."
"with regard to the dis-
count rate)."
"The carrying amount of the Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility Classic cash-generating unit would exceed the 
recoverable amount if, in addition to a change in opera-
tional key assumptions, the cost of equity were to in-
crease slightly."
"If the Group loses control 
of a subsidiary and subsequently presents it at equity, 
the fair value of the retained shares represents the 
acquisition cost."
"On the date of acquisition, a positive difference be-
tween cost of acquisition and the Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable as-
sets and liabilities of the associated company or joint 
venture is determined and recognized as investor level 
goodwill."
"The goodwill is included in the carrying 
amount of the equity-method investment."
"If an equity 
interest in an existing associated company is increased 
without change in significant influence, goodwill is 
determined only for the additionally acquired interest; 
the previous investment is not remeasured at fair val-
ue."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group reviews on each reporting 
date whether there is any objective indication of im-
pairments or impairment reversals of equity-method 
investments."
"If such indications exist, the Group de-
termines the impairment loss or reversal to be recog-
nized."
"If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable 
amount of an investment, the carrying amount is writ-
ten down to the recoverable amount."
"The recoverable 
amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use."
"An impairment reversal is carried out if 
there is objective evidence for an impairment reversal."
"If such an assessment is made, the recoverable amount 
is remeasured."
"An impairment reversal is recognized to 
the extent that the recoverable amount has increased 
subsequent to the impairment and is limited to the 
amount by which an asset has been impaired."
"Gains or losses to be eliminated from transactions with 
companies accounted for using the equity method are 
recognized through profit and loss with corresponding 
adjustments of the investments’ carrying amounts."
"Gains or losses from the contribution of interests in 
subsidiaries to investments which are measured using 
the equity method are also subject to elimination ad-
justments to the carrying amount of the investment."
"Non-current assets and disposal groups  
held for sale 
The Group classifies non-current assets or disposal 
groups as held for sale if the carrying amount will be 
recovered principally through an extremely likely sale 
transaction rather than through continuing use."
"In this 
case, the assets or disposal groups are no longer de-
preciated as planned, but are measured at the lower of 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell."
"Imme-
diately before classification as held for sale, it is as-
sessed if the assets are impaired based on the applica-
ble individual regulations."
"If fair value less costs to sell 
subsequently increases, any impairment loss previously 
recognized is reversed."
"This reversal is restricted to the 
impairment loss previously recognized for the assets or 
disposal group concerned."
"Inventories 
Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or 
manufacturing cost and net realizable value."
"The net 
realizable value is the expected sales price less esti-
mated costs of completion and estimated costs to sell."
"The acquisition or manufacturing costs of inventories 
are generally based on the specific identification meth-
od and include costs incurred in acquiring the invento-
ries and bringing them to their present location and 
condition."
"Acquisition or manufacturing costs for large 
numbers of inventories that are interchangeable are 
allocated under the average-cost formula."
"Financial instruments 
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to 
a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity."
"Financial instru-
ments in the form of financial assets and financial lia-
bilities are generally presented separately."
"Financial 
instruments are recognized as soon as the Mercedes-
Benz Group becomes a party to the contractual provi-
sions of the financial instrument."
"In the case of pur-
chases or sales of financial assets through the regular 
market, the Mercedes-Benz Group uses the transaction 
date as the date of initial recognition or derecognition."
"Upon initial recognition, financial instruments are 
measured at fair value."
"Transac-
tion costs directly attributable to acquisition or issu-
ance are considered when determining the carrying 
amount if the financial instruments are not measured at 
fair value through profit or loss."
"Financial assets 
Financial assets primarily comprise receivables from 
financial services, trade receivables, receivables from 
banks, cash on hand, derivative financial assets, mar-
ketable securities and similar investments and financial 
investments."
"The classification of financial instruments is based on 
the business model in which these instruments are 
held and on their contractual cash flows."
"The determination of the business model is carried out 
at the portfolio level and is based on management’s 
intention and past transaction patterns."
"Assessments 
of the contractual cash flows are made on an instru-
ment-by-instrument basis."
"Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss  
Financial assets recognized at fair value through profit 
or loss include financial assets with cash flows other 
than those of principal and interest on the nominal 
amount outstanding."
"Furthermore, financial assets that 
are held in a business model other than “hold to col-
lect” or “hold to collect and sell” are included here."
"Gains or losses on these financial assets are recognized 
in profit or loss."
"to 
achieve a defined liquidity target (business model “hold 
to collect and sell”)."
"This category also includes equity 
instruments not held for trading for which the option to 
recognize changes in the fair value of the instrument 
within other comprehensive income has been applied."
"Upon the 
disposal of debt instruments, the accumulated gains 
and losses recognized in other comprehensive in-
come/loss resulting from measurement at fair value are 
recognized in profit or loss."
"Interest earned on financial 
assets at fair value through other comprehensive in-
come is generally reported as interest income using the 
effective-interest method."
"Changes in the fair value of 
equity instruments measured at fair value through oth-
er comprehensive income are not recycled to profit or 
loss, but reclassified to retained earnings upon dispos-
al."
"Dividends are recognized in profit or loss when the 
right to payment has been established."
"After initial recognition, these finan-
cial assets at amortized cost are subsequently carried 
at amortized cost using the effective-interest method 
less any loss allowances."
"Gains and losses are recog-
nized in the Consolidated Statement of Income when 
the financial assets at amortized cost are impaired or 
derecognized."
"Interest effects from the application of 
the effective-interest method are also recognized in 
profit or loss as well as effects from foreign currency 
translation."
"Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on 
hand, cheques and demand deposits at banks, as well 
as debt instruments and certificates of deposits with a 
remaining term when acquired of up to three months, 
which are not subject to any material value fluctua-
tions."
"Cash and cash equivalents correspond with the 
classification in the Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows."
"Impairment of financial assets 
At each reporting date, an impairment is recognized for 
financial assets, loan commitments and financial guar-
antees other than those to be measured at fair value 
through profit or loss reflecting expected credit losses 
for these instruments."
"The portion of the lifetime 
expected credit losses resulting from default events 
possible within the next 12 months is recognized."
"The expected credit 
loss is recognized as an impairment measured over the 
expected lifetime of the financial asset."
"Objective evi-
dence for a credit-impaired financial asset includes 91 
days past due date and other information about signifi-
cant financial difficulties of the debtor."
"For debt 
instruments that are not receivables from financial 
services, a significant increase in credit risk is assessed 
mainly based on past-due information or the probabil-
ity of default."
"A financial asset is migrated to stage 2 if the asset’s 
credit risk has increased significantly compared to its 
credit risk at initial recognition."
"The credit risk is as-
sessed based on the probability of default."
"For trade 
receivables, the simplified approach is applied whereby 
all trade receivables are allocated to stage 2 initially."
"Hence, no determination of significant increases in 
credit risk is necessary."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group applies the low-credit-risk 
exception to the stage allocation to quoted debt in-
struments with investment-grade ratings."
"These debt 
instruments are always allocated to stage 1."
"In stages 1 and 2, the effective interest revenue is cal-
culated based on gross carrying amounts."
"If a financial 
asset becomes credit impaired in stage 3, the effective 
interest revenue is calculated based on its net carrying 
amount (gross carrying amount adjusted for any loss 
allowance)."
"Expected credit losses are measured as the probabil-
ity-weighted present value of all cash shortfalls over 
the expected life of each financial asset."
"For receiva-
bles from financial services, expected credit losses are 
calculated using a statistical model with three major 
risk parameters: probability of default, loss given de-
fault and exposure at default."
"The estimation of these risk parameters incorporates 
all available relevant information, not only historical 
and current loss data, but also reasonable and sup-
portable forward-looking information reflected by fu-
ture expectations."
"This information includes macroeco-
nomic factors (e.g."
"gross domestic product growth, 
unemployment rate, cost performance index) and fore-
casts of future economic conditions."
"The impairment 
amount for trade receivables is predominantly deter-
mined on a collective basis."
"A financial instrument is written off when there is no 
reasonable expectation of recovery in whole or in part, 
for example, after the end of insolvency proceedings or 
after a court decision of uncollectibility."
Significant modification of financial assets (e.g.
"with a 
change in the present value of the contractual cash 
flows of 10%) also leads to derecognition of the finan-
cial assets with a simultaneous recognition of new 
financial assets."
"If the terms of a contract are renegoti-
ated or modified and this does not result in derecogni-
tion of the contract, then the gross carrying amount of 
the contract is recalculated and a modification gain or 
loss is recognized in profit or loss."
"Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities primarily include trade payables, 
liabilities to financial institutions, bonds, derivative 
financial liabilities and other liabilities."
"Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost 
After initial recognition, financial liabilities are subse-
quently measured at amortized cost using the effec-
tive-interest method."
"Insofar as the Mercedes-Benz Group enters into re-
verse factoring agreements in which trade receivables 
of a supplier are transferred to a financial intermediary, 
changes in the presentation of the original trade paya-
bles may occur."
"That would be the case if these liabili-
ties differed in nature and function from other trade 
payables."
"As a result, these liabilities would be pre-
sented separately."
"Financial liabilities at fair value through  
profit or loss 
Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through 
profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trad-
ing."
"Derivatives (including embedded derivatives sepa-
rated from the host contract) which are not used as 
hedging instruments in hedge accounting are classified 
as held for trading."
"Gains or losses on liabilities held for 
trading are recognized in profit or loss."
"Derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments exclu-
sively for hedging financial risks that arise from its 
operating or financing activities or liquidity manage-
ment."
"These are mainly currency risks, interest rate 
risks and commodity price risks."
"If such contracts do 
not meet the criteria for executory contracts they are 
recorded as derivatives."
"These derivatives are meas-
ured at fair value through profit or loss."
"The valuation 
effects are reported in the functional costs, in which 
the consumption of the procured non-financial items 
(e.g."
"Embedded derivatives are principally separated from 
the host contract and recognized separately."
"However, 
embedded derivatives are not separated from the host 
contract if that host contract is a financial asset, if the 
Mercedes-Benz Group chooses to measure a hybrid 
contract at fair value through profit or loss, or if the 
embedded derivative is closely related to the host 
contract."
"Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair 
value upon initial recognition and at each subsequent 
reporting date."
"The fair value of listed derivatives is 
equal to their positive or negative market value."
"If a 
market value is not available, fair value is calculated 
using standard financial valuation models such as dis-
counted cash flow or option-pricing models."
"Deriva-
tives are recognized as assets if their fair value is posi-
tive and as liabilities if their fair value is negative."
"In a fair-value 
hedge, the changes in the fair value of a recognized 
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment 
are hedged."
"In a cash flow hedge, highly probable fu-
ture cash flows from expected transactions or variable 
cash flows to be paid or received related to a recog-
nized asset or liability are hedged."
"The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the 
start of and during the hedging relationship."
"Changes in fair value of non-designated derivatives are 
recognized in profit or loss."
"For fair-value hedges, 
changes in the fair value of derivative financial instru-
ments and the hedged item are recognized in profit or 
loss."
"For cash flow hedges, fair-value changes in the 
effective portion of derivative financial instruments are 
recognized after tax in other comprehensive income."
"Effects from hedging are presented in the item of the 
Statement of Income in which the underlying transac-
tion is effective."
"Under IFRS 9, for cash flow hedges in procurement 
transactions expected with a high degree of probabil-
ity, designation can be made for separable risk compo-
nents of these non-financial hedged items."
"the forecast transaction, 
results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability."
"For other cash flow hedges, the accumulated hedging 
gains or losses from hedging instruments are reclassi-
fied from the reserves for derivative financial instru-
ments to the Consolidated Statement of Income when 
the hedged item affects profit or loss."
"Insofar as cur-
rency translation effects recognized in profit or loss 
due to trade receivables and payables are connected 
with the underlying hedged transactions, simultaneous-
ly occurring hedging gains/losses are reclassified in the 
Consolidated Statement of Income."
"The ineffective portions of fair-value changes are rec-
ognized directly in profit or loss."
"This may apply for example to the time 
value of options, the forward element of a forward 
contract or cross-currency basis spreads."
"Hedge relationships are to be discontinued prospec-
tively if a particular hedge relationship ceases to meet 
the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 
9."
"Accumulated hedg-
ing gains and losses from cash flow hedges are re-
tained and are reclassified from equity as described at 
maturity if the hedged future cash flows are still ex-
pected to occur."
"Otherwise, accumulated hedging gains 
and losses are immediately reclassified to profit or 
loss."
"If derivative financial instruments do not or no longer 
qualify for hedge accounting because the qualifying 
criteria for hedge accounting are not or are no longer 
met, the derivative financial instruments are classified 
as held for trading and are measured at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"Pensions and similar obligations 
The measurement of defined benefit commitments for 
pensions and other similar post-employment benefits 
(healthcare benefits) in accordance with IAS 19 Em-
ployee Benefits is based on the projected unit-credit 
method."
"Plan assets invested to cover defined benefit 
pension commitments and other post-employment 
benefit obligations are measured at fair value and off-
set against the corresponding obligations."
"The balance of defined benefit commitments for pen-
sions and other post-employment benefit obligations 
and plan assets (net pension obligation or net pension 
assets) accrues interest at the discount rate used as a 
basis for the measurement of the gross pension obliga-
tion."
"The resulting net interest expense or income is 
recognized in profit and loss under interest expense or 
interest income in the Consolidated Statement of In-
come."
"The other expenses resulting from pension 
commitments and other post-employment benefit obli-
gations, which mainly result from entitlements acquired 
during the year under review, are taken into considera-
tion in functional costs in the Consolidated Statement 
of Income."
"Differences between the assumptions made 
and actual developments as well as changes in actuari-
al assumptions for the measurement of defined benefit 
plans and similar obligations result in actuarial gains 
and losses, which are recognized in equity through 
other comprehensive income."
"For 
very long maturities, there are no high-quality corpo-
rate bonds available as a benchmark."
"The respective 
discount factors are estimated by extrapolating current 
market rates along the yield curve."
"Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a 
defined benefit plan are recognized in profit or loss 
when the curtailment or settlement occurs."
"The amount recognized as a provi-
sion represents the best estimate of the obligation at 
the reporting date."
"Provisions with an original maturity 
of more than one year are discounted to the present 
value of the expenditures expected to settle the obli-
gation at the end of the reporting period."
"If the recognition criteria of provisions are not fulfilled 
and the possibility of a cash outflow upon settlement is 
not unlikely, the item is to be presented as a contingent 
liability, insofar as it is adequately measurable."
"The 
amount disclosed as a contingent liability represents 
the best estimate of the possible obligation at the re-
porting date."
"Provisions and contingent liabilities are 
regularly reviewed and adjusted as further information 
becomes available or circumstances change."
"A provision for expected warranty costs is recognized 
when a product is sold or when a new warranty pro-
gramme is initiated."
"Estimates for accrued warranty 
costs are particularly based on historical experience."
"Other assumptions include, but are not limited to, the 
amount of potential repair costs."
"The provisions are 
regularly adjusted to reflect new information."
"Restructuring provisions are set up in connection with 
programmes that materially change the scope of busi-
ness performed by a segment or business unit or the 
manner in which business is conducted."
"In most cases, 
restructuring expenses include termination benefits 
and compensation payments due to the termination of 
agreements with suppliers and dealers."
"Benefits on 
termination of employment are recognized when the 
Group has a detailed formal plan that has either com-
menced implementation or been announced."
"Contract and refund liabilities 
Contract liabilities 
A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer 
goods or services to a customer for which the entity 
has received consideration (or the amount is due) from 
the customer."
"Refund liabilities 
A refund liability occurs if the Mercedes-Benz Group 
receives consideration from a customer and expects to 
refund some or all of that consideration to the custom-
er."
"A refund liability is measured at the amount of con-
sideration received for which the Mercedes-Benz 
Group does not expect to be entitled and is thus not 
included in the transaction price."
"Share-based payment 
Share-based payment comprises cash-settled liability 
awards."
"Liability awards are measured at fair value at each 
balance sheet date until settlement and are classified 
as provisions under consideration of vesting condi-
tions."
"The profit or loss of the period equals the addi-
tion to and/or the reversal of the provision during the 
reporting period and the dividend equivalent paid dur-
ing the period, and is included in functional costs."
"In addition, interest paid 
as well as interest and dividends received are allocated 
to cash flow from operating activities."
"To the extent 
that the reverse factoring agreements entered into by 
the Mercedes-Benz Group do not result in a change in 
the presentation of the original trade payables, the 
cash flows from these agreements are also presented 
in cash flow from operating activities."
"Furthermore all 
cash flows of receivables from financial services in the 
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are also classi-
fied as cash flow from operating activities."
"The cash flows from short-term marketable debt secu-
rities with high turnover rates and significant amounts 
are offset and presented within cash flow from invest-
ing activities."
"1 Net carbon-neutral means that no CO2 emissions are created or any resulting CO2 
emissions are offset by certified compensation projects."
"Consideration of sustainability related aspects in 
connection with the recognition and measurement 
of assets and liabilities 
With “Ambition 2039” the Mercedes-Benz Group has 
set itself the target of net carbon-neutrality1 for the 
new vehicle fleet by 2039 in its business strategy."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Group is aiming to shape the transfor-
mation into a software-driven and all-electric future."
"The Group is creating the necessary conditions to be-
come all-electric."
"The pace of the transformation is 
determined by market conditions and the wishes of 
customers."
"Recognition and measurement of the 
Group’s assets and liabilities take into account climate-
related risks and developments associated with the 
transformation, which also include the climate targets 
set in the Paris Climate Agreement."
"Changes in the originally 
envisaged product life cycles can result from the trans-
formation to all-electric vehicles."
"Due to the resolu-
tions regarding the accelerated transformation new 
developments in the area of conventional powertrains 
are reduced and already capitalized development ex-
penditure will partly be used for longer."
"In the same way, the useful lives of property, plant and 
equipment assets are regularly reviewed in the light of 
the transformation to all-electric vehicles."
"This did not 
require any material adjustments of the useful lives up 
to the reporting date as the production facilities of the 
Group are basically flexible in use."
"In the context of production network management, 
efforts are also being made to secure sites affected by 
the transformation by enhancing them."
"No significant 
obligations to dismantle or remove production facilities 
and plants that would give rise to a provision existed 
on the reporting date."
"When determining 
recoverability, the expected residual value of the 
leased vehicles is particularly relevant."
"Due to the 
transformation to all-electric vehicles, residual values 
can be influenced by changing customer behavior, new 
regulatory requirements and further technological de-
velopments."
"Although the currently expected residual 
values of all-electric vehicles were lower than originally 
expected, no significant impairment losses were re-
quired for conventionally powered or all-electric vehi-
cles in the reporting year."
"The expected proceeds from the disposal of vehicles 
pledged as collateral were taken into account in the 
determination of expected credit losses for receivables 
from financial services."
"The expected proceeds from 
the disposal were based on an estimate of the market 
value at the expected time of a possible default."
"There 
were no indications of a reduction of these estimated 
market values that could be traced to effects of climate 
change or of changing customer behaviour as of the 
reporting date."
"In addition to traditional energy supply contracts, 
which are usually only recorded as pending transac-
tions upon delivery, the Group has concluded contracts 
to secure purchase quantities and prices for renewable 
energies (in particular electricity from wind and solar 
energy)."
"These are contracts that provide for a fixed 
remuneration per unit of energy and are mainly recog-
nized either as derivatives or leases."
"The impairment test on the level of the cash-generating 
units is based on the corporate planning and strategy 
of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"This provides for a step 
by step substitution of vehicles with combustion en-
gines by electric vehicles."
"For the purposes of the impairment test, further risks 
(e.g."
"sales risks, price risks and risks regarding the fu-
ture price of raw materials) were also taken into ac-
count."
"Additional corporate planning parameters in 
connection with the transformation affect the invest-
ment requirements and the currently higher variable 
costs of all-electric vehicles in comparison with vehi-
cles with conventional powertrains."
"The simultaneous 
development, model refinement and production of 
electric and conventionally powered vehicles results in 
a high investment requirement, particularly in the detail 
planning period until 2028."
"No growth was assumed in 
the derivation of the terminal value, due in part to the 
not yet completely predictable effects of the competi-
tive situation and customer behaviour in the course of 
the transition to electric mobility."
"The impairment test 
carried out taking into account the transformation ef-
fects described did not result in any impairment re-
quirement for the cash-generating units."
"The major items affected by such estimates and man-
agement judgements are described as follows."
"Actual 
amounts may differ from the estimates."
"Changes in the 
estimates and management judgements can have a 
material impact on the Consolidated Financial State-
ments."
"Recoverable amounts of cash-generating units and 
equity-method investments 
In the context of impairment tests for non-financial 
assets, estimates have to be made to determine the 
recoverable amounts of cash-generating units."
"As-
sumptions have to be made in particular with regard to 
future cash inflows and outflows for the planning peri-
od and the following periods."
"The estimates mainly 
refer to future unit sales, growth in the respective mar-
kets and the profitability of the products, which are 
also highly dynamic and thus uncertain as a result of 
the transition to electric mobility."
"Therefore, a risk as-
sessment and sensitivity analyses are performed when 
deriving the value in use."
"On the basis of the impair-
ment tests carried out in 2023, the recoverable 
amounts are larger than the net assets of the Group’s 
cash-generating units."
"When objective evidence of impairment or impairment 
reversal is present, estimates and assessments also 
have to be made to determine the recoverable amount 
of an equity-method investment."
"The determination of 
the recoverable amount is based on assumptions re-
garding future business developments for the determi-
nation of the expected future cash flows of that in-
vestment."
"On the balance sheet date, the carrying 
amount of equity-method investments was €13,104 
million (31 December 2022: €13,530 million)."
"Recoverable amount of equipment on  
operating leases 
The Mercedes-Benz Group regularly reviews the factors 
determining the values of its leased vehicles (carrying 
amount as of 31 December 2023: €41,712 milllion;  
31 December 2022: €41,552 million)."
"In particular, it is 
necessary to estimate the residual values of vehicles, 
which constitute a substantial part of the expected 
future cash flows from equipment on operating leases."
"In this context, assumptions are made regarding major 
influencing factors, such as the expected number of 
returned vehicles, the latest remarketing results and 
future vehicle model changes."
"Those assumptions are 
determined either by qualified estimates or by publica-
tions provided by expert third parties."
"Qualified esti-
mates are based, as far as publicly available, on exter-
nal data with consideration of internally available addi-
tional information such as historical experience of price 
developments and sale prices."
"The residual values thus 
determined serve as a basis for depreciation; changes 
in residual values lead either to prospective adjust-
ments of the depreciation or, in the case of a signifi-
cant decline in expected residual values, to an impair-
ment."
"If depreciation is prospectively adjusted, chang-
es in estimates of residual values do not have a direct 
effect but are equally distributed over the remaining 
term of the lease contract."
"Many factors are taken into 
consideration in this context including historical loss 
experience, the size and composition of certain portfo-
lios, current economic events and conditions and the 
current fair values and adequacy of collaterals."
"In addi-
tion to historical and current information on losses, 
appropriate and reliable forward-looking information 
on factors is also included."
"This information includes 
macroeconomic factors (e.g."
"gross domestic product 
growth, unemployment rate, cost performance index) 
and forecasts of future economic conditions."
"For re-
ceivables from financial services, these forecasts are 
performed using a scenario analysis (basic scenario, 
optimistic scenario and pessimistic scenario)."
"Further 
external information which cannot be depicted in the 
scenarios, is - as far as necessary - included in the 
assessment through subsequent adjustments."
"Changes 
to the estimation and assessment of these factors in-
fluence the allowance for credit losses with a resulting 
impact on the Group’s net profit."
"Product warranties 
The Group provides various types of product warran-
ties, depending on the type of product and market 
conditions."
"Provisions for product warranties (carrying 
amount as of 31 December 2023: €6,399 million;  
31 December 2022: €6,576 million) are generally recog-
nized at the time of vehicle sale."
"In order to determine 
the extent of these provisions, assumptions have to be 
made concerning the type and extent of future warran-
ty claims and goodwill cases, as well as on possible 
recall campaigns for each model series."
"These assess-
ments are based on experience of the frequency and 
extent of vehicle faults and defects in the past."
"In addi-
tion, the estimates also include assumptions on the 
amounts of potential repair costs per vehicle and the 
effects of possible time or mileage limits."
"The provi-
sions are regularly adjusted to reflect new information."
"Liability and litigation risks and governmental  
proceedings 
Various legal proceedings, claims and governmental 
investigations are pending against Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and its subsidiaries on a wide range of top-
ics."
"If the outcome of such legal proceedings is detri-
mental to the Mercedes-Benz Group, the Group may be 
required to pay substantial compensatory and punitive 
damages, to undertake service actions or recall cam-
paigns, to pay fines or to carry out other costly actions."
"Litigation and governmental investigations often in-
volve complex legal issues and are connected with a 
high degree of uncertainty."
"Accordingly, the assess-
ment of whether an obligation exists on the balance 
sheet date as a result of an event in the past, and 
whether a future cash outflow is likely and the obliga-
tion can be reliably estimated, largely depends on es-
timations by the management."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group regularly evaluates the current stage of legal 
proceedings, also with the involvement of external 
legal counsel."
"It is therefore possible that the amounts 
of provisions for pending or threatened proceedings 
will have to be regularly restated due to new expected 
developments."
"As of 31 December 2023, the carrying 
amounts of provisions for liability and litigation risks 
are €2,104 million (31 December 2022: €2,755 million)."
"Changes in estimates and assumptions can have a ma-
terial effect on the Group’s future profitability, liquidity 
and capial resources and financial position."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
may also become liable for payments in legal proceed-
ings for which no provisions were established."
"Pensions and similar obligations 
The calculation of provisions for pensions and similar 
obligations and the related pension cost are based on 
various actuarial valuations."
"The calculations are sub-
ject to various assumptions on matters such as current 
actuarially developed probabilities (e.g."
"discount fac-
tors and cost-of-living increases), future fluctuations 
with regard to age and period of service, and experi-
ence with the probability of occurrence of pension 
payments, annuities or lump sums."
"As a result of 
changed market or economic conditions, the probabili-
ties caused by the influencing factors may differ from 
current developments."
"The financial effects of devia-
tions of the main factors are calculated with the use of 
sensitivity analyses."
"As of 31 December 2023 provisions 
for pensions and similar obligations are €1,090 million 
(31 December 2022: €1,021 million)."
"Income taxes 
The calculation of income taxes of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG and its subsidiaries is based on the legisla-
tion and regulations applicable in the various countries."
"Due to their complexity, the tax items presented in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements are possibly subject 
to different judgements by taxpayers on the one hand 
and local tax authorities on the other hand."
"Different 
judgements can occur especially in connection with the 
recognition and measurement of balance sheet items 
as well as in connection with the tax assessment of 
expenses and income."
"Carrying amount of liabilities for 
income taxes as of 31 December 2023 are €2,421 mil-
lion (31 December 2022: €2,648 million)."
"Consolidated Group 
Composition of the Group 
The following table shows the composition of the 
Group."
"A detailed list of the companies included in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and of the equity 
investments of the Mercedes-Benz Group pursuant to 
Section 313 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) is 
provided in the statement of investments."
"Further in-
formation is provided in Note 41."
"Consolidated subsidiaries and an equity-
method associated company were established for the 
charging activities of electric vehicles."
"The main dis-
posals are described in the following sections."
"Structured entities 
The structured entities of the Group are mainly asset-
backed-securities (ABS) companies and special funds."
"The ABS companies are primarily used for the Group’s 
refinancing."
"The receivables transferred to structured 
entities usually result from the leasing and sales-
financing business."
"Those entities refinance the pur-
chase price by issuing securities."
"The special funds are 
set up in particular in order to diversify the capital-
investment strategy."
"At the reporting date, the Group has business relation-
ships with 34 (2022: 33) controlled structured entities, 
of which all are fully consolidated."
"In addition, as in the 
previous year the Group has relationships with one 
non-controlled structured entity."
"At the 
end of October 2022, the Mercedes-Benz Group signed 
contracts with the Russian car dealer Avtodom AO for 
the sale of the shares in the Russian subsidiaries."
"A degree of discretion has been exercised in the con-
sideration and subsequent derivation of the effects of 
the sanctions and counter-sanctions on the business 
activities."
"The recognition and valuation of the assets and liabili-
ties due to the discontinuation of the business activi-
ties in Russia, in particular the processing of existing 
transactions, resulted in expenses of around €0.7 bil-
lion in the automotive segments in 2022."
"Total expens-
es of around €0.2 billion resulted from the measure-
ment of credit default risks and increased refinancing 
expenses in the segment Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"The 
bulk of the expenses were included in cost of sales."
"As of 31 December 2022, completion of the transaction 
was still subject to authorities’ approval and the im-
plementation of the contractually agreed conditions."
"With the closing of the transaction on 19 April 2023, the 
shares of Russian subsidiaries were deconsolidated."
"The sale of the Russian subsidiaries resulted in no  
significant cash inflow."
"This led to a cash outflow in the 
amount of the disposed cash and cash equivalents of 
€91 million, which is mainly attributable to the Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility segment."
"The assets of €976 million disposed of with the decon-
solidation essentially include property, plant and 
equipment of €290 million and receivables from finan-
cial services of €280 million."
"In addition, cash and cash 
equivalents of €91 million are included."
"The disposed 
liabilities of €1,065 million include in particular provi-
sions of €636 million and financing liabilities of €347 
million."
"The Group had issued a global guarantee for 
the financing liabilities to financial institutions, which 
ended when the transaction was completed."
"The con-
tingent liabilities reported as of 31 December 2022 in 
connection with the cessation of business activities in 
Russia were also derecognized upon completion of the 
transaction."
The transaction costs amounted to €3 million.
"After 
realizing the currency reserve of €291 million, a loss on 
disposal of €205 million resulted."
"This was reported in 
other operating expenses."
"Expenses of €276 million 
were attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility seg-
ment; the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans segments generated income of €66 million and 
€5 million, respectively."
"The initially remaining financial services of the Daimler 
commercial vehicle business were sold to Daimler 
Truck Holding AG or its subsidiaries in 2022."
"At the 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment, assets of €3,191 mil-
lion and liabilities of €746 million were disposed of on 
or before 31 December 2022."
"In addition, in individual countries, investments in op-
erating entities or business operations of the former 
commercial vehicle business were sold to external third 
parties in 2022."
"Assets of €149 million and liabilities of 
€106 million, mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz 
Cars segment, were disposed of on or before 31 De-
cember 2022."
"The Group received €2,355 million from the (in the 
prior year partially still preliminary) purchase prices in 
2022, including the repayment of the existing intra-
Group financing liabilities of the companies and busi-
ness activities within the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Income of €32 million was realized 
for the operating investments and business activities 
disposed of in 2022, in particular in the Mercedes-Benz 
Cars segment."
"In total, expenses from the realization of 
the currency reserve of €58 million were recognized."
"In 2023 there were no significant effects on the profit-
ability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial 
position."
"Sale of foreign retail activities and other  
sales companies 
Agreements on the sale of further sales activities in 
other European countries were concluded in 2023."
"The 
disposals are to take place successively over the 
course of 2024."
"The criteria for classification as assets 
and liabilities held for distribution or sale are met as of 
31 December 2023."
"The assets of €0.8 billion and liabil-
ities of €0.2 billion are therefore reported as assets 
and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated State-
ment of Financial Position of 31 December 2023 in 
accordance with IFRS 5."
"Of the assets, €0.7 billion is 
attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment and 
€0.1 billion to the Mercedes-Benz Vans segment."
"As-
sets mainly comprise inventories of €0.3 billion, prop-
erty, plant and equipment of €0.2 billion and trade 
receivables of €0.1 billion."
"The liabilities, which are 
almost entirely attributable to the Mercedes-Benz Cars 
segment, mainly include financing liabilities to financial 
institutions of €0.1 billion."
"In January 2024, the Group divested its retail activities 
in Italy."
"There were no significant effects on the profit-
ability, liquidity and capital resources, and financial 
position."
"The sales company in Greece and other dealers in  
Europe were already sold in the course of 2023."
"The 
disposals resulted in income of €186 million."
"The cash 
inflow amounted to a total of €315 million."
"The effects 
are mainly allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars seg-
ment."
"In addition, further retail activities in various countries, 
in particular those allocated to the Mercedes-Benz 
Cars segment, were sold in 2022."
"The disposals result-
ed in income of €107 million and cash inflows of 
€362 million."
"In December 2021, the contractual arrangements on 
the sale of the retail activities in Canada were conclud-
ed."
"The transaction became effective in February 2022 
and the Group recognized other operating income of 
€514 million, which was mainly allocated to the Mer-
cedes-Benz Cars segment."
"The cash inflow amounted 
to €608 million and was also mainly allocated to the 
Mercedes-Benz Cars segment."
"Parts of the purchase 
price were financed by Mercedes-Benz Financial Ser-
vices in Canada and led to a cash outflow of 
€393 million at the Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment."
"Sale of Indonesian sales and production entities 
The Mercedes-Benz Group sold its subsidiaries in In-
donesia to a local investor with effect from 29 Septem-
ber 2023."
"The sale of both companies resulted in an 
income of €89 million and a cash inflow of €140 million 
which are allocated to the Mercedes-Benz Cars seg-
ment."
"Assets decreased by €141 million and liabilities 
by €88 million as a result of deconsolidation."
"In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group signed the contractual agreements with Motor-
sports Invest Ltd."
and INEOS Industries Holdings Ltd.
on the sale of shares of Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd.
"Some of the agreements concluded already took effect 
in 2021."
"When the other agreements became effective 
in January 2022, the Group lost control over Mercedes-
Benz Grand Prix Ltd."
"and included the remaining 33.3% 
interest in the company in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements using the equity method."
"The sale of the 
shares resulted in other operating income of 
€385 million in the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment in the 
first quarter of 2022."
"The purchase price payment 
agreed for 2023 resulted in a cash inflow of 
€144 million."
"Revenue 
Revenue in 2023 was slightly above the previous year’s 
level."
"The increase in revenue was primarily due to 
higher unit sales and improved pricing at the Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans segment."
"Revenue in the Mercedes-
Benz Cars segment was also higher, primarily due to a 
further improvement in pricing."
"However, negative 
exchange-rate effects had an opposing effect, causing 
a reduction in revenue."
"Revenue disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Income includes revenue from contracts with custom-
ers, which are in the scope of IFRS 15 (revenue accord-
ing to IFRS 15), and other revenue not in the scope of 
IFRS 15."
"The composition of the revenue in the Consol-
idated Statement of Income is shown by region in Note 
34."
"Revenue according to IFRS 15 is disaggregated by the 
two categories - type of products and services and 
geographical regions."
"The category type of products 
and services corresponds to the reported segments."
"Revenue related 
to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or 
partially unsatisfied) by the end of the reporting period 
that is expected to be recognized within three years 
amounted to €6,663 million at 31 December 2023 
(2022: €6,437 million)."
"This revenue is mainly derived 
from long-term service and maintenance contracts and 
extended warranties."
"It does not include performance 
obligations from customer contracts that have initial 
expected durations of one year or less."
"The number of 
vehicles, for which the expected original delivery time 
will exceed twelve months, was immaterial and is 
therefore not part of the disclosed amount."
"Long-term 
performance obligations of minor importance to the 
overall contract value of a bundled contract are not 
considered in assessing the initial duration of the bun-
dled contract."
"Interest from the financial services business 
includes financial income on the net investment in 
leases of €1,027 million (2022: €783 million)."
"In contrast, 
lower raw material prices had a positive impact on the 
cost of sales."
"Refinancing costs at Mercedes-Benz Mo-
bility are rising due to higher interest rates compared 
to the previous year."
"In the prior year, cost of sales 
were impacted by expenses in connection with the 
discontinuation of the business activities in Russia."
"The amortization expense of capitalized development 
costs in the amount of €2,139 million (2022: €2,052 
million) is presented in expense of goods sold."
"Selling expenses 
In 2023, selling expenses amounted to €9,728 million 
(2022: €9,482 million)."
"Selling expenses consist of di-
rect selling costs as well as selling overhead expenses 
and comprise personnel expenses, material costs and 
other selling costs."
"General administrative expenses 
General administrative expenses amounted to €2,688 
million in 2023 (2022: €2,584 million)."
"They consist of 
expenses which are not attributable to production, 
sales or research and development functions, and in-
clude personnel expenses, depreciation and amortiza-
tion of fixed and intangible assets, and other adminis-
trative costs."
"Research and non-capitalized  
development costs 
Research and non-capitalized development costs were 
€6,230 million in 2023 (2022: €5,602 million) and pri-
marily comprise personnel expenses and material 
costs."
"Personnel expenses and average 
number of employees 
Personnel expenses included in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income for 2023 amounted to 
€16,633 million (2022: €16,501 million)."
"Personnel ex-
penses comprise wages and salaries in the amount of 
€13,848 million (2022: €13,684 million), social-security 
contributions in the amount of €2,376 million (2022: 
€2,239 million) and expenses from pension obligations 
in the amount of €409 million (2022: €578 million)."

"2 With the implementation of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards as of 
2024, the number of employees becomes a further criterion for the inclusion of an 
entity within the scope of consolidation."
"The average number of employees of non-
consolidated subsidiaries is 15,448 employees."
"They will therefore be included within 
the scope of consolidation from the year 2024, but are not included in the above figure."
"3 Proportionally including 2,345 (2022: 2,107) employees from a proportionately consoli-
dated company."
"Other operating income  
and expense 
The composition of other operating income is shown 
in the following table."
"The decrease in other operating income in 2023 was 
mainly due to the income from the sale of the retail 
activities in Canada (€514 million) reported in the com-
parative period."
"It is included in gains on sales of prop-
erty, plant and equipment."
"In addition, income from 
corporate transactions in connection with the sale of 
the shares in Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Ltd."
"was in-
cluded in 2022 (€385 million)."
"The composition of other operating expense is shown 
as follows."
"They are included in 
other miscellaneous expense."
"Other miscellaneous expense also includes expenses 
from hyperinflation accounting and other operating ex-
pense charged to third parties."
"The loss of €205 million from the deconsolidation of 
the shares in the Russian subsidiaries booked in other 
operating expense in 2023 is mainly attributable to the 
Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment."
"In 2022, the valuation and disposal of operating invest-
ments and business activities of the Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility segment’s commercial vehicle business 
included net expense of €184 million (excluding 
transaction costs), which was reported in the 
reconciliation."
"Other financial income/expense 
The following table shows the components of other 
financial income/expense, net."
"Interest income and  
interest expense 
The following table shows the components of interest 
income and interest expense."
"Income taxes 
The following table shows the components of income 
tax expense."
"The following table shows a reconciliation of expected 
income tax expense to actual income tax expense in 
the financial year."
"In order to determine the expected 
income tax expense, the German combined statutory 
tax rate of 29.825% applicable in the financial year is 
multiplied by the profit before taxes."
"tax-free results of the equity-method in-
vestments."
"The increase compared to the previous year 
is due, among other things, to the increase in tax-free 
equity-method earnings in 2023."
"The other items include, among other things, effects 
from withholding taxes on dividends, patents and li-
censes which increased compared to the prior year."
"Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-
set if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and 
if there is the right to set off current tax assets against 
current tax liabilities."
"In the presentation of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Statement 
of Financial Position, no difference is made between 
current and non-current."
"At 31 December 2023, unrecognized deferred tax as-
sets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Posi-
tion relate, among other things, to corporate income 
tax-loss carryforwards and tax credits of €83 million."
"A large proportion of the unrecognized deferred tax 
assets relates to tax-loss carryforwards for state and 
local taxes at the US companies as well as temporary 
differences."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group believes that it is more like-
ly than not that it will be unable to utilize those de-
ferred tax assets."
"From the current perspective, the retained earnings of 
non-German subsidiaries are largely intended to be 
reinvested in those operations."
"The Group did not rec-
ognize deferred tax liabilities on retained earnings 
which are intended to be reinvested at non-German 
subsidiaries of €27,529 million (2022: €27,469 million)."
"If those earnings were paid out as dividends, an 
amount of 5% would be taxed under German taxation 
rules and, if applicable, with non-German withholding 
tax."
"Additionally, other income tax consequences might 
arise if the dividends first have to be distributed by a 
non-German subsidiary to a non-German holding com-
pany."
"Normally, the distribution would lead to an addi-
tional income tax expense."
"Estimating the amount of 
taxable temporary differences for these undistributed 
foreign earnings would require a disproportionate ef-
fort."
"The Group has various unresolved issues concerning 
open tax years."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group believes 
that it has recognized adequate liabilities for any future 
income taxes that may be owed for all open tax years."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that tax payments 
might exceed the liabilities recognized in the financial 
statements."
"As a result of future adjudications or changes in the 
opinions of the fiscal authorities, it cannot be ruled out 
that the Mercedes-Benz Group might receive tax re-
funds for previous years."
"In particular, from 2012 to 
2021, Mercedes-Benz Group AG incurred currency ex-
change-rate related losses from the financing of Group 
companies based abroad totalling €2.1 billion, which 
were compensated by corresponding hedging instru-
ments."
"For the years until 2021, the German tax author-
ities consider that exchange-rate related losses from 
the financing of Group companies are generally not to 
be recognized, while the compensating profits from the 
hedging activities remain taxable."
"In 2021, the German 
Modernization of Corporate Income Tax Act stipulated 
that such exchange-rate losses are generally deducti-
ble."
"However, this only applies from 2022 onwards."
"The 
Company does not share the legal opinion represented 
by the tax authorities for the years up to 2021."
"In the 
meantime, a lawsuit has also been filed with the Fi-
nance Court."
"Intangible assets 
Intangible assets developed as shown on the following 
page."
"At 31 December 2023, goodwill of €389 million (2022: 
€389 million) relates to the Mercedes-Benz Mobility 
segment, goodwill of €335 million (2022: €337 million) 
relates to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment and good-
will of €21 million (2022: €23 million) relates to the 
Mercedes-Benz Vans segment."
"Non-amortizable intangible assets primarily relate to 
goodwill and development costs for projects which 
have not yet been completed (carrying amount at 31 
December 2023: €6,131 million; 2022: €4,496 million)."
"The increase in capitalized development costs is mainly 
due to development services for the new platform 
generations geared to electromobility."
"In addition, oth-
er intangible assets with a carrying amount of €262 
million (2022: €190 million) are not amortizable."
"These 
non-amortizable intangible assets are distribution 
rights in the vehicle segments with indefinite useful 
lives."
"The Group plans to continue to use these assets 
unchanged."
"The following table shows the line items of the Consol-
idated Statement of Income in which total amortization 
expense for intangible assets is included."
2 Including capitalized borrowing costs on development costs of €113 million (2022: €79 million).
Amortization amounted to €12 million (2022: €9 million).
"Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment as shown in the Consol-
idated Statement of Financial Position with a carrying 
amount of € 26,090 (2022: €27,250) million also in-
cludes right-of-use assets, that the Group received as 
lessee."
"Property, plant and equipment, including right-
of-use assets, developed as shown on the following 
page."
"In 2023, government grants of €69 (2022: €96) million 
were deducted from the carrying amount of property, 
plant and equipment."
"The following tables show additional disclosures relat-
ed to lessee accounting."
"Equipment on operating  
leases 
The development of equipment on operating leases is 
shown in the table Equipment on operating leases."
"The carrying amount of the equipment on operating 
leases includes leased right-of-use assets from recog-
nized head leases with the Daimler Truck Group of  
€0.3 billion (2022: €0.5 billion)."
"The revenue received from the sale of Group products 
to external dealers is estimated by the Group as being 
of the magnitude of the respective addition to leased 
equipment at Mercedes-Benz Mobility."
"These vehicles 
generate revenue from lease payments and subse-
quent resale on the basis of the separate leasing con-
tracts."
"In 2023, additions to leased equipment from 
these vehicles at Mercedes-Benz Mobility amounted  
to approximately €10 billion (2022: approximately  
€9 billion)."
"At 31 December 2023, equipment on operating leases 
with a carrying amount of €8,187 million was pledged 
as security for liabilities from ABS transactions (2022: 
€9,663 million)."
"These liabilities related to a securitiza-
tion transaction of future lease payments on leased 
vehicles (see also Note 24)."
"2 The additions include €8,353 million that were not acquired from external dealers."

"THBV is account-
ed for as an associated company in the Consolidated

"As part of a strategic realignment and refinancing of 
HERE, the Mercedes-Benz Group, along with other 
shareholders of the associated company THBV, con-
tributed additional equity of €118 million into THBV 
through Mercedes-Benz AG in the first half of 2023."
"The capital increases led to a corresponding increase in 
the equity-method carrying amount."
"The funds from 
the capital injection were transferred by THBV to HERE 
in order to increase HERE’s liquidity."
"The strategic repositioning led to a reassessment of the 
business development of HERE in the second quarter 
of 2023."
"Due to this THBV recognized an impairment on 
the carrying amount of HERE."
"The proportionate ex-
penses attributable to the Group from the impairment 
of €92 million are included in the line item gains/losses 
on equity-method investments and reported in the 
Mercedes-Benz Cars segment."
Figures for the statement of financial position and the reconciliation to the equity-method carrying amounts relate to the balance sheet date of 31 December and include investor level adjustments.
"The purpose 
of YOUR NOW Holding is to hold shares in mobility 
service providers."
"In 2023, YOUR NOW’s gains/losses on equity-
method investments include impairments of 
€117 million (2022: €102 million)."
"The following table shows summarized aggregated 
financial information for the other minor equity-
method investments after purchase-price allocation 
and on a pro-rata basis."
"Further information on equity-method investments 
is provided in Note 37."
"Receivables from financial  
services 
Types of receivables 
Receivables from sales financing with customers in-
clude receivables from credit financing for non-Group 
third parties who purchased their vehicle either from a 
dealer or directly from the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Receivables from sales financing with dealers repre-
sent loans for floor financing programmes for vehicles 
purchased from the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"In addition, 
these receivables also relate to the financing of other 
assets that the dealers purchased from third parties, in 
particular used vehicles or property."
"Receivables from finance lease contracts consist of 
receivables from leasing contracts for which all sub-
stantial risks and rewards incidental to the leasing ob-
jects are transferred to the lessee."
"In 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Group recognized a gain of 
€538 million (2022: €177 million) from the difference 
between the additions to receivables from finance 
lease contracts and the carrying amounts of the under-
lying assets."
"At 31 December 2023, receivables from financial ser-
vices with a carrying amount of €11,139 million (2022: 
€11,931 million) were pledged mostly as collateral for 
liabilities from ABS transactions (see also Note 24)."
"The carrying amounts of receivables from financial 
services based on modified contracts that are shown in 
stages 2 and 3, amounted to €463 million at 31 Decem-
ber 2023 (2022: €223 million)."
"In addition, carrying 
amounts of €86 million in connection with contractual 
modifications were reclassified at 31 December 2023 
from stages 2 and 3 into stage 1 (2022: €135 million)."
"Credit risks 
Information on credit risks included in receivables from 
financial services is shown in the table Credit risks 
included in receivables from financial services."
"Longer overdue periods regularly lead to higher loss 
allowances."
"At the beginning of the contracts, collaterals of usually 
at least 100% of the carrying amounts were agreed, 
which are backed by the vehicles based on the under-
lying contracts."
"Over the contract terms, the amounts 
of the collaterals are included in the calculation of the 
risk provisioning, so the net carrying amounts of the 
credit-impaired contracts are essentially backed by the 
underlying vehicles."
"Further information on loss allowances, financial risks 
and types of risks is provided in Note 33."
"Marketable debt securities and 
similar investments 
The marketable debt securities and similar investments 
amount to €6,858 million (2022: €7,060 million)."
"When 
a short-term liquidity requirement is covered with 
quoted securities, those securities are presented as 
current assets."
"Further information on marketable  
debt securities and similar investments is provided in 
Note 32."
"Other financial assets 
The line item other financial assets presented in the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is com-
prised as shown in the following table."
"Further infor-
mation on other financial assets is provided in Note 32."
"At 31 December 2023, other financial assets included 
receivables with a carrying amount of €450 million 
(2022: €461 million) that were pledged as collateral for 
liabilities."
"Other assets 
Non-financial other assets are comprised as shown in 
the following table."
"Other expected reimbursements predominantly relate 
to recovery claims against our suppliers in connection 
with issued product warranties."
"Inventories 
Inventories are comprised as shown in the following 
table."
"Additionally the finished goods in-
clude, on average, more expensive vehicles."
"The amount of write-down of inventories to net realiza-
ble value recognized as an expense in cost of sales was 
€620 million in 2023 (2022: €543 million)."
"The carrying 
amounts of inventories that are expected to be recov-
ered or settled after more than twelve months amount-
ed to €812 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: 
€724 million) and are related primarily to finished 
goods."
"To secure obligations from partial retirement and long-
term working accounts, a number of company cars  
and demonstration vehicles included in inventories of 
Mercedes-Benz AG in the amount of €1,195 million is 
pledged as collateral to Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust 
e.V."
as of 31 December 2023 (2022: €854 million).
"The 
increase in carrying amount is due to the significantly 
higher inventory levels as well as the on average more 
expensive vehicle prices."
"Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are primarily receivables from con-
tracts with customers within the scope of IFRS 15 and

"Equity 
Share capital 
The share capital (authorized capital) is €3,070 million 
at 31 December 2023, unchanged compared to 31 De-
cember 2022."
"It is still divided into 1,070 million no-
par-value shares."
All shares are fully paid up.
"Each 
share represents a proportionate amount of approxi-
mately €2.87 of the share capital."
"The number of shares issued on 31 December 2023 
was 1,070 million, the same as on 31 December 2022 
and unchanged since 1 January 2022."
"The number of shares outstanding decreased by  
29 million shares to 1,041 million shares as at 31 De-
cember 2023, compared to 31 December 2022 (1,070 
million shares) due to the share buyback programme 
that has been running since March 2023."
"The number 
of shares outstanding had remained unchanged at 
1,070 million between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 
2022."
"Approved capital 
The Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2023 au-
thorized the Board of Management again to increase 
the share capital by up to a total of €1.0 billion by  
2 May 2028 with the approval of the Supervisory Board 
against cash and/or non-cash contributions (Approved 
Capital 2023)."
"The authorization enables the exclusion 
of shareholders’ subscription rights under certain con-
ditions and within defined limits subject to the consent 
of the Supervisory Board."
"No use has been made of the Approved Capital 2018, 
for which the authorization period ended on 4 April 
2023, and no use has been made of the Approved Cap-
ital 2023 to date."
"The bonds can be offered in exchange for cash 
and/or non-cash contributions, in particular for shares 
in other companies."
"The terms and conditions of the 
bonds can include warranty obligations or conversion 
obligations."
"The bonds can be issued once or several 
times, wholly or in instalments, or simultaneously in 
various tranches as well as by subsidiaries of the Com-
pany within the meaning of Sections 15 et seq."
"of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"Among other 
things, the Board of Management was also authorized 
to exclude shareholders’ subscription rights for the 
bonds under certain conditions and within defined 
limits subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board."
"In order to fulfil the conditions of the above-mentioned 
authorization, the Annual General Meeting on 8 July 
2020 also resolved to increase the share capital condi-
tionally by an amount of up to €500 million (Condition-
al Capital 2020)."
"No use was made of this authorization to issue con-
vertible and/or warrant bonds during the reporting 
period."
"The shares can be used, 
among other things, with the exclusion of shareholders’ 
subscription rights, for business combinations or to 
acquire companies or to be sold to third parties for 
cash at a price that is not significantly lower than the 
stock-exchange price of the Company’s shares."
"The 
acquired shares can also be used to fulfil obligations 
from issued convertible bonds and/or bonds with war-
rants and to be issued to employees of the Company 
and employees and board members of the Company’s 
subsidiaries pursuant to Sections 15 et seq."
"of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The treasury 
shares can also be cancelled."
"Share buyback programmes 
On the basis of the authorization to acquire the Com-
pany’s own shares given by the Annual General Meeting 
on 8 July 2020, the Board of Management, with the 
approval of the Supervisory Board, resolved a share 
buyback programme on 16 February 2023."
"The acquisi-
tion of treasury shares worth up to €4 billion (not in-
cluding incidental costs) on the stock exchange over a 
period of up to two years began on 3 March 2023."
"The 
repurchased shares are to be cancelled at a later date."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG has separately agreed with 
Beijing Automotive Group Co., Ltd."
"and Geely Group 
that they will each keep their share in all voting shares 
of Mercedes-Benz Group AG below 10% by divesting 
their shares on a pro-rata basis concurrently with the 
share buyback programme."
"From March to December 2023, as part of the share 
buyback programme, 29 million of the Company’s own 
shares were repurchased at a purchase price of €1,887 
million, representing €83 million or 2.70% of the share 
capital."
"The purchase price was recorded under treas-
ury shares together with a liability of €369 million for 
buyback obligations."
"On 21 February 2024, Mercedes-Benz Group AG has 
resolved to implement a share buyback policy."
"Based 
on such policy, the future Free Cash Flow from the 
industrial business (as available post potential small-
scale M&A) generated beyond the approximately 40% 
dividend payout ratio of Group net profit shall be used 
to fund share buybacks with the purpose of redeeming 
shares."
"In this context, Mercedes-Benz Group AG moreover  
has resolved to conduct a further share buyback pro-
gramme, through which it is intended to acquire own 
shares worth up to €3 billion (not including incidental 
costs) on the stock exchange and to then cancel them."
"It is 
scheduled to commence immediately after the conclu-
sion of the ongoing share buyback programme an-
nounced on 16 February 2023, and is expected to be 
completed before the expiry of the Annual General 
Meeting’s above-mentioned authorization."
"Future share buyback programmes are subject to the 
necessary resolutions of the company’s corporate bod-
ies required in each individual case."
"2, of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"The 
purchase was carried out without utilizing the authori-
zation to acquire treasury shares granted by the Annual 
General Meeting on 8 July 2020."
"Retained earnings 
Retained earnings comprise the accumulated net prof-
its and losses of all companies included in Mercedes-
Benz Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements, less 
any profits distributed."
"In addition, the remeasuring of 
defined benefit plans and the corresponding effects 
arising from equity-method investments and the re-
spective related deferred taxes are presented within 
retained earnings."
"In other comprehensive income/loss 2023, 
gains/losses on equity-method investments that will 
not be reclassified to profit/loss in the statement of 
income includes a loss of €10 million (2022: gain of 
€289 million) from effects of remeasuring of defined 
benefit plans."
"Dividend 
Under the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the 
dividend is paid out of the distributable profit reported 
in the Annual Financial Statements of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG (parent company only) in accordance with 
the German Commercial Code (HGB)."
"A portion of €153 million of the amount pro-
posed for allocation to retained earnings is attributable 
to 28.9 million treasury shares not entitled to dividends 
held directly or indirectly by the company on 31 De-
cember 2023."
"As the number of treasury shares held 
directly or indirectly by the Company will change be-
fore the Annual General Meeting due to the ongoing 
share buyback programme, a proposal for a corre-
spondingly adjusted resolution will be submitted to the 
Annual General Meeting."
"With an unchanged dividend 
of €5.30 per no-par-value share entitled to a dividend 
the portion of the distributable profit to be transferred 
into retained earnings and the total distribution amount 
will be adjusted accordingly."
"The changes in other reserves are included in other 
comprehensive income/loss and are presented in the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive In-
come/Loss."
"In other comprehensive income/loss 2023, 
gains/losses on equity-method investments that may 
be reclassified to profit/loss in the statement of in-
come in the future includes a loss of €247 million 
(2022: gain of €141 million) from accumulated unreal-
ized gains/losses from currency translation."
"Share-based payment 
At 31 December 2023, the Group has the 2020-2023 
Performance Phantom Share Plans (PPSP) outstanding."
"As instruments of share-based payment with cash set-
tlement, the PPSP are measured at their fair values on 
the balance sheet date."
"They are paid out at the end of 
their contractually defined periods; an earlier, propor-
tionate payout is only possible under certain conditions 
when a beneficiary leaves the company."
"PPSP 2019 was 
paid out as planned in the first quarter of 2023."
"Moreover, 50% of the annual bonus of the members of 
the Board of Management is paid out after a waiting 
period of one year."
"The actual payout is determined by 
the development of Mercedes-Benz Group shares 
compared to an automobile-related index (Auto-
STOXX)."
"The fair value of this medium-term annual 
bonus, which depends on that development, is meas-
ured by using the intrinsic value at the reporting date."
"The pre-tax effects of share-based payment arrange-
ments for the executives of the Group and the mem-
bers of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG on the Consolidated Statement of Income 
and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are 
shown in the following table."
"The details shown in the table do not represent any 
paid or committed remuneration, but refer to expenses 
calculated according to IFRS."
"During the four-year period between the allocation of 
the preliminary phantom shares and the payout of the 
plan after the end of the term, the phantom shares 
earn a dividend equivalent to the amount of the actual 
dividend paid on real Mercedes-Benz Group shares in 
the respective year."
"The 
vesting period is therefore four years."
"For the existing 
plans, the quoted price of the phantom shares to be 
used for the payout is limited to 2.5 times the phantom 
share price at the date of grant."
"Furthermore, in the 
case of the plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, the payout for 
the members of the Board of Management is also lim-
ited to 2.5 times the allotment value used to determine 
the preliminary number of phantom shares."
"The limita-
tion of the payout for the members of the Board of 
Management also includes the dividend equivalents."
"PPSP 
2023 includes environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) targets in the achievement of objectives in order 
to promote the sustainable realignment and long-term, 
sustainable development of the Group."
"From PPSP 
2023, overall target achievement will be determined 
based on the weighted achievement of the financial 
targets (relative share performance and RoS) and the 
ESG targets over the three-year performance period."
"The achievement of the financial targets accounts for 
80% and the achievement of the ESG targets for 20% 
of the overall target achievement of the PPSP."
"In the case of plans PPSP 2020 to 2022, special rules 
apply for the members of the Board of Management: 
the Mercedes-Benz Group’s RoS must be not only 
equal to but higher than that of the competitors in 
order to obtain the same target achievement as the 
other plan participants."
"Furthermore, an additional limit 
on target achievement was agreed upon for the refer-
ence parameter RoS for the members of the Board of 
Management."
"In the case of target achievement be-
tween 195% and 200%, an additional comparison is 
made on the basis of the RoS achieved in absolute 
terms."
"If the actual RoS for the automotive business is 
below the strategic target in the third year of the per-
formance period, target achievement is limited to 195%."
"The Group recognizes a provision for awarding the 
PPSP in the Provisions for other risks in the Consoli-
dated Statement of Financial Position."
"Since payment 
per vested phantom share depends on the quoted 
price of Mercedes-Benz Group’s share, that quoted 
price essentially represents the fair value of each 
phantom share at the balance sheet date."
"The propor-
tionate remuneration expenses from the PPSP recog-
nized in the individual years are measured based on 
the price of Mercedes-Benz Group shares and the es-
timated target achievement."
"Pensions and similar  
obligations 
Commitments specific to various countries for defined 
benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension 
plans exist at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Furthermore, certain foreign subsidiaries, mainly in the 
United States, provide their employees with post-
employment healthcare benefits with defined entitle-
ments, which have to be accounted for as defined ben-
efit plans."
"The following table shows the composition of provi-
sions for pensions and similar obligations."
"Defined benefit pension plans  
Provisions for pension obligations are made for defined 
benefit pension commitments to active and former 
employees of the Mercedes-Benz Group and their sur-
vivors."
"The defined benefit pension plans provided by 
the Group generally vary according to the economic, 
tax and legal circumstances of the country concerned."
"Most of the defined benefit pension commitments also 
provide benefits in the case of invalidity and death."
"Pension plans and pension  
plan assets 
Most employees in Germany have defined benefit pen-
sion commitments; most of the pension commitments 
for the active workforce are based on individual retire-
ment benefit accounts, to which the Company makes 
annual contributions."
"The amount of the contributions 
for non-exempt employees depends on the tariff clas-
sification in the respective year or on their respective 
income; for executives it depends on their respective 
income."
"For the commitments to retirement benefits 
made prior to 2011, the contributions continue to be 
converted into capital components and credited to the 
individual pension accounts with the application of 
fixed factors related to each employee’s age."
"The con-
version factors include a fixed value increase."
"For the 
commitments to retirement benefits made as of 2011, 
the Company guarantees at a minimum the value of the 
contributions paid into a cash-balance plan."
"Pension 
payments are made either as a life annuity, twelve 
annual instalments, or a single lump sum."
"In addition, previously concluded defined benefit plans 
exist which primarily depend on employees’ wage-tariff 
classification upon transition into the benefit phase 
and which foresee a life annuity."
"As well as the employer-financed pension plans grant-
ed by German companies, the employees of some 
companies are also offered various earnings-
conversion models."
"Most of the pension obligations in Germany relating to 
defined benefit pension commitments are funded by 
investment funds."
"Contractual trust arrangements 
(CTA) exist between Mercedes-Benz Group AG as well 
as some subsidiaries in Germany and the Mercedes-
Benz Pension Trust e."
"The Mercedes-Benz Pension 
Trust e."
acts as a collateral trust fund.
"In 2018, Mercedes-Benz Group AG transferred certain 
pension obligations and plan assets of retired employ-
ees and their survivors to Mercedes-Benz Pen-
sionsfonds AG (previously Daimler Pensionsfonds AG; 
pension fund)."
"These benefits are administrated by that 
non-insurance-like pension fund, which falls under the 
scope of the Act on the Supervision of Insurance Un-
dertakings and is therefore subject to the oversight of 
the Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (BaFin)."
"In Germany, there are normally no statutory or regula-
tory minimum funding requirements."
"Outside Germany, there are plans relating to final sala-
ries as well as plans relating to salary-based compo-
nents."
"Most of the international obligations from de-
fined benefit pension commitments are funded by 
investment funds."
"The funded status of pension obligations with the split 
between German and international plans is shown in 
the following table."
"Accordingly, the committed benefits are 
intended to contribute to additional financial security 
during retirement, and in the case of death or invalidity 
to be capable of being planned and fulfilled by the 
respective company of the Group and to have a low-
risk structure."
"In addition, a committee exists that ap-
proves new pension plans and amendments to existing 
pension plans as well as policies relating to company 
retirement benefits."
"The obligations from defined benefit pension commit-
ments and the pension plan assets can be subject to 
fluctuations over time."
"This can have a negative or a 
positive effect on the funded status."
"Fluctuations in the 
defined benefit pension obligations result at the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group in particular from changes in finan-
cial assumptions such as discount rates and increases 
in the cost of living, but also from changes in demo-
graphic assumptions such as adjusted life expectan-
cies."
"With most of the German plans, expected long-
term wage and salary increases do not have an impact 
on the amount of the obligation."
"The fair value of the plan assets is predominantly  
determined by the situation on the capital markets."
"Unfavourable developments, especially of equity prices 
and fixed-interest securities, could reduce that fair 
value."
"The diversification of investment funds, the en-
gagement of asset managers using quantitative and 
qualitative analyses, and the continual monitoring of 
performance and risk help to reduce the associated 
investment risk."
"As long as the commitments of the 
defined benefit pension plans remain overfunded by 
the plan assets, the Mercedes-Benz Group will only 
make additional pension contributions when legally and 
economically necessary."
"As a general principle, it is the Group’s objective to 
design new pension commitments as defined benefit 
plans based on capital components or on contribu-
tions, or as defined contribution plans."
"The composition of the Group’s pension plan 
assets is shown in the following table."
"in the amount of €526 million 
(2022: €434 million)."
"Market prices are usually available for equity instru-
ments and bonds due to their listing in active markets."
Most of the bonds have investment grade ratings.
"They 
include government bonds of very good creditworthi-
ness."
"The investment strategy is reviewed regularly and ad-
justed if deemed necessary."
"The investment strategy is 
determined by Investment-Committees, which are 
generally composed of representatives of the Finance 
and Human Resources departments."
"The investment 
strategy for the pension plan assets is generally orient-
ed towards the structure of the pension obligations."
"Pension costs 
The components of pension costs included in the  
Consolidated Statement of Income are shown in the 
following table."
"The measurement date for the periodic pension cost is 
generally 1 January."
"The assumptions used to calculate 
the defined benefit obligations vary according to the 
economic conditions of the countries in which the pen-
sion plans are situated."
"Calculation of the pension obligations uses life expec-
tancy for the German plans based on the Heubeck 2018 
G mortality tables."
"Comparable country-specific calcu-
lation methods are used for international plans."
"For most international plans, expected increases in cost of 
living do not have a material impact on the amount of the obligation."
"Sensitivity analysis 
The calculations carried out by actuaries were done in 
isolation for the evaluation parameters regarded as 
important."
"This means that if there is a simultaneous 
change in several parameters, the individual results 
cannot be summed due to correlation effects."
"With a 
change in the parameters, the sensitivities shown can-
not be used to derive a linear development of the de-
fined benefit obligation."
"An increase or decrease in the main actuarial assump-
tions would have the following effects on the present 
value of the defined benefit pension obligations."
"Effect on future cash flows 
For the year 2024, the Group plans to make contribu-
tions of €0.1 billion to the plan assets; the final amount 
is usually set in the fourth quarter of a year."
"The pen-
sions benefits paid are expected to amount to 
€1.1 billion in 2024."
"The weighted average duration of the defined benefit 
obligations amounts to 13 years (2022: 13 years)."
"Defined contribution pension plans 
Under defined contribution pension plans, the  
Mercedes-Benz Group makes defined contributions to 
external insurance policies or investment funds."
"There 
are fundamentally no further contractual obligations or 
risks for the Mercedes-Benz Group in excess of the 
defined contributions."
"The Group also pays contribu-
tions to governmental pension schemes."
"In 2023, the 
total costs from defined contribution plans amounted 
to €1.0 billion (2022: €1.0 billion)."
"Of those payments, 
€1.0 billion (2022: €1.0 billion) was related to state 
pension plans."
"Provisions for other risks 
Product warranties 
The Mercedes-Benz Group issues various types of 
product warranties, under which it generally guaran-
tees the performance of products delivered and ser-
vices rendered for a certain period."
"The provision  
for these product warranties covers expected costs  
for legal and contractual warranty claims as well as  
expected costs for goodwill concessions and recall  
campaigns."
"This also includes measures relating to 
Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles in various regions as 
well as recalls, in particular for an extended recall of 
Takata airbags."
"The utilization date of product warran-
ties depends on the incidence of the warranty claims 
and can span the entire term of the product warranties 
and the goodwill period."
"The cash outflows in relation 
to non-current provisions are primarily expected within 
a period until 2026."
"The additions recorded to the provi-
sions for profit-sharing bonuses and variable remuner-
ation in the reporting year usually result in cash out-
flows in the following year."
"The cash outflows for non-
current provisions for personnel and social costs are 
primarily expected within a period until 2032."
"They primari-
ly include risks from litigation and regulatory proceed-
ings in relation to Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles."
"The 
cash outflows in relation to non-current provisions are 
primarily expected within a period until 2026."
"Further information on liability and litigation risks and 
regulatory proceedings is provided in Note 30."
"Other 
Provisions for other risks primarily comprise expected 
costs for provisions for environmental protection, other 
taxes and charges related to income taxes as well as 
obligations from outstanding commission."
"They also 
include provisions for anticipated losses on pending 
transactions and various other risks which cannot be 
allocated to any other class of provision."
"Financing liabilities 
The composition of financing liabilities is as follows."
"Other financial liabilities  
The composition of other financial liabilities is shown in 
the following table."
"Further information on other financial liabilities is pro-
vided in Note 32."
"Deferred income 
The composition of deferred income is as follows."
"Contract and refund liabilities 
Following table shows the composition of contract and 
refund liabilities."
"Other liabilities 
Other liabilities are composed as follows."
"Consolidated Statement  
of Cash Flows 
Calculation of funds 
At 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents in-
cluded restricted funds of €91 million (2022: €187 mil-
lion)."
"The restricted funds representing cash and cash 
equivalents were related to subsidiaries where foreign 
exchange controls apply, so that the Group has re-
stricted access to the funds."
"Cash flow from operating activities 
Other operating assets and liabilities changed as  
follows."
"In the prior year, significant positive effects resulted 
from assets in connection with the securitization of 
receivables and from contractual liabilities for price 
discounts."
"This was partially offset by lower negative 
effects in miscellaneous other financial liabilities and 
the contract liabilities for service and maintenance 
agreements."
"The following cash flows are included in Cash flow from 
operating activities."
"In addition, the other non-cash expense 
and income was impacted by the depreciation of the 
remaining financial services volumes of the Daimler 
commercial vehicle business, sold to Daimler Truck 
Holding AG or its subsidiaries in 2022."
"Cash flow from financing activities includes payments 
for the reduction of outstanding leasing liabilities of 
€640 million (2022: €565 million)."
"Liabilities arising from financing activities, divided into 
cash and non-cash components, changed as follows."
"Product-
related litigation involves, among other things, claims 
alleging faults in vehicles."
"Some of these claims are 
asserted by way of class actions."
"If the outcome of 
such legal proceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-
Benz Group or such legal proceedings are settled, the 
Group may encounter substantial financial burdens, 
e.g."
"from damages payments or service actions, recall 
campaigns, monetary penalties or other costly actions, 
which would adversely affect the earnings of Mer-
cedes-Benz Group AG."
"Legal proceedings and related 
settlements may also have an impact on the company’s 
reputation."
"Diesel emission behaviour:  
governmental proceedings 
The Mercedes-Benz Group is continuously subject to 
governmental information requests, inquiries, investi-
gations, administrative orders and proceedings relating 
to various laws and regulations in connection with die-
sel exhaust emissions."
"The corresponding activities of various authorities 
worldwide, which were already reported in the past, are 
partly ongoing, as described below."
"In the United States, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and 
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (MBUSA) reached agreements 
in the third quarter of 2020 with various authorities to 
settle civil environmental claims regarding the emission 
control systems of certain diesel vehicles."
"These 
agreements have become final and effective."
"The au-
thorities took the position that the Mercedes-Benz 
Group had failed to disclose Auxiliary Emission Control 
Devices (AECDs) in certain of its US diesel vehicles and 
that several of these AECDs were illegal defeat devices."
"The failure to meet certain of 
those obligations may trigger additional stipulated 
penalties."
"In the first quarter of 2021, the Mercedes-
Benz Group paid the civil penalties; provisions have 
been recognized for the emission modification pro-
gramme and other measures."
"As already reported, in April 2016, the U.S."
"Department 
of Justice (DOJ) requested that the Mercedes-Benz 
Group conduct an internal investigation."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group conducted such an internal investigation in 
cooperation with the DOJ‘s investigation; the DOJ‘s 
investigation remains open."
"In addition, further US 
state authorities have opened investigations pursuant 
to both local environmental and consumer protection 
laws and have requested documents and information."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to cooper-
ate with the investigating authorities."
"In Germany, the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office 
issued a fine notice against Mercedes-Benz in Septem-
ber 2019 based on a negligent violation of supervisory 
duties, thereby concluding the related administrative 
offense proceedings against Mercedes-Benz."
"In July 
2021, the local court of Böblingen issued penal orders 
against three Mercedes-Benz employees based on, 
amongst others, fraud, which have become final."
"The 
criminal investigation proceedings of the Stuttgart pub-
lic prosecutor’s office against further Mercedes-Benz 
employees on the suspicion of, amongst others, fraud 
have meanwhile been discontinued."
"Between 2018 and 2020, the German Federal Motor 
Transport Authority (KBA) issued subsequent auxiliary 
provisions for the EC type approvals of certain Mer-
cedes-Benz diesel vehicles, and ordered mandatory 
recalls as well as, in some cases, stops of the first reg-
istration."
"In autumn 2022 and in December 2023, the 
KBA issued further decisions regarding vehicles 
equipped with various EU6 or EU5 diesel engines."
"In 
each of those cases, it held that certain calibrations of 
specified functionalities are to be qualified as imper-
missible defeat devices."
"Mercedes-Benz has a contrary 
legal opinion on this question and has filed timely ob-
jections against the KBA’s administrative orders and 
determinations mentioned above."
"Insofar as the KBA 
has not remedied the objections, Mercedes-Benz has 
filed lawsuits with the competent administrative court 
to have the controversial questions at issue clarified in 
a court of law."
"Irrespective of such objections and the 
lawsuits that are now pending, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group continues to cooperate fully with the KBA."
"To a 
large extent, the remedial actions requested by the 
KBA were developed by the Mercedes-Benz Group and 
assessed and approved by the KBA; the necessary 
recalls were initiated."
"For some of the vehicles affected 
by the KBA’s decision from December 2023, develop-
ments, examinations and approvals of the remedial 
measures are still pending."
"It cannot be ruled out that 
under certain circumstances, software updates may 
have to be reworked, or further delivery and registra-
tion stops may be ordered or resolved by the company 
as a precautionary measure, also with regard to the 
used car, leasing and financing businesses."
"In the 
course of its regular market supervision, the KBA rou-
tinely conducts further reviews of Mercedes-Benz ve-
hicles and asks questions about technical elements of 
the vehicles."
"In addition, the Group continues to be in a 
dialogue with the German Federal Ministry for Digital 
and Transport (BMDV) to conclude the analysis of the 
diesel-related emissions matter and to further the up-
date of affected customer vehicles."
"In 
this context, these South Korean authorities have made 
determinations and imposed sanctions against Mer-
cedes-Benz which Mercedes-Benz has appealed."
"In the 
same context, national antitrust authorities of various 
countries are also conducting investigations, including 
the South Korean antitrust authority, which has made 
certain findings and imposed fines on some car manu-
facturers."
"In February 2024, the criminal proceeding in 
South Korea was concluded."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group continues to fully cooperate 
with the authorities and institutions."
"The 
lawsuit was dismissed in the third quarter of 2022."
"The 
plaintiff’s appeal to this decision was dismissed in the 
third quarter of 2023."
"The decision is final, and the 
proceedings are concluded."
"Consumer class actions were filed against Mercedes-
Benz Group AG in Israel in February 2019 as well as 
against Mercedes-Benz Group AG and further Group 
companies in the United Kingdom since May 2020, in 
the Netherlands since June 2020, in Portugal as well as 
since November 2022 in Australia."
"The plaintiffs inter 
alia assert that the Mercedes-Benz Group had used 
devices that impermissibly impair the effectiveness of 
emission control systems in reducing nitrogen-oxide 
(NOx) emissions and which cause excessive emissions 
from vehicles with diesel engines."
"Furthermore, they 
claim that Mercedes-Benz Group AG deceived consum-
ers in connection with advertising Mercedes-Benz die-
sel vehicles."
"The proceedings in England and Wales 
consist of several individual lawsuits that have been 
consolidated into a class action."
"A class action lawsuit 
is also pending in Scotland."
"In these proceedings, al-
legedly injured parties must actively register for the 
enforcement of claims (opt-in)."
"The plaintiffs in the 
consumer class action in England and Wales also al-
lege, among other things, anti-competitive behaviour 
relating to technology for the treatment of diesel ex-
haust emissions."
"In Germany, a large number of customers of diesel 
vehicles have filed lawsuits for damages or rescission 
of sales contracts."
"They assert that the vehicles con-
tained illegal defeat devices and/or showed impermis-
sibly high emission or consumption values."
"They refer 
in particular to the KBA’s recall orders (see above)."
"Although the number of pending cases is declining, a 
future increase cannot be ruled out."
"Based on similar 
allegations, the Federation of German Consumer Or-
ganizations (Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e."
"V.) 
filed a model declaratory action (Musterfeststellungs-
klage) against Mercedes-Benz Group AG with the 
Stuttgart Higher Regional Court in July 2021."
"Such an 
action seeks a ruling that certain preconditions of al-
leged consumer claims are met."
"In addition, investors from Germany and abroad have 
filed lawsuits for damages with the Stuttgart Regional 
Court alleging the violation of disclosure requirements 
(main proceedings) and also raised out-of-court claims 
for damages."
"The investors allege that Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG did not immediately disclose inside infor-
mation in connection with the emission behaviour of its 
diesel vehicles and that it had made false and mislead-
ing public statements."
"They further claim that the pur-
chase price of the financial instruments acquired by 
them (in particular Mercedes-Benz Group shares, for-
merly Daimler AG shares) would have been lower if 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG had complied with its disclo-
sure obligations."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG regards 
these allegations and claims as being without merit and 
will defend itself against them."
"In this context, the 
Stuttgart Higher Regional Court initiated model case 
proceedings under the German Act on Model Case 
Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law 
(KapMuG) in December 2021 (model case proceedings)."
"The purpose of the model case proceedings is to reach 
a decision that is binding for the main proceedings 
regarding common factual and legal questions."
"The 
main proceedings before the Stuttgart Regional Court 
will be suspended until a decision is reached on the 
questions submitted, insofar as they cannot be dis-
missed independently of the questions to be decided 
in the model case proceedings."
"The decision in the 
model case proceedings is binding for the suspended 
main proceedings."
"Multiple investors have used the 
possibility to register claims in a considerable amount 
with the model case proceedings in order to suspend 
the period of limitation."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG re-
mains of the view to have duly fulfilled its disclosure 
obligations under capital markets law and defends 
itself against the investors’ allegations also in these 
model case proceedings."
"For recognized provisions, this does 
not apply to the extent that a settlement has been 
reached or a proceeding has been concluded."
"Other legal proceedings 
Starting in July 2017, a number of class action suits 
were filed in the United States and Canada against 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and other manufacturers of 
automobiles as well as a number of their North Ameri-
can subsidiaries."
"Plaintiffs allege to have suffered dam-
ages because defendants engaged in anticompetitive 
behaviour relating to vehicle technology, costs, suppli-
ers, markets, and other competitive attributes, includ-
ing diesel emissions control technology, since the 
1990s."
"In June 2022, the proceedings in the United 
States were dismissed with final effect in favour of the 
concerned Mercedes-Benz Group companies."
"Further-
more, in 2023, several class actions in Canada were 
finally dismissed as the plaintiffs discontinued their 
claims."
"This development leads to a 
material reduction of the risk associated with the class 
actions."
"They therefore no longer qualify for separate 
reporting, which is why the Mercedes-Benz Group will 
no longer report on them in the future."
"As already reported, class actions in connection with 
Takata airbags are pending in the United States, Cana-
da and Israel."
"One 
of the lawsuits in the United States also asserted 
claims by automotive recyclers who alleged injury be-
cause they were not able to re-sell salvaged airbag 
inflators that are subject to the Takata recall."
"This claim 
has since then been finally dismissed."
"Also, the remain-
ing consumer class action in the United States was 
dismissed against Mercedes-Benz Group AG in its en-
tirety, and against MBUSA in part."
"The plaintiffs have 
appealed the dismissal of Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
and the proceedings against MBUSA are still pending."
"Since February 2023, the class actions in Canada were 
discontinued by the plaintiffs; one of the class actions 
was finally dismissed and the formal court dismissal for 
the other class action is still pending."
"Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG continues to regard the pending claims as 
being without merit, and the affected Group companies 
will continue to defend themselves against the claims."
"Contingent liabilities were disclosed to a low extent for 
this topic."
"In October 2021, a number of Australian Mercedes-
Benz dealers lodged a claim against Mercedes-Benz 
Australia/Pacific Pty Ltd (MBAuP) with a Federal Court 
in Australia."
"They allege that MBAuP forced the dealers 
to accept a change in their business model from a 
dealership model to an agency model and thus de-
prived them of the goodwill they created through their 
investments in the Australian Mercedes-Benz dealer-
ship network."
"They seek reinstatement of the dealer-
ship model or, alternatively, compensation for the 
damage they allegedly incurred."
"In August 2023, the 
court dismissed the claims in their entirety."
"In January 
2024, the plaintiffs appealed the decision."
"MBAuP con-
siders those claims to be without merit and continues 
to defend itself against the claims."
"Since 2022, a class action has been pending in the 
United States alleging claims based on a voluntary 
recall of certain Mercedes-Benz ML-, GL- and R-Class 
vehicles produced during the 2004–2015 model years 
for potentially corroded brake boosters."
"Among other 
things, the plaintiffs allege that the brake boosters in 
such vehicles can corrode and lead to reduced braking 
force."
"They allege failure to disclose the claimed defect 
and assert various claims."
"A similar class action was 
filed in Israel."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group considers the 
lawsuits to be without merit and defends itself against 
them."
"Such provisions 
are recognized in the Group’s Consolidated Financial 
Statements and are based on estimates."
"If quantifiable, 
contingent liabilities in connection with legal proceed-
ings are disclosed in the Group’s Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements."
"Risks resulting from legal proceedings 
sometimes cannot be assessed reliably or only to a 
limited extent."
"Consequently, provisions recognized for 
some legal proceedings may turn out to be insufficient 
once such proceedings have ended."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group may also become liable for payments in 
legal proceedings for which no provisions were recog-
nized and/or contingent liabilities were disclosed."
"Un-
certainty exists with regard to the amounts or due 
dates of possible cash outflows."
"Although the final 
result of any such proceedings could materially affect 
the Group’s operating results and cash flows for a par-
ticular reporting period, the Mercedes-Benz Group 
believes that it should not exert a sustained influence 
on the Group’s financial position."
"Contingent liabilities and  
other financial obligations 
Contingent liabilities 
At 31 December 2023, the best estimate for obligations 
from contingent liabilities was €2,553 million (2022: 
€4,122 million)."
"The other contingent liabilities are 
mainly related to the legal proceedings and product 
warranties described in Note 30."
"Compared to the pre-
vious year, the decrease in contingent liabilities is a 
result of discontinuing the business activities in Russia 
and the disposal of contingent liabilities with the reali-
zation of the transaction."
"Other financial obligations 
At 31 December 2023, other financial obligations exist 
from the acquisition of intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment and lease property of 
€5,684 million (2022: €5,729 million)."
"In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group issued irrevo-
cable loan commitments at 31 December 2023."
"These 
loan commitments had not been utilized as of that 
date."
"Further information with respect to these irrevo-
cable loan commitments is provided in Note 33."
"The fair values of 
financial instruments were calculated on the basis of 
market information available on the balance sheet 
date."
"The following methods and assumptions were 
used."
"Receivables from financial services 
The fair values of receivables from financial services 
with variable interest rates are estimated to be equal to 
the respective carrying amounts, because the agreed 
upon interest rates and those available in the market 
do not significantly differ."
"The fair values of receivables 
from financial services with fixed interest rates are 
determined on the basis of discounted expected future 
cash flows."
"Discounting is based on the current interest 
rates at which similar loans with identical terms could 
have been obtained at 31 December 2023 and 31 De-
cember 2022."
"Trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents 
Due to the short terms and the fundamentally lower 
credit risk of these financial instruments, it is assumed 
that their fair values are equal to the carrying amounts."
"Marketable debt securities and similar investments, 
other financial assets  
Marketable debt securities are recognized at fair value 
through other comprehensive income or at fair value 
through profit or loss."
"Similar investments are meas-
ured at amortized cost and are not included in the 
measurement hierarchy, as their carrying amounts are a 
reasonable approximation of fair value due to the short 
terms of these financial instruments and the funda-
mentally low credit risk."
"Equity instruments are recognized at fair value through 
other comprehensive income or at fair value through 
profit or loss."
"The 
remaining investments recognized at fair value through 
other comprehensive income comprise further invest-
ments not material on an individual basis."
"Marketable debt securities and equity instruments 
recognized at fair value were measured using quoted 
market prices at the end of the reporting period."
"If 
quoted market prices are not available for these debt 
and equity instruments, fair value measurement is 
based on inputs that are either directly or indirectly 
observable in active markets."
"Fair values are calculated 
using recognized financial valuation models such as 
discounted cash flow models or multiples."
"Other financial assets recognized at fair value through 
profit or loss relate to derivative financial instruments 
not used in hedge accounting."
"The 
measurement of currency forwards is based on mar-
ket quotes of forward curves."
"Currency options are 
measured with option-pricing models using market 
data."
"- derivative interest rate hedging contracts; the fair 
values of interest rate hedging instruments (e.g."
"- derivative commodity hedging contracts; the fair 
values of commodity hedging contracts (e.g."
"com-
modity forwards) are determined on the basis of cur-
rent reference prices with consideration of forward 
premiums and discounts and default risks."
"Other financial receivables and other financial assets 
are carried at amortized cost."
"Because of the predomi-
nantly short maturities and the fundamentally lower 
credit risk of these financial instruments, it is assumed 
that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts."
"Financing liabilities 
Financing liabilities are measured at amortized cost."
"The fair values of bonds, loans, commercial paper, 
deposits in the direct banking business and liabilities 
from ABS transactions are calculated as present values 
of the estimated future cash flows (taking account of 
credit premiums and credit risks)."
"Market interest rates 
for the appropriate terms are used for discounting."
"Trade payables 
Due to the short maturities of these financial instru-
ments, it is assumed that their fair values are equal to 
the carrying amounts."
"Reverse factoring agreements did not change the rele-
vant characteristics of a trade payable for the Group 
for the liabilities concerned."
"As a result, there were no 
reclassifications of these trade payables to financing 
liabilities."
"Contract and refund liabilities  
Contract and refund liabilities include obligations from 
sales transactions that qualify as financial instruments."
"Obligations from sales transactions should generally be 
regarded as current."
"Due to the short maturities of 
these financial instruments, it is assumed that their fair 
values are equal to the carrying amounts."
"Other financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities recognized at fair value through 
profit or loss comprise derivative financial instruments 
not used in hedge accounting."
"For information regard-
ing these financial instruments as well as derivative 
financial instruments used in hedge accounting, see the 
notes above under Marketable debt securities and 
similar investments, other financial assets."
"Miscellaneous other financial liabilities are carried at 
amortized cost."
"Because of the predominantly short 
maturities of these financial instruments, it is assumed 
that the fair values approximate the carrying amounts."
"See Note 1 for further qualitative descriptions of ac-
counting for and presentation of financial instruments 
(including derivative financial instruments)."
"However, these arrangements do not meet 
the criteria for netting in the Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position, as they allow netting only in the case 
of future events such as default or insolvency on the 
part of the Group or the counterparties."
"The following table shows the carrying amounts of the 
derivative financial instruments subject to the de-
scribed arrangements as well as the possible financial 
effects of netting in accordance with the master netting 
arrangements."
2 The other financial liabilities which are subject to a master netting arrangement comprise derivative financial instruments that are included in hedge accounting and financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit or loss (see Note 25).
"At the end of the reporting period, the Group reviews 
whether reclassifications between the measurement 
hierarchies are necessary compared to 31 December of 
the previous year."
"For the determination of the credit risk from derivative 
financial instruments which are allocated to the Level 2 
measurement hierarchy, portfolios managed on the 
basis of net exposure are applied."
"2 Fair value measurement is based on inputs, that are observable on an active market either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)."
"3 Fair value measurement is based on inputs, for which no observable market data is available."
"2 Fair value measurement is based on inputs that are observable on an active market either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)."
3 Fair value measurement is based on inputs for which no observable market data is available.
"2  This does not include lease receivables of €19,235 million (2022: €18,851 million) as these are not assigned to a measurement category."
3 These amounts relate to derivative financial instruments that are not included in hedge accounting.
"4 This does not include liabilities from lease transactions of €2,207 million (2022: €2,645 million) as these are not assigned to a measurement category."
5 This does not include financial guarantees of €4 million (2022: €7 million) as these are not assigned to a measurement category.
"Net gains/losses on equity and debt instruments rec-
ognized at fair value through profit or loss primarily 
comprise gains and losses attributable to changes in 
the fair values of these instruments."
"Net gains/losses on other financial assets and liabilities 
recognized at fair value through profit or loss comprise 
gains and losses attributable to changes in their fair 
values."
"Net gains/losses on equity instruments recognized at 
fair value through other comprehensive income com-
prise dividend payments."
"Net gains/losses on other financial assets recognized  
at fair value through other comprehensive income are 
primarily attributable to exchange-rate effects."
"Foreign cur-
rency gains and losses are also included."
"Net gains/losses on financial liabilities measured at 
(amortized) cost (excluding the interest income/ 
expense shown below) primarily comprise exchange-
rate effects."
"Total interest income and total  
interest expense  
Total interest income and total interest expense  
for financial assets or financial liabilities that are not  
recognized at fair value through profit or loss are 
shown in the following table."
"These are mainly currency 
risks; interest rate risks and commodity price risks, 
which have been defined as risk categories."
"For these 
hedging purposes, the Group mainly uses currency 
forward transactions, cross-currency interest rate 
swaps, interest rate swaps, options and commodity 
forwards."
"The following table shows the amounts for the trans-
actions designated as hedging instruments."
"Most of the transactions for which the effects from the 
measurement of the hedging instrument and the un-
derlying transaction to a large extent offset each other 
in the Consolidated Statement of Income were mostly 
not included in the hedge accounting."
"Even if derivative financial instruments do not or no 
longer qualify for hedge accounting, these instruments 
still serve to hedge financial risks from business opera-
tions."
"A hedging instrument is terminated when the 
hedged transaction no longer exists or is no longer 
expected to occur."
"Explanations of the hedging of exchange-rate risks, 
interest rate risks and commodity price risks can be 
found in Note 33 in the sub-item Finance market risk."
"2 Includes the following hedging instruments: interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps."
3 Gains and losses from hedging instruments used for recognizing hedge ineffectiveness.
"The amounts related to items designated 
as cash flow hedges are shown in the following table."
"The Group also partially hedges the currency risk of 
selected investments with the application of derivative 
or non-derivative financial instruments."
"Neither in the 
reporting year nor in the previous year were there any 
active hedges of net investments in foreign operations."
"Expenses of €2 million (2022: income of €2 million) 
were attributable to the hedge ineffective portion of the 
hedges."
"During 2022, shifts in delivery dates and volumes oc-
curred in various markets, making some planned vehicle 
sales in specific currencies unlikely, with the conse-
quence that hedge accounting for these sales had to be 
terminated."
"This particularly affected the currency CNY as a conse-
quence of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"The reclassification 
from the reserves for derivative financial instruments to 
the Consolidated Statement of Income did not result in 
any material effects."
"The amounts of the items hedged 
with fair-value hedges are included in the following 
table."
"Neither in the current year nor in the previous year 
were there any results attributable to the ineffective 
portion of the hedge with fair-value hedges."
"At 31 December 2023, the balance of reserves for 
hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
amounted to €189 million (2022: €189 million)."
"The following table shows the nominal values of de-
rivative financial instruments used in hedge accounting 
entered into for the purpose of hedging currency risks, 
interest rate risks and commodity price risks that arise 
from the Group’s operating and/or financing activities."
"The maturities of the derivative financial instruments 
generally correspond with those of the underlying 
transactions."
"The realization of the underlying transac-
tions is expected to correspond with the maturities of 
the hedging transactions shown in the following table."
"Further information on the reform of the 
interest rate benchmark is provided in Note 33."
"An equity price risk results from investments 
in listed companies."
"In addition, the Group is exposed 
to credit risks from its leasing and mainly financing 
activities and from its business operations (trade re-
ceivables)."
"Furthermore, the Group is exposed to coun-
try and liquidity risks relating to its credit and market 
risks or a deterioration of its business operations or 
financial market disturbances."
"If these financial risks 
materialize, they could adversely affect the Group’s 
profitability, liquidity and capital resources and finan-
cial position."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has established internal 
policies for risk controlling procedures and for the use 
of financial instruments, including a clear segregation 
of duties with regard to financial activities, settlement, 
accounting and the related controlling."
"The guidelines and sys-
tems are regularly reviewed and adjusted to changes in 
markets and products."
"The Group manages and monitors these risks primarily 
through its operating and financing activities and, if 
required, through the use of derivative financial in-
struments."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group uses derivative 
financial instruments exclusively for hedging financial 
risks that arise from its business operations or refi-
nancing activities or liquidity management."
"Without 
these derivative financial instruments, the Group would 
be exposed to higher financial risks."
"Additional infor-
mation on financial instruments and especially on the 
volumes of the derivative financial instruments used is 
included in Note 32."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group regu-
larly evaluates its financial risks with due consideration 
of changes in key economic indicators and up-to-date 
market information."
"See Note 22 for additional infor-
mation on the Mercedes-Benz Group’s pension and 
post-employment healthcare benefits."
"Credit risk  
Credit risk describes the risk of financial loss resulting 
from a counterparty failing to meet its contractual 
payment obligations."
"Credit risk encompasses both the 
direct risk of default and the risk of a deterioration of 
creditworthiness as well as concentration risks."
"The maximum risk positions of financial assets which 
are generally subject to credit risk are equal to their 
carrying amounts at the balance sheet date (without 
consideration of collateral, if available)."
"There is also a 
risk of default from irrevocable loan commitments 
which had not been utilized as of that date, as well as 
from financial guarantees."
"The maximum risk position 
in these cases is equal to the expected future cash 
outflows."
"The following table shows the maximum risk positions 
at the balance sheet date."
"Liquid assets 
Liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and 
marketable debt securities and similar investments."
"With the investment of liquid assets, banks and issuers 
of securities are selected very carefully and diversified 
in accordance with a limit system."
"Liquid assets are 
mainly held at financial institutions within and outside 
Europe with high creditworthiness, as bonds issued by 
German federal states and as money market funds."
"In 
connection with investment decisions, priority is placed 
on the borrower’s very high creditworthiness and on 
balanced risk diversification."
"The limits and their utili-
zation are reassessed continuously."
"In this assessment, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group also considers the credit risk 
assessment of its counterparties by the capital mar-
kets."
"In line with the Group’s risk policy, most liquid 
assets are held in investments with an external rating 
of “A” or better."
"Liquid assets are thus not subject to a 
material credit risk and are allocated to stage 1 of the 
impairment model under IFRS, which is based on ex-
pected credit risk."
"As a consequence of 
these activities, the Group is exposed to credit risk, 
which is monitored and managed based on defined 
standards, guidelines and procedures."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group manages its credit risk irrespective of 
whether it is related to a financing contract or to an 
operating lease or a finance lease contract."
"For this 
reason, statements concerning the credit risk of Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility refer to the entire financing and 
leasing business, unless otherwise specified."
"Exposure to credit risk from financing and lease activi-
ties is monitored based on the portfolio subject to 
credit risk."
"The portfolio subject to credit risk consists 
of wholesale and retail receivables from financial ser-
vices and the portion of the operating lease portfolio 
that is subject to credit risk."
"Receivables from financial 
services comprise claims arising from finance lease 
contracts and repayment claims from financing loans."
"The operating lease portfolio is reported under equip-
ment on operating leases in the Group’s Consolidated 
Statement of Financial Position."
"Lease payments due 
from operating lease contracts are recognized in re-
ceivables from financial services."
"The Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment has policies set-
ting the framework for effective risk management at a 
global as well as a local level."
"In particular, these poli-
cies deal with minimum requirements for all risk-
relevant credit processes, the definition of financing 
products offered, the evaluation of customer quality, 
requests for collateral and the treatment of unsecured 
loans and non-performing claims."
"The limitation of 
concentration risks is implemented primarily by means 
of global limits, which refer to customer exposures."
"To 
comply with these limits, Mercedes-Benz Mobility ap-
plies approval standards and measures to avoid con-
centration risks."
"Only one customer was granted a 
credit line in the form of a large loan."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Mobility portfolio consists of a large number of 
small and medium-sized enterprises and private cus-
tomers from more than 30 countries."
"At 31 December 
2023, this segment accounted for 72% of the portfolio."
"With respect to its financing and lease activities, the 
Group holds collateral for customer transactions limit-
ing actual credit risk through its fair value."
"The value of 
collateral generally depends on the amount of the fi-
nanced assets."
"The financed vehicles usually serve as 
collateral."
"Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Mobility limits 
credit risk from financing and lease activities, for ex-
ample through deposits from customers."
"For the assessment of the default risk of retail and 
small business customers, scoring systems are applied 
to evaluate their creditworthiness."
"Corporate custom-
ers are evaluated using internal rating instruments."
"Both evaluation processes use external credit bureau 
data if available."
"The scoring and rating results as well 
as the availability of security and other risk mitigation 
instruments, such as deposits, guarantees and, to a 
lesser extent, residual debt insurances, are essential 
elements for credit decisions."
"In the case of receivables from finan-
cial services, significant modifications of financial as-
sets were only made in rare cases and to an insignifi-
cant extent."
"The allowance ratio decreased compared to the previ-
ous year due to the sale of the Russian Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility companies for which very high provisions were 
recorded in 2022."
"The default rate has increased com-
pared to the very low figures in the previous year, 
mainly due to a challenging lending environment in the 
United States."
"For information on credit risks included in receivables 
from financial services, see Note 14."
"Information on the 
measurement of expected credit losses is provided in 
Note 1."
"Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are mostly receivables from world-
wide sales of vehicles and spare parts."
"The credit risk 
from trade receivables encompasses the default risk of 
customers, e.g."
"dealers and general distribution com-
panies, as well as other corporate and private custom-
ers."
"In order to identify credit risks, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group assesses the creditworthiness of customers."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Group manages its credit risk from 
trade receivables using appropriate IT applications and 
databases on the basis of internal policies which have 
to be followed Group-wide."
"A significant proportion of the trade receivables from 
each country’s domestic business is secured by various 
country-specific types of collateral."
"This collateral in-
cludes conditional sales, guarantees and sureties, as 
well as mortgages and deposits from customers."
"For trade receivables from the export business, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group also evaluates its customers’ 
creditworthiness by means of an internal rating process 
with consideration of the respective country risk."
"In this context, the Annual Financial Statements and 
other relevant information on the general distribution 
companies, such as payment history, are used and 
assessed."
"Depending on the creditworthiness of the customers, 
the Mercedes-Benz Group establishes credit limits and 
limits credit risks with the following types of collateral:  
- credit insurances, 
- first-class bank guarantees and 
- letters of credit."
"These procedures are defined in the export credit 
guidelines, which have Group-wide validity."
"For impairments of trade receivables, the simplified 
approach is applied, according to which these receiva-
bles are allocated to stage 2."
"Credit losses until maturi-
ty for these trade receivables are recognized upon 
initial recognition."
"Further information on trade receivables and the status 
of loss allowances recognized is provided in Note 19."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group manages its 
credit risk exposure in connection with derivative fi-
nancial instruments through a limit system, which is 
based on the review of each counterparty’s financial 
strength."
"This system limits and diversifies the credit 
risk."
"As a result, the Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed 
to credit risk only to a small extent with respect to its 
derivative financial instruments."
"In accordance with the 
Group’s risk policy, most derivatives are contracted 
with counterparties which have an external rating of 
“A” or better."
"Other receivables and financial assets 
The Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to credit risk 
only to a small extent with respect to other receivables 
and financial assets included in other financial assets in 
2023 and 2022."
"Irrevocable loan commitments 
The Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment in particular is 
exposed to credit risk from irrevocable loan commit-
ments to end customers and retailers."
"At 31 December 
2023, irrevocable loan commitments amounted to 
€2,476 million (2022: €3,234 million)."
"These loan com-
mitments had a maturity of less than one year and are 
not subject to a material credit risk based on the cur-
rent state of knowledge."
"Financial guarantees 
The maximum potential obligations resulting from fi-
nancial guarantees amounted to €284 million at 31 
December 2023 (2022: €551 million) and included lia-
bilities recognized at 31 December 2023 in the amount 
of €4 million (2022: €7 million)."
"Financial guarantees 
represent contractual arrangements."
"These guarantees 
generally provide that in the event of default or non-
payment by the primary debtor, the Group will be re-
quired to settle such financial obligations generally up 
to a contractually agreed amount."
"Country risk 
Country risk is the risk of economic loss arising from 
changes of political, economic, legal or social condi-
tions in the respective country, e.g."
"resulting from sov-
ereign measures such as expropriation or interdiction 
of foreign currency transfers."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to country risk 
mainly resulting from cross-border funding or collat-
eralization of Group companies and customers, from 
investments in Group companies, associated compa-
nies, joint ventures and joint operations as well as from 
cross-border trade receivables."
"Country risks also arise 
from cross-border cash deposits at financial institu-
tions."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group manages these risks via 
country exposure limits (e.g."
"for hard currency portfoli-
os of financial services entities)."
"An internal rating sys-
tem serves as a basis for the Mercedes-Benz Group’s 
risk-oriented country exposure management; it assigns 
all countries to risk classes, with consideration of both 
external ratings and capital market indications of coun-
try risks."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group manages its liquidity by 
holding adequate volumes of liquid assets and by 
maintaining syndicated credit facilities in addition to 
the cash inflows generated by its business operations."
"Additionally, the possibility to securitize receivables of 
the financial services business (ABS transactions) also 
reduces the Group’s liquidity risk."
"Liquid assets com-
prise cash and cash equivalents and marketable debt 
securities and similar investments."
"The Group can dis-
pose of these liquid assets at short notice."
"Insofar as reverse factoring agreements are entered 
into, they have no influence on the liquidity risk of the 
Mercedes-Benz Group, as they relate to a large number 
of investors and have no impact on the payment terms 
of the trade payables concerned."
"The funds raised are used to finance working capital 
and capital expenditure as well as the cash needs of 
the leasing and sales-financing business and unex-
pected liquidity needs."
"In accordance with internal 
policies, the refunding of the leasing and sales-
financing business is generally carried out with match-
ing maturities so that financing liabilities have the same 
maturity profile as the equipment on operating leases 
and the receivables from financial services."
"At 31 December 2023, the liquidity of the Mercedes-
Benz Group amounted to €22.8 billion (2022: 
€24.7 billion)."
"In 2023, significant cash inflows resulted 
from the business of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans segments."
"Furthermore, dividends 
received from Daimler Truck Holding AG and Beijing 
Benz Automotive Co., Ltd."
"in particular had a positive 
effect on liquidity."
"Cash outflows resulted in particular 
from investments in intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment, income taxes paid, the dividend 
payment to the shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group 
AG and payments made as part of the share buyback 
programme."
"Moreover, there were negative effects 
from the leasing and sales financing business at Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility."
"From an operating point of view, the management of 
the Group’s liquidity exposures is centralized by a daily 
cash-pooling process."
"This process enables the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group to manage its liquidity surplus and 
liquidity requirements according to the actual needs of 
the Group and of the companies of the Group."
"The 
Group’s short-term and mid-term liquidity management 
takes into account the maturities of financial assets 
and financial liabilities and estimates of cash flows 
from business operations."
"In general, the Mercedes-Benz Group makes use of a 
broad spectrum of financial instruments to cover its 
funding requirements."
"Depending on funding require-
ments and market conditions, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group issues commercial papers, bonds (including 
green bonds), debt obligations and financial instru-
ments secured by receivables in various currencies."
"Bank credit facilities are also used to cover financing 
requirements."
"Potential downgrades of the Mercedes-
Benz Group’s credit ratings could have a negative im-
pact on the Group’s financing."
"Since July 2018, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group has had at its disposal a syndi-
cated credit facility with a volume of €11 billion from a 
consortium of international banks."
"It grants the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group additional financial flexibility until 
2025."
"The credit line was unused as of 31 December 
2023."
"In addition, customer deposits at Mercedes-Benz 
Bank are used as a further source of refinancing."
"Information on the Group’s financing liabilities is also 
provided in Note 24."
"The customer deposits of Mercedes-Benz Bank are mostly considered in this analysis to mature with-
in the first year."
(b) The cash flows of floating-interest financial instruments are estimated on the basis of forward rates.
2 The stated cash flows of financing liabilities consist of their undiscounted principal and interest payments.
3 The undiscounted sum of the cash flows of the derivative financial liabilities is shown for the respective year.
4 The cash outflows of trade payables are undiscounted.
5 The maximum available amounts are stated.
6 The maximum potential obligations under the issued financial guarantees are stated.
It is assumed that the amounts are due within the first year.
"The Group is also exposed to equity price risk in 
connection with its investments in listed companies."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group manages market risks to 
minimize the impact of fluctuations in foreign ex-
change-rates and interest rates on the earnings of the 
Group and its segments."
"The Group calculates its over-
all net-exposure to these market risks to provide the 
basis for hedging decisions, which include the selection 
of hedging instruments and the determination of hedg-
ing volumes and the corresponding periods."
"The hedg-
ing strategy is specified at Group level and uniformly 
implemented in the segments."
"Decisions regarding, for 
example, currencies and asset-liability management 
(interest rates) are made by a committee that meets 
regularly."
"Net-exposures are the basis for the hedging 
strategies and are updated regularly."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group usually counteracts the risk of short-term 
fluctuations in raw-material prices by means of price 
escalation clauses in the supply contracts."
"Power pur-
chase agreements are also concluded to reduce elec-
tricity price risks."
"Power purchase agreements are pur-
chase agreements for energy needs, including fixed 
purchase prices of the electricity generated by a spe-
cific plant for generating wind or solar power."
"Certain existing benchmark interest rates including 
those of the London Interbank Offered Rate (for USD, 
GBP, CHF and JPY) were comprehensively and interna-
tionally reformed."
"As a result, those interest rates were 
gradually abolished and replaced with alternative risk-
free reference rates."
"Alternative interest rates were 
developed on a national level in the context of the 
respective legal systems and currencies; they can 
therefore vary with regard to their structure, method-
ology and period of publication."
"As the reform for EURIBOR and USD, GBP, CHF and JPY 
LIBOR has already been implemented, the contractual 
adjustment of financial instruments has already been 
made in line with a corresponding interest rate refer-
ence."
"The conversion of the outstanding reference rates of 
hedging instruments and their underlying transactions 
was identical and without any material delay."
"The Mer-
cedes-Benz Group considered the economic relation-
ship and thus the continuation of hedge accounting to 
be still existing as of 31 December 2022."
"The nominal values of those hedging instruments that 
were affected in the prior year and are included in a 
hedging relationship can be found in table Nominal 
amounts of derivative financial instruments used in 
hedge accounting in Note 32."
"The effect of the application of the new interest rates 
on the Consolidated Financial Statements is being re-
viewed on an ongoing basis."
"In order to conduct finan-
cial transactions based on the new indices, the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group is preparing its relevant IT-systems 
accordingly."
"Uncertainty still exists about future market 
standards with interest conventions for individual fi-
nancial products (cash products and interest deriva-
tives) that reference the new risk-free rates."
"Contracts 
not yet converted as part of the IBOR reform in the 
previous year (USD LIBOR) amounted to €4,790 million 
in financial liabilities and €9,258 million in derivatives 
as of 31 December 2022."
"As part of its risk management system, the Mercedes-
Benz Group employs value-at-risk analyses."
"At the Group level, the Mercedes-Benz Group calcu-
lates the value at risk for exchange-rate and interest 
rate risk according to the variance-covariance ap-
proach."
"The value-at-risk calculation method for com-
modity hedging instruments is based on a Monte Carlo 
simulation."
"When calculating value at risk using the variance-
covariance approach, the Mercedes-Benz Group first 
computes the current market value of the Group’s fi-
nancial instruments portfolio."
"Then the sensitivity of 
the portfolio value to changes in the relevant market 
risk factors, such as particular foreign currency ex-
change-rates or interest rates of specific maturities, is 
quantified."
"Based on volatilities and correlations of 
these market risk factors, which are obtained from the 
RiskMetrics™ dataset, a statistical distribution of po-
tential changes in the portfolio value at the end of the 
holding period is computed."
"The loss which is reached 
or exceeded with a probability of only 1% can be de-
rived from this calculation and represents the value at 
risk."
"The Monte Carlo simulation uses random numbers to 
generate possible changes in market risk factors con-
sistent with current market volatilities."
"The changes in 
market risk factors allow the calculation of a possible 
change in the portfolio value over the holding period."
"Running multiple iterations of this simulation leads to a 
distribution of portfolio value changes."
"The value at risk 
can be determined based on this distribution as the 
portfolio value loss which is reached or exceeded with 
a probability of 1%."
"Exchange-rate risk 
Transaction risk and currency risk management 
The global nature of the Mercedes-Benz Group’s busi-
nesses exposes cash flows to risks arising from fluctua-
tions in exchange-rates."
"These risks primarily relate to 
fluctuations between the euro and the US dollar, the 
Chinese renminbi, the British pound and other curren-
cies such as currencies of growth markets."
"In the oper-
ating vehicle business, the Group’s exchange-rate risk 
primarily arises when revenue is generated in a curren-
cy that is different from the currency in which the costs 
of revenue are incurred (transaction risk)."
"It may be 
inadequate to cover the costs if the value of the cur-
rency in which the revenue is generated declined in the 
interim relative to the value of the currency in which 
the costs were incurred."
"The risk exposures serve as a 
basis for analysing exchange-rate risks at Group level."
"In addition, the Group is indirectly exposed to a trans-
action risk from its equity-method investments."
"The Group’s overall currency exposure is reduced by 
natural hedging, which consists of the currency expo-
sures of the business operations of different entities 
and segments partially offsetting each other at Group 
level."
"These natural hedges eliminate the need for 
hedging to the extent of the matched exposures."
"To 
provide an additional natural hedge against any re-
maining transaction risk exposure, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group generally strives to increase cash outflows in the 
same currencies in which the Group has a net excess 
inflow."
"In order to mitigate the impact of currency exchange-
rate fluctuations for the business operations (future 
transactions), the Mercedes-Benz Group continually 
assesses its exposure to exchange-rate risks and hedg-
es a portion of those risks by using derivative financial 
instruments."
"A committee manages the Group’s ex-
change-rate risk and its hedging transactions through 
currency derivatives."
"The committee consists of repre-
sentatives of the relevant segments and corporate 
functions."
"The Corporate Treasury department aggre-
gates foreign currency exposures from the companies 
of the Group and the operational units and implements 
the committee’s decisions concerning foreign currency 
hedging through transactions with international finan-
cial institutions."
"Suitable measures are generally taken 
without delay to eliminate any over-hedging regarding 
hedging transactions caused by changes in exposure."
"Moreover, designated hedging relationships are re-
viewed with respect to any requirements to discon-
tinue hedge accounting."
"Depending on 
the nature of the underlying risks, the hedging rates 
decrease the further the expected cash flows are in the 
future."
"On the one hand, the hedging horizon is natural-
ly limited by uncertainty related to cash flows that lie 
far in the future; on the other hand, it may also be lim-
ited by the fact that appropriate currency contracts are 
not available."
"This step-by-step method aims to limit 
risks for the Group from unfavourable movements in 
exchange-rates while preserving sufficient flexibility to 
participate in favourable developments."
"Based on this 
step-by-step method and depending on the market 
outlook, the committee determines the hedging hori-
zon, which usually varies from one to five years, as well 
as the average hedge ratios."
"To cover foreign currency exposure risks of the vehicle 
business operations forward foreign exchange con-
tracts and currency options are primarily used."
"The 
Mercedes-Benz Group’s policies call for a mixture of 
these financial instruments depending on the assess-
ment of market conditions."
"Value at risk is used to 
measure the exchange-rate risk inherent in these de-
rivative financial instruments."
"Average exposure has been computed 
on an end-of-quarter basis."
"The other transactions 
underlying the derivative financial instruments are not 
included in the following value-at-risk presentation, 
since they comprise forecast cash flows."
"See also table 
Nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments 
used in hedge accounting in Note 32."
"Hedge accounting  
When designating derivative financial instruments, a 
hedge ratio of 1 is applied."
"In addition, the respective 
volume and currency of the hedge and the underlying 
transaction as well as maturity dates are matched."
"The 
Group ensures an economic relationship between the 
underlying transaction and the hedging instrument by 
ensuring consistency of currency, volume and maturity."
"The effective-
ness of the hedge is assessed at the start of and during 
the hedging relationship."
"Possible sources of ineffec-
tiveness of the hedging relationship are: 
- Changes in the credit risk on the measurement of the 
used hedging instrument which are not reflected in 
the change of the hedged currency risk."
- Changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.
"There 
were no material effects on earnings in the years 2022 
and 2023."
"The Group’s investments in liquid assets or refinancing 
activities are generally selected so that possible cur-
rency risks are minimized."
"The Group uses appropriate derivative 
financial instruments (e.g."
"cross-currency interest rate 
swaps) to hedge against currency risk."
"Effects of currency (translation risk)  
For purposes of Mercedes-Benz Group’s Consolidated 
Financial Statements, the income and expenses and 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside 
the euro zone are converted into euros."
"Therefore, 
period-to-period changes in exchange-rates may cause 
translation effects that have a significant impact on, for 
example, revenue, segment profit/loss (EBIT) and as-
sets and liabilities of the Group."
"Unlike exchange-rate 
transaction risk, currency translation risk does not nec-
essarily affect future cash flows."
"The Group’s equity 
position reflects changes in carrying amounts caused 
by exchange-rates."
"In general, the Mercedes-Benz 
Group does not hedge against currency translation risk."
"However, the majority of 
interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities results from 
the financial services business operated by Mercedes-
Benz Mobility."
"The Mercedes-Benz Mobility companies 
enter into transactions with customers that primarily 
result in fixed-rate receivables."
"The Mercedes-Benz 
Group’s general policy is to match the refinancing of 
interest-bearing assets in terms of maturities and in-
terest rates wherever economically feasible."
"However, 
for a narrowly limited portion of the receivables portfo-
lio in selected and developed markets, Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility does not match refinancing in terms of maturi-
ties in order to take advantage of market opportunities."
"This results in the Mercedes-Benz Group being ex-
posed to interest rate risks."
"A committee consisting of representatives of the rele-
vant segments and the corporate functions manages 
the interest rate risk by setting targets for the interest 
rate risk position."
"The Corporate Treasury department 
and the local Mercedes-Benz Group companies are 
jointly responsible for achieving these targets."
"As sepa-
rate functions, the Treasury Controlling and the Mer-
cedes-Benz Mobility Controlling & Reporting depart-
ment monitor target achievement on a monthly basis."
"In order to achieve the targeted interest rate risk posi-
tions in terms of maturities and interest rate fixing 
periods, the Mercedes-Benz Group also uses derivative 
financial instruments such as interest rate swaps."
"The 
interest rate risk position is assessed by comparing 
assets and liabilities for corresponding maturities, in-
cluding the impact of the relevant derivative financial 
instruments."
"Derivative financial instruments are also used in con-
junction with the refinancing related to the automotive 
segments and liquidity management."
"The Mercedes-
Benz Group steers the funding activities of the automo-
tive segments and the financial services business at 
Group level."
"Liabilities from leasing contracts for which the 
Mercedes-Benz Group acts as a lessee are not included 
in the value-at-risk of the interest rate risk."
"Average 
exposure has been computed on an end-of-quarter 
basis."
"In the course of 2023, changes in the value at risk of 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments were pri-
marily determined by the development of interest rate 
volatilities."
"Hedge accounting 
When designating derivative hedging instruments, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group generally applies a hedge ratio 
of 1."
"The respective volumes, interest curves, curren-
cies and maturity dates of the underlying transaction 
and the hedging instrument are generally matched."
"In 
the case of combined derivative financial instruments 
for interest currency hedges, the cross-currency basis 
spread is not designated into the hedge relationship, 
but deferred as a hedging cost in other comprehensive 
income and recognized in profit or loss over the hedge 
term."
"The Group ensures an economic relationship 
between the underlying transaction and the hedging 
instrument by ensuring consistency of interest rates, 
maturity terms and nominal amounts."
"In the case of 
hedging for ABS transactions of private placements, 
the risk of the market interest rate component is partly 
protected, which historically covers on average more 
than 70% of the change in value of the total interest 
rate."
"The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed at the 
beginning and during the hedging relationship using the 
hypothetical derivative method."
"- No perfect match for individual parameters of the 
underlying hedged transactions and the hedging in-
struments used."
"- Premiums on hedging instruments for hedging ABS 
transactions."
"There were no material effects on earnings in the years 
2022 and 2023."
"Commodity-price risk 
The Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to the risk of 
changes in market prices (e.g."
"for raw materials and 
energy) in connection with procuring manufacturing 
supplies used in production."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
usually counteracts the risk of short-term fluctuations 
in market prices by means of short and medium-term 
price escalation clauses or fixing of purchase prices in 
the supply contracts."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group con-
cludes e.g."
"power purchase agreements for wind and 
solar energy in order to protect itself from fluctuations 
in energy prices and ensure long-term, sustainable 
procurement of electricity."
"A small portion of the raw-material price risk relating to 
the forecast procurement of precious metals was 
hedged with the use of derivative financial instruments."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group has decided to suspend 
these hedging strategies for precious metals until fur-
ther notice."
"The previously existing hedges expired in 
2023."
"The table Value at risk for exchange-rate risk, interest 
rate risk and commodity price risk shows the period-
end, high, low and average value-at-risk figures for the 
2022 portfolio of derivative financial instruments used 
to hedge commodity price risk."
"Average exposure has 
been computed on an end-of-quarter basis."
"The trans-
actions underlying the derivative financial instruments 
are not included in the value-at-risk presentation."
"These investments are not in-
cluded in a market risk assessment by the Group."
"Segment reporting 
Reported segments 
The Group comprises the segments Mercedes-Benz 
Cars, Mercedes-Benz Vans and Mercedes-Benz  
Mobility."
"The breakdown of the segments corresponds to the 
internal organizational and reporting structure."
"The 
vehicle segments develop and manufacture premium 
and luxury cars as well as vans."
"In addition to the Mer-
cedes-Benz brand, the brand portfolio of the Mer-
cedes-Benz Cars segment encompasses the brands 
Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach, as well as the 
G-Class product brand."
"Mercedes me provides access 
to the digital services of Mercedes-Benz Cars."
"At Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans, the vans are sold under the Mer-
cedes-Benz brand."
"Corresponding spare parts and 
accessories are also sold."
"The Mercedes-Benz Mobility segment supports the 
sales of the Mercedes-Benz Group’s automotive brands 
worldwide."
"Furthermore, Mercedes-Benz Mobility is 
active in the area of innovative and digital mobility 
services, seamless payment methods and the expan-
sion of the charging infrastructure."
"Reconciliation 
The reconciliation includes functions and services pro-
vided by the Group’s headquarters as well as by equity 
investments not allocated to the segments (e.g."
"Daim-
ler Truck Holding AG)."
"In addition, the reconciliation 
includes items at the corporate level and the effects on 
earnings of eliminating intra-Group transactions be-
tween the segments."
"Internal management and  
reporting structure 
The internal management and reporting structure at 
the Mercedes-Benz Group is principally based on the 
accounting policies according to IFRS that are de-
scribed in Note 1."
"The measure of the Group’s net profit or loss used by 
the Mercedes-Benz Group’s management and reporting 
structure is referred to as “EBIT”."
"EBIT comprises gross 
profit, selling and general administrative expenses, 
research and non-capitalized development costs, other 
operating income/expense, and the gains/losses on 
equity-method investments, as well as other financial 
income/expense."
"Intersegment revenue is principally recorded at prices 
that approximate market terms."
"Transactions between the segments are generally elim-
inated in the reconciliation."
"The elimination of effects 
connected with intra-Group transfers of equity invest-
ments principally takes place in the segments involved."
"The effects on earnings at the Group are normally rec-
ognized in the corresponding segment upon comple-
tion of the external transaction."
"Some simplifications 
have been made in the segment reporting with regard 
to accounting for leasing agreements in connection 
with intra-Group transactions."
Segment assets principally comprise all assets.
"The 
assets of the Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz 
Vans segments exclude income tax assets, assets  
from defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment benefit plans, and certain financial in-
struments (including liquidity)."
"The Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Vans 
reporting segments’ liabilities exclude income tax liabil-
ities, liabilities from pensions and similar obligations 
and certain financial instruments (including financing 
liabilities)."
"The residual-value risks associated with the Group’s 
operating leases and receivables from financial ser-
vices are generally borne by the segments which manu-
factured the leased vehicles."
"Risk sharing is based on 
agreements between Mercedes-Benz Cars, Mercedes-
Benz Vans and Mercedes-Benz Mobility; the terms vary 
by segment and geographic region."
"Non-current assets consist of intangible assets, prop-
erty, plant and equipment, and equipment on operating 
leases."
"Capital expenditures for intangible assets and property, 
plant and equipment reflect the cash-effective addi-
tions to these intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment insofar as they do not relate to capitalized 
borrowing costs or goodwill."
"Depreciation and amortization may also include im-
pairments insofar as they do not relate to goodwill 
impairment according to IAS 36."
"Amortization of capitalized borrowing costs is not in-
cluded in the amortization of intangible assets or de-
preciation of property, plant and equipment."
"The line item Other reconciling items includes further 
items at the corporate level."
"In the prior year, the line 
item included expenses in connection with the sale of 
individual investments and business activities to Daim-
ler Truck Holding AG or its subsidiaries."
"The reconciliation of segment assets and liabilities to 
relevant amounts for the Group is shown in the next 
table."
2 Unless these are attributable to Mercedes-Benz Mobility.
"Revenue from external customers and non-current 
assets by region are shown in the following table."
"Capital management  
Net assets and value added represent the basis for 
capital management at the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"Alt-
hough individual companies in the Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility segment are subject to the capital require-
ments of the respective banking supervision, Mer-
cedes-Benz Group AG is not subject to external mini-
mum capital requirements."
"The assets and liabilities of the segments in accord-
ance with IFRS provide the basis for the determination 
of net assets at Group level."
"Mercedes-Benz Cars and 
Mercedes-Benz Vans are accountable for the net oper-
ating assets; all assets, liabilities and provisions for 
which they are responsible for in day-to-day operations 
are therefore allocated to them."
"Performance meas-
urement at Mercedes-Benz Mobility is on an equity 
basis, in line with the usual practice in the banking 
business."
"Net assets at Group level additionally include 
assets and liabilities from income taxes as well as other 
corporate items and eliminations."
"Average annual net assets are calculated on the basis 
of average quarterly net assets."
"The average quarterly 
net assets are calculated as an average of the net as-
sets at the beginning and the end of the quarter."
2  Unless allocated to the segments.
3 To the extent not allocated to Mercedes-Benz Mobility.
"The cost of capital of the Group’s average net assets is 
reflected in value added."
"Value added shows the extent 
to which the Group achieves or exceeds the minimum 
return requirements of the shareholders, thus creating 
additional value."
"The required rate of return on net 
assets, and thus the cost of capital rate, is derived from 
the minimum rates of return that equity investors and 
lenders expect on their invested capital."
"In the report-
ing year, the cost of capital rate used for the internal 
capital management amounted to 9% after taxes."
"The objective of capital management is to increase 
value added, among other things, by optimizing the 
cost of capital."
"This is achieved on the one hand by 
optimizing the net assets, e.g."
"working capital, which is 
within the operational responsibility of the segments."
"In addition, taking into account legal regulations, the 
Mercedes-Benz Group strives to optimize the costs and 
risks of its capital structure, and consequently, the cost 
of capital rate."
"An example of this is an appropriate 
level of liquidity, oriented towards the operational re-
quirements."
"Earnings per share 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share 
is based on net profit attributable to shareholders of 
Mercedes-Benz Group AG."
"The profit attributable to 
shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG (basic and 
diluted) amounts to €14,261 million (2022: €14,501 mil-
lion)."
"The weighted average number of shares out-
standing (basic and diluted) amounts to 1,059.6 million 
issued shares (2022: 1,069.8 million issued shares)."
"The decrease in the weighted average number of 
shares outstanding is due to the share buyback pro-
gramme resolved by the Board of Management on  
16 February 2023."
"Related-party disclosures 
Related parties (companies or persons) are deemed to 
be associated companies, joint ventures and unconsol-
idated subsidiaries as well as persons who exercise  
a significant influence on the financial and business 
policy of the Mercedes-Benz Group."
"The latter category 
includes all persons in key positions and their close 
family members."
"At the Mercedes-Benz Group, those persons are the 
members of the Board of Management and of the  
Supervisory Board and their close family members."
"Business transactions with related parties are generally 
carried out at market terms."
"(BBAC), which are allocated to the 
Mercedes-Benz Cars segment."
"There are numerous relationships in the scope of ordi-
nary business between the Mercedes-Benz Group and 
Daimler Truck, for example, the purchase and sale of 
goods and services and leasing agreements."
"In addi-
tion, there is an interim provision of services by corpo-
rate functions that are included under other operating 
income."
"The leased equipment of the Mercedes-Benz Mobility 
segment includes commercial vehicles produced by 
Daimler Truck which have been acquired from external 
dealers or other third parties not related to the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group."
"Mercedes-Benz Mobility usually 
receives a residual-value guarantee from Daimler Truck 
for this leased equipment in connection with the obli-
gation to return the respective commercial vehicles to 
Daimler Truck."
"At 31 December 2023 this guarantee 
was €37 million (31 December 2022: €66 million)."
"Additionally, the Mercedes-Benz Group will continue 
the leasing and sales-financing business for Daimler 
Truck’s commercial vehicles in some markets."
"To this 
end, Mercedes-Benz Mobility acquires these vehicles 
from Daimler Truck and leases them to the end cus-
tomers."
"Insofar as a mandatory vehicle return to Daim-
ler Truck has been agreed, a leasing contract (head 
lease) between Mercedes-Benz Mobility and Daimler 
Truck is shown."
"The contract between Mercedes-Benz 
Mobility and the end customer constitutes a sublease 
in this respect."
"These right-
of-use assets were depreciated as planned by 
€217 million in 2023 (2022: €399 million)."
"In addition, the Mercedes-Benz Group holds a minority 
interest of €207 million (31 December 2022: €162 mil-
lion) in real estate companies controlled by Daimler 
Truck Group, which is shown as debt instruments in 
other financial assets."
"At 31 December 2023, off-balance-sheet obligations to 
the Daimler Truck Group amounted to €110 million 
(31 December 2022: €310 million)."
"Joint ventures 
On 12 May 2022, Mercedes-Benz AG signed an agree-
ment with PSA Automobiles SA, Opel Automobile 
GmbH, Saft EV SAS and Saft Groupe to acquire a 
33.33% stake in Automotive Cells Company SE (ACC) 
through a capital contribution of approximately 
€390 million."
"The Group also committed itself to the 
provision of further funds up to €410 million."
"The in-
vestment in the European battery cell manufacturer 
ACC was made in order to promote the development 
and production of high-performance battery cells and 
modules in the course of the transformation to a sus-
tainable business strategy."
"The shares in the joint ven-
ture ACC are included in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements using the equity method and are allocated 
to the Mercedes-Benz Cars segment."
"The other 
shareholders also confirmed that they are obligated to 
provide additional funds."
"Moreover, in March 2024, ACC drew down €105 million 
of the total contractually committed funds of €867 
million."
"As a result, the carrying amount of ACC in-
creased accordingly."
"As of 31 December 2023, there are off-balance-sheet 
obligations of €256 million (31 December 2022: 
€157 million)."
"On 1 July 2022, an agreement became effective in fa-
vour of smart Automobile Co., Ltd."
"(smart), a joint 
venture of Mercedes-Benz AG and Zhejiang Geely Hold-
ing Group Co., Ltd."
"This agreement obliges the share-
holders to provide financial support up to a maximum 
amount of €573 million each in the event that smart is 
not able to perform its payment obligations under a 
syndicated loan agreement."
"smart is allocated to the 
Mercedes-Benz Cars segment."
"Note 13 provides further details of the business activi-
ties of the significant associated companies."
"Related persons 
Throughout the world, the Group has business relation-
ships with numerous entities that are customers and/or 
suppliers of the Group."
"Those customers and/or sup-
pliers include companies that have a connection with 
some of the members of the Board of Management or 
of the Supervisory Board and close family members of 
those board members of Mercedes-Benz Group AG or 
of its subsidiaries."
"Board of Management and Supervi-
sory Board members and close family members of 
those board members may also purchase goods and 
services from Mercedes-Benz Group AG or its subsidi-
aries as customers."
"Mr. Stefan Pierer has been a member of the Superviso-
ry Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-
Benz AG since May 2023."
"The Mercedes-Benz Group 
maintains supply and service relationships with some 
companies in the Pierer Group."
"The Pierer Group in-
cludes the SHW Group, a global automotive supplier, as 
well as other companies."
"In August 2023, Stefan Pierer 
also acquired 100% of the shares of Leoni AG, an inter-
national automotive supplier."
"The table Transactions 
with related parties shows the information on the vol-
ume of goods and services supplied by these compa-
nies in the line Companies controlled by related per-
sons."
"Contributions to plan assets 
Mercedes-Benz Pension Trust e.V."
"manages the plan 
assets on a fiduciary basis to cover pension obligations 
in Germany and is therefore a related party of the Mer-
cedes-Benz Group."
"Another related party is Mercedes-
Benz Pensionsfonds AG."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG 
bears non-significant expenses and provides services 
for both companies."
"See also Note 22 for further infor-
mation."
"The spin off and 
hive-down of the Daimler commercial vehicle business 
in 2021 resulted in a subsequent liability relationship 
outside the Group."
"The stipulations existing in this context, in particular on 
the procedure for regulating the internal settlements 
between the participating legal entities, are laid down 
in the hive-down agreement of 25 March 2019."
"The aforementioned period is ten years for pension 
obligations based on the German Company Pensions 
Act (BetrAVG) that existed before the hive-down took 
effect."
"Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Mercedes-Benz 
AG do not expect any outflow of liquidity from the re-
spective other legal entity due to the plan assets being 
available in a sufficient volume."
"According to the current appraisal, an actual claim with 
respect to the subsequent liability relationship be-
tween the entities is considered to be unlikely."
"Remuneration of the members 
of the Board of Management and 
the Supervisory Board 
The table below shows the remuneration granted dur-
ing 2023 to the members of the Board of Management 
and the Supervisory Board who were active in 2023."

tions in the Supervisory Board."
"The members of the Board of Management of Mer-
cedes-Benz Group AG do not receive any remuneration 
for their board activities on the boards of the subsidiar-
ies."
"These activities are remunerated with the remuner-
ation at Mercedes-Benz Group AG."

"The pension provisions for former 
members of the Board of Management and their

"Individualized information on the remuneration of the 
members of the Board of Management and of the Su-
pervisory Board of Mercedes-Benz Group AG is dis-
closed in the Remuneration Report."
"Auditor fees  
The shareholders of Mercedes-Benz Group AG elected 
KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft as the ex-
ternal auditor at the Annual General Meeting held on 3

"The following table shows the fees for ser-
vices provided by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesell-
schaft and the companies of the worldwide KPMG net-
work to Mercedes-Benz Group AG, the consolidated 
subsidiaries and the proportionately consolidated joint 
operations."
"Other attestation services were particularly provided 
for certifications and reviews of IT systems or in con-
nection with the issuance of comfort letters."
"Other 
services were mainly commissioned for process con-
sulting not relevant to accounting and for quality as-
surance."
"Events after the  
reporting period 
Review of future structure of Own Retail in Germany 
On 19 January 2024, the Mercedes-Benz Group an-
nounced a comprehensive review of the structures of

"The review is open-
ended as regards its outcome and will be conducted 
individually and step-by-step at each retail location."
"The Company expects the transformation process to 
take several years."
"Contract negotiations with potential 
buyers had not yet taken place as of the balance sheet

tion and liquidity and capital resources."
"Information on investments 
The statement of investments of the Group pursuant to 
Section 313 Subsection 2 Nos."
"1-6 of the German Com-
mercial Code (HGB) is presented in the following table."
"In general, cooperations without an equity interest are 
not reported."
"Information on equity and earnings and 
information on investments pursuant to Section 313 
Subsection 2 No."
"4 of the German Commercial Code 
(HGB) is omitted insofar as, pursuant to Section 313 
Subsection 3 Sentence 4 of the HGB, such information 
is of minor relevance for a fair presentation of the prof-
itability, liquidity and capital resources and financial 
position of the Group."
"In addition, the statement of 
investments indicates which consolidated companies 
make use of the exemption pursuant to Section 264 
Subsection 3 of the HGB and/or Section 264b of the

"In addition, we 
have audited the report on the situation of the Com-
pany and the Group (hereinafter referred to as “the 
combined management report”), of Mercedes-Benz 
Group AG for the financial year from January 1 to 
December 31, 2023."
"In accordance with the German legal regulations, we 
have not audited the content of the elements of the 
combined management report referred to in the “Other 
information” section of our auditor’s report."
"The combined management report includes cross-refer-
ences not foreseen by law that are marked as unau-
dited."
"In accordance with the German legal regulations, 
we have not audited the content of these cross-refer-
ences and the information to which these cross-refer-
ences relate."
"In all material respects, the combined man-
agement report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal 
requirements and appropriately presents the oppor-
tunities and risks of future development."
"Our opinion 
on the combined management report does not cover 
the elements of the combined management report 
referred to in the “Other information” section of our 
auditor’s report."
"The combined management report 
includes cross-references not foreseen by law that 
are marked as unaudited."
"Our opinion does not cover 
these cross-references and the information to which 
these cross-references relate."
"Pursuant to Section 322 paragraph 3 sentence 1 HGB, 
we declare that our audit has not led to any reserva-
tions relating to the legal compliance of the consoli-
dated financial statements and of the combined man-
agement report."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as the 
“EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German 
Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement 
Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschafts-
prüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW)."
"We performed the audit of the consolidated financial 
statements in supplementary compliance with the 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs)."
"Our respon-
sibilities under those requirements, principles and 
standards are further described in the “Auditor’s 
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Finan-
cial Statements and of the Combined Management 
Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are inde-
pendent of the group entities in accordance with the 
requirements of European law and German commercial 
and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other 
German professional responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with 
Article 10 paragraph 2 letter f) of the EU Audit Regula-
tion, we declare that we have not provided non-audit 
services prohibited under Article 5 paragraph 1 of the 
EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the evidence we 
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial 
statements and on the combined management report."
"There it is stated that the EU taxonomy Regu-
lation and the delegated acts promulgated for this 
includes wording and terms that are subject to consid-
erable uncertainty with regard to their interpretation 
and for which clarifications have not yet been pub-
lished in all cases."
"The legal representatives describe 
how they have carried out the necessary interpretation 
of the EU taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts 
promulgated for this."
"On account of the immanent risk 
that certain abstract legal terms can be interpreted in 
various ways, the conformity of the interpretation with 
the law is subject to uncertainty."
"Our opinions on the 
on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report has not been modified in 
this regard."
"Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our profes-
sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements for the finan-
cial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, 
and, in forming our opinion thereon, we do not provide 
a separate opinion on these matters."
"Impairment Risk on Operating Leases
Please refer with regard to the accounting policies and 
methods applied to the notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements in Note 1 “Significant accounting poli-
cies” and Note 2 “Accounting estimates and manage-
ment judgements”."
"Further information on the operating 
leases can be found in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements in Note 12 “Equipment on operat-
ing leases” and in the comments in the combined man-
agement report in the section entitled “Industry and 
business risks and opportunities”."
"An impairment risk exists with 
regard to these vehicles that is primarily dependent on 
the residual value achievable at the end of the lease."
"These future residual values are dependent on the situ-
ation in the used vehicle markets prevailing when the 
vehicles are returned."
"The future-oriented valuation is 
based on a number of discretionary assumptions."
"The 
risk for the financial statements is that any impairment 
losses will not be recognised or that the amounts rec-
ognised will be inadequate."
"We investigated and appraised the indications 
assumed by the Group for any need for an impairment 
loss and where necessary obtained an understanding of 
the write-downs calculated by the Mercedes-Benz 
Group."
"We have assessed the Mercedes-Benz Group’s 
evaluation with regard to the residual values achievable 
by the end of the terms of the leases."
"In this connec-
tion, we in particular critically reviewed the main influ-
encing factors, such as the expected number of returns 
from leasing, the current marketing results in order to 
assess the accuracy of the estimates and future vehicle 
model changes."
"For the significant US-market we fur-
thermore also audited the consistency of the assump-
tions made by the Mercedes-Benz Group with residual 
value forecasts by independent expert third parties."
"Valuation Allowances on Receivables 
from Financial Services
Please refer with regard to the accounting policies 
applied to the notes to the consolidated financial state-
ments in Note 2 “Accounting estimates and manage-
ment judgements”."
"The loss 
allowances on these receivables amounted at the 
reporting date to € 1,055 million."
"The calculation of the loss allowances is based on 
expected credit losses and therefore also includes 
expectations regarding the future."
"Recognition of the 
expected credit losses is carried out by means of a 
three-parameter procedure for the determination of 
loss allowances."
"Furthermore, macroeconomic sce-
narios (basis scenarios, optimistic and pessimistic sce-
narios) flow into the calculation, the identification of 
which to a high degree includes discretionary judge-
ments and uncertainties."
"The risk for the financial state-
ments is that the creditworthiness of customers and 
future cash flows is misjudged or that the calculation of 
the risk provision parameters is incorrect so that loss 
allowances are not recognised or are insufficient."
"We audited the appropriateness and effectiveness of 
the internal control system in relation to the risk models 
as well as the determination of the value-determining 
factors and the valuation allowances, also in part 
through recalculation."
"We also assessed the relevant IT 
systems and internal processes."
"Our audit focused on 
assessing the methodology used to determine and to 
calculate the probabilities of default and loss given 
default, which are derived from historical data."
"We took 
into account the current economic uncertainties in con-
nection with the effects of several geopolitical hotspots 
when testing the macroeconomic scenarios and the 
model assumptions made."
"Based on the results of a 
validation performed by Mercedes-Benz Mobility, we 
satisfied ourselves of the appropriateness of key risk 
provisioning parameters and assessed the parameter 
adjustments made to reflect current market conditions."
"In this context, we examined the data underlying the 
validations."
"Measurement of the Provision  
for Product Warranties
Please refer with regard to the accounting policies and 
methods applied to the notes to the consolidated finan-
cial statements in Note 1 “Significant accounting poli-
cies” and in Note 2 “Accounting estimates and manage-
ment judgements”."
"The risk for the consolidated financial statements
The provision for product warranties amounts to 
€ 6,399 million and is included in the provisions for 
other risks."
"Mercedes-Benz Group is exposed to claims arising from 
various types of product warranty claims or grants vari-
ous types of product guarantees under which it 
vouches for the defect-free functioning of a Mercedes-
Benz Group product sold or a service provided for a 
certain period of time."
"In order to confirm or reassess 
future warranty, guarantee and goodwill expenses, con-
tinuously updated information on the type and volume 
of damage that has occurred and its rectification is 
recorded and analysed at the level of division, model 
series, damage code and sales year."
"Significant uncertainty for the calculation of the provi-
sion arises with regard to the future loss event."
"The risk 
for the consolidated financial statements is that the 
provision is not properly measured."
"Our audit approach
Our audit procedures included among other things the 
evaluation of the process to calculate the provision for 
product warranties and the evaluation of the relevant 
assumptions and their derivation for the measurement 
of the provision."
"These include primarily assumptions 
on expected susceptibility to and the course of damage, 
and in addition the monetary value of the damage per 
vehicle based on actual warranty, guarantee and good-
will losses."
"Based on historical analyses, we assessed 
the accuracy of the forecasts of past warranty, guaran-
tee and goodwill costs."
"We also checked that updated 
assessments of the future repair costs and procedures 
were taken into account."
"We obtained an understanding 
for the underlying numbers of vehicles through the 
actual unit sales."
"Our observations
The calculation methods and the assumptions made are 
appropriate."
"Further information on legal proceedings 
can be found in Note 23 “Provisions for other risks”, in 
Note 30 “Legal proceedings” in the notes to the consol-
idated financial statements and in the combined man-
agement report in the section “Legal and tax risks and 
opportunities - Legal risks”."
"Product-related 
proceedings involve, among other things, claims 
asserted in part by way of a class action due to possi-
ble vehicle defects."
"If the outcome of such legal pro-
ceedings is detrimental to the Mercedes-Benz Group, 
the Group may be required to pay substantial compen-
satory and punitive damages or fines."
"In addition, ser-
vice actions, recall campaigns or other costly actions 
may have to be undertaken."
"Whether the recognition of a provision and, if so, in 
what amount it is necessary on account of legal pro-
ceedings is dependent to a high degree on discretion-
ary estimates and assumptions by the legal representa-
tives."
"In view of this and the monetary amounts 
involved with regard to the risks, the following legal 
proceedings of the Mercedes-Benz Group are in our 
opinion of particular importance."
"In addition, 
the plaintiffs allege that consumers were deceived in 
connection with advertising claims for Mercedes-Benz 
diesel vehicles."
"In Germany, a large number of customers of diesel 
vehicles are suing for damages or cancellation of pur-
chase contracts."
"They claim that the diesel vehicles 
were equipped with unauthorised defeat devices and/
or had unacceptably high emission or consumption 
values."
"In addition, investors have filed claims for damages in 
Germany due to the alleged violation of capital market 
disclosure regulations and have also claimed dam-
ages out of court."
"The investors allege that the 
Mercedes-Benz Group did not immediately publish 
insider information in connection with the emissions 
behaviour of its Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles and 
also made false and misleading public statements."
"They also claim that the purchase price of the finan-
cial instruments they acquired (in particular 
Mercedes-Benz Group shares; formerly Daimler 
shares) would have been lower if the Mercedes-Benz 
Group had reported as required."
"The prereq-
uisite for the recognition of provisions for legal pro-
ceedings is that a current external obligation exists that 
is likely to lead to an outflow of resources embodying 
economic benefits and can be reliably estimated."
"The 
amount of the provisions is determined on the basis of 
the best possible estimate of the obligation by the legal 
representatives as at the balance sheet date."
"The rec-
ognition and measurement of the recognized provisions 
for the legal proceedings are based on discretionary 
estimates and assumptions by the legal representatives."
"There is a risk for the financial statements that the pro-
visions for the legal proceedings are not recognized or 
not recognized to a sufficient extent."
"Our audit approach
Our audit procedures included, on the one hand, an 
assessment of the process established by the company 
to ensure the identification of risks, the assessment of 
the outcome of the proceedings and the presentation of 
the legal proceedings in the financial statements."
"Sec-
ondly, we held discussions with the internal legal 
department and other departments familiar with the 
matters, external advisors and lawyers of the company 
in order to obtain an explanation of the developments 
and the reasons that led to the corresponding assess-
ments."
"In addition, we assessed the underlying docu-
ments and minutes as well as the calculations for the 
respective provisions."
"We were provided with the legal 
representatives’ assessment of the developments in the 
aforementioned areas in written form by the company."
"We also interviewed the legal representatives of the 
company."
"As at the balance sheet date, assessments by 
external lawyers were available on the material pro-
ceedings, which support the risk assessment made by 
the legal representatives."
"Where agreement has since been reached on individual 
matters, we compared the amounts originally estimated 
with the final obligations to obtain an understanding of 
the quality of the estimates."
"Finally, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclo-
sures on the aforementioned legal proceedings in the 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and in 
the combined management report."
"Our observations
The judgement-based estimates and assumptions of the 
legal representatives are appropriate."
"Other information
The legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are 
responsible for the other information."
"In accordance with our engagement, we have per-
formed a separate financial audit of these disclosures."
"With regard to the nature, scope and results of this 
assurance engagement, we draw attention to our assur-
ance report dated March 14, 2024."
"The other information also includes the remaining parts 
of the annual report."
"The other information does not 
include the annual financial statements, the combined 
management report information audited for content 
and our auditor’s report thereon."
"Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements 
and on the combined management report do not cover 
the other information, and consequently we do not 
express an opinion or any other form of assurance con-
clusion thereon."
"If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement of this other infor-
mation, we are required to report that fact."
"We have 
nothing to report in this regard."
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the 
legal representatives are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They are 
also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsi-
ble for financial reporting based on the going concern 
basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liqui-
date the Group or to cease operations, or there is no 
realistic alternative but to do so."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the 
Group`s financial reporting process for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and the com-
bined management report."
"Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individu-
ally or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be 
expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial state-
ments and this combined management report."
"We exercise professional judgement and maintain pro-
fessional scepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material 
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collu-
sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresenta-
tions, or the override of internal control."
"–	 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used by management and the reasonableness of esti-
mates made by management and related disclosures."
"If we conclude that a material uncer-
tainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the con-
solidated financial statements and in the combined 
management report or, if such disclosures are inade-
quate, to modify our respective opinions."
"Our conclu-
sions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to 
the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future 
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to 
be able to continue as a going concern."
"–	 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding 
the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express opinions on the 
consolidated financial statements and on the com-
bined management report."
"We are responsible for the 
direction, supervision and performance of the group 
audit."
We remain solely responsible for our opinions.
"–	 
perform audit procedures on the prospective infor-
mation presented by the legal representatives in the 
combined management report."
"On the basis of suffi-
cient appropriate audit evidence, we evaluate, in par-
ticular, the significant assumptions used by the legal 
representatives as a basis for the prospective infor-
mation and evaluate the proper derivation of the pro-
spective information from these assumptions."
"We do 
not express a separate opinion on the prospective 
information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future 
events will differ materially from the prospective 
information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance 
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, includ-
ing any significant deficiencies in internal control that 
we identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged 
with governance, we determine those matters that were 
of most significance in the audit of the consolidated 
financial statements of the current period and are 
therefore the key audit matters."
"We describe these 
matters in our auditor’s report unless laws or other legal 
regulations preclude public disclosure of the matter."
"Our responsibility in accordance there-
with is further described below."
"Our audit firm applies

for Quality Management in Audit Firms (IDW QMS 1

"The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the 
process of preparing the ESEF documents as part of the 
financial reporting process."
"Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the ESEF documents are free from material 
intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the 
requirements of Section 328 paragraph 1 HGB."
"We exer-
cise professional judgement and maintain professional 
scepticism throughout the assurance work."
"–	 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant 
to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to 
design assurance procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness 
of these controls."
"–	 
evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, 
i.e."
"whether the file made available containing the 
ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Dele-
gated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, as amended as at the 
reporting date, on the technical specification for this 
electronic file."
"–	 
evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an 
XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the 
audited consolidated financial statements and the 
audited combined management report."
"We were engaged by 
the Supervisory Board on June 21, 2023."
"We have been 
the group auditor of Mercedes-Benz Group AG without 
interruption since the financial year 1998."
"We declare that the opinions expressed in this auditor’s 
report are consistent with the additional report to the 
audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit 
Regulation (longform audit report)."
"Other matter –  
Use of the Auditor’s Report
Our auditor´s report must always be read together with 
the audited consolidated financial statements and the 
audited combined management report as well as the 
examined ESEF documents."
"In particular, the ESEF report 
and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be 
used solely together with the examined ESEF docu-
ments made available in electronic form."
