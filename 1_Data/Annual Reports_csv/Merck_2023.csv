"The year 
2023 provided yet another opportunity to demonstrate our resilience to the world."
"Despite a difficult global 
macroeconomic environment and the geopolitical situation, our Group performed robustly."
"Once again, we demonstrated the competitive strengths of our people, the diversification of our business 
sectors, and our global footprint."
"In our Life Science business, demand declined as expected in 2023 due to the 
end of the Covid-19 pandemic."
"Pronounced destocking by customers within Process Solutions has also been 
longer in duration than expected."
"In parallel, our Electronics business faced a prolonged downcycle in 
Semiconductor Solutions and the Display Solutions unit was affected by low customer demand."
"The strong performance of our Healthcare business sector mainly offset these temporary, industry-wide 
challenges."
"In particular, our new products experienced robust growth."
"Full-year net sales of our multiple 
sclerosis medicine Mavenclad® exceeded US$ 1 billion for the first time, joining our cancer medicine Erbitux®, 
which maintained its blockbuster status for the second year in a row."
"Our immuno-oncology drug Bavencio®, to 
which we regained sole ownership rights on June 30, 2023, generated organic net sales growth of 23.4%."
"This 
was complemented by the solid performance of both our Fertility and our Cardiovascular, Metabolism, and 
Endocrinology franchises."
"The competitive strength of our global business footprint was demonstrated by moderate Group exposure to 
localized economic trends in 2023."
"Our business operations in Asia-Pacific, North America and Europe as well as 
other geographic regions made important financial contributions."
"Overall, Group net sales of € 21.0 billion were about at the mid-point of the absolute guidance range."
"Due to 
the aforementioned factors as well as negative foreign exchange effects and inflationary pressures, EBITDA pre 
in 2023 was also within our guidance range at € 5.9 billion, albeit at the lower end of the corridor."
"We are grateful to our approximately 63,000 employees around the world for their exceptional dedication and 
resilience and would like to thank our many partners and suppliers for their important contributions to this 
performance."
"Furthermore, in recognition of the contribution of shareholders, we will propose to the Annual 
General Meeting a dividend of € 2.20 per share for 2023."
"We remain firmly positioned to return to growth in 
2024 and generate long-term, sustainable value for 
our owners, shareholders, customers, patients, 
employees, and society."

Looking forward, we expect that global economic and geopolitical challenges will continue to adversely affect 
our activities through 2024."
"However, based on current forecasts, we anticipate a gradual return to organic 
sales growth during the year."
"We expect our Life Science business sector to recover in the course of the year with the expected end of the 
destocking phase within Process Solutions on the one hand and improving conditions in Science & Lab Solutions 
on the other hand."
"Within our Healthcare business sector, growth rates should begin to normalize and more 
closely align with our mid-term targets."
"And within our Electronics business sector, we expect to benefit from 
an upswing in customer demand for Semiconductor Solutions as the market gradually recovers."
"Looking beyond 2024, our Group remains firmly positioned for long-term growth and impact as a leading 
science and technology company with a clear purpose to advance human progress."
"In addition to favorable 
macrotrends such as the digital transformation of markets by generative AI and machine learning technologies, 
many other forces are expected to drive growth across each of our three sectors."
"They include novel drug 
modalities in Life Science, growing patient needs for cancer, neurological and immunological treatments in 
Healthcare, and AI-enabling chips and high-performance computing demanding more and novel materials in 
Electronics."
"Our teams are closely monitoring these and other trends to help us anticipate potential scenarios 
and adapt with speed and agility to protect or expand our competitive positions."
"We continue to make strategic investments, enter collaborations, and adapt our businesses in order to 
constantly improve our competitive position and anticipate emerging market needs even more proactively."
"In 
Germany, the United States, Switzerland, China, the United Kingdom, Korea, and other countries across our 
global network, we invested significantly in new and upgraded sites and capabilities."
"With these and other 
significant capital expenditure projects, we are striving to move even closer and become more responsive to 
customers and patients worldwide."
"We assume that this overall momentum in operational expenditure will 
continue through 2025 and beyond."
"However, we reserve the flexibility to respond to further market changes."
"Despite the disappointing news in December 2023 that the Phase III clinical trials of evobrutinib did not meet 
their primary endpoints, we remain confident in the position of our Healthcare business sector as a global 
specialty innovator."
"Boosted by 
various in-licensing of external innovation, including those announced in 2023, such as with Hengrui and 
Abbisko, we aim to introduce one new product or major indication every 1.5 years on average."
"Finally, I am pleased by the significant strides being made to achieve our three core sustainability targets."
"By 
2030, we aim to have fully integrated sustainability into our value chains and contributed to human progress 
for more than one billion people through sustainable science and technology."
"And by 2040, we expect to 
achieve climate-neutrality and significantly reduce our resource consumption."
"After entering into virtual power 
purchase agreements in 2023, renewable energy is expected to cover 100% of our current electricity purchases 
in Europe, more than 90% in North America, and 70% worldwide from 2025."
"As you continue to read this Annual Report, you will see that we remain firmly positioned to both return to 
growth in 2024 and generate long-term, sustainable value for our owners, shareholders, customers, patients, 
employees, and society."
"On behalf of the Executive Board, I thank you and all our other shareholders for your ongoing trust and support."

 MeRck Shares
At a glance 
The stock markets got off to a restrained start in 2023 before finishing strongly, with some indices hitting 
record levels in December as interest rate concerns eased."
"There was a significant level of sector divergence 
with subdued performance in Life Sciences and Pharma."
"Consequently, our share price performance was 
dampened during 2023."
"The resilience of our multi-industry business model was demonstrated with Healthcare largely offsetting 
market-driven challenges in Electronics and Life Science."
"Despite the financial results, our share price declined 
by around 20% in the course of the year."
"Merck shares underperformed compared with the DAX® index of 
German blue-chip companies, which rose by around 20% over the year."
"Our share performance correlated 
strongly to the share performance of the life sciences industry across the year and tracked the index (-3%) 
until the December evobrutinib announcement."
"In comparison, the index for the pharmaceutical industry 
outperformed Merck shares, rising by almost 5%."
"The semiconductor industry index rose by around 65% driven 
by a handful of chip developers and their products for artificial intelligence applications."
"Merck shares closed at 
€ 144.10 on December 29, 2023 (2022: € 180.90)."
"The first six months were heavily influenced by uncertainties tied to the continued economic recovery, inflation, 
rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions."
"The Covid-19 pandemic business continued to decline, which 
created a difficult environment in the life science market."
"Moreover, customers of the Life Science business 
sector mainly focused on cash preservation as well as working capital optimization, in light of high interest 
rates."
"While the semiconductor market is preparing for artificial intelligence fueled growth, it has not yet 
translated into volume growth for the materials sector."
"The existing portfolio of Healthcare had a strong year; 
however, the negative results of the Phase III trials of evobrutinib had a share price impact in December."
"Taken 
together, these factors explain why our share price underperformed the DAX® and relevant sector indices in 
2023."
"At approximately 329,000 shares per day, the average daily trading volume of Merck shares in 2023 was up 
around 2% on the prior-year figure of around 321,000."
"This meant Merck shares bucked the general trend of 
lower turnover on German securities trading platforms in 2023 compared with the previous year."
"Our shareholder structure remained largely stable in 2023 compared with the previous year: Europe continues 
to account for the largest proportion of the free float at around half, followed by the United States with around 
29%."
"Compared with 2022, the proportion of the value-oriented investors fell slightly in favor of growth 
oriented investors and GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investors."
"The top five investors held around 24% 
of the free float at the end of 2023, up around two percentage points on the previous year."
"In 2023, our Executive Board and Investor Relations team held over 1,000 discussions with investors on topics 
such as strategy, the business model, business performance, corporate governance, and sustainability at our 
company during investor conferences, roadshows, and conference calls."

only by creating added value for society."
"Through our innovative and high-quality products, we want to help 
meet global challenges."
"At the same time, these types of products secure our financial performance capability."
Responsible action is an integral part of our company culture.
"This also includes respecting the interests of our 
employees, customers, investors, and society."
Safety and ethics matter just as much to us as business success.
"We mitigate ethical, economic, environmental, 
and social risks as far as possible."
"From the early stages of development through to disposal, we keep an eye 
on the entire life cycle of a product."
We apply strict sustainability standards to our procurement activities.
"During product manufacture, it is important to us to keep the environmental impact as low as possible, which is 
why safe production, high environmental standards and strict quality management are of course so important 
to us."
"By supplying products that meet extensive sustainability criteria, we also help other companies to 
achieve their sustainability goals."

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."
"Overall, our sustainability strategy is centered on seven focus areas 
within which we are realizing numerous initiatives and projects today and tomorrow, measuring our progress as 
we go."
"Refining the sustainability strategy 
In 2023, we revised our sustainability strategy, which we had communicated in 2020."
"In particular, we 
sharpened the second goal: Under the new heading “Partnering for sustainable business impact”, we want to 
strengthen our focus on the social aspects in our value chains and embed sustainability more comprehensively 
into our decision-making processes."
"Therefore, in addition to the existing focus area “Sustainable and 
transparent supply chain”, we are now also working on the new focus areas “Sustainability in our ways of 
working and decision-making” and “Our people and communities; providing a diverse and inclusive 
environment”."
"For the third goal, “Reducing our ecological footprint”, we modified two of our key indicators for 
waste and water."
"The two new indicators, which are valid as of 2024, use more common metrics and also 
include circular economy criteria."
We use 14 key indicators to record and assess our progress towards achieving our sustainability goals.
"Our 
annual Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Board members and senior executives contains a 
sustainability factor."
"We use it to measure performance over a period of three years based on selected key 
indicators for each of our three sustainability goals."
"Details on how this sustainability factor is calculated can be 
found in the “Compensation Report”."
"In 2023, the company tied 15% of variable employee compensation to 
sustainability parameters for the first time."
"We are in the process of transforming the company and are integrating sustainability into the innovation 
process and all parts of the value chain."
"It is our aim to decouple the growth of our businesses from negative 
environmental impacts."
"More information on sustainability topics can be found in the “Non-Financial 
Statement”, which is also part of the management report."
"Our diversified and profitable business activities 
form the basis for our strong and sustainable cash flow generation capacity."
"Moreover, we have several funding 
resources in place."
A € 2.5 billion syndicated loan facility is in place until 2028 to cover unexpected cash needs.
This credit line is a backup facility that is intended to be used in exceptional circumstances only.
We also agreed upon several bilateral loan facilities.
"In addition, we have a commercial paper program with a 
volume of € 2.5 billion at our disposal."
"Within the scope of this program, we can issue short-term commercial 
paper with a maturity of up to one year."
The bond market also represents an important source of financing.
"The most recent bond issue took place in 
June 2022 (€ 1.0 billion bond issue)."
"The use of various instruments provides a broad financing basis and 
addresses different investor groups."
"Maintaining long-term and reliable business relations with a core group of banks 
We work mainly with a well-diversified, financially stable, and reliable group of banks."
"Due to our long-term 
business approach, bank relationships typically last for many years and are characterized by professionalism 
and trust."
"The banking group consists of banks with strong capabilities and expertise in various products and 
geographical regions."
"We regard these banks as strategic partners and involve them in important financing 
transactions accordingly."
"Strong investment-grade rating 
The rating of our creditworthiness by external rating agencies is an important indicator of financial stability."
"A strong investment-grade rating is an important cornerstone of our financial policy as it safeguards access to 
attractive financial conditions on the capital markets."
"In November 2023, our ratings were confirmed by Moody’s (A3, stable outlook) and Standard & Poor’s (A, 
stable outlook)."
"We discontinued our Scope rating (previously: A, stable outlook) in December 2023."
"Sustainable dividend policy 
We are pursuing a sustainable dividend policy."
"Provided the economic environment develops in a stable 
manner, the current dividend represents the minimum level for future dividend proposals."
"Our dividend policy 
will follow business development and earnings increases over the coming years."
"However, dividend growth 
could deviate, for example, within the scope of restructuring or in the event of significant global economic 
developments."
We aim for a target corridor of 20% to 25% of earnings per share pre.

such as rebates or discounts."
"Net sales are the main indicator of our business growth and therefore an 
important parameter of external as well as internal performance measurement."
"In addition, organic sales 
growth compared with the target is used for internal performance management."
"Organic sales growth shows 
the percentage change in net sales versus a comparative period, adjusted for exchange rate and portfolio 
effects."
"Exchange rate effects may arise as a result of foreign exchange fluctuation between the functional non-
euro currency of a consolidated company and the reporting currency (euro)."
"By contrast, portfolio effects reflect 
sales changes due to acquisitions and divestments of consolidated companies or businesses."
"To permit a better understanding of the underlying operational performance, the operating 
result is adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, impairment losses and reversals of impairment 
losses, as well as adjustments."
"These adjustments are restricted to the following categories: integration 
expenses, IT expenses for certain projects, restructuring expenses, gains/losses on the divestment of 
businesses, acquisition expenses, and other adjustments."
"The classification of specific income and expenses as 
adjustments follows clear rules and is subject to strict governance at the Group level."
"Within the scope of 
internal performance management, EBITDA pre permits process efficiency increases without influencing the 
performance of the operating business through exceptional items or restructuring expenses."
"The following table 
shows the composition of EBITDA pre in fiscal 2023 compared with the previous year."
"The IFRS figures have 
been modified to reflect the elimination of adjustments included in the respective functional costs."
"2 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); EBITDA corresponds to operating result (EBIT) adjusted by depreciation, 
amortization, impairment losses, and reversals of impairment losses."

Operating cash flow (OCF) 
Operating cash flow results from Merck’s current business activities and describes the cash generated from 
operating activities."
"It is influenced mainly by EBITDA pre, income tax, the financial result and changes in net 
working capital."
Adjustments according to definition above.

Investments and value management 
Sustainable value creation is essential to secure the long-term success of the company."
"To optimize the 
allocation of financial resources, we use a defined set of parameters as criteria for prioritizing investment 
opportunities and portfolio decisions."
"Net present value (NPV) 
The main criterion for prioritizing investment opportunities is net present value."
"It is based on the discounted 
cash flow method and is calculated as the sum of the discounted free cash flows over the duration of a project."
"The weighted average cost of capital (WACC), representing the weighted average of the cost of equity and cost 
of debt, is used as the discount rate."
"Different markups are applied to the WACC depending on the nature and 
location of the respective project."
"Internal rate of return (IRR) 
The internal rate of return is a further important criterion for the assessment of acquisition projects and 
investments in property, plant and equipment, as well as intangible assets."
"It is the discount rate that makes 
the present value of all future free cash flows equal to the initial investment or the purchase price of an 
acquisition."
"A project adds value if the internal rate of return is higher than the weighted cost of capital 
including markups."
"Return on capital employed (ROCE) 
In addition to NPV and IRR, return on capital employed is an important metric for the assessment of investment 
projects when looking at individual accounting periods."
"It is calculated as the adjusted operating result pre 
(EBIT pre) divided by the sum of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade accounts receivable, 
trade accounts payable, and inventories."
"Payback period 
An additional parameter for assessing investments in property, plant & equipment, and intangible assets is the 
payback period, which indicates the time in years after which an investment will generate positive net cash 
flow."
"Merck value added (MEVA) 
Merck value added gives information about the financial value created over a period of time."
"Added value is 
created when the return on capital employed (ROCE) of the company or the business is higher than the 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)."
"MEVA metrics provide us with a powerful tool to weigh investment 
and spending decisions against capital requirements and investors’ expectations."
"The use of a theoretical 
number of shares takes into account the fact that the general partner’s capital is not represented by shares."
"As 
an alternative comparison, we also report earnings per share pre, which are adjusted for the effects of 
integration expenses, IT expenses for selected projects, restructuring expenses, profits/losses from the 
divestment of businesses, acquisition expenses, and other adjustments."
"Amortization of acquired intangible 
assets is also adjusted for."
"The adjustment excludes impairment losses on intangible assets for acquired 
research and development (R&D) projects below a threshold value of € 50 million."
"Income tax is calculated on 
the basis of the Group’s underlying tax rate."
"The following table presents the reconciliation of net income to net 
income pre for the calculation of EPS pre."
"Dividend ratio 
We pursue a reliable dividend policy with a target payout ratio based on EPS pre (see definition above) with the 
aim of ensuring an attractive return for our shareholders."
"Credit rating 
The rating of our creditworthiness by external agencies is an important indicator of our ability to raise debt 
capital at attractive market conditions."
"The capital market makes use of the assessments published by 
independent rating agencies in order to assist debt providers in estimating the risks associated with a financial 
instrument."
We are currently assessed by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s.
"The most important factor for the 
credit rating is the ability to repay debt, which is determined in particular by the ratio of operating cash flow to 
net- or gross financial debt."
"High-Impact Culture 
Our culture should embody what unites us as well as the way in which we collaborate, lead and work as a team 
to achieve human progress and drive the company forward."
"We live our high-impact culture and through this, 
we measure our ability to attract, develop and retain the right people."
"Sustainability 
According to our sustainability strategy, which was revised in 2023, we aim to achieve human progress through 
sustainable science and technology, fully integrate sustainability into our value chains and reduce our ecological 
footprint."
"We are pursuing these goals in seven focus areas, within which we are realizing numerous initiatives 
and projects and measuring our progress."
"Diversity, equity and inclusion 
We know that diversity drives progress."
"It strengthens our ability to innovate and makes an essential 
contribution to our success in science and technology."
"We actively promote and measure the diversity of our 
leaders to create an inclusive culture that reflects our values and enables every employee to fulfill their 
potential."

"The 
convergence of several adverse developments (macroeconomics, capital constraints, declining Covid-19 
pandemic demand, and high customer inventory) has challenged growth of life science companies compared 
with previous years."
"Accordingly, the markets in which the Life Science business sector of Merck operates slowed down in 2023 
compared with 2022."
"According to the market research firm Frost & Sullivan, the market for laboratory 
products, which is relevant to our Science & Lab Solutions business unit, declined by -5.6% in 2023 (2022: 
4.2%)."
"This decline is due to a challenging macroeconomic outlook (declining GDP growth and persistent 
inflation) and a sustained slowdown of investment in early stage biotech companies (according to Citi Research, 
venture capital and IPOs remain below pandemic highs)."
"Once capital markets stabilize, spending on laboratory products is likely to increase again."
"In the pharma and 
biotech production market, in which our Process Solutions and Life Science Services business units are active, 
demand is driven by the development and manufacture of therapeutics and vaccines."
"According to the 
pharmaceutical market research firm IQVIA, the end market for biopharmaceuticals grew by 16.9% in 2023 
(2022: 14.5%) to € 496 billion (or 38.2% of the global pharmaceutical market)."
"The number of monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs) in phase I or II development grew by 17.4% (2022: 7.7%)."
"While the biopharmaceutical 
market grew in 2023, laboratory consumables and materials used in manufacturing were pre-purchased to a 
significant extent in 2022, resulting in high inventories among our customers."
"Healthcare 
In its latest study from September, IQVIA forecasts growth of 9.2% in 2023 (2022: 7.8%) for the global overall 
pharmaceutical market."
"After the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, the pharmaceutical market is expected 
to see still high growth rates benefitting from accelerated approval pathways and increased access to innovative 
medicines globally."
"This is balanced by further increasing cost containment measures and policies driving 
biosimilar and generics uptake as well as stricter price reviews and prescription controls."
The developments at a regional level follow the described trend.
"EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) grew by 
9.2% in 2023 (2022: 8.2%) with the EU5 (Germany, France, UK, Italy, and Spain) growing by 7.8% (2022: 
8.0%)."
"North America grew by 10.2% (2022: 9.6%) with the United States growing at a rate of 10.3% (2022: 
9.5%)."
"In absolute terms, the pharmaceutical market in the United States remains the biggest and most 
important market by far."
"Latin America achieved double-digit growth of 19.2% (2022: 12.5%) impacted by 
high inflation."
"This is followed by the Asia-Pacific region (excluding China and Japan) with 8.2% growth (2022: 
9.6%)."
"Despite continued extension of price regulations (for example, volume-based procurement), China 
returned to growth with 4.3% in 2023 (2022: -0.8%) due to the lifting of Covid-19 pandemic measures, 
increased access to innovative products and growing healthcare infrastructure)."
"Not only the growth of the pharmaceutical sector as a whole, but also the market development for 
biotechnologically produced active ingredients is relevant to our business."
"According to IQVIA, these products 
accounted for 38.2% of the global pharmaceutical market in 2023 (2022: 35.8%), thus continuing the increase 
in market share of recent years."
"The most important market for biological pharmaceuticals remains the United 
States, with a 64.2% share of global biopharmaceutical market volumes."
The developments in the therapeutic areas of relevance to Merck saw differing trends in the reporting year.
"The 
global market for type 2 diabetes, excluding the United States, followed the growth trend of previous years and 
accelerated growth, achieving 19.1% in 2023 (2022: 18.1%)."
"The therapeutic area of infertility grew 10.9% in 
the reporting year (2022: 4.2%)."
"Colorectal cancer declined by -0.1% in 2023 (2022: increase of 4.5%) due to 
biosimilar penetration."
"The growth trend in the market for multiple sclerosis therapies declined slightly 
compared with previous year level by -2.3% (2022: 2.5%), as new product launches are counteracted by the 
effect of generic competition."
"In particular, the growth in demand 
for semiconductor materials depends mainly on the wafer area produced for semiconductors."
"The silicon wafers 
required as raw materials are used as an indicator to estimate the demand for semiconductor materials overall."
"According to the global industry association SEMI (forecast as of Q3 2023), the delivered silicon wafer area 
experienced a -14.1% decline in 2023, following moderate growth in 2022 (3.9%)."
"The current cyclical industry 
downturn is amplified by macroeconomic challenges such as high interest rates and changing consumer buying 
behaviors with a preference for services."
"Semiconductor manufacturers have responded by reducing utilization 
rates to address excess inventory, resulting in declining demand for silicon wafers and related materials and 
services."
"Despite the current downturn, we foresee a positive outlook for the Electronics business sector."
"We anticipate 
that the semiconductor market will regain momentum in 2024, driven by AI solutions, the Internet of Things, 
and the increase in data volumes related to big data."
"With our Display Solutions business, we are a significant producer of liquid crystal mixtures and OLED materials 
for the display industry."
"After the Covid-19-pandemic-induced “stay at home boom,” the display industry 
underwent demand normalization in 2022."
"There are several indications that display market is slowly 
recovering after supply inventory adjustments."
"Due to sluggish demand in the fourth quarter of 2023, however, 
the market research company OMDIA (forecast as of Q3 2023) forecasted a slight decline in growth for 2023."
"In the medium to long term, liquid crystals will continue to play a key role in the display industry in the future."
"OLED technology, for which we have a strong position as material supplier, is becoming increasingly important 
in high-end display applications."
The markets for automotive coatings and cosmetics are crucial to our Surface Solutions business.
"According to 
the December 2023 report from GlobalData (formerly LMC), a leading global provider of automotive forecasts, 
global automobile production grew significantly by 10.1% in 2023 compared with growth of 7.1% in 2022."
"Underlying drivers include an unmet global demand, with China continuing to be one of the most important 
markets."
"According to Euromonitor’s report from October 2023, the market for cosmetics and care products 
grew more slowly in 2023 after a very strong development in 2022 with an overall growth of 4.2% in 2023 
(2022: 12.2%)."
"Net sales 
We forecast slight to solid organic net sales growth for the Group in 2023."
"In particular, the macroeconomic, 
geopolitical and industry-specific conditions changed over the course of the year."
"Furthermore, the Life Science 
business sector saw sustained high inventory levels and a reluctance to invest on the part of customers, while the 
Electronics business sector was affected by the ongoing weakness of the market for semiconductor materials."
"Waning demand for products in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic meant that, as expected, net sales 
declined sharply in fiscal 2023."
"All in all, we reported an organic decline in net sales of -1.6% in fiscal 2023, 
which fell within the forecast range of between -2% and +2% that we revised in the second quarter and 
confirmed in the third quarter."
"At the start of the year, we anticipated a negative exchange rate effect totaling 
between -1% and -4%, especially as a result of the expected development of the U.S."
"dollar and the Chinese 
renminbi."
"Several currencies, including the U.S."
"dollar and the Chinese renminbi as well as some currencies of 
emerging economies, saw less favorable development than expected as the year progressed."
"The negative 
exchange rate effect in 2023 as a whole was -4.1%, thus falling within the range of -3% to -6% which we most 
recently revised in the second quarter and confirmed in the third quarter."
"The slightly positive portfolio effect 
was negligible at +0.1%."
"All in all, net sales amounted to € 20,993 million, representing a year-on-year 
decrease of -5.6%."
"This was below the mid-point of the forecast range of € 20,500 million to € 21,900 million 
and thus was consistent with the more specific forecast issued together with the figures for the third quarter 
(trending slightly below the mid-point)."
"Life Science 
Our Life Science business sector reported an organic decline in net sales of -7.9% in fiscal 2023."
"This was at 
the lower end of the forecast range of between -8% and -2%, which we adjusted in the second quarter and 
confirmed in the third quarter, meaning that Life Science fell below our original forecast of slight to moderate 
organic growth."
"All of the business units – Process Solutions, Life Science Services and Science & Lab Solutions 
– recorded a downturn in organic net sales."
"As expected, Process Solutions and Life Science Services saw the 
most pronounced organic decline in net sales, whereas the downturn in the Science & Lab Solutions business 
unit was only slight."
"All in all, net sales in the Life Science business sector fell by -10.6% to € 9,281 million 
including a negative exchange rate effect of -2.7% and a positive portfolio effect of 0.1%."
"This was in the lower 
half of the forecast range of € 9,100 million to € 9,950 million, which is consistent with the more specific 
forecast issued at the end of the third quarter (trending in the lower half of the forecast range)."
"Healthcare 
We originally forecast moderate to solid organic sales growth for our Healthcare business sector compared with 
the previous year."
"We then quantified this organic sales growth forecast at between +5% and +9% when we 
published the figures for the first quarter."
"We raised this forecast range to between +6% and +9% with the 
publication of the figures for the second quarter and confirmed this at the end of the third quarter."
"With full-year 
organic growth of +8.5%, the business sector achieved the forecast for fiscal 2023."
"This development was driven 
in particular by the significant growth of the oncology business and, above all, the strong performance of our 
recently approved product Bavencio®."
"Neurology & Immunology made a substantial contribution to full-year 
organic sales growth in fiscal 2023 thanks to our recently approved product Mavenclad® in particular."
"Sales 
growth was also driven by our established portfolio, especially fertility products."
"Taking into account the negative 
exchange rate effect of -5.8%, net sales in the Healthcare business sector increased by +2.7% to € 8,053 million 
in fiscal 2023, thereby falling within the upper half of the forecast range."
"This was consistent with the more 
specific forecast issued together with the report on the third quarter (trending slightly above the mid-point)."
"We quantified our 
organic sales growth forecast at between -2% and +3% when we published the figures for the first quarter."
"Compared with the previous forecast, we anticipated an even more pronounced weakening of the market 
followed by a delayed but stronger recovery which should now only occur later in the second half of the year."
"We adjusted this forecast with the publication of the figures for the second quarter, stating that we expected an 
organic decline in net sales of between -6% and -1% in light of the further delay in the recovery of the 
semiconductor market."
We then confirmed this forecast at the end of the third quarter.
"The organic decline in 
net sales for fiscal 2023 as a whole was -5.1%, which is in line with the lower end of the forecast range."
"Due to 
negative exchange rate effects of -4.1% and taking into account a portfolio effect of +0.3%, net sales in the 
Electronics business sector declined by -8.8% year-on-year to € 3,659 million, thereby falling within the 
forecast range of between € 3,500 million and € 3,800 million."
"This was consistent with the more specific 
forecast issued together with the report on the third quarter (trending around the mid-point)."
"EBITDA pre 
Our original forecast for the Merck Group’s EBITDA pre for 2023 ranged from a moderate decline to roughly 
stable organic development compared with the previous year."
"This assumption was based on the expectation of 
a moderate decline to roughly stable organic development in the Life Science business sector, slight to 
moderate organic growth in the Healthcare business sector, and a slight to strong organic decline in the 
Electronics business sector."
"We originally expected negative exchange rate effects to impact EBITDA pre by 
between -1% and -4% compared with the prior year."
"With the presentation of the figures for the first quarter, 
we quantified our forecast at organic development of between -5% and 0%."
"In response to inflation-related 
cost increases and the underutilization of our production capacities, especially in the Life Science and 
Electronics business sector, we revised our forecast to between -9% and -3% at the end of the second quarter."
This forecast was confirmed with the publication of the figures for the third quarter.
"Due to negative exchange 
rate effects, we revised our forecast for the impact of exchange rate effects twice in the course of fiscal 2023, 
ultimately ending with a forecast of between -6% and -3%."
"EBITDA pre amounted to € 5,879 million in fiscal 
2023, representing an overall decline of -14.2% compared with the previous year (-9.0% organic, -4.9% from 
currency effects, -0.3% from portfolio effects)."
"This is in the lower half of the forecast range of between 
€ 5,800 million and € 6,400 million, and hence is consistent with the more specific forecast range (trending in 
the lower half of the range)."
"Life Science 
In contrast to the expected net sales development, we originally expected EBITDA pre in Life Science to be in a 
range from a moderate decline to organically about stable in fiscal 2023 due to inflation-driven price increases 
weighing more heavily on earnings."
"At the end of the first quarter, we quantified our forecast for the organic 
decline in EBITDA pre at between -8% and -4%."
"In response to the underutilization of our production 
capacities, we then lowered this to between -21% and -12% with the publication of the figures for the second 
quarter."
"Along with the exchange rate effect that was most recently forecast at between -6% and -2% 
(originally: slightly negative exchange rate effect), this resulted in a forecast range for EBITDA pre in the 
Life Science business sector of between € 2,750 million and € 3,200 million."
"The business sector achieved this 
forecast with EBITDA pre of € 2,820 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: € 3,760 million)."
"This corresponded to a 
decline of -25.0% compared with the previous year (-21.4% organic, -3.3% due to exchange rate effects)."
"EBITDA pre therefore also fell within the more specific forecast range issued at the same time as the report on 
the third quarter (trending in the lower half of the range of € 2,750 million to € 3,200 million)."
"Largely because of the sustained high level of prices due to inflation, this original forecast was 
slightly below the expected organic growth in net sales (moderate to solid organic sales growth)."
"With the 
publication of the figures for the first quarter, we quantified our forecast for organic growth in EBITDA pre at 
between +8% and +12% in fiscal 2023."
"We then raised this forecast to between +14% and +19% at the end 
of the second quarter, especially as business performance was expected to be stronger."
"We confirmed this 
forecast range at the end of the third quarter."
"With EBITDA pre of € 2,543 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: 
€ 2,477 million), the business sector came in at the upper end of this range."
"This was also consistent with the 
more specific forecast issued together with the report on the third quarter (trending at the upper end of the 
range)."
"This corresponded to an increase of +2.7% compared with the previous year (+17.1% organic, -14.4% 
due to exchange rate effects, -0.7% from portfolio)."
"Electronics 
We originally anticipated a slight to strong organic decrease in EBITDA pre for our Electronics business sector in 
fiscal 2023."
"We expected inflation-driven cost increases to have a particularly pronounced impact on material costs, 
and that we would only be able to pass on cost increases to a limited extent in the coming quarters due to the price 
pressure faced by our customers."
"With the presentation of the figures for the first quarter, we quantified our 
forecast for the organic decline in EBITDA pre as ranging from -12% to -3%."
"Having lowered our forecast 
considerably to between -18% and -10% with the report on the second quarter in response to inflation-related cost 
increases and the underutilization of our production capacities, we reiterated this guidance at the end of the third 
quarter."
"Along with the exchange rate effect that was most recently forecast at between -10% and -7% (originally: 
significantly negative exchange rate effect), this resulted in a forecast range for EBITDA pre in the Electronics 
business sector of between € 870 million and € 980 million."
"EBITDA pre of € 913 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: 
€ 1,192 million) was in the lower half of the forecast range."
"This was consistent with the more specific forecast 
issued along with the report on the third quarter (trending in the lower half of the range) and corresponded to a 
decline of -23.4% compared with the previous year (-17.1% organic, -5.6% due to exchange rate effects)."
"Corporate and Other 
The expenses for Corporate and Other in EBITDA pre amounted to € -397 million in fiscal 2023."
"This meant that 
EBITDA pre was slightly below the original forecast range of between € -370 million and € -330 million."
"However, 
we specified our forecast with the presentation of the figures for the third quarter."
"Due to substantially lower 
expected income from currency hedging transactions, we have forecast that EBITDA pre for corporate costs and 
other is expected to be slightly below the forecast range of -330 to -370 million €."
"The original forecast for fiscal 
2023 provided for a significant decline in the expenses in this area."
"Compared with the prior-year figure of € -
579 million, the expenses decreased significantly by -31.5%."
"Operating cash flow 
We originally anticipated a moderate decline to roughly stable development for the operating cash flow of the 
Merck Group in 2023 (2022: € 4,259 million)."
"We then specified the forecast range at between € 3,700 million 
and € 4,300 million with the publication of the figures for the first quarter."
"As we expected the development of 
operating cash flow to be largely in line with operating performance, we lowered our forecast to between 
€ 3,500 million and € 4,100 million at the end of the second quarter and confirmed this forecast in our report 
on the third quarter."
"The operating cash flow amounted to € 3,784 million in fiscal 2023, which was within the 
most recent forecast range of between € 3,500 million and € 4,100 million."
"This corresponded to a decline of  
-11.2% compared with the previous year (2022: € 4,259 million)."
"The decisive factor for this was the 
development of EBITDA pre."
"2 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); EBITDA corresponds to operating result (EBIT) adjusted by depreciation, 
amortization, impairment losses, and reversals of impairment losses."

representing a year-on-year decline of € 1,239 million or -5.6%."
"Negative exchange rate effects served to 
reduce net sales by € 902 million or -4.1% in fiscal 2023."
"These effects largely resulted from the exchange 
rate development of the Chinese renminbi, the US dollar, and the Argentinian peso."
"Net sales fell by 
€ 357 million or -1.6% organically."
"Net sales in the Life Science and Electronics business sectors declined, 
while the Healthcare business sector recorded organic growth."
"The portfolio-related net sales increase of

"• 
Net sales in the Life Science business sector decreased by € 1,100 million or -10.6% year-on-year to 
€ 9,281 million (2022: € 10,380 million)."
"This development was mainly attributable to organic effects, which 
amounted to € 821 million or -7.9%."
"Exchange rate effects of € 285 million or -2.7% also contributed to the 
downturn in net sales."
"The Life Science business sector accounted for the largest share of Group net sales at 
44% (2022: 47%), followed by Healthcare at 38% (2022: 35%)."

increased by € 214 million or 2.7% year-on-year to € 8,053 million (2022: € 7,839 million)."
"Negative exchange 
rate effects of -5.8% were offset by organic growth of 8.5%."
"The € 354 million decline in net sales in the 
Electronics business sector to € 3,659 million (2022: € 4,013 million) was driven by organic effects of -5.1% and 
exchange rate effects of -4.1%."
"This was offset by a positive effect of 0.3% from the acquisition of M Chemicals 
Inc., Korea."
The percentage contribution of Electronics to Group net sales was unchanged year-on-year at 18%.
There was a year-on-year decline in the operating result (EBIT) in fiscal 2023.
"This was largely due to the lower 
level of gross profit, which was only partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses."
"In particular, the 
year-on-year decline in the gross margin was due to lower sales of high-margin products in the Life Science 
business sector that had experienced strong demand in conjunction with the Covid-19 pandemic."
"In addition, as 
a result of the agreement terminating the strategic alliance with Pfizer Inc., United States, the cost of sales 
included royalties for the Bavencio® product for the first time from July 1, 2023, which in turn reduced the 
gross margin."
"• 
Marketing and selling expenses declined on the back of lower logistics costs in particular."
"• 
Administration expenses increased as a result of a program to continuously improve processes and align 
the Group Functions more closely with the businesses in particular."
"• 
Accounting for a 70% (2022: 70%) share of Group R&D spending (excluding research and development 
cost allocated to Corporate and Other), Healthcare was the most research-intensive business sector of the 
Merck Group."
Further information can be found in the “Research and Development” chapter.
"• 
Other operating income and expenses fell compared with the previous year, mainly as a result of lower profit 
transfer expenses in the Healthcare business sector."
Impairment losses on non-financial assets also declined.
"• 
Overall, the aforementioned developments led to a reduction in the EBIT margin by around three 
percentage points, from 20.1% in the previous year to 17.2%."
"• 
Compared to the previous year, EBITDA pre, the key financial indicator used to steer operating business, 
fell by € 970 million or -14.2% to € 5,879 million (2022: € 6,849 million)."
"• 
The financial result improved by 33.0% to € -125 million (2022: € -187 million)."

instruments” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

Income tax expense amounted to € 650 million (2022: € 948 million) and resulted in a tax rate of 18.7% 
(2022: 22.1%)."
The downturn in earnings was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in taxes.
"Furthermore, a non-recurring deferred tax income had a reducing effect on the tax rate."
"• 
The net income attributable to Merck KGaA shareholders declined by 15.1% to € 2,824 million (2022:

77 Report on Risks and Opportunities
As a global science and technology enterprise, identifying risks and opportunities is an intrinsic part of 
making our businesses resilient and generating value."
"We operate in a highly complex, global and 
interconnected business environment that further necessitates the competent management of risks and 
opportunities."
"Therefore, managing risks and opportunities is an imperative and a core component of our 
internal business planning and forecasting."
"We have processes, tools and responsibilities in place to enable 
the early identification of risks and to supply effective and efficient mitigation strategies."
"In our internal risk reporting framework, we define risks as potential future events or developments that 
could result in unfavorable deviations from our financial and non-financial targets."
"Risk parameters in this 
context are the probability of financial (quantitative) impact (EBITDA pre/Operating Cash Flow) or non-
financial (qualitative) impact (reputation/brand, Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) including 
workforce and ethics, strategy, operations)."
Opportunities imply favorable deviations from targets.
"Future events and expected developments are 
considered in internal planning if a likely occurrence can be assumed within the planning period."
"The 
following section presents the risks and opportunities that could result in favorable and unfavorable 
deviations from existing plans and targets."
"The following report is relevant from the perspective of both Merck KGaA and the overarching Merck 
Group."
"For additional information and details regarding the non-financial topics, please refer to the “Non-
Financial Statement”."
"The model 
divides our company functions for controlling risks properly and effectively into three areas, the so-called lines 
of defense:  
The first line of defense consists of all functions that are responsible for the operational business and whose 
day-to-day business risks can have an impact."
"the heads of the business units, enabling 
Group functions and local Managing Directors) establish processes in accordance with the requirements set by 
the second line of defense to identify, assess, and monitor risks and to develop measures for proper risk 
mitigation."
Results of these assessments are regularly communicated to the Executive Board.
"The second line of defense includes enabling functions at both Group and local level that control and monitor 
the operational business (first line of defense)."
"This includes, among other things, the design and 
implementation of methods and procedures for risk management and the internal control system (financial and 
non-financial) as well as its regular monitoring."
The third line of defense is our Internal Auditing function.
"Both the second and third line of defense functions regularly report to the Executive Board and the Audit 
Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"This system covers measures designed to ensure the complete, correct, and timely reporting and 
presentation of information that is relevant for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and 
the Combined Management Report."
"Each of these components is regularly documented, tested and/or assessed."
"This 
control system aims to ensure the accuracy of the consolidated accounting process through functioning internal 
controls with reasonable assurance."
"The Group Accounting function centrally steers the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of 
Merck KGaA as the parent company of the Merck Group."
"This Group function defines the reporting requirements 
that all companies of the Merck Group must meet."
"At the same time, this function steers and monitors the 
scheduling and process-related requirements of the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"The Merck Business 
Services organization manages all changes to the equity holding structure and correspondingly adapts the 
Group’s scope of consolidation."
"The proper elimination of intragroup transactions within the scope of the 
consolidation process is ensured."
"For special issues, such as 
the accounting treatment of intangible assets within the scope of business combinations in accordance with 
IFRS 3 or defined benefit obligations, external experts are additionally involved where necessary."
"The individual legal entities, including Merck KGaA, have a local internal control system within a global 
framework."
"Where financial processes are handled by the Merck Business Services organization, the internal 
control system of the Merck Business Services organization is additionally applied."
"Both ensure that accounting 
complies with IFRS and with the Group accounting guidelines."
"Group Accounting provides support to the local contacts and ensures a consistently high quality of reporting 
throughout the entire reporting process."
"For Group financial reporting purposes, most of our subsidiaries use standard SAP software."
"Consolidation 
software from SAP is also used for the elimination of intragroup transactions."
"A detailed authorization concept 
ensures the segregation of duties with respect to both single-entity reporting and the Consolidated Financial 
Statements."
"The accounting process is generally designed to ensure that all units involved adhere to the 
principle of dual control."
"The operational effectiveness of our internal financial control system is regularly tested within the scope of self-
assessments by our legal entities and enabling Group functions including the Merck Business Services 
organization."
"The quality is systematically reviewed by a dedicated global financial control and governance 
team."
"Control deficiencies are properly recorded and, wherever necessary, adequate countermeasures are 
taken to remediate control deficiencies in a timely manner."
"For 
the accounting treatment of balance sheet items, Group Accounting closely cooperates with Group Risk 
Management to correctly present potential risks in the balance sheet."
"Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities 
79 
 
All the structures and processes described in the foregoing relate to the Group Accounting procedures and are 
subject to regular review by Group Internal Auditing based on an annual audit plan set out by the Executive Board."
"The results of the self-assessments, quality reviews, and internal audits are dealt with by the Executive Board, 
the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee."
"The internal financial control system at Merck makes it 
possible to lower the risk of material misstatements in accounting."
"However, residual risk cannot be entirely 
ruled out as no internal control system is infallible, irrespective of its design."
"An important decision was to consolidate the 
management of financial and non-financial risks under unified organizational leadership (with the Chief Financial 
Officer being responsible commencing with fiscal 2024) to increase efficiency and quality."
"This also includes the 
non-financial internal control system."
"For fiscal 2023, the Group Legal & Compliance function provides the organizational framework for the non-
financial internal control system."
"In line with the risk situation of the Group and to ensure regulatory 
compliance, non-financial topics such as sustainability, cyber security and supply chain are core areas of the 
internal control system."
"We base this on international standards, such as the framework for the governance of 
Group Cyber Security, which includes organizational, process-related, and technical measures for information 
security."
The existing process of Cyber Security Risk Management is designed pursuant to ISO 27005:2018.
"In 
comparison with the previous year, a monthly Group Security Forum has been established, where new risks 
from the risk register are reported, and actions are tracked."
"Additionally, the non-financial internal control system aligns with the sustainability strategy and ongoing projects 
for implementing sustainability reporting (e.g."
"The goal is to continuously improve regulatory compliance 
pursuant to CSRD requirements through the implementation of organization-wide measures and controls."
"The aim of our internal control system as the entirety of all systematically defined controls is therefore to 
prevent and reduce the probability of potential risks occurring as well as actively steer risks in business 
processes."
"Thereby, it helps to ensure the compliance of the company’s activities with laws and regulations."
The entire internal control system and the applied methods are continuously developed further.
"The 
responsibility for the effectiveness of the internal control system and the further development of the non-
financial key metrics lies with the respective responsible senior leaders or risk and process owners."
"Relevant representatives from the business sectors and the enabling Group functions reported to the Executive 
Board through the implemented control system in 2023."
"In this context, areas where potential for improvement 
and optimization had been identified and relevant ongoing projects were also presented to the Executive Board."
"Finally, the individual Group functions and business sectors issued an assessment to the Executive Board 
regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of the control system, considering the recommended 
improvement opportunities, where applicable."
"Based on this as well as the review of the non-financial internal 
control system, and reporting by Internal Auditing, as of December 31, 2023, the Executive Board was not 
aware of any indications with regard to material issues that the system is not appropriate or effective."
"Given the multi-layered process landscape and the high speed of change regarding the catalog of requirements 
for non-financial information, the degree of development of the non-financial internal control system does not 
yet match that of the (Group) accounting-related internal control system."

Risk and opportunity management 
Group Controlling & Risk Management provides the organizational framework for risk management and reports 
to the Group Chief Financial Officer."
"We have established a holistic risk management system aimed at 
safeguarding the long-term achievement of our Group's goals and addressing risks to ensure our continued 
existence and future success."
"Within the scope of audits, Group Internal Auditing regularly reviews the 
performance of risk management processes within the units on local level and, at the same time, the 
communication of relevant risks from the operating businesses to Group Risk Management."
"Additionally, the 
external auditor examines the risk early warning system in accordance with section 317 (4) of the German 
Commercial Code (HGB) as part of the year-end audit of Merck KGaA."
"Our risk management activities aim to continuously and promptly identify, assess and manage risks so that 
appropriate measures can be implemented to mitigate their potential negative impact."
"The responsibilities, 
objectives, and procedures of risk management are outlined in our internal group standard for risk 
management."
"The designated risk owners, including business heads, managing directors of Merck subsidiaries, 
and the heads of enabling Group functions, are responsible for overseeing and running local risk management 
processes."
"The risk owners continuously assess the status of risks and report their risk portfolio to Group Risk Management 
twice a year."
"To facilitate and support these activities, we employ dedicated risk management tools."
"Group Risk 
Management coordinates and supervises the bottom-up risk reporting process."
"This includes validating the 
plausibility of the reported risks, assessing the effectiveness of mitigation measures and time frames, and 
determining the residual risk."
The net risk is then presented in the internal risk report.
"For the internal bottom-up risk reporting process, reporting is based on defined thresholds, and a variety of 
distribution functions are used to reflect scenarios with varied occurrence probabilities."
"Risks below the global 
reporting threshold are managed and monitored at a local level."
"The timeframe applied for internal risk and 
opportunity reporting is five years."
"It may extend beyond this timeframe in specific cases, such as for 
regulatory risks related to climate change."
"The outlined risks and their evaluation are based on respective 
annual values within the reporting period."
"The assessment of the risks presented relates to December 31, 2023."
"No significant changes occurred after the balance sheet date that would necessitate an amended presentation 
of the Group’s risk situation."
Group Risk Management analyzes the reported information to determine the current risk portfolio of the Group.
"This assessment is presented in a comprehensive report, accompanied by detailed explanations, to the 
Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, and relevant committees twice a year."
"This also encompasses a 
quantitative aggregation of risks at Group level, using a Monte Carlo simulation."
"Moreover, any notable changes 
in the assessment of existing risks or the identification of new significant risks can be reported at any time and 
promptly communicated to the Executive Board."
"Our internal controlling processes incorporate the opportunity management process, which is aligned with the 
Group’s strategy within the operating units."
"As part of the strategy and planning processes, the business 
sectors analyze and evaluate possible business-related opportunities."
"In this context, investment opportunities 
are carefully examined and prioritized primarily in terms of their potential value proposition, ensuring optimal 
resource allocation."
"We target investment in growth markets to leverage the opportunities of dynamic 
development and customer proximity at a local level."
Identified opportunities that are deemed likely to occur are integrated into the business plans and forecasts.
"Additionally, trends and events that have the potential to positively impact EBITDA pre or Operating Cash Flow."
These opportunities have the potential to have a positive effect on our medium-term prospects.
"The use of this scale is mandatory for the assessment of non-
quantifiable and qualitative risks such as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), reputational, strategic, 
and operational risks as well as for material risks that also require a qualitative evaluation."
"The scale 
categorizes the risks as low, moderate, significant, or critical and provides a comprehensive reference for 
assessment."
Opportunities are assessed within their respective business environment.
"During short-term and strategic 
planning, general measures of business functions are quantified, typically in relation to EBITDA pre (earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and operating cash flow."
"In addition, we identify and 
leverage opportunities as part of our regular business operations and through our daily observation of internal 
processes and markets."
"Investment opportunities are primarily evaluated and prioritized using metrics such as net present value, 
internal rate of return, return on capital employed (ROCE), and the payback period of the investment."
"These 
indicators are used to assess the potential of investment projects and prioritize them accordingly."
"Similarly, 
scenarios are used to simulate the impact of possible fluctuations and changes in the respective parameters on 
results."

Business-related risks and opportunities 
Political and regulatory risks and opportunities 
As a global corporate group, we face political and regulatory changes in a large number of countries and markets."
"Risk of more restrictive regulatory requirements regarding drug pricing and reimbursement as well 
as pricing-related opportunities 
Our business is affected by numerous regulations that are continuously changing – and could even become 
more stringent."
"For example, in the Healthcare business sector, the known trend towards increasingly 
restrictive requirements in terms of drug pricing, reimbursement, and the expansion of rebate groups is 
continuing."
"With globally rising healthcare expenditures, both in absolute amounts and relative to GDP, 
healthcare budgets around the globe face increasing pressure."
"Specifically, in the United States, a pricing 
reform on prescription drugs is part of the agenda of the current administration."
"These requirements can 
negatively influence the profitability of our products, as can market referencing between countries, and the 
success of market launches."
Foreseeable effects are considered as far as possible in the business sector’s plans.
Close communication with health and regulatory authorities serves as a preventive measure to avert such risks.
"The remaining risks beyond the current plans resulting from restrictive regulatory requirements are possible to 
likely with a moderate to significant impact."
"While we consider the possibility of resulting price cuts in our 
forecasts, there is also an opportunity that price pressure from healthcare systems worldwide is less 
pronounced than expected or materializes at a later point in time versus the base assumption."
"Additionally, as a 
global specialty innovator that pursues a focused leadership approach in attractive therapeutic areas, we are 
positioned to benefit from attractive pricing schemes for demonstrated major therapeutic improvements."
"Risk of stricter regulations for the manufacturing, testing, and marketing of products 
We must adhere to a multitude of regulatory requirements regarding the manufacturing, testing and marketing 
of many of our products."
"Specifically, in the European Union, we are subject to the EU chemicals regulation 
REACH."
"Similar regulations are emerging globally in relevant markets, particularly in Asia."
"These regulations 
demand comprehensive tests for chemicals."
"Moreover, the use of chemicals, such as per- and polyfluorinated 
alkyl substances (PFAS), in production and final products could be restricted, which would negatively impact the 
ability to manufacture and market certain products."
"With the EU Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability, an 
initiative of the European Green Deal, we expect increasing demands concerning the substitution of specific 
hazardous substances."
"We are constantly pursuing research and development (R&D) in substance 
characterization and the possible substitution of critical substances so as to mitigate this risk."
"Nevertheless, 
risks of stricter regulations are classified as possible to likely with moderate to significant impacts."
"Risk of negative political and macroeconomic developments 
The current political and macroeconomic situation, characterized by high uncertainty and volatile global 
developments, is a strategic factor for us as potential negative developments can also impact our businesses."
"The 
ongoing general trend of bloc building and reshoring of critical supplies and processes is leading to a further 
increase in the establishment of trade barriers and the general weaponization of trade to assert interests."
"For example, multiple countries have 
already implemented measures to restrict the export and transfer of technology to China, particularly in relation to 
advanced chips that could be utilized for AI, quantum computing and military applications."
These risks can have a negative impact on our supply chains and sales in our key countries and regions.
"Such 
risks are considered as fully as possible in the business plans of the affected countries and regions, and are 
mitigated through product, industry and regional diversification as well as measures to ensure resilience of 
supply chains and networks."
the United States and Europe).
"Also, given the 
considerable investments of several countries in the domestic chip industry (e.g."
"Chips Act, EU Chips 
acts) to establish local supply of this critical component."
"Besides that, strategic geopolitical risk management is 
in place at the Group and business sector levels to continuously monitor and assess the global developments 
and to prepare Merck holistically for foreseeable risks."
Global economic growth is projected to slow down with growing regional divergences.
"Weak economic growth or 
even a recession could lead to less government spending or other cost-containment policies."
"Global inflation 
declined gradually in 2023, but remained significantly above target levels, keeping costs at an elevated level 
which could negatively impact our business."
"Persistently high inflation could increase our operating expenses 
(e.g."
"raw materials, operating costs and logistics) as well as capital expenditures."
"It could also prompt central 
banks to increase interest rates further and curb fiscal policy for some economies."
"In the course of 2022 and 
2023, the European Central Bank as well as the U.S."
"Federal Reserve increased key interest rates significantly, 
which may affect our refinancing costs."
"Financial markets remain volatile, which could have numerous potential 
impacts."
"The net risks of negative geopolitical and macroeconomic developments are seen as possible and might have 
significant to critical effects."
"However, our assumptions on geopolitical developments exclude extreme scenarios 
with severe escalation of tensions."
"The materialization of such scenarios would jeopardize entire industries and the 
balance of geopolitical and economic structures, posing a substantial challenge for us, as for any other company."
"Further details on the macroeconomic development can be found under “Macroeconomic and Sector-
Specific Environment”."
"Market risks and opportunities 
We compete with numerous companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical, and life science sectors."
"Rising 
competitive pressure can have a significant impact on the quantities that can be sold and prices attainable 
for our products."
"We have strategically positioned ourselves to capture 
numerous opportunities from the industry’s shift towards biologics, coupled with the growing demand for 
bioproduction driven by many drug candidates and more regulatory approvals."
"In addition, we are well-
prepared to benefit from our customers’ investments in expanding bioreactor capacity."
"Our commitment to 
innovation and our customer-focused approach positions us to advance the field of biomanufacturing."
The growing use of biologics is creating a need for more efficient and higher-yield manufacturing processes.
"This represents an opportunity for us to enable continuous and intensified processing through our ongoing 
innovation in single-use technologies and advancements in bioproduction."
"Consequently, faster market growth driven by the aforementioned industry shifts can lead to a more positive 
development compared with our latest plan."
"Our Life Science Services business unit fully integrates Contract Testing, Development, and Manufacturing 
Organization (CTDMO) services to meet the evolving needs of our global customers across all stages of drug 
development, from preclinical to commercialization."
"Our CTDMO services cover a wide range of modalities, 
including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients (HP-APIs), antibody-
drug conjugates (ADCs), viral and gene therapies (VGTs), and end-to-end mRNA offerings."
"We continually 
invest in expanding our portfolio and production capabilities to offer specialized solutions for both traditional 
and innovative therapies."
"This positions us to capitilize on the potential of the growing biopharmaceutical 
market by providing leading CTDMO services to our customers."
"Through quicker establishment of model 
modalities on the market in combination with our broad and integrated portfolio, we can increase the potential 
beyond the assumptions reflected in our plan."
"Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities 
84 
 
Our Science & Lab Solutions business unit serves customers in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries and 
other industries in production, testing and research, as well as public authorities and research institutions."
"Despite current headwinds – a complex macroeconomic environment, and softer market demand, especially in 
the United States and China – the business unit is well-positioned to deliver long-term, profitable growth."
"We 
aim to offer our customers a streamlined experience and a comprehensive portfolio of offerings to facilitate 
their research and analytical processes."
"This includes several customer solutions in the area of innovative 
digitalization and automation."
"A faster recovery from the aforementioned macroeconomic adverse development 
as well as greater commercial success of our innovative digital and automation solutions could imply an 
increased potential compared to our latest plans."
"Risks and opportunities in the semiconductor industry 
Our Semiconductor Solutions business unit leverages a broad portfolio of independent technologies."
"This 
enables us to supply products for all essential production steps of wafer processing, helping our customers to 
achieve their technology roadmaps."
The underlying semiconductor industry is cyclical by nature.
"The current downturn has been exacerbated by a 
post-Covid-19 pandemic recession."
"The economic weakening has led to a temporary weakness of the traditional 
industry growth drivers such as PCs, smartphones and traditional data centers, while the new growth drivers 
such as AI and automotive are still too small to compensate for these effects."
"The multi-layered macro-
economic effects and poor transparency throughout the supply chain cause a certain degree of uncertainty 
when estimating the timing and shape of the industry recovery."
"However, it may also imply upsides compared 
with our plan if the industry recovers faster and stronger than expected."
"The semiconductor cyclical correction 
risk is considered as likely with a significant impact."
"Irrespective of the current turbulent macroeconomic situation, the positive medium- and long-term growth 
prospects of our markets remain unchanged."
"We see long-term growth opportunities in the semiconductor 
market due to the significantly accelerating global demand for innovative semiconductor materials with 
potential growth upside beyond the assumptions reflected in our plan, driven by a faster market adaptation and 
penetration."
"This demand is driven by exponential data growth and highly impactful technology trends such as 
autonomous driving, electric vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G."
"We will benefit from the high material 
requirement of these AI chips and are working with our customers on almost all of these groundbreaking 
technological innovations in the semiconductor sector."
"That is why we are investing in our highly attractive 
growth markets and purposefully expanding production capacities with a smart localization of our footprint to 
further boost customer proximity and ensure supply stability."
"Having the right capacity in the right place to 
bring new products and higher volumes to our customers enables us to stay flexible about the timing of the 
market upswing and can serve as a competitive advantage."
"The aforementioned trends and the continued announcements of major capacity expansions in the industry in 
the coming years also benefit our DS&S business."
"With this portfolio of gas and chemical cabinets and the 
potential to provide our largest customers with turnkey solutions for the delivery of bulk gases in the 
manufacturing process, we are well positioned to capture upcoming opportunities."
"We compete with other pharmaceutical companies in various therapeutic indications 
and rely on high quality data to successfully market our products."
"For this reason, we closely observe our 
competitive landscape and make assumptions with regard to future competitor entries that pose competition to 
our products."
"Due to the uncertainty that is inherent to clinical trials, there is the possibility that competitor 
trials fail to meet primary endpoints in their studies or deliver inferior data than we initially anticipated."
"If there 
 
Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities 
85 
 
are no new competing products or if our competitors deliver less promising data, this could represent 
opportunities for us in therapeutic areas in which we are active."
"In the Life Science and Electronics business sectors, risks are posed by not only cyclical business fluctuations but 
also changes in the technologies used or customer sourcing strategies."
"We use close customer relationships and 
in-house further developments as well as market proximity, including precise market analyses, as mitigating 
measures."
"Overall, the occurrence of these risks is possible to likely and could have a significant impact."
"Further details on the industry and market development can be found under “Macroeconomic and Sector-
Specific Environment”, e.g."
on the market challenging environment in the life science industry.
"Risks and opportunities of research and development  
Innovation driven by R&D is a major element of the Group strategy – including fostering innovation at the 
intersection of our business sectors – and is particularly important in the Healthcare business sector."
"In regular 
portfolio management reviews, we continually evaluate and, if necessary, realign research areas and R&D 
pipeline projects to focus our investments in areas where patient needs are served best."
"Nevertheless, R&D 
projects can experience delays, expected budgets can be exceeded, or targets can remain unmet."
"Sometimes, 
development projects are discontinued after high levels of investment at a late phase of clinical development."
"Decisions – such as those relating to the transition to the next clinical phase – are taken with a view to balance 
risks and opportunities."
"In addition to in-house R&D efforts, strategic alliances with external partners and the in- and out-licensing of 
programs also form part of the catalog of measures to develop innovative medicine and ensure the efficient 
allocation of resources."
"Strategic alliances with partners as well as in- and out-licensing transactions always 
follow a stringent selection process along clear strategic and financial decision criteria."
"An example of such in-
licensing deals is the recently announced partnership with Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co."
"for a next-
generation selective PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) inhibitor and ADC (antibody drug conjugate) 
which represents a strong strategic fit leveraging our internal DNA damage response expertise and in-house 
ADC capabilities."
"This agreement provides the opportunity to advance more therapeutic options for patients 
with difficult-to-treat cancers."
"However, in general, there is a possibility that we may not be able to identify a 
sufficient number of in-licensing assets on financially acceptable terms."
The aforementioned development opportunities are associated with different types of risks.
"There is the risk 
that regulatory authorities either do not grant or delay approval or grant only restricted approval."
"The risk that 
undesirable side effects of a pharmaceutical product could remain undetected until after approval or registration 
could result in a restriction of approval or withdrawal from the market."
"Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that 
all the assets we are currently developing will achieve the desired commercial success."
"The failure to meet 
targets in this area could have significant effects, for example due to lower net sales or the non-occurrence of 
milestone payments from collaboration agreements."
"These risks are evaluated with probabilities ranging from 
possible to likely."
"Moreover, in Electronics, we will also continue to invest heavily in R&D in leading-edge material solutions."
"The 
aim is to seize growth opportunities arising from the increasing global demand for innovative semiconductors."
Promising opportunities for innovation are constantly arising throughout our Semiconductor Solutions business.
We work closely with our customers to exploit these.
"Technology inflection points bring opportunities to our 
material solutions and the chance to differentiate from competition."
"We are further developing new dielectric 
platforms in cooperation with our key customers for 3D NAND applications."
"In addition, we see opportunities in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials in high-quality display 
applications."
"We have been conducting R&D in the area of OLED technology for more than 15 years and have 
grown into a well-positioned material supplier for OLEDs."
"Through our semiconductor and display knowledge, 
we will be able to contribute to the new display devices including foldable displays and Augmented Reality/ 
Virtual Reality applications, which require a broad set of materials."
"More detailed descriptions on our R&D activities worldwide can be found under “Research and Development” 
in “Fundamental Information about the Group”."
"During the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chains experienced unprecedented disruption, with customers placing 
greater emphasis on supply security."
"In Life Science, we responded to this trend by actively diversifying our 
global presence by moving to a production network in the region and for the region to increase resiliency and 
meet the local needs of customers in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific."
"In fiscal 2023, we announced several new investments to expand capacity and product capabilities at facilities 
around the world."
"These include investments in biosafety testing, the expansion of our production for highly 
purified reagents and expanded lab space and production capability to manufacture cell culture media."
"Having 
the right capacity in the right place to ensure supply security, to bring new products to the market and to serve 
higher customer demand offers us the opportunity to capture higher market shares and can serve as a 
competitive advantage."
"However, market dynamics naturally influence our expansion activities as well as 
utilization."
We therefore regularly review our expansion plans and adapt them accordingly.
"Risks arising from project execution 
In today's dynamic business environment, we prioritize innovation and growth."
"Projects are essential for 
achieving our strategic objectives, driving expansion, and promoting sustainable development."
"To effectively 
support further business growth and enhance efficiency, we continuously invest in projects, such as IT systems, 
distribution centers, office buildings and other projects."
"However, project execution involves significant capital 
expenditures, making effective project management crucial to avoid delays and higher spending."
"Inadequate 
planning, execution errors, and ineffective change management can lead to inefficiencies and disruptions, 
resulting in increased costs and lower sales."
"In a rapidly evolving market, there is also a risk of missing out on market growth and development by delaying 
or deferring investments."
"To mitigate this risk, we actively monitor industry trends, conduct market research, 
and maintain a flexible project portfolio."
"By aligning our investment decisions with market dynamics, we aim to 
capture opportunities and minimize the risk of being left behind."
"This is particularly important in industries like 
semiconductors, where market cycles present substantial risks."
"To proactively address project execution risks, we apply well-established project planning and internal control 
practices, collaborate closely with stakeholders, and conduct regular project reviews through teams and 
steering committees."
"This approach enables us to detect risks early on and implement corrective actions or 
discontinue projects that are unlikely to succeed."
"Through comprehensive planning, accurate cost estimations 
and re-evaluations, we monitor costs and ensure efficient resource allocation."
"Effective project governance and 
prioritization further contribute to desired project outcomes."
"By employing these strategies, we mitigate project execution risks, ensuring successful project delivery, 
improved efficiency, and alignment with our strategic objectives."
"Overall, the possible risks could have a 
moderate to significant impact."
"In this regard, we are subject to the 
supervision of the regulatory authorities."
"Conditions imposed by national regulatory authorities could result in a 
temporary ban on products/production facilities and possibly affect new registrations with the respective 
authority."
"We make the utmost effort to ensure compliance with regulations, regularly perform own internal 
audits, and carry out external inspections."
"Thanks to these quality assurance processes, the occurrence of a 
risk with a significant impact is improbable to possible; however, it cannot be entirely ruled out and depends on 
the product concerned and the severity of the objection."
"As far as possible and economically viable, the Group limits its damage risks with insurance coverage, 
the nature and extent of which is constantly adapted to current requirements."
"Likewise, we are exposed to risks 
of production outages and the related supply bottlenecks that can be triggered by technical problems in 
production facilities with very high-capacity utilization."
"Furthermore, there are risks of supply bottlenecks due 
to a lack or disappearance of capacity."
"We work towards continual mitigation of such risks by making regular 
investments, setting up alternative sourcing options and maintaining sufficient inventory levels."
"Although the occurrence of these risks is considered improbable, an individual event could have a critical 
negative effect."
"Risks of dependency on suppliers and opportunities from supply reliability 
Merck, like many other market players in other industries, has been exposed in the recent past to 
unprecedented events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and other geopolitical events."
"Throughout these 
challenging times, we have been able to avoid any major supply disruptions for our customers."
"A significant 
part of this success is rooted in our efforts to build resilient supply chains over the years with our strategic 
suppliers and reduce the probability of these risks."
"These strong and esteemed relationships have enabled 
Merck to respond to the changes in a difficult environment and adapt to the new circumstances quickly."
"For example, the promise of our Healthcare business sector to reliably serve our patients is a top priority for us 
and requires a strong and resilient supply chain."
"In 2023, we proved that we could continue to reliably supply 
our patients with highly needed drugs while competitors in Fertility and Endocrinology ran out of stock."
"This 
stock-out situation faced by competitors could continue in the near future and would provide us with 
opportunities to gain additional market share by serving patient demand."
"However, part of our supply chain remains vulnerable to certain events."
"Therefore, we continue to invest in the 
improvement of our supply chain, by for example, avoiding single-source situations wherever possible and 
economically sensible, and by increasing stock levels for essential materials in close collaboration with our 
suppliers."
"Through these measures we keep our dependencies on individual partnerships as low as possible 
within the highly regulatory environment we operate in."
"Overall, the likely risks might have a moderate to 
significant impact."
"Risks due to product-related crime 
As a leading global science and technology company and manufacturer of innovative products of the highest 
quality, we are exposed to various security- and crime-related risks."
"Due to the complexity of international 
trade and global supply chains, our products are at risk of being counterfeited, stolen, illegally diverted and 
misused."
"If left unaddressed, this would not only lead to financial loss, reputational damage and business 
disruption, but also compromise patient and customer safety."
"Consequently, we have implemented technical, 
operational and procedural measures aimed at protecting the integrity of our products and supply chains, while 
also ensuring that new threats are identified and managed appropriately."
"Overall, the threat resulting from product-related crime is likely with a moderate impact."
"Risks from the use of social media 
We and our employees are active on numerous social media platforms."
"The consistent and legally compliant use 
of such platforms and their content is important in terms of increasing awareness of our brand, among other 
things."
"We take all necessary precautions and have implemented processes to ensure awareness regarding the 
proper handling of social media as well as actively manage and control our publications and communication."
"Nevertheless, reputational risks could result, for instance through public dialogues on social media."
"On the 
qualitative rating scale, we thus rate this risk as significant."

Financial risks and opportunities 
As we operate internationally, and due to our presence in the capital markets, we are exposed to various 
financial risks and opportunities."
"Above all, these are liquidity and counterparty risks, financial market risks and 
opportunities, and risks of fluctuations in the market values of operational tangible and intangible assets as well 
as risks and opportunities from pension obligations."
"In the area of financial risks and opportunities, we use an active management strategy to reduce the effects of 
fluctuations in exchange and interest rates."
"The management of financial risks and opportunities by using 
derivatives is regulated through extensive guidelines."
"Speculation is prohibited, and derivative transactions are 
subject to constant risk controls."
"The strict separation of functions between trading, settlement, and control 
functions is ensured."
"Liquidity risks 
To ensure continued existence, we must be able to fulfill our commitments arising from operating and financial 
activities at any time."
"Therefore, to reduce potential liquidity risks, we have a central Group-wide liquidity 
management system in place, and a balanced maturity profile."
"The maturities of our financial liabilities are 
aligned with our planned free cash flow."
"Furthermore, we have a syndicated loan facility of € 2.5 billion with a 
term until 2028, which ensures continuing solvency if any liquidity bottlenecks occur."
"As our loan agreements 
do not contain any financial covenants, these agreed lines of credit can be accessed even if Merck's credit rating 
should deteriorate."
"Additionally, we have a commercial paper program with a maximum volume of € 2.5 billion."
"Counterparty risks 
Counterparty risks arise from the potential default by a partner in connection with financial investments, loans, 
and financing commitments on the one hand and receivables in operating business on the other."
"As for counterparty risks from financial transactions, we review all central positions relating to trading partners 
and their credit ratings daily."
"We manage financial risks of default by diversifying our financial positions and 
through the related active management of our trading partners."
"Significant financial transactions involving 
credit risk are entered into with banks and industrial companies that have a good credit rating."
"Moreover, our 
large banking syndicate – the renewed syndicated loan facility of € 2.5 billion was syndicated among 15 banks 
in 2023 – reduces possible losses in the event of default."
"The solvency and operational development of trading partners are regularly reviewed as part of the 
management of operational counterparty risks."
Sovereign risks are also analyzed.
"The volume of receivables of 
each customer is capped in line with their credit ratings."
"Risk-mitigating measures, such as credit insurance, 
are utilized as appropriate."
"Nevertheless, defaults by isolated trading partners, even those with outstanding 
credit ratings, cannot be entirely ruled out, although rated as unlikely."
Counterparty risks are classified as possible risks and might have moderate effects.
"Financial market risks and opportunities 
As a result of our international business activities and global corporate structure, we are exposed to risks and 
opportunities from fluctuations in exchange rates."
"These result from financial transactions, operating 
receivables, and liabilities as well as future cash flows from sales and costs in foreign currency."
"We use 
derivatives to manage and reduce these risks and opportunities (further information can be found under 
“Derivative financial instruments” in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”)."
"Foreign 
exchange rate risks are rated as possible with a significant effect on EBITDA pre or operating cash flow."
"Variable interest and current financial liabilities are exposed to the risks and opportunities of interest rate 
fluctuations."
"Interest rate risks have a negative impact, are considered possible, and pose a minor negative risk 
overall."
"Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities 
89 
 
Risks of impairment of balance sheet items 
The carrying amounts of individual balance sheet items are subject to the risk of changing market and business 
conditions and thus to changes in fair values as well."
"Necessary impairments could have a significant negative 
non-cash impact on earnings and affect the accounting ratios."
"This qualitative risk might have a significant effect 
on reputation."
"Risks and opportunities from pension obligations 
We have commitments in connection with pension obligations."
"The present value of defined benefit obligations 
can be significantly increased or reduced by changes in the relevant valuation parameters, for example the 
interest rate or future salary increases."
"Pension obligations are regularly assessed as part of annual actuarial 
reports."
"The obligations are covered by the pension provisions reported in the balance sheet based on the 
assumptions as of the balance sheet date."
"Some of these obligations are funded by plan assets (further 
information can be found under “Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits” in the 
“Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”)."
"By contrast, rising 
returns increase the value of plan assets, thereby resulting in excess cover of plan liabilities."
"We increase the 
opportunities of fluctuations in the market value of plan assets on the one hand and reduce the risks on the 
other by using a diversified investment strategy."
"The possible risk due to pension obligations could have minor 
effects."
"Assessment by independent rating agencies 
The capital market uses the assessments published by rating agencies to help lenders assess the risks of 
financial instruments used by Merck."
We are currently rated by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.
"Standard & 
Poor’s has issued a long-term credit rating of A with a stable outlook and Moody’s a rating of A3 with a stable 
outlook."
"In line with market procedures, our financing conditions are closely tied to our rating."
"The better the 
rating, the more favorably we can generally raise funds on the capital market or from banks."
"Overview of Rating Development 
 
 
Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities

Risks due to the divestment, acquisition and integration of companies and 
businesses 
Successfully acquiring and subsequently integrating new businesses entails risks."
"These are primarily centered 
around the uncertainty of achieving business targets and synergy goals as well as remaining within the planned 
integration budget."
"Divestments, on the other hand, could lead to liabilities and additional expenses related to 
potential indemnifications and commitments guaranteed in the sale transaction."
"We leverage our solid 
acquisition track record to reduce the probability of any transaction-associated risks by integrating lessons 
learned from past transactions, strong due diligence, and closely managed integration processes."
"Currently, we 
are not aware of any significant risks in this area."
"Tax risks 
Merck and its subsidiaries operate worldwide and are consequently subject to different national tax laws and 
regulations."
"National tax audits of our entities are conducted on an ongoing basis by the tax authorities of the 
respective countries in which we operate."
"Tax risks originate particularly from the changes in national tax laws 
and regulations, and case laws and interpretations by national tax authorities as well as from significant 
transactions such as acquisitions, divestments and reorganizations."
"Findings of the national audit authorities of the various countries may lead to higher tax expenses and 
payments and may also have an impact on the amount of tax receivables, and tax liabilities as well as on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities."
The tax function at Merck regularly and systematically assesses the relevant tax risks.
"Appropriate standards are 
put in place to identify tax risks at an early stage in order to review, assess and mitigate them effectively and 
efficiently."
Group Tax coordinates mitigation measures with the subsidiaries.
"Risks in addition to those already 
accounted for in the balance sheet are classified as improbable to possible with moderate to significant impact."
"Information on the accounting and measurement policies for income taxes can be found under “Income tax” 
in the “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”."
"Legal risks 
Generally, we strive to minimize and control our legal risks."
"To this end, we have taken the necessary 
precautions to identify threats and defend our rights where necessary."
"Nevertheless, we are still exposed to 
risks from litigations or legal proceedings."
"In particular, these include risks in the areas of product liability, 
competition and antitrust law, pharmaceutical law, patent law, trademark law, data protection law, tax law, and 
environmental protection."
"As a research-based company, we have a valuable portfolio of industrial property 
rights, patents, and brands that could become the target of attacks and infringements."
"The outcome of future 
proceedings or those currently pending is difficult to foresee."
"For instance, we are currently involved in litigation 
with Merck & Co."
"Inc., Rahway, New Jersey (USA) (outside the United States and Canada: MSD), against whom 
we have filed lawsuits in various countries."
"This company has also sued us in the United States for trademark 
infringement, among other things."
"Due to long statutes of limitations or in some cases the absence thereof, it is not possible to rule out that we 
will face third-party claims arising from the same issue despite the conclusion of legal proceedings."
"Court or 
official rulings or settlements that we consider as “highly improbable” to “more likely than not” could lead to 
expenses with a significant to critical impact on our business and earnings."
"Despite extensive precautionary 
measures, non-compliance with laws and regulations leading to related consequences can never be completely 
excluded."
"In our opinion, the lawsuits described below constitute the most significant legal risks."
"This should 
not be seen as an exhaustive list of all legal disputes currently ongoing."
"The European 
Commission imposed a fine in June 2013."
Appeals against the decision were unsuccessful.
"Following the 
payment of the fine of around € 18 million, British health authorities brought legal claims for damages against 
Merck and other companies in a mid-triple-digit million-euro amount in fiscal 2023 due to alleged infringements 
of competition law."
"In addition, there were further claimants from various other jurisdictions who have not yet 
quantified their claims."
"In response to the latest developments in the proceedings, the provision was adjusted 
as of December 31, 2023, and is now recognized in a high single-digit million-euro amount."
"A cash outflow 
within the next twelve months is considered possible."
"Product liability risks 
Operating in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, we are exposed to product liability risks."
"Product 
liability risks can lead to considerable claims for damages, costs to avert damages, and potentially loss of 
reputation."
"In view of this, we have taken out standard liability insurance to mitigate such risks."
"However, it 
could be that the insurance coverage available is insufficient for individual cases."
"Although the occurrence of 
product liability claims in excess of the existing insurance coverage is considered improbable, individual cases 
could still have a critical effect."
"Human resources risks 
Our future growth is highly dependent on our innovative strength."
"Therefore, the expertise and engagement of 
employees in all business sectors in which we operate are crucial to our success."
"The markets relevant to the 
company are characterized by intense competition to recruit qualified specialists and talents, and by the 
challenge of being perceived by the public as an attractive employer."
"Fluctuation risks specific to countries and 
industries have to be identified ahead of time and specifically addressed in order to keep the skills and 
expertise critical to success and business within the company."
"Recruiting as well as retaining specialists and talent are therefore key priorities for the company and are 
managed through the targeted use of, for instance, employer branding initiatives, global talent, and succession 
management processes as well as competitive compensation packages."
"Nevertheless, employee-related risks 
that affect business activities are possible; even though their impact is difficult to assess we evaluated a 
potential impact on the qualitative rating scale as moderate."
"Information technology risks 
We use a variety of IT systems and processes to optimally support our globalization."
"Trends in information 
technology offer various opportunities but also harbor risks."
We maintain and operate an information protection management system based on ISO 27001.
"Our governance 
framework contains organizational, process-related, and technical information security countermeasures based on 
recognized international standards."
"In addition, we employ harmonized electronic and physical security controls (e.g."
"access control and security monitoring) to bolster our ability to handle sensitive data, such as trade secrets."
"Combined Management Report___ Report on Risks and Opportunities 
92 
 
Cyber Security is part of our Group Corporate Security Office."
"In addition, we have a Group Chief Information 
Security Officer and a network of Information Security Officers within the business sectors, each supported by 
dedicated networks."
"The individual sectors hold risk ownership and act as our first line of cyber security 
defense."
"Our Global Cyber Security function acts as a second line of defense and has responsibilities regarding 
cyber security risk governance and oversight."
Our third line of defense consists of internal audits.
Globally used IT applications form the basis for the contractual delivery of products and solutions.
"The failure of 
business-critical IT applications could therefore have a direct influence on our ability to deliver and on the 
quality of our products."
This also applies to the failure of a data center.
"To achieve the required service quality, 
we use a quality management system certified to ISO 9001 that also applies to the provision of IT."
"In addition, 
to reduce the risk of failure, we operate several redundantly designed data centers."
"Furthermore, insurance 
solutions for cybercrime offenses are in place at Group level."
"Likewise, complications with the changeover of IT systems could negatively impact the earnings situation."
"Close 
monitoring of critical IT projects serves to mitigate this risk."
"Despite the mitigation measures applied and functional continuity plans, the effects of cybercrime or the failure 
of business-critical IT applications and their influence on EBITDA pre and operating cash flow are considered to 
be possible and with a significant impact."
"Environmental, climate-related, and safety risks  
Risks arising from environment, climate as well as plant and equipment 
As a company with global production operations, we are exposed to risks of possible damage to personnel, goods 
and our reputation."
"These include physical risks stemming from exposure to droughts, storms, and floods."
"Mitigation measures such as audits, consultations and trainings on environmental protection, occupational health 
and safety minimize these risks to people as well as the environment."
"In order to ensure the continuity of plant 
and equipment, we monitor these risks both at our own sites as well as at suppliers and contract manufacturers."
"By adhering to high technical standards, our rules of conduct, and all legal requirements in environmental 
protection as well as occupational health and safety, we ensure the preservation of goods and assets."
We have taken sufficient appropriate accounting measures for the environmental risks known to us.
"We monitor 
regulatory risks in connection with the transition to a low-carbon economy, which could materialize in the mid- and 
long-term through rising carbon prices through emissions trading systems, taxes or energy legislation."
"We mitigate 
those risks with our energy and CO2 management measures."
"Mainly, we classify these as possible risks with 
moderate impacts."
"However, a critical impact on EBITDA pre or operating cash flow cannot fully be ruled out."
"Risks due to climate change 
In 2022, we performed a qualitative climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify transitional and 
physical climate-related risks that are material to our activities."
"In 2023, in accordance with TCFD 
recommendations, we conducted a quantitative climate scenario analysis to identify climate-related risks and 
opportunities."
"Consequently, we conducted an evaluation in relation to impacts of transition risks and the 
exposure related to physical hazards."
"During this assessment, we utilized two climate pathways (1.5°C and 4°C) considering different time horizons 
(2030 and 2050) to identify climate-related risks and opportunities."
"Based on our findings, we determined the 
potential effects of physical risks on our key sites and evaluated the impact of transitional risks on our business."
"In line with our ongoing dedication to risk mitigation, we continuously develop innovative and sustainable 
approaches."
"As a result, we foresee no significant deviations from our expectations regarding impacts on 
EBITDA pre or operating cash flow."
"For further details on climate-related risks, please see “Increased uncertainty due to climate risks” in the 
“Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements”."
"The overall risk of the Group, which is derived from the probability-weighted aggregation of the identified risks, 
leads to the assessment that an existence-threatening risk-scenario, for which coverage and financing of the 
losses are questionable, is improbable."
"We are convinced that we will also successfully manage the 
aforementioned challenges in the future and benefit from diversification through our different products and 
markets."
"Based on our assessment, we believe that the most promising opportunities arise from business-related 
opportunities."
"The activities described hold significant opportunities for us in the medium to long term, beyond 
the forecast period."
"We actively pursue the opportunities that arise and specify their expected effects in the 
forecast development of EBITDA pre and operating cash flow."
"Additionally, we proactively seek out new 
opportunities, assess their feasibility, and drive them forward where appropriate."
"If opportunities arise in 
addition to the forecast developments, or these occur more quickly than anticipated, this could have positive 
effects on our EBITDA pre or operating cash flow."
"Fundamental assumptions 
Against the backdrop of the ongoing highly dynamic development of macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry-
specific conditions, the forecast is also subject to greater uncertainty and volatility in fiscal 2024 than is 
normally the case."
"In terms of expected inflation, we assume a slow normalization."
We also expect a persistently volatile environment as regards the development of foreign exchange rates.
"For 
2024, we forecast an unfavorable foreign exchange development, albeit to a weaker extent than in fiscal 2023."
The negative foreign exchange effects are expected to be primarily attributable to the development of the U.S.
dollar as well as individual Asian currencies.
For the average euro/U.S.
"dollar exchange rate, our full-year 
assumption ranges between 1.07 and 1.11 for 2024."
"Combined Management Report ___ Report on Expected Developments 
95 
 
Net sales 
For fiscal 2024, we expect to return to organic sales growth, which is likely to be slight to moderate."
"The 
Healthcare business sector is expected to be the strongest growth driver, with Mavenclad® and products from 
the Cardiovascular, Metabolism & Endocrinology franchise making the main contributions to growth."
"For 
Life Science, we assume that sales in the first half of the year will still be influenced by customer destocking of 
increased inventories and that the expected recovery will thus mainly set in during the second half of 2024."
"We 
do not expect any further significant contributions from demand for products in connection with Covid-19 in 
2024."
"In the Electronics business sector, we forecast that the turnaround in the semiconductor materials 
market will come in the second half of the year, leading as expected to organic sales growth with products from 
the Semiconductor Materials business."
"The expected declining Display Solutions business will have a negative 
impact as will the project business within the Semiconductor Solutions business unit, which, as expected, is 
subject to stronger fluctuations owing to the dependency on major individual orders."
"Overall, we forecast 
foreign exchange effects of 0% to -3% for the Merck Group."
"EBITDA pre3 
For Group EBITDA pre, we also forecast a slight to moderate organic increase, which is expected to be driven 
primarily by the Healthcare business sector."
"EBITDA pre of the Life Science 
business sector is expected to be adversely impacted by negative mix effects, which we will mitigate as far as 
possible with corresponding cost savings."
"In the Electronics business sector, a favorable mix effect on sales as 
well as positive effects from active cost management are expected; however, the sale of a portfolio of licenses 
and patents in fiscal 2023 will have an opposing effect."
"The rise in costs in Corporate and Other will be mainly 
attributable to lower foreign currency hedging gains."
"The forecast foreign exchange development is likely to 
lower Group EBITDA pre by between -1% and -4%."
"Operating cash flow 
The forecast for operating cash flow is generally subject to a higher fluctuation corridor than the forecast for 
EBITDA pre."
We provide an estimate of the development of operating cash flow only for the Group as a whole.
"The development of operating cash flow will be in line with the expected positive performance of the operating 
business."
"In addition, we expect positive effects from stringent management of working capital."
"Foreign 
exchange is expected to have a negative effect."
"Accordingly, for the Merck Group, we forecast a moderate to 
strong increase in operating cash flow."
"As regards the composition of operating cash flow, we refer to the 
section entitled “Internal Management System” in the combined management report as well as the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement in the Consolidated Financial Statements."
"3 Not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); EBITDA corresponds to operating result (EBIT) adjusted by depreciation, amortization, 
impairment losses, and reversals of impairment losses."
"As of December 31, 2023, the company’s subscribed capital is divided into 129,242,251 no-par value bearer 
shares plus one registered share."
Each share therefore corresponds to € 1.30 of the share capital.
"The holder of 
the registered share is E."
"It is entitled and obliged to appoint one-third of the 
members of the Supervisory Board representing the limited liability shareholders."
"If the holder of the registered 
share is a general partner, he or she has no such right of appointment."
"The transfer of the registered share 
requires the company’s approval."
"The approval is granted at the sole discretion of the personally liable general 
partner with an equity interest, namely E."
"Pursuant to the information on voting rights submitted to us in accordance with the German Securities Trading 
Act (WpHG), on December 31, 2023, no shareholders owned direct or indirect investments exceeding 10% of 
the voting rights."
"According to the Articles of Association of Merck, the general partners not holding an equity interest who form 
the Executive Board are admitted by E."
"Merck KG with the consent of a simple majority of the other general 
partners."
"A person may be a general partner not holding an equity interest only if he or she is also a general 
partner of E."

Roles and responsibilities 
Based on the requirements set forth in charters, principles and policies, our internal standards give specific 
guidance for operational processes."
"They are constantly updated by the relevant departments and are available 
on our intranet."
"Our managers implement these standards in their respective areas of responsibility and ensure 
that they are adhered to."
"In addition, we educate and train our employees on all guidelines that apply to them."
"We employ management systems to steer processes and define goals, actions, and responsibilities."
"These 
systems are based on standards such as the internationally recognized quality management standard 
ISO 9001, good working practices (GxP) in the pharmaceutical industry and ISO 14001 for environmental 
management."
"Our company regularly undergoes ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certification, which are conducted 
by an independent auditing firm."
We hold group certificates for both standards.
"Strategic and organizational approach to sustainability 
The world is facing numerous challenges that also affect us as a company."
"These include climate change, 
international conflicts and economic crises, for instance."
"Our ambition is to leverage science and technology to 
achieve sustainable progress for mankind."
We pursue three overarching sustainability goals.
"In 2023, we revised our sustainability strategy, which we had 
communicated in 2020."
"In particular, we sharpened the second goal."
"•
In 2030, we will achieve human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable science and
technology."
"•
By 2030, we will fully integrate sustainability into our value chains."
"•
By 2040, we will achieve climate neutrality and reduce our resource consumption."
"We describe our sustainability strategy in the “Strategy” section of the combined management report within 
this Annual Report for 2023 and, in more detail, in the Sustainability Report for 2023 in the chapter entitled 
“Sustainability Strategy”."
"Measuring progress made with the sustainability strategy 
We use 14 key indicators to record and assess our progress towards achieving our sustainability goals."
"We 
defined these indicators back in 2021 and did not identify any significant non-financial performance indicators."
"The key indicator “Percentage of employees trained in sustainability” was dropped in 2023 because we had 
achieved the associated target."
"Instead, as of 2023, we began using several questions in our annual Employee 
Engagement Survey to measure how mature the sustainability culture is within our organization."
"Combined Management Report___ Non-Financial Statement 
101 
Moreover, our annual Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Board members and senior executives 
contains a sustainability factor."
"We use it to measure performance over a period of three years based on 
selected key indicators for each of our three sustainability goals."
"Consequently, target achievement based on 
the key financial performance indicators can increase or decrease by up to 20%."
"Details on how this 
sustainability factor is calculated can be found in the “Compensation Report”, which is subject to both a 
formal audit and a separate content audit performed by Deloitte."
"In 2023 and for the first time, the company 
tied 15% of variable employee compensation to sustainability parameters."
"Details on this can be found under 
“Sustainable innovation and technology” within this non-financial statement."
"Our key indicators 
Goal 1: In 2030, we will achieve human progress for more than one billion people through 
sustainable science and technology."
"Goal 2: By 2030, we will fully integrate sustainability into our value chains."
"2 The key indicator ""Percentage of employees trained on sustainability"" is no longer applicable in 2023, as the target was achieved."
"Goal 3: By 2040, we will achieve climate neutrality and reduce our resource consumption."
2 A new key figure will replace this key figure from the 2024 reporting year.
"Combined Management Report___ Non-Financial Statement 
102 
Roles and responsibilities 
Our Executive Board has Group-wide responsibility for our sustainability strategy."
"It has adopted our three 
strategic goals (details can be found under “Strategy”)."
"The Group Corporate Sustainability unit is responsible for developing and shaping the sustainability strategy 
and it informs the Executive Board at least once a year about the progress made and the need for action."
"It is 
part of the Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ), which reports to the 
Chair of the Executive Board."
"At Executive Board level, responsibility for Environment, Social, Governance 
(ESG) also lies with the Chair of the Executive Board."
"Group Corporate Sustainability is also responsible for coordinating the Merck Sustainability Board, which is 
chaired by the Head of SQ, who simultaneously serves as Chief Sustainability Officer."
"The committee consists of 
representatives from our business sectors and from key Group functions, such as Procurement, 
Communications and Controlling."
"The Sustainability Board steers and monitors the Group-wide implementation of the sustainability strategy, 
defines priorities and stipulates globally applicable sustainability policies."
"In addition, the Sustainability Board 
ensures that the initiatives of our various business sectors, Group functions and subsidiaries align with our 
global sustainability strategy."
"Moreover, it recommends corresponding initiatives to the Executive Board."
"Within 
their respective area of responsibility, each Executive Board member is also responsible for sustainability, 
reviews the priorities that have been set, and decides on the implementation of initiatives."
"In 2023, the Sustainability Board met 11 times by video conference."
"In addition to climate-related issues and 
new sustainability reporting requirements, it also addressed the adaptation of the strategy and new objectives 
for circular economy and water management."
"The Merck Sustainability Advisory Panel (MSAP) supports our company as an external expert committee for 
sustainability."

selected issues and assesses planned activities."
"Moreover, the members apply their knowledge to help address 
societal and political challenges and developments that could be strategically relevant for our businesses."
"Combined Management Report___ Non-Financial Statement 
103 
Topics for the non-financial statement 
Pursuant to section 289c (3) and section 315c (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), we are obligated to 
review topics for their double materiality."
"The principle of double materiality requires companies to disclose 
non-financial information as soon as the following two criteria are met: Firstly, the information makes it 
possible to understand how the company’s activities affect non-financial aspects."
"And secondly, the information 
is necessary to understand the course of business, results of operations and economic position of Merck KGaA 
and the Merck Group."
"In 2023, we examined the topics identified within the scope of a materiality analysis in 
accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative standards (GRI) for their double materiality."
The following topics achieved the relevance threshold for double materiality in 2023.
"They cover fiscal year 
2023 and pertain to our entire Group."
"Any deviations from the reporting framework are indicated on a case-by-
case basis."
"This includes 
tracking information on the gross risks in terms of potential damage and probability, as well as the residual net 
risks remaining after mitigation measures have been executed."
"As of the reporting date and pursuant to the 
risk analysis of the material non-financial topics, no significant risks within the meaning of section 289c (3) 
sentence 1 no."
"3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) from the company’s own business activities or 
from business relationships are known that are very likely to have or will have serious negative effects on non-
financial aspects."
"Additional risks are described in the “Report on Risks and Opportunities” in the combined 
management report."
"Our goal is to decouple business growth from 
negative environmental impacts wherever possible."
"Our production sites are located in established industrial 
and commercial zones."
"Before acquiring a company – and thus its facilities – we first conduct an environmental 
risk assessment."
"Roles and responsibilities 
The Chair of the Executive Board and CEO of our company is responsible for environmental protection, which 
also covers climate action, water management, waste and recycling, air emissions, biodiversity, and plant and 
process safety."
"Her duties include approving overarching Group-wide guidelines such as our Environment, 
Health and Safety (EHS) Policy."
"Furthermore, the Merck Sustainability Board (MSB) monitors the Group-wide 
implementation of environmental protection goals."
"The Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ) is responsible for steering all 
the related measures globally."
"SQ senior leadership approves operational standards and regularly reports on 
environmental protection to the Merck Sustainability Board."
"Every year, SQ prepares a comprehensive 
environment, health and safety report covering topics such as climate action, water management and waste 
and recycling as well as plant and process safety."
"The Merck Sustainability Board uses this report to steer the 
strategic direction and provide verification for our ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications."
"Across our business sectors, the Operations Leadership Committee (OLC) makes strategic decisions on issues 
pertaining to emissions, energy, water, and waste."
"This body comprises representatives from Life Science, 
Healthcare and Electronics as well as SQ."
"Decisions made by the OLC and any resulting actions are 
implemented by the respective business sector."
"Once per quarter, the OLC members update their leaders on 
matters relating to environmental protection and this information, if relevant, is then shared with the MSB."
"Our commitment: Standards and standard operating procedure 
Our approach to environmental management is founded on our Group EHS (Environment, Health and 
Safety) Policy, which has been approved by our Executive Board."
"Aligned with the requirements of the 
chemical industry’s Responsible Care® Global Charter and the ISO 14001 environmental management 
standard, this policy underscores our leaders’ responsibility for environmental protection and health and safety."
"It is also aimed at our suppliers, calling on them to likewise adopt high environmental sustainability and safety 
standards."
"Our EHS policy thus complements the Supplier Code of Conduct of our Group Procurement 
function."
"Through our Contractor EHS Management Standard, we aim to ensure that our contract partners also 
take environment, health and safety aspects into account."
"Material investments in environmental impact mitigation 
Efforts to prevent and monitor air, water and soil emissions entail significant expense on our part, as does proper 
waste disposal."
"Moreover, we set up provisions for groundwater and soil remediation to ensure that we can 
execute all the necessary measures."
"As of December 31, 2022, our provisions for environmental protection totaled 
€ 149 million (2022: € 148 million), 96% (2022: 94%) of which was attributable to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, 
Germany."
For details see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under (27) “Other provisions”.
"Conducted by SQ, 
these assessments serve to ensure that our requirements are being met, with appropriate corrective measures 
being implemented as needed."
"In our Group EHS audits, we assess our sites’ performance on a five-tier scale 
(“excellent”, “good”, “fair”, “poor”, and “critical”), which in turn determines how frequently audits are 
conducted."
"If the findings are deemed to be good, we audit the facility less often, while incompliances can 
increase the frequency."
"In 2023, we commissioned a total of 34 audits (2022: 41), one of them ""excellent"", 23 
of them ""good"" and 10 of them ""fair""."
"We record all incidents Group-wide and report them to the 
Executive Board annually."
"In the event of a major occurrence, our digital Rapid Incident Report System (RIRS) promptly notifies the SQ 
and Group Communications functions, which, if necessary, inform the Executive Board."
"Major incidents could 
include fatalities, accidents with multiple casualties, incidents that impact neighboring communities, or natural 
disasters such as earthquakes and flooding."
"Through the RIRS, we can quickly coordinate with all those 
involved and inform the other sites immediately of the respective event."
"In addition, employees as well as 
external stakeholders can report any violations of our standards to Group Compliance."
"In 2023, we recorded no (2022: two) significant incident-related releases of substances."
"ISO 14001:2015 Group certificate 
Since 2009, our company has held an ISO 14001 Group certificate that requires all production sites with more 
than 50 employees to implement an environmental management system with predefined indicators such as 
greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption."
Other facilities are not obligated to undergo certification.
"The annual internal audit reports and management reviews carried out under the Group certificate give us a 
better overview of how all our sites are performing."
"As in the previous year, 95 of our sites worldwide were 
covered by the ISO 14001 certificate in 2023."
Annual external audits are used to monitor our certifications.
"As part of a defined sample procedure for the 
Group certificate, a total of 34 sites were externally audited in 2023, with all audited facilities passing (2022: 
12)."
"In addition to external inspections, internal audits serve to ensure Group-wide compliance with our 
requirements."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental Matters

Climate action 
We want to do our part to preserve the climate and comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change."
"Therefore, we have set our own objectives:  
By 2030, we intend to lower our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 50% 
compared with the base year 2020."
"We aim to achieve this mainly by reducing process-related emissions, 
implementing energy efficiency measures and purchasing more electricity from renewable sources."
"In May 2022, this goal for 2030 was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which 
independently assesses and approves company targets based on its strict climate science criteria."
"This approval 
by SBTi confirms that we are contributing to limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, thus complying with the 
requirements of the Paris Agreement."
We also aim to cover 80% of our purchased electricity with renewables by 2030.
"Moreover, we aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions across the entire value chain by 52% compared with 2020 
(per euro of gross profit) by 2030."
This target was also approved by SBTi.
"By 2040, we intend to have achieved climate-neutral operations throughout our entire value chain; this target 
covers our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance is responsible for overseeing all climate action efforts 
throughout the Group, with our individual sites and business sectors worldwide implementing the necessary 
measures at the local level."
More information can be found under “Environmental protection”.
"Our commitment: Standards and legal frameworks 
We have three EHS standards in place to manage energy and process-related emissions consistently across the 
Group, specifically “Energy Management”, “Air Emissions” and “Emissions of Refrigerants”."
"We use an internal 
audit process to randomly check compliance with all EHS standards."
"Emissions reduced further 
In 2023, we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 17% compared with the previous year, emitting a 
total of approximately 1,463,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2eq) (2022: 1,760,000)."
"Our direct emissions (Scope 1) totaled 1,236,000 metric tons of CO2eq (2022: 1,518,000), with process-related 
emissions accounting for 990.000 metric tons of CO2eq and fuel use accounting for the remainder."
"Indirect 
emissions (Scope 2) totaled roughly 227,000 metric tons of CO2eq (2022: 242,000) calculated according to the 
market-based method (approximately 381,000 metric tons of CO2eq according to the location-based method)."
"Greenhouse gas emission intensity (Scope 1 and 2) amounted to 0.07 Kg of CO2eq per € of net sales in this 
period (2022: 0.08)."
"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines 15 categories for Scope 3 emissions from upstream and downstream 
activities."
"In 2023, these emissions totaled around 4,594,000 metric tons of CO2eq (2022: 6,680,000)."
"Categories 1 and 2 (Purchased Goods and Services and Capital Goods) accounted for 62% (2022: 69%) of our 
total Scope 3 emissions in this period."
"31 
of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions or divestments of (parts of) companies, or for changes in emission factors (portfolio-adjusted)."
2 Baseline for our emission targets is 2020.
"4 In 2023, we adjusted our Scope 1 and Scope 2 calculations to reflect minor data corrections."
"5 In 2023, we adapted the Scope 1 calculations to the modified global warming potentials of the IPCC 6th assessment report (previously IPCC 5th 
assessment report) and restated previous years accordingly."
6 The figures presented here have been calculated in accordance with the market-based method.
7 We adapted the calculations to the complete Greenhouse Gas Protocol requirements.
"We have included the following gases in our calculation of direct and indirect CO2eq emissions: 
Direct CO2 emissions: CO2, HFCs, PFCs, CH4, N2O, NF3, SF6."
Indirect CO2 emissions: CO2.
"31 
of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions or divestments of (parts of) companies, or for changes in emission factors (portfolio-adjusted)."
2 The reported figures contain 95-97% of our total spend.
"The difference stems from smaller sites that are not integrated in our Group-wide purchase 
volume data."
2020 data are slightly over-reported (approx.
3%) as the currency conversion factor (USD to EUR) from 2021 was used.
"Non-categorized 
spends are distributed pro rate to category 1 and 2."
"3 We updated environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIO) factors, and we adjusted our emission calculation approach for service categories 
using primary supplier data."
"4 Due to high efforts for data preparation, we reference 2020 data for 2021."
"5 In 2023, we introduced a new and improved calculation methodology based on primary data from suppliers/logistics service providers and an energy-
based bottom-up calculation approach."
6 We adjusted our calculation methodology to remove non-GHG relevant waste streams.
7 We adjusted our calculation methodology to take into account the results of an internal employee survey on home office use.
8 Already covered under Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
9 Our company produces a huge variety of intermediate products for various purposes.
"Due to their many applications and our customer structure, the 
associated greenhouse gas emissions cannot be tracked in a reasonable fashion."
"10 In 2023, we adapted the Category 11 calculations to the modified global warming potentials of the IPCC 6th assessment report (previously IPCC 5th 
assessment report) and restated previous years accordingly."
"11 Due to high efforts for data preparation, we partly use 2020 data for 2022."
"12 This category is not relevant for us as we do not operate franchises, i.e."
"businesses operating under a license to sell or distribute another company’s 
goods or services."
Out-licensing in the pharmaceutical sector is not regarded as franchising.
"Biogenic emissions (Scope 3), if present, are not being recorded."

Transparency on CO2 emissions and energy consumption 
We report to CDP on an annual basis."
"This organization assesses the ways in which companies are working to 
lower greenhouse gas emissions and minimize the risks and consequences of climate change, along with their 
strategy for doing so."
"Companies are rated from A to D-, with A being the top score."
"In 2023, we scored A- 
(2022: B) for climate change."
"Energy consumption and renewable energy 
We consumed 2,337 gigawatt hours of energy in 2023 compared with 2,432 gigawatt hours in 2022."
"As in the 
previous year, our energy intensity relative to sales remained at 0.11 kWh/€ in 2023."
"In 2023, we further strengthened our focus on purchasing electricity from renewable sources."
"In this period, we 
sourced 51% of our purchased electricity from renewable energies, meaning direct supply contracts and energy 
attribute certificates (2022: 47%)."
"The share of our total energy consumption by renewable energies increased 
to 23% in 2023 (2022: 20%)."
"In 2023, we signed virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) in Europe for a total of around 300 gigawatt 
hours (GWh) of renewable energy per year."
"This means that 100% of our electricity currently purchased in the 
European Union (EU) and Switzerland will be covered with renewable energy certificates as of 2025."
"31 of the reporting year and retroactively adjusted for acquisitions or divestments of (parts of) companies, or for changes in emission factors 
(portfolio-adjusted)."
"2 Light and heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), diesel, biodiesel, gasoline and kerosene."
We use photovoltaics to produce power at multiple sites.
"We currently only record purchased secondary energy – this is primarily electricity and, to a lesser extent, heat, 
steam and cold."
"Details on the local energy mix, including the respective percentage of primary energy, 
renewable energy, etc."
"Data on local energy efficiency in electricity or heat generation are not 
available either."
Our production sites are located in countries with a widely varying energy mix.

Water management 
To us, sustainable water management means obtaining freshwater or discharging treated wastewater without 
negatively impacting aquatic ecosystems."
We are also concerned with addressing water scarcity.
"To determine 
whether a site is in a water-stressed area, we apply a risk factor of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas of the World 
Resources Institute (WRI)."
"We want to reduce the environmental impact of our wastewater and make our 
processes more water efficient."
"In the medium term, we will also consider water-related risks in our supply 
chain when purchasing important raw materials."
"In the long term, we aim to transparently map water use and 
environmental impacts throughout the entire life cycle of our products."
"To this end, we have defined two targets: Firstly, we originally aimed to achieve a 10% reduction in our Merck 
Water Intensity Score by 2025 compared with the baseline of 2020."
"In 2023, we met and surpassed this target, 
successfully lowering the Merck Water Intensity Score by 25% in comparison with the baseline year 2020."
"Consequently, we have set a new target based on a new and more transparent calculation."
"By 2030, we strive 
to achieve a 50% reduction in our water efficiency ratio of water intake per revenues compared with the 2020 
baseline."
The new target covers the complete water intake of our company.
"Our 2020 baseline year was chosen 
to align this new target with other existing environmental goals."
"Our second objective focuses on mitigating our 
environmental impact."
"Specifically, we are committed to reducing potentially harmful residues in our 
wastewater to levels below the established no-effect threshold."
"Our regular EHS audits at our production and development facilities also review site-specific water management 
practices."
"Our water management efforts focus more heavily on our manufacturing sites than our 
administrative facilities as production generally poses a higher risk to aquatic ecosystems."
"Roles and responsibilities 
The Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance is responsible for water 
management."
"At our sites, engineers work closely with our EHS managers to reduce water consumption and 
treat wastewater."
Further information can be found under “Environmental protection”.
"All three standards are based on the commitments 
we made under the Responsible Care® initiative."
Our Wastewater Standard defines criteria for assessing our wastewater discharges into ecosystems.
"It also 
helps us achieve our targets regarding trace substances in wastewater from our operations."
"The Water Use 
Standard sets out mandatory Group-wide requirements for the responsible consumption of water."
"The Water 
Risk Management standard establishes a way for us to manage the risks that arise from direct or indirect water 
extraction and covers risks such as contaminated rainwater and flooding."
"We perform internal EHS audits to 
verify that our sites comply with our three standards."
"All sites are required to measure and assess the risks and 
impacts of the hazardous substances in their wastewater."
"Moreover, they must also analyze withdrawal and 
wastewater risks and comply with the respective requirements of the local authorities."
"Water withdrawals from our own wells and local suppliers 
For the most part, we draw water used for our production processes from our own wells and source drinking 
water from local suppliers."
"In doing so, we do not want water extraction to impair any protected areas, 
sensitive ecosystems or habitats."
We extract less water from our own wells than the amounts permitted.
"We 
simultaneously monitor potential trends that could lead to the reclassification of water sources, which involves 
assigning heightened levels of protection to specific regions."
The cooling water used in our production processes generally runs in a circular system.
"Depending on 
regulatory standards and the energy footprint, we sometimes use freshwater for cooling in a once-through 
system."
"However, this is only done in regions with high freshwater availability."
"For certain applications, we treat 
production wastewater and reuse it."
"In 2023, we recycled a total of 20.5 million m3 of water (2022: 20.7)."
"Here, the water is fed back directly into natural circulation."
"Using water more efficiently 
We seek to minimize our impact on water availability in the vicinity of our sites."
"In 2023, we withdrew 
12.1 million m3 of water in total (2022: 13.2)."
"We assess local conditions to determine whether a sufficient 
water supply is available."
"In our water conservation efforts, we pay particular attention to sites in water-scarce 
areas."
"To measure how we improve our water efficiency, we have defined the Merck Water Intensity Score, 
which relates the amount of water either purchased or withdrawn from our own wells at a site to the number of 
hours worked, taking local water availability into account."
"In 2023, we already exceeded our target set for 2025 to lower the Merck Water Intensity Score by 10% (baseline 
year 2020)."
"Initiatives that helped us reach our original goal include effects from shifts in product mix as well as 
initiatives such as recycling of wastewater in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), St."
Louis (USA) and Mollet del Valles (Spain).
"We have therefore set ourselves a new target: By 2030 we will reduce our sales-normalized water intake by 50% 
compared with 2020 (2020: 792 m3 per million € net sales (100%), 2023: 580 m3 per million € net sales (-30%))."
"In the past, our Gernsheim site in Germany was excluded from both the score and our water conservation 
efforts because we must extract a minimum water quantity from our own wells to meet regulatory 
requirements."
"Our new target will cover the entire Group, including Gernsheim."
"Our wastewater 
In 2023, we generated a total of 11.1 million m3 of wastewater (2022: 12.4)."
"This comprised around 7.6 million m3 
of “direct discharge” water (2022: 8.6) into surface waters."
"3.4 million m3 was classified as “indirect discharge” 
(2022: 3.8) water and treated at external treatment plants."
"We have appointed an expert for each of our business sectors to provide guidance for our 
sites."
"This approach aims to reduce the amount of pharmaceutically active ingredient residues as well as all 
substances with water-hazardous properties."
"All wastewater from relevant sites is processed in wastewater 
treatment plants before being discharged into the environment."
"This is done either in our own plants or by 
offsite third parties such as municipal wastewater treatment plants."
"Assessing our water management practices 
In addition to reporting on our climate action efforts, we also report water-related data to the CDP, which 
collects environmental data from companies once a year and evaluates their processes and performance on a 
scale from A to D-."
"As in the previous year, we were awarded a B for our water management practices in 2023."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental Matters

Plant, process and transport safety 
We seek to minimize manufacturing process hazards wherever possible in order to prevent workplace accidents, 
production outages and chemical spills."
"To this end, we regularly review our approach to plant and process 
safety and continuously gauge it using our EHS key indicators."
"Moreover, all our shipments are to reach our customers and sites safely, undamaged and with the required 
safety information."
Several of the materials we store and transport are classified as hazardous.
"The storage of 
such dangerous goods and the transport thereof – whether by road, rail, air, or water – are governed by global 
regulations."
"To minimize risks to people and the environment, we apply strict safety requirements across the 
Group that also comply with applicable laws."
"We conduct regular reviews to ensure our own warehouses as well 
as those of third parties comply with these regulations."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Overriding responsibility for plant, process and transport safety lies with the Group function Corporate 
Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ), which coordinates plant and process safety for the company 
and defines Group-wide EHS standards and regulations."
"Our commitment: Internal standards and international rules 
To ensure safe operation throughout the lifetime of a plant, our Group-wide EHS standards contain specific 
rules for production plants and processes."
"These include specifications that determine how special risk analyses 
and hazard assessments are to be carried out."
"We have also defined measures for the event of accidental 
release of chemical substances and for fire protection."
Our Group-wide EHS standards stipulate the safety levels for the storage of hazardous materials at our sites.
"Along with supplementary standard operating procedures and best practice documents, these EHS standards 
describe the technology, equipment and organizational infrastructure needed to achieve the appropriate safety 
levels."
Contract warehouses must also adhere to our strict safety requirements.
"Before we sign a contract with 
an operator, they must submit a statement detailing how they meet our prerequisites."
"Our Group-wide EHS 
standards also define the technical and organizational requirements for such warehouses."
"Our Group Transport Safety Standard is based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of 
Dangerous Goods."
"This guideline is especially important for sites in countries with inadequate local regulations 
covering the conveyance of hazardous materials."
"Assessing potential risks 
Before commissioning a plant, we draft a safety concept, which is subject to continuous review throughout the 
entire lifetime of the facility."
It is updated as needed until the facility is decommissioned.
"This safety concept 
contains an overview of potential risks and specifies corresponding protective measures."
"In the event that 
alterations are made to a plant, we reassess the hazard and risk situation."
"Our Risk Management Process 
guides all our sites in identifying and assessing risks and serves to devise further measures to minimize them."
"We use internal EHS audits to complement the inspections conducted by our EHS and dangerous goods 
managers in order to ensure that our sites comply with process, plant, transport, and storage safety 
regulations."
"Normally, these audits are conducted every three years at production sites and every four years at 
warehouse and distribution sites."
"If major shortcomings are identified, we re-audit the respective site the 
following year."
"Conversely, we may decide to extend the period between audits at facilities where, based on the 
findings from previous audits, we deem the potential risk to be low."
"Our sites are required to rectify any 
deficiencies discovered during the audit, with the auditor subsequently checking whether the specified 
corrective actions have been taken."
"In 2023, we conducted 34 EHS audits (2022: 41) in accordance with our 
Group-wide EHS standards."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental Matters

Keeping a close eye on safety 
We track EHS performance indicators at all production and warehouse facilities, as well as at major research 
sites, including both accidents and near misses."
"We investigate each individual incident and then devise 
appropriate countermeasures in an effort to reduce the likelihood of such events reoccurring in the future."
"EHS 
performance indicator data are reported once a month within each business sector, with the Executive Board 
receiving reports on the topic once per year."
"Four indicators are particularly important to us: 
• 
Under our EHS Incident Rate (EHS IR), we track and evaluate all major and minor accidents and incidents 
as well as further EHS-relevant incidents."
"The EHS IR covers both our own employees as well as those of 
contractors."
"To calculate it, we state the number of incidents and the severity of the event in relation to the 
number of hours worked."
"The lower the EHS Incident Rate, the safer the site is."
"In 2023, the ratio was 2.4 
(2022: 2.8)."
"• 
The EHS IR also contains our Loss of Primary Containment (LoPC) indicator."
"In 2023, we did not record any 
significant incident-related releases of substances (2022: two)."
"• 
The EHS Leading Rate (EHS LR) reflects the number and the results of the analyses of near misses and 
hazardous conditions or behaviors, as well as other proactive safety activities such as risk assessments."
"• 
For the Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) we set ourselves the goal of lowering our Group-wide LTIR to 
under 1.0 by 2025 (number of accidents Group-wide resulting in at least one missed day of work per 
million hours worked)."
"In 2023, our LTIR was 1.3 (2022: 1.2)."
"Chemical product safety 
Product safety is one of our top priorities."
"During the product development phase, we investigate the potential 
adverse impacts of chemical substances."
"Along the entire value chain of our products – from raw materials to 
manufacture and commercialization – we provide relevant information on their hazardous properties and how to deal 
with them."
"These instructions facilitate the safe handling and use of our products in line with pertinent regulatory 
requirements."
We publish this information primarily on the relevant digital channels.
"As paper safety data sheets are 
still common in some countries, we can also provide these upon request through our customer service."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Our Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics business sectors have organizational structures in place to 
implement our product safety strategy in line with their respective business requirements and customer needs."
"This approach includes registering chemicals, classifying hazardous substances and highlighting risks using 
safety data sheets, labels and digital communication tools."
"Our Group standard provides a framework for governing the setup of effective operational processes for product 
safety, hazard communication and chemical regulatory compliance throughout our business sectors."
"In 
addition, the Group Chemicals Regulations Council fosters cross-sectoral alignment of strategic regulatory 
activities required for existing and emerging chemicals regulations as well as sustainability and identifies 
potential impacts for our company."
"This approach also applies to innovative fields of development such as nanomaterials, which we use with the 
greatest of care in line with the precautionary principle."
"Furthermore, our Group-wide Policy for Use and 
Handling of Nanomaterials provides the necessary guidance on the use of these materials."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Environmental Matters 
113 
 
Legal requirements and internal guidelines 
Our internal standard defines the roles, responsibilities and basic processes required to comply with national 
and international regulations."
"In addition, we have also endorsed voluntary commitments of the chemical 
industry such as the Responsible Care® Global Charter."
"Using the Globally Harmonized System for Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) for hazard 
communication enables us to streamline our internal processes and provide consistent, harmonized and high-
quality information to our customers."
"In 2023, there was one incident of non-compliance with regulations concerning potential health and safety 
impacts and the labeling of our chemical products."
"Some information and the REACH registration number was 
missing on a safety data sheet which resulted in a fine in Italy."
"In this regard, to the best of our knowledge, 
there were no negative impacts on human health or the environment."
"Safety analysis of our products 
Safe and sustainable by design implies that product safety starts during development."
"Therefore, at an early 
stage of our product development process, we analyze innovations in terms of their impacts on human health 
and the environment."
"We continuously evaluate the intrinsic hazards of both our existing and new products to 
create relevant product safety information in line with applicable rules."
"Product safety information 
Chemical product safety is all about protecting human health and the environment from adverse impacts 
resulting from the use of chemical products throughout their life cycle."
"To achieve this, we provide relevant 
information to our customers and the public, which helps to raise awareness of the hazards and build a greater 
understanding of how to mitigate risks and use the products safely."
"To obtain the relevant information on hazard profiles, we employ industry-standard digital tools through which 
we gather information available on the substances we use."

Employee-Related Matters 
Attracting and retaining talent 
To ensure our ongoing success, we are focusing on the future by creating meaningful impacts and building needed 
capabilities."
"At the same time, we must respond to changing demographics and adapt to the behaviors and 
expectations of the highly competitive talent market."
"Therefore, in 2023, we continued to enhance our talent 
acquisition strategy with a more personal, employee-focused approach."
"Our talent sourcing approach aims to build 
inclusive pipelines and effectively recruit diverse talent with the needed competencies and capabilities to our 
organization."
"In addition, our talent retention approach is inclusive in targeting various employee groups."
"In 2023, 
we intensified our efforts to support internal mobility."
"For example, we launched a dedicated project to improve 
organizational agility, up-skilling and re-skilling, retention, and engagement."
"Specific modules went live in 2023, 
and we will roll out the complete platform with all functionalities during the course of 2024."
We have designed our compensation structure to provide valuable benefits to our employees and their families.
"Our benefits offerings recognize the diversity and uniqueness of our employees while providing flexibility 
wherever possible."
"Additionally, our international employee mobility programs create an environment suited to 
the needs of a rapidly evolving workforce."
"Total number of employees

"For the 2023 reporting year, we hav e aligned the scope of 
consolidation also for the employee data in the non-financial reporting with the financial reporting."
"As of now, the figures relate to all employees who 
are employed in fully consolidated subsidiaries that manage personnel."
"2 The sharp decline in comparison with the previous year (8,485 employees) is attributable to the fact that in addition to Healthcare KGaA, which was 
hived off in 2019, the two other business sectors, namely Life Science und Electronics, have now also been transferred to separate legal entities."
"Employee age by region 
As of Dec."
"2 Formula for calculating the rate of new employee hires by age/gender/region: New employee hires of the focus group divided by the total number of 
new employee hires."
"The rate excludes employees who pause due to parental leave or a long-term illness, as well as 
employees who are transitioning to the non-working phase of partial retirement."
"2 The employee turnover rate is calculated as follows: Total number of leavers from the past 12 months divided by the average employee headcount 
multiplied by 100."
"3 The figures do not reflect the approximately 500 Allergopharma employees, who were not included in the employee turnover rate  due to the divestment 
of the business."
"In 2023, the average length of service for employees Group-wide was 9.7 years (2022: 9.2 years), with 15.2 
years (2022: 15.4 years) for Merck KGaA employees."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Group Human Resources (HR) supports and advises all business sectors and Group functions within our 
organization regarding our human capital, especially topics related to recruiting, vocational training and 
advanced training."
"Across all our sites, HR employees work with leaders from various functions and business 
sectors to employ strategies that engage our people in line with Group-wide HR guidelines and requirements, 
including attractive compensation models and benefits."
"In accordance with the audit plan, we conduct internal 
audits every two to three years to ensure that we implement our guidelines effectively."
The Chair of the Executive Board and CEO is responsible for Group Human Resources.
"Our Chief HR Officer, 
who leads the HR function and oversees all our HR activities, reports directly to the Chair of the Executive 
Board and CEO."
"Our Business Services unit oversees the operational tasks of HR work, such as drafting 
contracts and payroll accounting."
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for this unit.
"Our High-Impact Culture is founded on six behaviors: obsessed with customers and patients; act as the owner; 
be curious and innovate boldly; simplify and act with urgency; raise the bar; disagree openly, decide and 
deliver."
We regularly inform managers and employees about these behaviors through global campaigns.
"Our People Development and Learning Policy provides a Group-wide framework that guides employees in 
managing their professional growth."
"It defines requirements for our development opportunities, roles and 
responsibilities."
"A competitive compensation structure 
We reward the performance of our employees in order to maintain a competitive edge in attracting and 
retaining the best talent."
"Within our Group, we base compensation on the requirements of each position and 
each employee’s respective performance."
"We make no distinctions based on gender or any other diversity 
criteria."
"To ensure we maintain a competitive compensation structure, we regularly review our compensation 
policy based on data analyses and industry benchmarks."
"This enables us to compare internal factors and 
market requirements in equal measure."
"Before making changes to our compensation structure, we consult with 
key stakeholders such as employee representatives, as applicable."
"In addition to individual performance, our annual incentive plan also measures company performance based on 
financial and non-financial key indicators in our scorecard."
"The non-financial key indicators focus on the 
company's priorities and are designed to support our High-Impact Culture as well as our sustainability strategy 
and progress in terms of diversity, equality and inclusion."
"Furthermore, since 2022, we have included a 
sustainability factor in our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)."
"More information on the LTIP can be found in the 
Notes of our Annual Report."
"Strengthening our sustainability culture 
Since 2021, e-Learnings on our sustainability strategy are a mandatory training component for existing and 
new employees."
"While this was the first step of our upskilling journey, we have extended our offer with 
function- and hierarchy-specific educational activities."
"Furthermore, from 2023 on, we use the sustainability 
questions from our annual employee engagement survey to measure the impact of our activities."
"The survey 
results are only used internally."
"They help us to understand the maturity of a sustainability mindset in the 
company and to detect and address functional, regional or hierarchical differences."
"The corresponding key 
indicator “Result of the employee engagement survey on sustainability culture” replaces the previous year’s 
achieved key indicator “Percentage of employees trained on sustainability”."

Diversity, equity and inclusion 
We are committed to promoting a strong sense of inclusion and belonging among our employees."
"Therefore, we 
approach diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) with the same purpose as our other global business objectives 
and aspirations."
"While we have always been a diverse organization – we currently span 65 countries and have 
about 63,000 employees from 141 nationalities – we recognize that our success depends on our ability to foster 
equity and inclusion."
"In addition, our DE&I approach fuels our efforts to make positive impacts in the 
communities where we live and work."
"We expect our leaders and managers to be mindful and considerate in 
how they attract, hire, retain, and promote their people."
"We aim to help every employee maximize their 
potential, regardless of their gender identity, culture, ethnicity, race, religion or creed, sexual orientation, 
nationality, socioeconomic and family status, language, disability status, age, mindset, faiths, military service, 
or political conviction."
"We strive to create equitable outcomes and identify and eliminate any barriers that may hinder our employees’ 
contributions or their access to opportunities or career advancement."
"Ultimately, we believe diversity inspires 
progress and strengthens our ability to innovate in all areas of our business."

are employed in fully consolidated subsidiaries that manage personnel."
"2 The sharp decline in comparison with the previous year (8,485 employees) is attributable to the fact that in addition to Healthcare KGaA, which was 
hived off in 2019, the two other business sectors, namely Life Science und Electronics, have now also been transferred to separate legal entities."
"Roles and responsibilities 
The Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer is responsible for our global DE&I strategy and for steering its 
related activities."
"In this role, she reports directly to the Chair of the Executive Board, whose Board 
responsibilities include Group Human Resources."
"In addition, we have established a centralized Diversity 
Council comprising high-ranking executives from all our business sectors and selected Group functions."
"Our commitment: Industry-wide initiatives and regulations 
Our Social and Labor Standards Policy categorically states that our company does not tolerate any form of 
discrimination, physical or verbal harassment, or intolerance."
"We accelerated the impact of our national DE&I 
advocates in our 18 major countries and developed tailored roadmaps for each market."
"We also published our 
Premier DE&I Report, providing detailed evidence of our strategy implementation and initiatives."
"In 2021, we pledged to our people, partners, patients, and industry to intensify our DE&I efforts and set robust 
aspirations."
"In 2023, we demonstrated that we are on track to meeting our 2030 goals."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-Related Matters

Gender equity 
We developed measures to achieve a more balanced gender structure at various hierarchical levels of our 
business."
"We are making consistent progress and have increased the share of women in leadership (roles 4+) 
to 39% (2022: 38%) and senior management positions (roles 6+) to 29% (2022: 27%) while maintaining a 
44% proportion of women in our global workforce (2022: 43%)."
"This means our share of women in leadership 
has increased by 12 percentage points since 2015."
"Building on these efforts, we aim to achieve gender parity in 
leadership positions by 2030."
"Moreover, we are committed to fair and equitable pay for all employees."
"Our 
Executive Board comprises two female members (our CEO and CFO) and three male members, bringing the 
share of women to 40% (2022: 20%)."
"Culture and ethnicity 
With 23% (2022: 24%) of our employees based in the United States and 27% (2022: 27%) of net sales coming 
from the United States it is crucial that we become an employer of choice among underrepresented racial and 
ethnic groups in this market."
"Therefore, we plan to increase the share of employees in U.S."
"leadership (roles 
4+) who are members of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups from 23% (2022: 21%) to 30% by 2030."
"In 2023, we developed an Action Plan on Culture, Nationality and Ethnicity as well as a toolkit for leaders and 
HR to accelerate our progress as regards these aspects."
"Inclusion 
Beyond our aspiration to foster specific types of diversity and equity, we are accelerating our efforts to create a 
genuinely inclusive culture for all employees."
"To achieve this, we rolled out training courses to help leaders 
reflect on how they can lead more inclusively."
"All leaders will be encouraged to complete these courses over the 
coming years."
"At the end of 2023, 92% (2022: 64%) of our leaders had participated in this training program."
"Committed to fair and equitable pay 
Our commitment to pay equity is a crucial aspect of our DE&I strategy."
"To create transparency around 
unexplained pay gaps and identify their underlying root causes, we started a gender pay equity analysis in 2021."
"In the first step, we analyzed ten of our largest countries, covering approximately 80% of our total workforce."
"In 
2023, we extended the analysis to all countries, except North America which is planned in 2024."
"The identified 
adjusted gender pay gap continues to be less than 1.5%, which is below benchmarks in the industry."
"We have 
developed a plan for a recurring analysis to continuously monitor pay data and to take effective actions as needed."
"These include individual adjustments based on the results of the analysis, as well as educating our HR community 
on the topic and taking other steps to ensure we make equitable and unbiased pay decisions."
"Ensuring fair treatment for all 
We do not tolerate any form of discrimination in our company, as stipulated with binding effect in our Code of 
Conduct and Social and Labor Standards Policy."
"In January 2024, we published a new position paper on 
disability inclusion to complement our existing papers on DE&I, non-discrimination and non-
harassment."
"In addition, we have established various reporting channels to ensure employees have a clear 
point of contact should they experience harassment or discrimination in the workplace or any other violations of 
our standards."
"Their first points of contact are their supervisors, HR or compliance teams, and they can also 
make anonymous calls to our compliance hotline."
"In the reporting year, our HR Business Partners involved in 
HR-related compliance case investigations participated in a training and upskilling program to equip them with 
enhanced employee relations and investigation skills."
"In 2023, 30 (2022: 20) alleged cases of discrimination or 
harassment were reported via the compliance hotline and other channels, seven (2022: seven) of which were 
confirmed on our global reporting platform and appropriate action was taken."

Health and safety 
We seek to promote the health of our employees and sustain their long-term performance ability, which in turn 
necessitates a safe workplace."
"We are therefore constantly working to further strengthen our health and safety 
culture."
"The lost time injury rate (LTIR) is an important indicator used to gauge the success of our occupational safety 
efforts."
"It comprises all accidents worldwide that have resulted in at least one day of missed work per one 
million hours worked."
"We determine the Group-wide LTIR both for our employees and supervised temporary 
staff."
Our objective is to lower the LTIR to below 1.0 by 2025.
"Generally, before starting any activity, we perform a hazard assessment to identify risks and do everything 
possible to eliminate them before commencing the activity or commissioning a plant."
"If this is not feasible, we 
put measures in place to minimize the likelihood of risks and their potential impacts."
"Hazard assessments are 
the responsibility of our individual sites and are therefore conducted by them."
"In October 2023, we launched BeHealthy, our global employee health strategy, to our workforce."
"It is designed 
to further strengthen the physical, mental, social, and workplace health of our employees."
"Moreover, in 2023, 
we introduced a key indicator for health, planned to comprise our health index on the one hand and the 
implementation status of the BeHealthy strategy on the other hand."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Our Health and Safety management system is the responsibility of Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade 
Compliance, which in turn reports to the Chair of the Executive Board."
"This Group function sets objectives, 
oversees the respective initiatives globally and conducts internal EHS audits."
"Local EHS managers and their 
teams ensure that our individual sites comply with all occupational health and safety laws and regulations."
"They 
are also responsible for local projects, campaigns, and programs."
"Employees concerned about their health or safety are permitted to temporarily step back from their work until 
the issue has been resolved."
"Globally, across the Group, they are encouraged to report such concerns via our 
compliance hotline."
"Our commitment: Standards and policies 
Our Corporate EHS Policy (Corporate Environment, Health and Safety Policy) describes our fundamental 
approach to occupational health and safety, among other things."
"It is part of our EHS management system and 
undergoes an external ISO 45001 audit every year."
"As part of a Group certificate, our occupational health and 
safety management system was ISO 45001-certified at 66 sites at the end of 2023."
"Together with the Group-wide health strategy BeHealthy, we launched the newly developed Merck Group 
Employee Health Standard in October 2023."
"It describes the fundamental requirements that a site must fulfill as 
regards employee health."
"In addition, the standard specifies our approach to ensuring workplace safety for our 
employees while also promoting their health and well-being."
"Furthermore, we set out our Group-wide approach to 
health and safety management, which is aimed at preventing workplace accidents and occupational illnesses."
"We expect our contractors to comply with environmental as well as health and safety requirements throughout 
the entire process, from starting a job to completion."
"This objective is reflected in our Group-wide Contractor 
EHS Management Standard."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Employee-Related Matters

Accident rates 
Our employees are required to immediately report any relevant occupational accidents to Corporate 
Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance, where these accidents are assessed."
"If necessary, we then 
implement additional safety measures."
"This procedure is common practice across all production facilities around 
the world."
"We document the following occupational safety data across our sites worldwide: 
• 
The LTIR measures the accidents resulting in at least one day of missed work per one million hours worked."
"In comparison with the previous year, our LTIR increased slightly to 1.3 (2022: 1.2)."
"The majority of 
incidents resulting in lost time were slips, trips and falls, along with contusions and lacerations from the 
operation of machinery and equipment."
"Once more, in 2023, we recorded no fatal accidents."
"• 
We use our EHS Incident Rate (EHS IR) to document incidents."
"• 
Alongside this indicator, in the United States, we also use the Occupational Illness Rate to monitor work-
related illnesses and their long-term effects."
"Through the LTIR, we record work-related accidents that involve at least one day of missed work."
"A work-
related accident is an injury that results from the type of work, in the course of doing said work, and that has 
no internal cause."
"Work-related accidents are considered relevant if they occur on the premises, on business 
trips, during goods transport, as a result of external influences (e.g."
"natural disasters), or due to criminal acts 
involving personal injury."
"Commuting accidents and accidents during company sporting activities are not 
included."
"First-aid incidents are generally not included in the LTIR since these usually do not result in more than 
one day of missed work."
"Clear rules of conduct 
Group-wide, all newly appointed site EHS managers must complete an EHS onboarding training that covers the 
topics of occupational health and safety as well as our “BeSafe!” safety culture program."
"Through the “BeSafe!” 
program, we raise employee awareness of occupational hazards and teach them rules for safe behavior."
"In 
addition, we regularly provide occupational safety training at our sites covering both legal requirements and the 
specific risks."
"Therefore, we have introduced 
relevant strategies, processes and guidelines to prevent violations of supply chain standards and continuously 
improving our sustainability performance."
"Unless stated otherwise, the approaches presented apply to tier-1 
suppliers, i.e."
"Furthermore, our supplier management activities include special measures 
particularly for tier-n suppliers, i.e."
"indirect suppliers, working in the area of conflict minerals."
"To achieve our sustainability goals, our Procurement team is working closely with our suppliers."
"We aim to 
create transparency in all our sourcing regions and fully integrate sustainability into all our value chains."
"To this 
end, we have defined two key indicators to measure our journey towards increasing this transparency by 
reviewing the sustainability performance of our relevant suppliers based on valid sustainability assessments."
"Our definition of valid sustainability assessment includes assessments carried out over the last three years and 
performed by a reliable, approved source."
"In accordance with our risk management approach, we define 
relevant suppliers as suppliers, which either indicate a specific country and/or industry risk or contribute to a 
significant percentage of our supplier spend (at least 50%)."
"For the country risk evaluation, we have developed 
our own comprehensive country risk score."
"In 2023, 66% (2022: 46%) of our relevant suppliers were covered by a valid sustainability assessment; 94% 
(2022: 82%) of our spend attributable to these suppliers was covered by suppliers with a valid sustainability 
assessment."
"We consider all applicable legal requirements, such as the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, and initiate 
corresponding measures where necessary."
"Among other things and in conjunction with the implementation of 
the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, we have implemented a risk management approach focusing on 
human rights and environmental risks along our supply chain."
"This risk assessment is conducted annually and 
ad-hoc when required."
"Risk management process 
To ensure security of supply, we select our suppliers based on criteria such as country risk, material risk, 
supplier risk, and their strategic importance to the business."
"This process helps our Category Sourcing teams to 
identify potential mitigation actions with relevant suppliers and supports them in making improvements."
"Our 
risk management approach comprises four main elements: 
• 
Supplier Risk Assessments: to capture the overarching risks at the supplier level we consider multiple risk 
domains."
"• 
Alert system: to notify our Procurement organization about risk events arising with any of our suppliers."
"• 
Material Risk Assessments: to identify and mitigate the risks of the materials used in our most significant 
finished products."
This element focuses on our business sector Life Science.
"In 2023 we conducted 
assessments for more than 2,500 of our critical materials."
"• 
Risk Response Tracker: a system to create and monitor risk mitigation activities in inter-disciplinary teams."
"We calculate risk factors for suppliers and raw materials by multiplying risk probability and risk impact 
according to current human rights risk standards."
"We also include criteria for identifying supplier relationships 
impacted by key sustainability risks, such as mineral sourcing and animal welfare."
"These minerals involve the risk of being extracted, traded, 
handled, and exported from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs) where human rights are not always 
respected and violations thereof need to be prevented."
"Our aim is to source materials in a responsible and conflict-free manner and not to contribute to adverse 
impacts through our activities."
"Therefore, we have a due diligence program that applies across all our business 
sectors and takes into account applicable laws and international standards."
"Additionally, we have engaged an 
external auditing firm to carry out an independent assessment in 2023 in order to verify our compliance with 
regard to the requirements of the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (EU) 2017/821."
"As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we worked on the recommendations from the audit and refined 
our procedures."
"Additionally, we established a supply chain traceability system that further increases our supply 
chain transparency."
"For our tin imports, which make up the majority of our conflict minerals imports, additional 
control mechanisms were implemented."
"These mechanisms include supply chain mapping, information on the 
country of origin of the mineral, request of audit reports from smelters and refiners, and the revision of 
agreements, including audit rights, with our suppliers."
"After careful analysis of the potential risks, no specific 
risks could be identified that would have required the development of an action plan."
"We remain in constant 
contact with our suppliers, industry colleagues and cross-company collaborations to improve the transparency 
and effectiveness of the framework."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Procurement is responsible for integrating sustainability requirements into the relevant stages of our sourcing 
and supplier management processes."
"Our Center of Excellence for Sustainability coordinates the relevant 
measures, such as updating our guidelines where necessary, examining processes and coordinating our 
participation in external initiatives."
"Our commitment: Guidelines and standards 
We expect all our suppliers and service providers to comply with our environmental and social standards, which 
are primarily derived from the core labor standards of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the 
UN Global Compact."
We expect our suppliers to ensure that their subcontractors respect the same rules.
"For 
this purpose, our Supplier Code of Conduct details our expectations towards suppliers and business partners 
regarding human rights, health and safety, business integrity, environmental protection, continuous 
improvement, and management of their respective suppliers."
"Our Responsible Minerals Sourcing Charter demonstrates our commitment to responsible sourcing of 
minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas."
"It applies to all our legal entities and subsidiaries 
worldwide."
The charter complements the requirements set out in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
"To ensure that we work on the basis of industry standards and can rely on comparable data analytics and 
expert analysis, we collaborate with our peer companies in industry initiatives."
"For example, we are a member 
of Together for Sustainability (TfS), the Pharma Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), the Responsible Mica Initiative, 
and the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)."
"We call on our suppliers to allow us or trusted partners to 
conduct assessments or audits to increase the transparency of our supply chain and identify fields of activity to 
improve sustainability performance or mitigate infringement risks."
"EcoVadis assesses suppliers from more than 175 countries and more than 200 sectors across the four 
categories of Environment, Labor and Human Rights, Ethics, and Sustainable Procurement."
"On top of the 
assessments, suppliers are also monitored through a 360-degree news watch."
"The results are shared among 
TfS member companies in compliance with all restrictions stipulated by antitrust law."
"Through the TfS initiative alone, we have access to 1,860 valid scorecards on the assessment of our suppliers 
(2022: 1,700), almost 1,790 of which completed a new assessment or re-assessment in 2023 (2022: 1,100)."
"In some cases, these were initiated by us and in other cases by other TfS members."
"Supplier Decarbonization Program 
Our Supplier Decarbonization Program is a key element of achieving our Science Based Target."
"Through this 
ten-year program that was defined as part of the decarbonization strategy in 2021, we aim to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions associated with purchased goods and services as well as capital goods."
"In order to manage the large quantities of data on the CO2 emissions of our suppliers, we have an automated 
carbon accounting tool in place to which we continuously add new functionalities."
"We offer our suppliers access 
to solutions to reduce their Scope 2 emissions."
"In addition, we joined the Energize program as a new 
sponsor."
"Energize is a collective initiative by a group of industry-leading pharmaceutical and fine chemical 
companies that have committed themselves to engaging their suppliers to support the adoption of renewable 
energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their common supply chains."
"We offer all our suppliers the 
opportunity to join the program for free and to find out more about renewable electricity options leading to 
reduced Scope 2 emissions."
"Mica supply chain 
Mica is an important raw material for our effect pigments, which are used in automotive, cosmetic and 
industrial coatings as well as plastics."
"We procure the majority of our mica from the Indian states of Jharkhand 
and Bihar."
"We have special measures in place to comply with high social and environmental standards in our 
mica supply chain."
"Our mica suppliers are informed of our standards and have confirmed that they adhere to the principles of our 
Human Rights Charter as well as the requirements of our Supplier Code of Conduct."
"In the event of non-
compliance with our standards, we work with suppliers to ensure the appropriate implementation of corrective 
measures."
We do not tolerate child labor and contractually prohibit our suppliers from employing children.
"If one of our 
suppliers were found to be using child labor, we would terminate the business relationship immediately."
"We are 
driving initiatives and taking measures to improve the conditions of mica sourcing based on our high standards."
"For example, we have contractually agreed with our suppliers to pay at least a living wage to mine workers and 
workers in the processing units."
"Furthermore, we continuously review our monitoring processes to improve 
their effectiveness."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social Matters and Respect for Human Rights

Auditing our mica supply chain 
We have implemented a series of oversight mechanisms using a system that monitors and audits conformity 
with our social and environmental standards."
"In addition to visits by our company’s employees, regular 
inspections are conducted by third parties, who conduct comprehensive announced audits as well as frequent, 
unannounced monitoring."
"Environmental Resources Management (ERM), a leading global provider of environmental, health, safety, risk, 
and social consulting services, conducts external audits of mines and processing plants, investigating working 
conditions as well as environmental, health and safety issues."
"The audit reports document any identified 
shortcomings in this respect and propose corrective actions."
"Findings concerning safety of electrical installations 
and installing proper emergency exit signs were successfully addressed."
"Our employees in Kolkata, India, and 
Darmstadt, Germany, take action to address any identified issues."
"If the corrective measures are not respected, 
we may suspend or even terminate our business relationship."
"Since 2013, IGEP Consult, an Indian non-governmental organization, has conducted regular unannounced 
monitoring to review labor standards throughout our supply chain."
"During these visits, IGEP officials monitor 
occupational safety and compliance with laws preventing child labor."
"In 2023, its inspections focused on 
checking the availability of physical examinations for workers and conducting mock fire drills."
"Additionally, we 
regularly optimize the escalation process together with IGEP, which holds bi-weekly review meetings with 
representatives of our company to assess suppliers."
"These meetings help to identify any required actions, which 
our sourcing teams then discuss and implement with our suppliers."
"As a result, our suppliers have successfully 
improved the working conditions at these sites."
"Evaluating and tracking mica sources 
We use a tracking system to help ensure that the mica we purchase is derived from sources qualified by our 
company."
We also use this tracking system to monitor the productivity of our mica sources.
"Based on written 
records of the daily extraction quantities, we review the volumes of mica reported and supplied to the 
processing facilities."
"Furthermore, we use a digital traceability solution to increase transparency in the mica 
supply chain."
"To maintain accuracy, our processes undergo constant review and improvement."
"We are also evaluating other 
mica sources in accordance with our quality, social and environmental standards, both in India and other 
regions."
"For example, we source a considerable amount of mica from Brazil."
"To monitor our suppliers’ 
adherence to these standards, we have conducted an audit through a third party."

Human rights 
We are committed to upholding human rights, which is why we became a signatory to the UN Global Compact 
back in 2005."
"We endeavor to prevent the risk of human rights violations as far as possible, not only at our own 
sites but also along our entire supply chain."
"That is why we integrate human rights due diligence into our 
business processes."
"We view our human rights due diligence as a continuous process, which we constantly adapt and improve."
"This 
also prompts us to continually review our approach."
"We closely monitor regulatory developments such as the 
planned EU directive on human rights due diligence."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Our Executive Board has ultimate responsibility for human rights within our sphere of influence."
"The Executive 
Board exercises this responsibility by requiring our Managing Directors to comply with human rights."
"Our Human Rights Officer from the Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade Compliance (SQ) 
is responsible for monitoring due diligence obligations concerning human rights and environmental matters."
"The 
Executive Board is informed at least once a year of the work of the Human Rights Officer and the 
implementation status of risk management and of the due diligence processes."
"Those responsible for the issue in the Group functions, business sectors and local units are tasked with 
implementing our human rights due diligence processes in operations by integrating human rights due diligence 
into existing processes, for instance."
"Our commitment: Guiding principles, charters and laws 
Our Human Rights Charter aligns with the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights."
"It is 
our overarching human rights directive and defines the relevant requirements for our company."
"We expect our 
employees as well as our suppliers and all companies with which we have business ties to comply with this 
charter."
"In 2023, our Executive Board approved our Group Policy Statement on Compliance with Human Rights and 
Environmental Due Diligence Obligations in accordance with the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act."
"It 
applies to our own business operations, in other words to our entire workforces, as well as to our suppliers."
"The statement describes how we undertake to comply with our human rights and environmental due diligence 
obligations and provides information on the risks identified."
"Identifying actual and potential impacts on human rights 
We perform risk assessments to understand the potential impacts our operations and business relationships 
could have on human rights."
"For instance, we investigate human rights risks at our sites as well as risks related 
to product and service sourcing."
"These risk assessments enable us to derive the corresponding strategies and 
measures."
We track human rights risks through our strategic supplier risk process.
"More information on how we 
engage with suppliers can be found under “Responsible supply chain”."
"Risk analyses to determine human rights and environmental risks 
We conduct special analyses to identify human rights and certain environmental risks."
"This enables us to 
identify potential risks, weight them appropriately and prioritize them."
"These risk analyses are carried out 
annually and on an ad hoc basis for our own business operations."
"Our Social and Labor Standards Policy defines the corresponding commitments and principles as they relate 
to specific topics and sites."
We regularly check compliance with the requirements using a risk-based approach.
"If 
we identify a violation during the audit, we define remedial actions together with the responsible Managing 
Director and/or local HR staff."
We also assess human rights aspects at our sites through security audits and as part of the risk analysis.
"The 
audits are one control mechanism of our security governance framework."
"Through increased risk transparency 
and central follow-up of corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) we help ensure that our sites comply with 
safety-related human rights aspects."
"Through the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, we determine 
whether our strategically important suppliers comply with human rights standards."
"Creating awareness among our employees 
An online course trains our Managing Directors and senior management in how to meet the requirements of our 
Social and Labor Standards Policy in their area of responsibility."
"Our reporting practices 
We inform the public about our approaches and measures as well as the results of our human rights due 
diligence."
We provide information on this annually in our Sustainability Report.
"Under laws in Australia, the 
United Kingdom and Norway, we are additionally required to publish information in these countries on our 
measures to combat forced labor and human trafficking."
"Apart from the UK Modern Slavery Statement and 
the Merck Australia Modern Slavery Statement, we also published the Norway Transparency Statement 
for the first time in 2023."
"Our complaint mechanisms 
We have set up a Group-wide whistleblowing and complaints system that can be used to report potential 
violations of human rights, legal provisions and environmental issues, among other things."
"Our compliance 
hotline is a central element of this."
"Our employees as well as external stakeholders can report suspected cases 
via this Group-wide whistleblowing system in their respective national language, free of charge and 
anonymously, either by telephone or a web-based application."
"We are committed to thoroughly investigate all 
complaints that we receive and take countermeasures if necessary."
"More information on the compliance hotline 
can be found under “Compliance Management”."
"In addition, we published Rules of Procedure."
"These apply to tips or complaints that refer to human rights 
and certain environmental risks or violations at our company and along the supply chain in line with the 
German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act."
"In the reporting year, 184 violations of the Social and Labor 
Standards Policy were reported to us in our own business operations, 60 of which were confirmed."
"Furthermore, based on the complaint channels specified in the Rules of Procedure, there were no indications of 
child or forced labor or violations of the right to collective bargaining or freedom of association in our own 
business operations or in the supply chain in 2023."

Patient safety 
Through a rigorous benefit-risk management process, we help to ensure that the benefits of our medicinal 
products always outweigh the risks for patients."
"Every new medicine goes through a series of precisely defined 
development stages."
"Before any medicinal product is administered to human subjects, we conduct extensive 
preclinical testing both in vitro and in vivo."
"During clinical development, we diligently use all the collected data 
to continuously evaluate the medicinal product’s benefit-risk profile."
"If we consider the medicinal product’s 
benefit-risk profile to be positive, we then submit an application for marketing authorization to the relevant 
regulatory authorities."
"Continual monitoring of product safety risk profiles 
Once we launch a new medicinal product, the number of patients being treated with the product increases 
significantly."
"In rare circumstances, there may be adverse and potentially serious effects that were not detected 
during clinical development, which is why we continuously monitor risks and assess the benefit-risk profiles of the 
products after their market launch."
"Pharmacovigilance includes the process of monitoring a medicinal product on 
an ongoing basis to detect and assess safety signals as part of signal management activities."
"Our 
pharmacovigilance system and our pharmacovigilance business continuity management help to ensure continuous 
monitoring of adverse effects, allowing us to proactively and transparently minimize and communicate any risks."
"Emergency response procedures for business continuity are managed in accordance with global and local business 
continuity plans, tested in regular, defined intervals or with mock scenarios."
"In addition, we provide healthcare 
professionals and patients with the latest information on the safety of our marketed medicinal products."
"The scope 
of continuous safety monitoring covers the entire life cycle of a product, ranging from development, market launch 
and commercialization to the expiration or cancellation of its marketing authorization."
"By 2025, we aim to deliver product specific safety and benefit-risk strategies to support the execution of all key 
priority programs in line with internal and external stakeholders’ expectations."
"These strategies will enable us 
to understand in greater detail the benefit-risk profiles at each stage of product development and post-
marketing."
"During the reporting year, we worked toward achieving this goal by providing high-level safety and 
benefit-risk contributions for development programs with priority in oncology, neurology and immunology."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Our Global Patient Safety unit is responsible for drug safety."
"It continuously collects current safety data from a 
wide variety of sources across the globe, including clinical studies, early access programs, spontaneous reports on

and take necessary actions to ensure the ongoing compliance of our pharmacovigilance system."
"In 2023, we 
had five pharmacovigilance inspections (2022: four)."
"We also perform audits to our systems and processes to ensure that all our units and subsidiaries involved in 
pharmacovigilance consistently meet all global requirements."
"In 2023, we conducted a total of seven 
pharmacovigilance audits (2022: 19) and found no significant deviations in our pharmacovigilance systems 
from these requirements and standards."
"We also conducted twelve external audits (2022: 16) at our vendors 
and licensing partners involved in pharmacovigilance, helping us to improve our pharmacovigilance processes 
and to comply with regulatory requirements."
"Applying our proactive safety strategy to benefit-risk assessments 
Regarding product safety risk assessments, we have successfully implemented in the past years an improved 
benefit-risk management strategy to become a more proactive and benefit-risk-focused organization."
"This 
strategy firmly establishes the concepts and principles for conducting benefit-risk assessments at each stage of 
product development and post-marketing."
"In addition, our Benefit-Risk Action Team co-leadership model, 
created in 2022, enables us to understand in even greater detail the benefit-risk profiles of our products and 
enable early decision-making within our organization to protect patient safety."
"Ultimately, we aim to provide 
the right medicine to the right patient at the right time."
"Up-to-date labeling and product information 
Our product information explains to healthcare professionals and patients how to correctly use the respective 
product and make informed treatment decisions."
"We review and update product information documents, such 
as package leaflets, thereby, we want to ensure our medicinal products contain the latest information on safety, 
efficacy and pharmaceutical formulation."
"In accordance with regulatory requirements, we submit modifications 
to our leaflets to the respective regulatory authorities for approval."
"In 2023, there were no reportable incidents 
of non-compliance with regulations concerning the labeling of our medicinal products."
"Internal and external training 
Our pharmacovigilance experts are regularly trained so that they gain and maintain the required experience 
and knowledge to carry out their activities."
"We manage our training via a global learning platform and verify 
compliance with our training requirements by producing training completion reports."

products responsibly and work to prevent costs from becoming a barrier to treatment."
"In doing so, we strive to 
deliver on our steadfast commitment to providing the broadest possible patient access."
"We also continue to 
invest in meaningful scientific innovation to address the high number of unmet medical needs still faced by 
many patients and their caregivers."
"Therefore, we adapt the prices of our medicines in different geographic and 
socioeconomic segments according to people’s ability to pay."
We acknowledge the affordability challenges many healthcare systems face amid growing financial pressures.
We apply intra-country and inter-country equitable pricing approaches to all our brands.
This approach involves working closely with governments and other stakeholders.
"In addition, we continuously 
monitor dynamic healthcare environments and markets, pricing and reimbursement systems as well as legal 
and regulatory guidelines, adjusting our prices as necessary."
"We conduct annual price analyses to validate price 
thresholds and provide guidance on local pricing to our subsidiaries for the following year."
"We aim to ensure 
that they meet patient access needs by taking a consistent, data-driven approach."
"To increase the availability, accessibility and affordability of our medicines in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and 
the Middle East, we have adopted a new systematic approach known as the SHAPE program."
"This will enable us 
to address these access barriers for underserved patient populations in low- and middle-income countries."
"Additionally, we support innovative risk-sharing agreements and are working to improve data efficiency in 
health systems to help distribute funds and resources more optimally."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Our Global Value Demonstration, Market Access & Pricing (GVAP) unit, formerly called GMAP, reporting directly

"We participate in government tenders for products used in public hospitals serving low-
income patients, often in low- and middle-income countries."
"For some of our existing high-quality products, we offer second brands at affordable prices, particularly in 
countries with a large percentage of low-income patients."
"Patient access programs (PAPs) are self-sustaining commercial programs that provide registered medicinal 
products for underserved populations."
They primarily seek to address affordability challenges.
"We operate PAPs 
in several countries."
"Clinical studies 
Our aim is to conduct high-caliber clinical research that is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations."
"We set Group-wide requirements that aim to ensure that high ethical and scientific standards are met when 
conducting clinical trials."
"We only conduct clinical studies to investigate issues relevant to patients, healthcare professionals or society, 
and only when our established methodology finds the given medicines show significant therapeutic promise and 
a positive benefit-risk ratio."
"Accordingly, to ensure patient safety and avoid interrupting the development of 
promising products, we carefully select patients based on known risk factors."
"These include age and 
comorbidities, which we reflect in the design of our clinical studies."
"Notably, we only enroll the specific number 
of patients needed to answer the posed scientific and medical questions."
"We reconcile and review the safety 
reports from our clinical studies and marketed products and immediately address any unforeseen risks."
"Senior 
boards such as the Pharmacovigilance Advisory Board and the Medical Safety and Ethics Board maintain 
oversight of any emerging safety concerns."
"In addition, cross-functional Benefit Risk Assessment teams adapt 
the benefit-risk assessment and development strategy of each product to ensure it delivers maximum safety 
and efficacy to our patients."
"In addition, a sound, established scientific methodology must be available to 
investigate these scientific or medical questions."
"Protecting the safety, well-being, dignity, and rights of the patients and healthy volunteers participating in our 
clinical studies is of utmost importance to us."
"We do not intentionally expose study participants to undue risk or 
irreversible harm."

Based on our Standard on Human Research, we aim to conduct clinical studies that adequately represent the 
diverse patient populations expected to use our products once they are approved."
"To ensure fair, balanced and 
scientifically justified study representation, we cemented our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in 
clinical trials by collaborating with healthcare providers and community advocates to eliminate common barriers 
to clinical trial participation."
"Their valuable 
insights into disease and treatment management will help us make more informed decisions at each stage of 
the medicine development process."
"We aim to make our studies easy for patients to understand while ensuring 
all participants have positive experiences as they contribute to our understanding of the particular disease and 
its treatment."
"At every level of our organization and based on the function, we are additionally either offering or 
mandating to educate staff about the value of a close, more consistent patient interaction and the requirements 
to protect our patients’ independence and privacy."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Clinical development, including clinical studies and their related governance processes, are the responsibility of 
our Global Development unit."
"The Head of Global Research & Development reports to the CEO Healthcare, who 
is a member of the Executive Board."
We have established two internal committees to oversee our clinical studies.
"Both bodies consist of medical-scientific experts and executives with long-
standing experience in clinical research."
"Before administering a new product to humans, there must be sufficient evidence that it offers a potential 
therapeutic benefit, is sufficiently safe for use in humans and has a positive benefit-risk ratio."
"We only take the 
critical step of a first-in-human clinical trial after diligently conducting extensive preclinical testing."
"The decision 
lies with a separate committee, the Human Exposure Group, chaired by our Global Chief Medical Officer."
We continuously analyze potential risks for study participants before and during our clinical studies.
"Our Medical 
Safety and Ethics Board (MSEB) oversees the safety of the participants in our clinical studies and, as necessary, 
reviews the benefit-risk profiles of investigational products."
"Our commitment: International guidelines and requirements 
Our Quality Policy defines the strategic framework that ensures our products, services and systems deliver high 
quality, safety and efficacy to our patients."
"It details the most relevant laws and codes, criteria and guidance 
(e.g."
"for product development and manufacturing), and our senior management’s responsibility to ensure 
quality is embedded in everything we do."
"Our Standard on Human Research provides the framework for conducting clinical studies and helps ensure we 
adhere to all applicable legal, ethical and scientific standards."
"Further quality documents detail for instance the 
strategic direction of all quality related activities or disclose our position on data privacy."
"Regular supervision of clinical studies 
Our clinical study processes and procedures are regularly inspected by relevant regulatory authorities to verify 
their compliance with applicable laws and guidelines."
"The Research & Development Quality and Risk Management (RDQRM) unit applies a risk-based identification 
strategy to determine areas that need to be audited."
"Quality assurance audits are performed internally within 
Healthcare R&D (for example, process audits) and externally (e.g."
investigator sites and vendor audits).
"We 
respond immediately to observations made during audits by investigating their root causes and, according to 
their criticality, defining and implementing corrective and preventive actions to improve processes, prevent 
reoccurrence of irregularities and ensure compliance."
"As planned, in 2023, RDQRM concluded most of the audits 
of the Annual Audit Plan."
"As in the previous year, in 2023, 
none of the regulatory inspections conducted on our clinical research activities resulted in regulatory action."
"Disclosure of clinical studies and publication of results 
We are obligated to disclose findings from our clinical studies."
"We strive to do this publicly in a complete, 
accurate, balanced, transparent, and timely manner as laid out in our Standard on Clinical Trial Data 
Transparency."
"We publish results from our clinical studies in medical journals in line with applicable laws and 
industry codes."
"In particular, we adhere to the current version of the Good Publication Practice (GPP3) and 
align with the recommendations of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)."
"Our 
Standard on Clinical Trial Data Transparency underscores our strong commitment in this area."
"Enabling early access to new medicines 
Not all patients have the opportunity to take part in a clinical study and must therefore wait for a new 
pharmaceutical product to be approved."
"Through our Early Access Program, we can, under specific 
circumstances, enable patients to gain early access to new, potentially life-saving products."
"The offer is aimed 
at people with serious conditions who have already received all available therapies without success."
"It allows 
them to be treated with products that have already been clinically tested but have not yet been approved."
"Furthermore, we offer patients who participated in one of our clinical studies post-study access to the 
investigational product, provided that certain conditions are met."
"Here, too, we meet stringent statutory, ethical 
and scientific standards."
"By performing a thorough assessment of all available data, we ensure that the 
potential benefits outweigh the potential risks for patients."
"Moreover, we discuss in our committees the ethical aspects of providing products such as organoids for both 
academic research purposes and the biopharmaceutical industry."
"We carefully evaluate our position when it 
comes to controversial topics."
"We always prioritize the well-being of and benefit for various groups of patients, 
whether in clinical studies or during treatment with our medicines."
"The 
recommendations of the MEAP guide our actions and business activities."
"The members of the MEAP are renowned international experts from the fields of bioethics, medicine, 
philosophy, law, and the natural sciences as well as technology and sustainability."
"The MEAP has its mandate 
from the Executive Board and is chaired jointly by the two members of the Executive Board with responsibility 
for the Healthcare and Life Science business sectors."
"All employees may address their concerns to the Bioethics team via our compliance hotline and a dedicated 
e-mail address (accessible via the intranet)."
"A further board, the Stem Cell Oversight Committee (SCROC), reviews and decides on all planned in-house 
research activities involving the use of human embryonal or pluripotent stem cells, ensuring compliance with legal 
requirements as well as our ethical guidelines."
This also applies to joint projects with external partners.
"Up until 
the end of 2022, the SCROC consisted of internal experts from our business sectors as well as external advisors 
from the fields of bioethics, medicine, and law."
"In 2023 and in line with a resolution by the MEAP, we transformed 
the SCROC into a primarily internal board."
"The reason for this is that research plans that call for separate 
committee approval pursuant to the SCROC charter are currently not being carried out within the company."
"Furthermore, for ethical questions arising for instance in the context of forward-looking business decisions, 
targeted Ethics Foresight projects can be initiated."
"We specifically engage external experts to work on these 
projects."
No Ethics Foresight projects were commissioned in 2023.
"Our commitment to policies and standards 
Our Genome Editing Principle provides a binding ethical and operational framework for our employees."
"Apart 
from our position on genome editing, it includes information on human germline editing."
"It sets clear 
boundaries for us both as a supplier of customized CRISPR/Cas nucleases and genetically modified cell lines and 
as a company that uses genome editing technologies in our research."
"This is complemented by further guidelines that form the ethical framework of our research and business 
activities."
Our Stem Cell Principle sets the ethical boundaries for the use of human stem cells in our research.
Our Fertility Principle regulates our fertility treatment and in-vitro fertilization research activities.
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social Matters and Respect for Human Rights

Using genome-editing techniques 
CRISPR/Cas opens up new possibilities in genetic engineering research that could bring about major advances 
in the treatment of serious diseases."
"Laws in different countries allow for a varying degree of latitude in 
applying this technique."
"Bioethical positions on germline editing have been evolving for years through academic 
and social discourse."
"Our position on human germline editing is as follows: 
“In accordance with the German Embryo Protection Act, we do not support the use of genome editing in human 
embryos and clinical applications of germline interventions in humans."
"We recognize that there may be value in 
responsibly conducted related research.” 
Stem cell research 
We neither participate in clinical programs that utilize human embryonic stem cells or cloned human cells for 
the treatment of diseases, nor do we pursue such approaches ourselves."
"However, we use human embryonic 
stem cells in our research and offer our customers several select stem cell lines."
"In both applications, we allow 
the use of human embryonic stem cells only if clearly defined conditions have been met."
"For instance, we only 
utilize stem cells for research purposes if our SCROC has reviewed the respective project and given approval."
"In 
fiscal 2023, no projects required the approval of the SCROC (2022: one project)."
"We exclusively make use of 
cell lines that have been approved by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and are allowed 
under the German Embryo Protection Act as well as the German Stem Cell Law."
"Digital ethics 
As it is our aim is to develop and use new digital technologies responsibly, we evaluate ethical issues that may 
arise from algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) and data-based business models in an early stage."
"Since 2021, 
the Merck Digital Ethics Advisory Panel (DEAP) has been focusing on complex ethical issues surrounding digital 
technologies."
"Roles and responsibilities 
One of the main tasks of the DEAP is to support us in developing digital applications responsibly while 
addressing ethics questions that could result from collecting and processing data as well as from the use of 
these innovative technologies."
It issues recommendations for our entrepreneurial activities.
"The panel comprises external international science and industry experts from the fields of digital ethics, law, Big 
Data technologies, digital health, medicine, and data governance."
"In addition, we involve bioethics experts as 
well as representatives from patient organizations as needed."
"The DEAP has its mandate from the Executive 
Board; our employees may submit topics for the panel to discuss."
"As in the previous year, the panel held four 
meetings in 2023."
These focused on issues concerning the use of generative AI.
"Summary minutes of the DEAP 
meetings have been accessible on our intranet since 2023 insofar as they do not contain any business secrets."
They also document the recommendations issued.
"Our commitment: Guidelines and standards  
As a company, we want to position ourselves in the digital ethics sphere."
"We are therefore developing clear 
ethical standards in this new field, primarily for critical areas, for instance handling health data."
"In this effort, 
we collaborate with various stakeholders and experts."
"Together with the DEAP, we apply our Code of Digital Ethics (CoDE) in order to address questions pertaining to 
the ethical use of data and algorithms."
"The CoDE serves as a guideline for our digital business models, as a tool 
for analyzing ethical challenges, and a basis for practical DEAP recommendations."
"As one of our overarching 
governance documents, it applies to all employees and is publicly accessible as well."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social Matters and Respect for Human Rights 
137 
 
Developments in the field of generative AI, for instance ChatGPT, are growing in importance."
"All our business 
sectors are developing applications based on generative AI."
"To apply these innovative technologies responsibly 
and to the benefit of all, an ethical framework is currently being developed."
"The DEAP is intensively evaluating 
the guidelines."
The aim is to roll out this framework company-wide in 2024.
"Ethical use of data and algorithms 
In June 2023, online training on the CoDE was assigned to approximately 12,000 managers with personnel 
responsibility who can access the training in eight languages via our internal training platform."
"In addition, an 
advanced training course is available specifically for employees working in the fields of data science, AI and 
other digital areas of specialization."
"The course serves to illustrate the importance of the CoDE and empowers 
participants to make responsible decisions concerning the ethical aspects of data use and algorithms in digital 
products and business models."
"Since 2022, we have been looking at potential ethical risks that could result from projects by the Life Science 
Data Intelligence and Analytics unit of our Life Science business sector with the aim of developing suitable 
processes."
The unit analyzes data from the business sector in order to obtain insights for our business.
"Data privacy and cyber security 
The mandate and goal of our Group Data Privacy unit is to mitigate risks and create a global framework for 
data privacy-compliant business operations."
"This unit helps train our employees to handle data responsibly and 
with clear accountability."
"It safeguards our company by providing data privacy risk assurance and ensuring 
compliance with relevant data privacy laws globally."
"Group Data Privacy also contributes to creating value for 
the development of digital business models."
"It is of critical importance to our business to protect our information systems, their contents and our 
communication channels against any criminal or unwanted activities."
"These include e-crime and cyberattacks, 
such as unauthorized access, information leakage and misuse of data or systems."
"Roles and responsibilities 
Group Data Privacy is an independent function, organizationally integrated into Group Compliance and Data 
Privacy."
"We have a Group Data Privacy Officer and a network of local Data Privacy Officers at various sites 
Group-wide."
"In line with external regulations, the Data Privacy Officers and their respective teams act 
independently and without receiving internal or external instructions."
"Group Data Privacy regularly prepares 
data privacy updates and a comprehensive data privacy report."
"This report is submitted to the Executive Board 
and the Supervisory Board."
Cyber security is part of our Group Corporate Security Office.
"In addition, we have a Group Chief Information 
Security Officer and a network of Information Security Officers within the business sectors and Group functions 
who hold risk ownership, act as our first line of cyber security defense and are supported by dedicated 
networks."
"Our global Cyber Security function acts as a second line of defense and has responsibilities regarding 
cyber security risk governance and oversight."
Our third line of defense consists of internal audits.
Our Cyber Security organization strengthens resilience against cyberattacks and data breaches.
"It defines 
policies and standards for cyber security (including data security) while providing oversight, tools and systems 
to manage and monitor our overall cyber security risk exposure."
"The organization is also responsible for 
providing cyber security monitoring and incident response capabilities across the entire company."
"Additionally, 
we train our employees on how to protect data properly."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Social Matters and Respect for Human Rights 
138 
 
Our commitment: Guidelines and standards 
Our Data Privacy Policy and the corresponding standards and procedures define our principles for processing 
personal data."
"This approach allows us to achieve a high level of data protection for our employees, contract 
partners, customers, and suppliers as well as patients and participants in clinical studies."
"Our Group-wide 
understanding of data privacy is based on European legislation, in particular the European Union General Data 
Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)."
"We are also taking steps to meet local data privacy requirements, where 
these are stricter than our Group-wide standards."
"Our Group cyber security governance framework contains organizational, process-related and technical 
information security countermeasures based on recognized international standards."
"In addition, we apply 
harmonized electronic and physical security controls (e.g."
"access controls and security monitoring) to bolster 
our ability to securely handle sensitive data, such as trade secrets."
"Training and IT tools 
In line with the EU GDPR and our global approach to data privacy, we regularly conduct e-learning training 
courses in ten languages."
"In 2023, the completion rate for our e-learning courses was 99%."
"We maintain a central IT tool to provide a single source for data privacy processes, such as registering data 
processing activities and reporting potential data privacy incidents."
"In 2023, we reported seven cases of minor 
personal data breaches to the supervisory authority."
"One of them related to identified data leaks, theft, or loss 
of customer data."
"However, none of these cases were sanctioned."
"Combined Management Report ___ Non-Financial Statement ___ Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery

Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery 
Compliance management 
As a global company, we have stringent requirements for effective compliance management."
"Importantly, we 
seek to emphasize compliance by acting in line with our company values and believe that profitable business 
operations should go hand in hand with the highest ethical standards."
"To cover these topics, we have Group-wide policies, standards and procedures in place that ensure our business 
activities comply with the relevant laws, regulations and international ethical standards."
"Other compliance-
related issues, including the respective internal regulations and guidelines, such as Pharmacovigilance, Export 
and Import Controls, and Environment, Health, Safety, Security, Quality, are managed by the responsible 
functions."
"As part of our 
regular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the 
Executive Board."
"This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and 
key figures on compliance and data privacy cases."
"Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight 
ongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives."
"Our Chief Compliance Officer oversees all Compliance departments and the subordinate Compliance Officers 
and Compliance experts around the world."
"The Compliance Officers implement our compliance program within 
their respective areas of responsibility (adapting to local regulations) and receive guidance from our Group 
Compliance Center of Expertise."
"This is a centralized body that drives the design and evolution of our 
compliance program across all business sectors and Group functions."
"For this purpose, we have a compliance risk assessment process covering all of our business sectors."
"The assessment is based on a comprehensive risk matrix that improves objectivity and enables a data-driven 
risk approach."
"It focuses on bribery and corruption risks, illustrated through in-depth risk categorization and 
risk scenarios."
"It also utilizes country risk segmentation, classifying countries where we actively operate in 
terms of their risk exposure regarding bribery and corruption by applying objective and consistent criteria."
"We 
use the outcome as a model to prioritize initiatives and intensify activities in countries with higher risk levels."
"Conflicts of interest 
We take all potential conflicts of interest seriously."
"Employees must avoid situations where their professional 
judgment could come into conflict with their personal interests."
"They must also disclose every potential conflict 
of interest to their supervisor and document the disclosure."
"Such issues are typically resolved directly between 
the employee and the supervisor but can also be routed to Human Resources, Legal, Compliance or other 
relevant functions."
"Management and requirements of third parties 
For compliance management to be effective, it must not be restricted to the boundaries of our own company."
"While our supplier management processes focus on vendor compliance with our standards, our global Third 
Party Risk Management process governs interactions with sales parties, such as commercial agents, 
distributors, dealers, and high-risk vendors."
"We expect our third parties worldwide to adhere to our compliance 
principles."
"We collaborate only with parties who pledge to comply with relevant laws, reject all forms of bribery, 
and adhere to environmental, health and safety guidelines."
We apply a risk-based approach to select the third parties with whom we do business.
"The greater the 
estimated risk regarding a particular country, region, or type of service, the more in-depth we examine the 
third party before entering into a business relationship."
"We also explore background information from various 
databases and information reported by third parties."
"If we encounter compliance concerns, we further analyze and verify the relevant information."
"Based on the 
outcome, we decide whether to reject the potential third party, impose conditions to mitigate identified risks or 
terminate the existing relationship."
"We require employees to take these courses based on their exposure to 
risk."
"Some courses also apply to independent contractors and supervised workers, such as temporary 
employees."
"In 2023, we launched a new Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Money Laundering e-learning 
course based on the updated Global Anti-Corruption and Anti-Money Laundering standards introduced in 2022."
"Anti-money laundering 
We have implemented a global anti-money laundering (AML) program consisting of a global Anti-Money 
Laundering Group Standard, training and a dedicated process to report and investigate red flags and any high-
risk transactions."
"Suspicious transactions are reported to the German Financial Intelligence Unit or other 
authorities as required."
We continuously work to improve our AML program.
"Following in-depth AML risk 
assessments of jurisdictions with stricter regulatory frameworks than our AML program, we implemented 
additional local AML programs where required."
"Reporting potential compliance violations 
We encourage all employees worldwide to report potential compliance violations."
"Depending on the type of 
misconduct and the reporting person’s preference, they can choose from various reporting channels."
"We 
recommend using one of our central channels that are directly received and reviewed by a dedicated, 
independent and qualified team within Group Compliance."
"Depending on the nature, content and type of report, 
Compliance may investigate a submission directly or assign it to another responsible function for further 
investigation."
"One central reporting channel is our global whistleblowing compliance hotline, which can be used 
free of charge and anonymously to report violations."
"It is available in several languages by telephone or as a 
web-based application."
The compliance hotline is also available to external stakeholders.
"The relevant 
information can be found in the “contact us” and the Compliance and Ethics section of our website."
"Compliance-relevant cases with a particular risk profile are presented to the Compliance Case Committee, 
comprising senior members of our Compliance, Legal, Data Privacy, Internal Auditing, and Human Resources 
departments."
"The Committee’s duties include assessing and classifying specific compliance issues and 
addressing identified issues using appropriate measures."
"In all Compliance-relevant cases, based on the investigation outcome and recommendations from Compliance 
or the Compliance Case Committee, we aim to take appropriate remediation measures."
"These can include 
disciplinary actions against employees who have committed a compliance violation."
"If the investigation 
identifies a root cause that could lead to the risk of further compliance violations, we take additional preventive 
and corrective actions."
"Both the number of new Compliance-relevant cases and the number of cases with confirmed compliance 
violations increased compared with the previous year."
"In 2023, 106 Compliance-relevant new cases with 
reports via the compliance hotline and other channels were created."
"In 32 concluded cases, it was confirmed 
that the principles of the Code of Conduct or other internal or external guidelines had been violated."
"As part of the audits, Group Internal Auditing regularly reviews functions, processes and legal entities 
worldwide."
"These reviews include an assessment of the effectiveness of the respective compliance guidelines, 
processes and structures in place."
"The units also check for violations of our Code of Conduct, Anti-Corruption 
Standard, Anti-Money Laundering Group Standard, and Antitrust and Competition Law Policy."
"Our audit planning aims to provide comprehensive risk assurance through the best possible audit coverage of 
our processes, countries and projects."
"We take a risk-based approach to our annual audit planning process, 
considering factors such as sales, employee headcount, systematic stakeholder feedback and the Corruption 
Perceptions Index (CPI) published by the non-governmental organization Transparency International."
"If an 
internal audit gives rise to recommendations, Group Internal Auditing performs a systematic follow-up and 
monitors the implementation of the recommended corrective actions."
"In 2023, Group Internal Auditing 
conducted 80 internal audits involving bribery and corruption-related risks (2022: 79), including 52 operational 
and 27 IT audits and 1 special audit which may be conducted to meet legal requirements."
"Interactions with health systems 
We support health systems by collaborating with our healthcare stakeholders, such as professional medical 
associations, patient and carer organizations, university clinics and other institutions that provide healthcare."
"We follow clearly defined internal approval requirements and procedures for each type of interaction, in line 
with applicable laws and codes."
"In countries with statutory or industry obligations on the disclosure of transfers 
of value to healthcare stakeholders, we aim to comply with these obligations."
In some countries we inform consumers directly.
"For example, in the United States direct-to-consumer (DTC) 
advertising for prescription medicines is permitted."
"In line with applicable local laws, we use DTC advertising in 
these countries to help increase people’s awareness of certain diseases and the available therapies."
"Roles and responsibilities 
For all interactions with healthcare stakeholders, we have established internal policies and review processes and 
tools, such as record-keeping systems."
"Thereby, we want to ensure adherence to statutory requirements and 
transparency obligations."
"Our Global Regulatory Affairs unit has established a dedicated standard and corresponding process document 
on the review and approval of our promotional materials for our Healthcare business sector."
"At the operational 
level, the relevant business and all employees involved in our sales and marketing activities must adhere to our 
internal policies, standards and procedures."
"To ensure that all promotional materials meet our standards as well 
as local regulations end-to-end, we apply a harmonized Group-wide review and approval system."
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).
"The published information includes the names of individual recipients, their addresses, the 
purpose, and the contributed amount or value as required by the applicable laws and codes."
"In addition, before 
publishing, we secure all necessary informed consent forms, as required by the applicable data privacy 
regulations."
"Regular employee training 
In 2023, we continued our Code of Conduct training curriculum on managing dilemmas in sector-specific 
situations."
"Moreover, employees who are responsible for the promotion of our pharmaceutical products receive 
regular training on current guidelines."
"Depending on their roles and responsibilities, new employees participate 
in onboarding training dealing with the review and approval of promotional materials."
"Based on their roles and 
responsibilities and in order to remain up-to-date, employees participate in mandatory e-learning courses and 
classroom training on our policies and guidelines as well as important changes to the reporting requirements for 
transfers of value."

Other Topics 
Sustainable innovation and technology 
The sustainable innovation that we envision and drive forward must align with and support the three goals of 
our sustainability strategy."
"We define sustainable innovation as new or improved products, services, 
technologies, or processes that generate economic benefits and have positive environmental and social 
impacts."
"Therefore, we develop long-term solutions for our innovation and research activities that consider the 
entire value chain and evaluate each product’s impact over its lifecycle."
"Today, our products are already having positive impact on human progress and global health, namely our 
medicines and our biological and chemical innovations that utilize the latest technologies."
"We want to 
continuously improve the way we measure our progress by adapting to upcoming regulations and integrating 
quantitative sustainability criteria into our product development processes across all business sectors."
"In 2023, we continued our partnership with the patent information platform LexisNexis® PatentSight® and 
evaluated the sustainability impact of our intellectual property."
"In the reporting year, 29% (2022: 40%) of our 
patent families published had a positive sustainability impact."
"However, this key indicator is not comparable 
with the previous year's figure as LexisNexis® PatentSight® updated the underlying evaluation methodology."
"Roles and responsibilities 
The organizational set-up of our R&D activities reflects the overall structure of our company."
"All three of our 
business sectors operate in independent R&D units that pursue their own innovation strategies."
"Group 
Corporate Sustainability supports our business sectors and Group functions to advance sustainability within the 
R&D and innovation processes."
"This includes the coordination and alignment of common core sustainability 
criteria in line with our shared goals as well as quality and quantification requirements."
"In 2022, we created a 
Group-wide dashboard, showing the potential contribution of our R&D portfolio to sustainable solutions."
"In 
2023, we integrated a procedure describing the global sustainability evaluation in our R&D process."
"Our Group Science & Technology Office leads the implementation of our combined strategy for innovation as 
well as data and digital, enabling innovation across our business sectors while harnessing the power of 
advanced data and digital capacities."
"It aims to identify and integrate transformative and strategically relevant 
technology trends into our business sectors while maintaining a Group-wide overview of our technology 
roadmap and innovation portfolio."
"Fostering data and digital capacities is key to accelerating sustainable 
innovation and enabling rapid action and personalized offerings."
"Innovation projects are incubated either 
through our corporate innovation teams or in the business sectors."
"Our venture capital fund, M Ventures, prioritizes sustainable innovations through equity investments."
"The 
fund’s mandate is to invest in innovative technologies and products that have the potential to significantly 
impact our core business areas."
"In addition, the fund focuses on investments in two areas of high strategic 
relevance to our company: digital technology and sustainability."
M Ventures’ sustainability investment strategy follows two fundamental approaches.
"First, it invests in 
sustainable solutions relevant to our three business sectors, such as novel solutions for reducing emissions and 
waste, green life science technologies and green electronics technologies."
"These solutions may be more energy- 
or resource-efficient or may create products designed for circularity or with a lower carbon footprint."
"As many 
of these technologies are still in their early stages, M Ventures is partnering with SEMI.org along with the 
leading corporate venture capital funds to help accelerate the innovation and adoption of potential sustainable 
semiconductor solutions."
"The second approach involves making investments that leverage our core 
competencies to drive sustainability in other markets."
"These may include start-ups addressing sustainable 
foods, bio-manufacturing or carbon capture and utilization."
"We have integrated and tailored Design for 
Sustainability (DfS) across all business sectors and use our overarching dashboard to monitor progress on key 
sustainability criteria."
"In 2023, we assessed almost all relevant R&D projects and thus enhanced transparency 
around the sustainability performance of our global R&D portfolio."
"We integrated a sustainability in R&D key 
indicator to track progress and continued advancing the use of evaluation tools such as DOZN™ and 
GreenSpeed."
"We aim to combine the insights from the R&D dashboard with those gained from our commercial 
portfolio evaluation to steer our future R&D activities."
"We have dedicated corporate resources for our circular economy strategy and we are driving several circular 
economy pilots and initiatives throughout the organization."
"In addition, we held a global circular economy 
summit to provide a platform for best practice sharing with internal and external participants."
"For this purpose, the EU Taxonomy defines various key performance indicators and qualitative 
information that Merck must disclose."
"An economic activity 
qualifies as taxonomy-eligible if it is within the scope of the EU Taxonomy."
"According to the EU Taxonomy, an economic activity qualifies as taxonomy-aligned if it 
is taxonomy-eligible and makes a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives 
without doing significant harm to the other objectives or failing to fulfill minimum social standards."
"Furthermore, new economic activities for the environmental 
objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation have been added for which the degree 
of taxonomy eligibility will be required to be disclosed in the 2023 reporting year."
"Reporting on the degree of 
taxonomy alignment for the newly added environmental objectives is not planned for the time being."
"• 
From the 2024 reporting year, the degree of taxonomy eligibility and the degree of taxonomy alignment 
will have to be reported for all six environmental objectives."
"Identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities 
In the course of implementing the EU Taxonomy requirements, the business model of Merck underwent a 
comprehensive analysis."
"Taxonomy-eligible economic activities were identified in line with a top-down approach 
using structured inquiries submitted to the relevant specialist departments."
"For the environmental objectives of 
climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, the results of this analysis were supplemented by big 
data-supported analyses as part of a bottom-up approach."
"Among other things, information was used that can 
also be found in connection with the requirements of the REACH regulation as well as in the context of customs 
declarations."
"The economic activities for the other four environmental objectives were also identified by 
reference to existing reporting structures and hierarchies."
"There is no capital 
expenditure in category B to date as Merck does not prepare any capital spending plans to transform 
taxonomy-eligible economic activities into taxonomy-aligned economic activities."
"Furthermore, Merck has 
capital expenditure resulting from the acquisition of products classified as taxonomy-eligible economic activities 
or attributable to qualifying individual measures (category C)."
"In order to be taxonomy-eligible, this capital 
expenditure must correspond to one of the economic activities named in the Delegated Acts and be 
implemented and operational within 18 months."
"The basis for this was the Delegated Acts 
on the EU Taxonomy, which were used for the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities."
"In these, 
corresponding requirements are defined for the respective economic activities, which must be fulfilled for a 
classification as taxonomy-aligned."
"For this purpose, interviews were conducted with business and project 
managers and the physical climate risks at the sites were analyzed."
"Furthermore, operating permits, product 
data sheets, environmental product declarations, energy performance certificates and internal training 
documents were inspected, among other things."
"Net sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure in connection with the “climate change mitigation” 
environmental objective were identified as taxonomy-aligned economic activities to a very small extent only."
"No 
additional taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned net sales, capital expenditure or operating expenditure 
were identified for the “climate change adaptation” environmental objective."
"From 2024, the degree of 
taxonomy alignment will have to be reported for the other four environmental objectives in addition to the 
degree of taxonomy eligibility."
"Based on the information currently available, the degree of taxonomy alignment 
for the other four environmental objectives will also be very low."
"A more accurate statement is not yet possible 
owing to the uncertain questions regarding the interpretation of the regulations and the current progress of the 
project."
"Minimum safeguards 
The minimum safeguard frameworks include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United 
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the fundamental conventions of the International 
Labour Organization, and the International Bill of Human Rights."
"The requirements profile of the frameworks 
was systematized and compared with internal documents."
"This included an analysis of the Code of Conduct, 
work instructions, guidelines and training documents."
"Compliance with the due diligence process required by 
the framework in the area of human rights is ensured with respect to the individual business activities."
"Risk 
analyses are carried out with regard to the minimum safeguard requirements and appropriate measures are 
derived from these."
The principle of materiality was applied.
The most significant interpretive issues and Merck’s approach are presented below.
"Taxonomy eligibility 
Ancillary activities that are operationally necessary for our core business do not qualify as independent 
taxonomy-eligible economic activities."
"This applies, for example, to the transport of our products to our 
customers, research and development activities, and the acquisition or construction of production buildings in 
areas that cannot be allocated to a taxonomy-eligible target activity."
"To check the taxonomy eligibility of an economic activity, Merck applies an end-product oriented approach for 
manufacturing-related activities."
"This means that the end product must result from one of the economic 
activities specified in the Delegated Act in order to qualify as being taxonomy-eligible."
"In the case of organic 
basic chemicals, the corresponding economic activities qualify as taxonomy-eligible in the interpretation of 
Merck only if the manufacturing activities of the named chemical products involve a significant transformation 
process."
"In our interpretation, products that are merely passed on for sale, repackaged or mixed do not qualify 
as taxonomy-eligible within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation."
"In the area of fossil gas, Merck operates a gas turbine and a co-generation facility to generate electricity and 
heat from fossil gaseous fuels."
The facilities serve to generate our own power and heat.
"These activities in the 
area of electricity generation from fossil gaseous fuels as well as the operation of co-generation units with fossil 
gaseous fuels have been classified as not material."
"Additional activities in the field of nuclear energy and fossil 
gas are not performed or are performed to an insignificant extent only."
"Net sales 
The net sales KPI represents the ratio of net sales from taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned economic 
activities in a fiscal year to the total net sales of the same fiscal year."
"The definition of relevant net sales for the 
purposes of the EU Taxonomy Regulation corresponds to the definition of net sales in the consolidated financial 
statements (see Note (9) “Net sales” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements)."
"At Merck and within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, capital expenditure in the 
reporting period comprises additions to property, plant and equipment (IAS 16), rights of use from leases 
(IFRS 16), and intangible assets (IAS 38) with the exception of goodwill."
"Apart from the additions, advance 
payments for the named assets are also included."
"The denominator also includes additions to property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations."
"In order to exclude double counting, capital expenditure on products from taxonomy-aligned economic activities 
and individual measures that have already been checked under category A (i.e."
"capital expenditure that relates 
to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities) are included under this category 
only."
"Against this background, capital expenditure for production buildings, for example, is subject to a 
taxonomy-eligibility check under category A only, while capital expenditure for administrative buildings is 
included under category C."
"During the clinical and preclinical development phases in the Healthcare business 
sector, it is unclear as to whether the activities will ever lead to regulatory approval and hence to marketable 
products."
"Accordingly, the corresponding research and development activities have not been included as 
taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure in the numerator for the economic activities of pharmaceutical 
ingredients and medical products."
"Taxonomy KPIs 
The following tables present the share of sales, capital expenditure and operating expenditure attributable to 
taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities in respect of the environmental objective “climate 
change mitigation”."

"Merck KGaA, headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany, is the parent company of the Group."
"Following the transfer of the Life Science, Healthcare and Electronics business sectors into separate legal 
entities, Merck KGaA primarily performs a holding company function for the Merck Group."
"As part of the 
strategic management of the Group, this function makes strategically important decisions and ensures that 
compliance provisions are observed by the central enabling Group Functions on a Group-wide basis."
"It also 
performs Group-wide services for Group companies in the areas of information technology, strategic

The business lease agreement under which the Healthcare business sector was leased back to Merck KGaA was 
terminated with economic effect from March 31, 2019."
"Merck Healthcare KGaA (formerly the Healthcare OpCo) 
assumed the power of operational management for the Healthcare business sector from Merck KGaA with effect 
from April 1, 2019."
"As a result of the termination of the business lease agreement, the leased objects allocated 
to the Healthcare business sector at the end of the lease were transferred to Merck Healthcare KGaA."
"The business lease agreement for the Electronics business sector (EL business lease agreement) was 
terminated with economic effect from December 31, 2019 for the part of the distribution and sales function 
belonging to the Electronics business sector."
"Accordingly, these functions were transferred from Merck KGaA to 
the EL OpCo (then Merck Performance Materials Germany GmbH) with economic effect from January 1, 2020."
"The contractual, process, procedural, and working relationships and leased objects allocated to the function 
were transferred to the EL OpCo as a result."
"The EL business lease agreement for the other functions of the 
Electronics business sector remained in place until December 31, 2022."
"The 
function that was spun off from the EL business lease agreement via EL Production (the ELP business lease 
agreement) had been in place between Merck KGaA as the lessee and the LS OpCo as the lessor since this date."
"Furthermore, as a 
result of the Life Science business lease agreement, Merck KGaA also ran the operating business of the 
Life Science business sector."
"Termination of the temporary business lease of the Life Science and Electronics 
business sectors 
Merck Life Science KGaA went live on January 1, 2023."
"It assumed the power of operational management for 
the Life Science operating business and ELP from Merck KGaA at this date."
"Merck KGaA therefore terminated 
the LS and ELP business lease agreements with effect from January 1, 2023."
"Merck KGaA also terminated the EL business lease agreement with effect from January 1, 2023."
"The power of 
operational management for the Electronics business sector, with the exception of EL Production, was therefore 
transferred from Merck KGaA to Merck Electronics KGaA at this date."
"In exchange, Merck 
Life Science KGaA and Merck Electronics KGaA paid compensation in the amount of the balance of the 
transferred carrying amounts under German commercial law."
"In addition, around 3,400 employees were 
transferred from Merck KGaA to Merck Life Science KGaA and around 1,000 employees were transferred to

"Following the transfer, Merck KGaA no longer 
generates any income from operating product and service business (2022: € 1,813 million)."
"In the past fiscal year, Merck KGaA’s net sales exclusively comprised income from the intragroup on-charging 
of services."
"This primarily related to site management services, IT services, strategic management costs and 
license fees for the “Merck” umbrella brand."
"All in all, the intragroup on-charging of services was higher than in 
the previous year due to the increase in on-charged site and administrative services in particular."
"These effects are discussed below and above in the “Effects of material 
company agreements on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations” section."
"As a 
result, the income statement for fiscal 2023 mainly saw a decline in expense and income items relating to 
operating activities, such as net sales, material costs, personnel expenses and other operating expenses."
"In addition to the effects of the transfer of operating activities, higher profit transfers from subsidiaries and 
lower tax expense in particular more than offset the higher level of other financial expenses, resulting in an 
increase in total profit after taxes and profit transfers."
"The reduction in other income primarily resulted from the fact that the prior-year figure included changes 
relating to certain inventory items that were transferred as of January 1, 2023, as well as from the lower level 
of insurance compensation payments."
The transfer of operating activities meant the total cost of materials decreased in line with net sales.
"The level of additions to 
pension provisions was also lower."
"This was offset by salary increases for employees covered by and exempt 
from collective agreements, as well as the collectively agreed inflation allowance."
"Depreciation, amortization, and adjustments remained essentially unchanged as against the previous year."
"The transfer of operating activities did not have a material impact on the amount of fixed assets (see “Effects 
of material company agreements on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations”)."
"Following the transfer of operating activities, the relevance of investment income as the largest income item is 
increasing."
"It increased by € 188 million to € 2,203 million (2022: € 2,015 million) on the back of higher 
income from profit and loss transfer agreements with subsidiaries in the Healthcare business sector."
"The 
general rise in interest rates also led to an increase in the profit transfer from the Group financing company, 
Merck Financial Services GmbH, Darmstadt."
"This was offset by lower dividends from other subsidiaries and 
higher expenses from profit and loss transfer agreements."
"Additions to provisions for uncertain tax obligations in particular led to a higher tax expense in the previous 
year, whereas these did not occur to the same extent in 2023."

"In terms 
of the balance sheet for fiscal 2023, this primarily resulted in a reduction in inventories and trade accounts 
receivable on the asset side of the balance sheet and in trade payables on the equity and liabilities side, while 
other receivables increased."
"Largely irrespective of the transfer of operating assets, one notable increase on the asset side of the balance 
sheet related to fixed assets (€ +99 million)."
"This was mainly due to the investments in property, plant and 
equipment at the Darmstadt site."
"The higher level of income from profit and loss transfers meant that other receivables and other assets also 
increased (€ +649 million)."
"On the equity and liabilities side, the biggest increase related to other liabilities 
(€ +686 million), whereas financial liabilities decreased (€ -275 million)."
"All in all, net assets rose slightly by 
0.7%."
"Inventories declined as a result of the transfer of operating activities (see “Effects of material company

"This corresponds to 
an equity ratio of 21.2% (2022: 21.3%)."
"Equity increased in particular as a result of the net income generated in 
fiscal 2023, which offset the dividend payments made during the year."
"Merck KGaA is also financed via the Group financing company, Merck Financial Services GmbH, Darmstadt, which 
provides Merck KGaA with sufficient financial resources and hence ensures liquidity."
"Other liabilities rose by 
€ 686 million and primarily relate to current loans and clearing account liabilities in respect of Merck Financial 
Services GmbH, Darmstadt, in the amount of € 14,476 million (2022: € 13,963 million)."
"Financial liabilities of 
€ 2,476 million relate to bonds issued in previous years to finance the acquisitions of Sigma-Aldrich and Versum 
Materials, Inc., United States, in particular."
"The € -275 million reduction in financial liabilities was attributable to 
the repayment of bonds, which resulted in an increase in other liabilities from intragroup financing."
"Additional 
information on the financing conditions and maturity structure of the bonds can be found in Note (21) “Financial 
liabilities” of the Notes to the Financial Statements in accordance with HGB."
"The reduction in provisions was due in particular to the lower level of pension provisions, which primarily resulted 
from pension payments and employees being transferred to other legal entities within the Merck Group."
"Merck KGaA continues to recognize 
expenses for global R&D services."
"Dividend 
For fiscal 2023, we are proposing to the Annual General Meeting the payment of a dividend of € 2.20 per share."
"Personnel 
Merck KGaA had 3,924 employees as of December 31, 2023 (2022: 8,485)."
"The year-on-year decline of 4,561 
employees was largely attributable to the transfer of operating activities (see “Effects of material company 
agreements on the net assets, financial position, and results of operations”)."
Merck KGaA participates in these risks and opportunities via its equity investments and subsidiaries.
This can have consequences for its investment income or the valuation of shares in subsidiaries.
"More 
information can be found in the Group “Report on Risks and Opportunities”."
The remaining business sector was expected to see a similar level of sales to 2022.
Net income was forecast to be slightly higher than in 2022.
"Net sales declined from € 3,180 million in the previous year to € 1,628 million, largely as a result of the 
€ 1,813 million in sales from operating product and service business that were no longer recognized as 
anticipated following the transfer of operating activities."
"Sales in the reporting year relate solely to the 
intragroup on-charging of services."
"The increase in on-charged site and administrative services in particular 
meant that these were higher than the prior-year forecast of € 1,366 million."
Net income was above the forecast level due to higher investment income and lower taxes in particular.
"Taken 
together, these more than offset the higher level of other financial expenses."
"Forecast for 2024 
Following the transfer of operating activities, net sales are becoming less relevant for Merck KGaA, while the 
relevance of investment income as the largest income item is increasing."
"With this in mind, investment income 
is replacing net sales as a key financial performance indicator starting from fiscal 2023, and a forecast for the 
next fiscal year is provided below."
"In line with the Group’s development, we expect investment income to see moderate growth compared with the 
figure recorded in fiscal 2023."
"Accordingly, net income is forecast to be slightly higher than in 2023 overall."
"Merck Financial Services GmbH, Darmstadt, will provide the company with sufficient financial resources as 
needed and thus ensure liquidity."
No risks that could jeopardize the continued existence of the company have been identified.
"It provides a transparent overview of the 
relationship between compensation and performance, and presents the compensation awarded or due to the 
members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in fiscal 2023."
"Both, the Supervisory Board and the 
Executive Board have jointly prepared the Compensation Report in accordance with section 162 of the German 
Stock Corporation Act (AktG) as well as the German Corporate Governance Code in the version dated April 
28, 2022."
"It is formally audited in accordance with section 162 (3) AktG as well as materially audited by 
Deloitte Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft GmbH."
"The Compensation Report and the corresponding audit opinion 
can be found on our website."
Major differences between the two legal forms exist in terms of liability and management.
"In the 
case of an AG, only the AG is liable as a legal entity, whereas the general partners of a KGaA also have 
unlimited personal liability for the company’s obligations (section 278 (1) AktG)."
"Unlike the management board 
members of an AG, the members of the Executive Board of our company are personally liable partners of both 
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and the general partner E."
"Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany, and not merely 
employed members of a corporate board."
"Given the structural differences between an AG and a KGaA, several 
recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code apply to a KGaA only in a modified form."
"Review of fiscal 2023 
Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year, which ended with a satisfactory business result despite difficult 
macroeconomic conditions."
These challenging conditions were also evident in the share price development.
"Ultimately, the diversified business model had a positive impact on our business results."
"The Life Science 
business sector faced a noticeable decline in demand for products and services related to the Covid-19 
pandemic and the destocking of our Process Solutions customers, which lasted longer than expected."
"At the 
same time, the Electronics business sector was impacted by a prolonged downcycle in Semiconductor Solutions 
and low customer utilization in Display Solutions."
"The Healthcare business sector made a positive contribution 
to the company’s success in fiscal 2023."
Our new healthcare products led to robust growth.
"In particular, sales 
of multiple sclerosis drugs and oncology drugs achieved good sales in our opinion."
"In fiscal 2023, we continued to focus on achieving our three core sustainability targets."
"In the long term, we 
want to fully integrate sustainability into our value chains, contribute to human progress for more than one 
billion people through sustainable science and technology, continue to reduce our resource consumption, and 
achieve climate neutrality."
"To encourage the implementation of our long-term sustainability targets, 
corresponding key sustainability indicators and targets were also integrated in the sustainability factor of the 
Long-term Incentive Plan granted in 2023 (LTIP 2023)."
"For the members of the Executive Board, the contractually agreed compensation remained unchanged and 
there were no increases in fiscal 2023."
"In 2021, the LTIP was revised with a term of four years (previously 
three years)."
This extension of the performance cycle results in a one-time payout gap.
"As a consequence, the 
members of the Executive Board will not receive any payout from the Long-Term Incentive Plan for fiscal 2023 
and there will also be no other payment to bridge the gap."
"We will report on the target achievement and payout 
of the LTIP tranche 2021, which runs until December 31, 2024, in the next Compensation Report."

Germany, of the current year and the two previous years, to ensure a long-term orientation."
"Thus, the profit 
sharing for the 2023 financial year considers the very successful years 2021, 2022 as well as the current 
challenging year 2023."
"In fiscal 2023, Marcus Kuhnert stepped down as Chief Financial Officer and Member of the Executive Board of 
Merck as of June 30, 2023."
"On July 1, 2023, Helene von Roeder took over the position of Chief Financial Officer."
"Since 2019, she had been a member of both the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and 
the Board of Partners of E."
"Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany."
"During that time, she was also Chair of the Audit 
and Finance Committee."
"She has resigned from these mandates and left the Supervisory Board effective  
April 17, 2023."
"Barbara Lambert was appointed to the Supervisory Board with effect from August 11, 2023."
"Approval of the Compensation Report 2022 
At the Annual General Meeting 2023, the Compensation Report 2022 was approved with a voting result of 
84.63% in accordance with section 120a (4) AktG."
"Only shareholders of Merck KGaA are entitled to vote at the 
Annual General Meeting."
"In the course of the Annual General Meeting 2023 and in numerous discussions thereafter, Merck received 
feedback from investors, all relevant shareholder associations and proxy advisors on the compensation of the 
Executive Board as well as the presentation of the Compensation Report."
"As in the previous year, we are following suggestions from our investors, we are publishing the target corridor 
of the respective key performance indicators of the sustainability factor for the second time at the beginning of 
the performance cycle of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)."
"To provide a complete overview of the compensation system, we continue to describe the most important 
components of the Compensation Report in detail and at the same time have improved the presentation."
"In addition, we have further clarified the description of the maximum compensation, illustrating how the 
different compensation components are limited."
"Some discussions with investors focused on the level of the compensation of the Executive Board compared 
with other companies."
"In this context, it should be noted that the position of the members of the Executive 
Board as personally liable partners does explain a different level and structure of compensation."
"On a regular 
basis, we initiate a compensation benchmark to assess the level of our compensation."
"To consider, the criteria 
of country, size and industry as well as Merck’s global business activities and the various business sectors, two 
peer groups were used for comparison: the DAX® companies and a peer group of international competitors."
"The 
latter peer group of international competitors represents our three business sectors (Life Science, Healthcare 
and Electronics) and includes companies which are headquartered in Europe as well as in the USA."
"In addition, we have again decided to follow the presentation and interpretation of section 162 (1) of the 
German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) chosen last year for the compensation tables."
"In this context, we also 
monitor the practices of other companies to align with common market practice where necessary."
The exchange with our investors is an important and continuous process.
"During the Annual General Meeting 2024 
and also as part of the review of the compensation system for the Annual General Meeting 2025, we will regularly 
continue to obtain feedback and stay in dialogue with investors."
"In this way, we can ensure that we receive 
constructive and valuable feedback, which can be considered in the upcoming review and potential adjustment to 
the compensation system and decisions of the Personnel Committee."
"Accordingly, we will report on the feedback 
received in the next compensation report."

Compensation for fiscal 2023 – Summary 
For fiscal 2023, no payment will be made from the LTIP."
"In 2021, an LTIP was introduced, with a performance 
period of four years in total (previously three years)."
"As a result, there is a one-time payout gap without 
bridging payments."
The LTIP is therefore not considered in the following graphics below.
"As a result, the 
maximum values represent the sum of the base salary, additional benefits and service costs for fiscal 2023 as 
well as the maximum amount of profit sharing."
"Summary of the compensation for the Executive Board members’ performance up to December 31, 
2023 (see page 8 below “Executive Board Compensation for 2023”) 
1 The average calculation includes the compensation of Kai Beckmann, Peter Guenter and Matthias Heinzel."
"Peter Guenter's compensation payment is not 
illustrated."
"Since Marcus Kuhnert left the Executive Board and Helene von Roeder became a member of the Executive Board during the year, their pro-rated 
compensation would distort the illustration and have therefore not been considered."
"Compensation for fiscal 20231 – Chronological overview 
 
1 In 2021, the revised LTIP with a performance cycle of four years (previously three years) was introduced which resulted in a one-time payout gap without 
bridging payments."
"The LTIP tranche 2021 runs until December 31, 2024, and will be paid out in April 2025 due to the one-year holding period."
"That is the 
reason why the LTIP tranche 2021 is not included in the chronological overview."

Determining the compensation of the Executive 
Board 
At our company, unlike at publicly listed German stock corporations, it is not the Supervisory Board but the 
Board of Partners of E."
"Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany, that is responsible for designing and reviewing the 
compensation system and deciding on the amount and composition of compensation paid to Executive Board 
members."
The Board of Partners has assigned this task to its Personnel Committee.
"As a result, the Personnel 
Committee is responsible for the development and regular review of the compensation system, i.e."
"structuring 
and examining of the performance-independent and performance-related compensation elements."
"The 
Personnel Committee also takes into account the compensation system for managers and employees below 
Executive Board level to ensure consistency and a uniform steering effect between the compensation systems."
"Furthermore, the Personnel Committee is responsible for defining the annual targets and thresholds of the key 
performance indicators for the performance-related compensation elements."
"In addition to structuring the Executive Board compensation system, the Personnel Committee is responsible 
for defining the specific amounts of compensation paid to the members of the Executive Board."
"Overall, the peer group offers an appropriate ratio of companies 
headquartered in Europe and the United States as well as a balanced coverage of the Life Science, Healthcare 
and Electronics business sectors."
"Based on the size criteria of sales, number of employees and market 
capitalization, Merck positions itself around the median of this international peer group."
"Moreover, for the determination of the specific compensation amounts, the relations between Executive Board 
compensation, top management compensation and workforce compensation will be considered also based on a 
multi-year assessment."
"Top management is defined as senior levels of management below the Executive Board 
in Germany."
"The average compensation of an employee in full-time employment in Germany is considered in 
the determination of the compensation of the remaining staff."
"The Personnel Committee regularly reviews the amount and structure of the Executive Board compensation by 
referring to the peer groups described and with the assistance of an independent compensation consultant."
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
168 
 
Overview of the structure of the compensation 
system 
Compensation components  
Executive Board compensation includes three main components: base salary, profit sharing and the Long-Term 
Incentive Plan."
It is complemented by contributions to the company pension plan as well as additional benefits.
"Additional compensation arrangements also exist for the members of the Executive Board, in particular malus 
and clawback provisions and a Share Ownership Guideline."
"The performance-related compensation elements – profit sharing and the Long-Term Incentive Plan – are based 
on a multi-year performance period and as such are fully oriented toward the company’s long-term 
development."
"In addition, there is a strong reference to the company’s share price, to provide for special focus 
on our shareholders’ interests."
"The key performance indicators selected for variable compensation are derived 
from the corporate strategy and form part of our central controlling system."
"In this way, the variable 
compensation of the Executive Board members is used as a strong steering tool to ensure a focus on our 
objective of long-term profitable growth accompanied by strong cost discipline."
"The compensation system for the Executive 
Board is published on our Website and applies to all members of the Executive Board since January 1, 2021."
"The Personnel Committee ensures compliance with the compensation system by deciding by resolution on the 
parameters of the compensation elements (e.g."
"target setting, determination of target achievement, etc.) as 
well as on the amounts to be paid out."
The following section reports on the compensation awarded or due in accordance with section 162 (1) AktG.
"Accordingly, the following sections contain all amounts paid to individual members of the Executive Board 
(active and former members) in fiscal 2023 (compensation awarded) as well as all amounts legally due but not 
yet received (compensation due)."
"In addition, the compensation for which the members of the Executive Board have provided the underlying 
service in full by December 31, 2023, but whose payment will be made in the following year, is disclosed on a 
voluntary basis."
"This enables transparent information and ensures the link between performance and 
compensation in the fiscal year."
"This year, the voluntary reporting only concerns profit sharing for 2023."
"The 
Personnel Committee has provisionally determined the payout amounts of the profit-sharing by resolution and 
informed the members of the Executive Board accordingly."
"The final amount will be paid to the members of the 
Executive Board after the consolidated financial statements of E."
Merck KG have been released.
"After amending 
the compensation system of the Executive Board effective January 1, 2021, an additional one-year holding 
period was introduced for the LTIP, which applies for the first time to the LTIP Tranche 2021."
"Therefore, the 
performance period of the LTIP tranche 2021 will run until the end of fiscal 2024 and payout will be made in 
April 2025."
"The LTIP tranche 2020, however, ran until the end of fiscal 2022 and was paid out in April 2023."
"As 
a result, payout of the LTIP tranche 2021 can only be reported on a voluntary basis in the Compensation Report 
2024."
"The obligation to report on the LTIP tranche 2021 applies for the first time in the Compensation Report 
2025."
"Performance-independent compensation 
Base salary 
As base salary, the members of the Executive Board receive contractually fixed performance-independent 
amounts that are paid in the form of 12 equal monthly installments."
"There was no increase of the base salary in 
fiscal 2023."
"Additional benefits 
The additional benefits mainly include company cars for personal use, contributions to insurance policies and 
expenses for personal protection."
"In addition, as compensation for the loss of entitlements to variable compensation from his previous 
employment relationship, Peter Guenter received upon the initial appointment in fiscal 2021 a commitment to 
compensation totaling € 1,500,000.00."
"The entitlement has been verified in the context of his initial 
appointment based on supporting documents and the amount has been determined accordingly."
"The 
compensation is to be paid in cash in four equal installments."
"The first installment was paid on July 1, 2021, the 
second installment was paid on July 1, 2022, and the third installment was paid on July 1, 2023."
"The final 
installment will be paid out on July 1, 2024, provided the employment relationship continues."
"The loss of variable 
compensation claims against Vonovia SE were proven on the basis of corresponding supporting documents."
"The 
compensation for the loss of the short-term incentive for the year 2023 covers the period until her appointment 
to the Executive Board of Merck KGaA (January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023) and amounts to € 257,125."
"The 
amount will be paid out in fiscal 2024."
"As a corresponding compensation payment, 50% of the 
gross amount that would have resulted from Helene von Roeder’s complete entitlement to the long-term 
incentive for the year 2023 is to be reimbursed."
"However, the maximum payout amount according to Vonovia’s 
Long-Term Incentive Plan Rules will be considered."
"Therefore, the amount can only be calculated after the 
publication of the 2026 annual financial statements of Vonovia SE and will be paid out in 2027."
"Should it not be 
possible to calculate the payout amount, 50% of the allocation value of Vonovia’s long-term incentive for 2023 
will be paid out (€ 618,750)."
"In this way, it is ensured that Helene von Roeder is only compensated for the 
actual loss of long-term incentive."
The entitlement to the compensation payment has arisen in full.
"In fiscal 
2023, provisions of € 695,549 were made regarding this compensation."
"Pension entitlement 
The members of the Executive Board are granted a pension obligation as a direct commitment."
"Once the pension event occurs, the 
amount in the benefit account is paid out either in ten annual installments or as a one-time payment."
"The 
pension event occurs upon retirement, in the event of occupational disability or death."
"After leaving the Executive Board, Marcus Kuhnert retains a vested entitlement to the pension account, which 
will be granted to him upon the occurrence of the pension event."
"In fiscal 2023, no pension contributions were 
increased."
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
172 
 
Performance-related compensation 
Performance-related compensation comprises profit sharing as well as the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)."
"Profit sharing 
As regards profit sharing, an individual profit-sharing rate is contractually defined for the members of the 
Executive Board as a per mille rate of the three-year average of the consolidated profit after tax of 
E."
"Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany."
"Fiscal 2023 and the two preceding fiscal years are included in the 
calculation."
"The use of profit after tax as the key performance indicator, which also serves as the basis for dividend 
payments, ensures very close alignment with shareholder interests."
"To appropriately consider the individual performance of the Executive Board members, the Personnel 
Committee may modify the payment by applying a factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.2."
"In determining the level of 
this factor, the Personnel Committee applies the following criteria, which also include sustainability goals."
"Similarly, multiplying by a value less 
than 1.0 down to 0.8 can reduce profit sharing if the circumstances call for it."
"The members of the Executive Board are obligated to hold one-third of the payout of the profit sharing in 
shares of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for at least four years."
"Further details are provided under the 
heading “Share Ownership Guideline”."
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
173 
 
The following illustration shows the profit sharing for fiscal 2023: 
 
An average profit after tax of at least € 0.75 billion must be generated for the profit-sharing payment to be made."
This minimum threshold reflects the “pay-for-performance” approach of the compensation system.
"If the profit 
exceeds this threshold, the individual profit-sharing rates are staggered as illustrated in the following graphic:  
 
The maximum profit-sharing payment is capped individually."
"It amounts to € 4,810 thousand for Belén Garijo, 
€ 3,500 thousand for Kai Beckmann, € 3,900 thousand for Peter Guenter, € 3,900 thousand for Matthias 
Heinzel and € 3,300 thousand for both Marcus Kuhnert and Helene von Roeder."
"In fiscal 2023, the maximum 
payout for Marcus Kuhnert is € 1,650 thousand due to leaving the Executive Board on June 30, 2023, and for 
Helene von Roeder it amounts also to € 1,650 thousand due to her entry on July 1, 2023."
"The three-year average that is relevant for fiscal 2023 was based on the profit after tax generated by the 
E."

The Personnel Committee has set the adjustment factor at 1.0 for all members of the Executive Board, taking into 
account individual performance and contribution to the sustainability targets against the background of the agreed 
criteria."
This is in recognition of the achievements of the members of the Executive Board for fiscal 2023.
"The 
Executive Board faced many challenges as a result of difficult macroeconomic conditions, headwinds from 
competitors, and the fact that studies with Evobrutinib did not achieve the desired success in a late test phase."
"The 
Personnel Committee acknowledges that, thanks to the commitment of the members of the Executive Board, fiscal 
2023 could be closed satisfactorily under the given conditions."
"In addition to the economic aspect, the members of 
the Executive Board continued to focus on our three key sustainability targets."
"Sustainable leadership and well-
thought-out decisions by the Executive Board have ensured that the Merck Group remains focused on long-term 
growth."
Considering the relevant three-year average of the E.
"Merck Group's profit after tax, the individual sharing rates 
and the performance factor, the profit sharing and the shareholding obligation for fiscal 2023 are as follows:

Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
Long-Term Incentive tranche for fiscal 2023 
The Long-Term Incentive Plan is designed as a virtual performance share plan."
"It is based on a four-year 
future-oriented performance cycle that is composed of a three-year target achievement cycle and, since the 
2021 tranche, a subsequent one-year holding period."
"In addition to three financial performance indicators, the 
LTIP has taken sustainability targets into account since fiscal 2022."
"These targets are linked to a sustainability 
factor."
"The sustainability factor has a range of 0.8 to 1.2 and can increase or reduce the target achievement 
resulting from the financial key performance indicators by up to 20%."
"The following graphic illustrates the 
calculation of the Merck Share Units (MSUs) as well as the functionality of the sustainability factor."
"Calculation of the MSUs 
As part of the LTIP, members of the Executive Board are provisionally granted a certain number of virtual 
shares, so-called share units of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (""MSUs"")."
"The number of MSUs is calculated 
as follows: An individual grant in Euros is set for each Executive Board member."
"Every year, this grant is 
divided by the definitive reference share price at the beginning of the performance cycle, resulting in the 
number of MSUs that the respective member is provisionally entitled to receive."
"The number of MSUs actually allocated to the Executive Board members after the end of the target 
achievement cycle depends on the development of the financial performance indicators and the sustainability 
factor during the three-year target achievement cycle."
"Based on the three financial performance indicators, the number of MSUs allocated may be between 0% and 
150% of the provisionally granted MSUs."
"The resulting number of MSUs is then multiplied by the sustainability 
factor."
"The sustainability factor target achievement can range between 0.8 and 1.2 and is determined by the 
predefined sustainability key indicators."
"Thus, the total number of MSUs actually allocated can amount to a 
maximum of 180% of the provisionally granted MSUs."
The target achievement cycle is followed by a one-year holding period.
"The final payout amount may be 
between 0% and a maximum of 250% of the amount originally granted and depends on the number of MSUs 
actually allocated and the reference share price at the end of the performance cycle."
"The number of MSUs actually allocated after the end of the target achievement cycle is based on the following 
target achievement curves."
"The targets and thresholds for the key performance indicators of the EBITDA pre 
margin and organic sales growth are defined by the Personnel Committee at the start of the performance cycle 
and subsequently published in the Compensation Report."
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
177 
 
 
Non-financial key indicators of the sustainability factor 
With the introduction of the sustainability factor in fiscal 2022, our sustainability strategy also becomes 
incorporated into the LTIP."
"These values are used to calculate target achievement at 
the end of the relevant target achievement cycle."
"In this context, our Healthcare business sector measures how many people worldwide will be 
treated with our company's medical products."
"On the one hand, we look at the number of people treated 
with products from the Healthcare business sector and, on the other hand we consider patients who are 
offered treatment with our praziquantel tablets as part of the schistosomiasis control program."
"For the LTIP 
tranche 2023, an additional sustainability key indicator has been introduced that relates to our Life Science 
business sector."
"It covers people who are treated with drugs and medical products which are that are 
manufactured using key Merck Life Science technologies and products."
"We intend to continuously increase 
this sustainability goal and thus contribute to a significant improvement in medical care and the health 
status of as many people as possible."
"• 
“Partnering for sustainable business impact” 
We measure our progress in embedding sustainability in our supply chains."
"We achieve this by increasing 
the transparency of our supply chains and subjecting more suppliers to a sustainability assessment."
"We are 
focusing particularly on suppliers for which we see a sustainability risks in the supply chain and those 
suppliers who cover a relevant share of our supplier spend."
"In connection with this sustainability 
assessment, it is important for us to increase the number of suppliers with a valid sustainability 
assessment."
"• 
“Reducing our ecological footprint” 
On our path to climate neutrality, we have already joined the Science Based Targets Initiative and aim to 
reduce both direct (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2) by 50% by 2030 compared with 2020."
"This 
target is to be achieved through the reduction of process-related emissions, energy efficiency measures, 
and increased purchase of electricity from renewable sources."
"Particularly in the case of process emissions 
(Scope 1), we aim to significantly reduce emissions by using new technologies."
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
179 
 
Target Achievement Long-Term Incentive Plan  
The LTIP tranche allocated in fiscal 2021 was still without a sustainability factor but already included the one-
year holding period."
"Accordingly, the performance cycle is four years, consisting of the target achievement 
cycle of three years and the one-year holding period which will continue to be influenced by the share price 
development."
"Consequently, the target achievement cycle started on January 1, 2021, and was running until 
December 31, 2023."
"The final payout amounts of the LTIP Tranche 2021 will be determined after calculating the 
base price following the holding period and will be paid out in April 2025."
"The payout amounts will be published 
in the next compensation report."
"The LTIP tranche 2020 was structured according to the former model without a one-year holding period and 
without a sustainability factor."
"Consequently, the LTIP tranche 2020 has been paid out in April 2023."
"The resulting final number of MSUs and the payout amounts of the LTIP tranche 2020 are shown in the 
following table."
A pro-rata payout has been made for Stefan Oschmann and Udit Batra.
"The payout for Belén Garijo was 
reduced to ensure compliance with the cap on direct compensation."
"The performance cycle of the LTIP tranche 2022 is still running until December 31, 2025, and will be paid out in 
April 2026."

Share Ownership Guideline 
Since 2017, the members of the Executive Board are obliged to invest in and hold shares of Merck KGaA, 
Darmstadt, Germany, as part of the Share Ownership Guideline (SOG) valid until fiscal 2021."
"Since the 
introduction of the new compensation system at the beginning of fiscal 2021, the share ownership obligation 
has been linked to the variable compensation element of profit sharing."
"Under the revised SOG, members of 
the Executive Board are required to hold one-third of the net profit-sharing payout in shares for at least four 
years."
"The shareholding obligation thus builds up gradually over the first four fiscal years after the introduction 
of the new compensation system."
"The aim is that the Chairperson holds 200% of the base salary and the 
members of the Executive Board to hold 100% of the base salary in shares of Merck KGaA."
"A corresponding 
investment was made after payout of the profit sharing 2022 in fiscal 2023 as part of an automated purchase 
via an external provider."
"The following table illustrates the investment volume of the members of the Executive Board in accordance with 
the SOG."
The numbers show the shareholding obligation arising from the profit-sharing.
"No conclusions can be 
drawn as to the individual shareholdings."
Shareholding obligation is calculated on the respective net amounts.
"Malus and clawback provisions 
Through their status as personally liable general partners of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, and 
E."
"Merck KG, Darmstadt, Germany, the Executive Board members bear a unique entrepreneurial responsibility."
"This is also reflected by the malus criteria set forth in profit sharing and by the German statutory regulations on 
liability for damages stipulated in section 93 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)."
"In order to take even 
greater account of the prominent position of entrepreneurial responsibility in compensation, a clawback 
provision is implemented for the LTIP."
"In these cases, 
amounts that have already been allocated under the Long-Term Incentive Plan may be retained."
"The Personnel 
Committee is entitled to demand the repayment of profit sharing and LTIP payouts from a member of the 
Executive Board if it subsequently transpires that the payout was made wrongfully, either in full or in part."
"For 
example, this is the case when targets are not actually met or are not met to the extent assumed when the 
payout was calculated due to incorrect information being applied."
"The extent of these claims for restitution is 
based on section 818 of the German Civil Code (BGB)."
"The Personnel Committee may agree deadlines for the 
assertion of claims for restitution with the members of the Executive Board."
Neither the malus provision nor the clawback provision were exercised in fiscal 2023.
"Corporate Governance ___ Compensation Report 
181 
 
Compensation-related transactions 
Contracts with the members of the Executive Board are usually concluded for a period of five years."
"If a 
contract begins during the year, the fixed compensation, profit sharing and individual LTIP tranches are paid on 
a pro rata basis."
"Should members of the Executive Board be held liable for financial losses while executing their duties, this 
liability risk is covered by a D&O insurance policy under certain circumstances."
"The D&O insurance policy has a 
deductible in accordance with the legal requirements."
"Obligations in connection with the termination of Executive Board membership 
The contracts of the Executive Board members do not provide for ordinary termination."
"The right to 
extraordinary termination for good cause in accordance with section 626 BGB is available to both parties 
without observing a notice period."
"The contracts of the Executive Board members may provide for the continued payment of fixed compensation 
to surviving dependents for a limited period in the event of death."
"Above and beyond existing pension 
obligations, no further obligations are provided for in the event of the termination of the contractual 
relationships of the Executive Board members."
"The amounts payable to Executive Board members are capped in the event of the early termination of the 
contract without good cause justifying such termination."
"Pursuant to this, payments in connection with the 
termination of an Executive Board member’s duties shall not exceed twice the annual total compensation or 
constitute compensation for more than the remaining term of the employment contract (severance cap)."
"Should obligations resulting from the LTIP continue to apply, any early severance payout is excluded."
"Likewise, 
no early payout or severance for the profit-sharing payment is granted."
"If the compensation in the fiscal year in 
which the Executive Board member’s duties cease is expected to be significantly higher or lower than in the

compensation at its own discretion."
"In fiscal 2023, a termination agreement was reached with Marcus Kuhnert regarding the early termination of 
his membership in the Executive Board with effect from June 30, 2023."
"Initially, the term of his contract would 
have ended on July 31, 2024."
"In accordance with the contract as well as with the compensation system, the 
termination agreement regulates the continued payment of the fixed compensation of € 100,000 per month as 
well as the payment of profit-sharing and LTI for the initial contract term until July 31, 2024."
"Furthermore, the 
additional benefits will be paid out."

Post-contractual non-competition  
Post contractual non-competition clauses have been agreed with the members of the Executive Board except 
for Marcus Kuhnert."

event of termination of his membership of the Executive Board."
"In general, the post-contractual non-
competition clause involves the payment of compensation amounting to 50% of the member’s average 
compensation within the last twelve months and is paid for a period of two years."
"Other earnings, pension 
payments and any severance payments are offset against this amount."
"Owing to his early termination, a post-contractual non-compete was agreed with Marcus Kuhnert with effect 
until July 31, 2024."
"As compensation, the post-contractual non-compete agreement provides for the payment

Compliance with the defined maximum compensation

performance-related and performance-related compensation elements awarded or due in a fiscal year."
"Pension 
payments are not included in the maximum compensation."
"The maximum compensation for the fiscal year is € 11,500,000 for the Chair of the Executive Board and 
€ 9,500,000 each for ordinary members of the Executive Board."
"The sum of the compensation awarded or due 
in accordance with section 162 AktG less any pension payments and plus pension expenses is below the defined 
maximum compensation in accordance with section 87a AktG for all members of the Executive Board."
"In addition to the maximum compensation, there is a separate contractually agreed payment cap for each of 
the performance-related compensation elements."
"A maximum amount has been set for the amount of profit 
sharing for all members of the Executive Board (please find more details in the paragraph “profit sharing”)."
"The 
payout from the Long-Term Incentive Plan cannot exceed 2.5 times the individual award value, even in cases of 
exceptional performance."
"In addition, there is a contractually agreed maximum limit on the direct compensation, i.e."
"the sum of base 
salary, profit-sharing, and LTIP."
"In this context, it is stipulated that capping, if necessary, shall be applied first 
to the LTIP and then to profit sharing."
"To ensure compliance with this cap, the 2020 LTIP payment for Belén 
Garijo was reduced accordingly by € 476,514 thousand."
"Compliance with the defined maximum compensation is ensured by the Personnel Committee setting the 
amounts of the variable compensation components by resolution."
"The defined maximum compensation and the

Comparative presentation of compensation and 
earnings development 
The comparative presentation in accordance with section 162 (1) no."
"For employee compensation, the average personnel expenses excluding company pension costs are used."
"This 
reflects the total compensation of employees worldwide."
"For members of the Executive Board, the compensation awarded or due in the fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 
2023 is used in accordance with section 162 AktG."
"For the years 2020 and 2019, the allocated compensation is 
used excluding the service costs according to the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) sample table in 
the Compensation Report of the respective fiscal year."
"The executive directors and the 
supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they consider necessary to enable the 
preparation of a compensation report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error."
"Auditor’s Responsibilities 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this compensation report, including the related disclosures, based 
on our audit."
"We conducted our audit in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial 
Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"These Standards require that we 
fulfill the professional responsibilities and that we plan and perform the audit so that we obtain reasonable 
assurance as to whether the compensation report, including the related disclosures, is free from material 
misstatements."
"An audit involves performing audit procedures in order to obtain audit evidence for the amounts stated in the 
compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"The choice of the audit procedures is subject to the 
auditor’s professional judgment."
"This includes assessing the risk of material misstatements, whether due to 
fraud or error, in the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"In assessing these risks, the 
auditor considers the system of internal control, which is relevant to preparing the compensation report, 
including the related disclosures."
"Our objective is to plan and perform audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not to express an audit opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal 
control."
"An audit also comprises an evaluation of the accounting policies used, of the reasonableness of 
accounting estimates made by the executive directors and the supervisory board as well as an evaluation of the 
overall presentation of the compensation report, including the related disclosures."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion."
"Audit Opinion 
In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the compensation report for the financial 
year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, including the related disclosures, complies, in all material respects, 
with the accounting principles of section 162 AktG."

Other Matter – Formal Audit of the Compensation Report 
The audit of the content of the compensation report described in this report comprises the formal audit required 
under section 162 (3) AktG including the issuance of a report on this audit."
"Since our audit opinion on the audit 
of the content is unmodified, this audit opinion includes that the disclosures required under section 162 (1) and 
(2) AktG are contained, in all material respects, in the compensation report."
"Intended Use of the Report 
We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company."
"The audit has been 
performed for the purposes of the Company and the report is solely intended to inform the Company about the 
result of the audit."
"Liability 
This report is not intended to be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision."
"However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties."
"Given the 
structural differences between an AG and a KGaA, several recommendations of the German Corporate 
Governance Code are to be applied to a KGaA only in a modified form."
"Major differences between the two legal 
forms exist in terms of liability and management."
"In the case of an AG, only the AG is liable as a legal entity, 
whereas the general partners of a KGaA also have unlimited personal liability for the company’s obligations 
(section 278 (1) AktG)."
"At Merck KGaA, this pertains to both E."
"Merck KG – which is excluded from 
management and representation pursuant to article 8 (5) of the Articles of Association – as well as to the 
managing general partners who collectively make up the Executive Board of Merck KGaA."
"The members of the 
Executive Board of Merck KGaA are therefore subject to unlimited personal liability."
"Unlike an AG, their 
executive authority is not conferred by the Supervisory Board, but rather by their status as general partners."
This legal form also involves special features with regard to the Annual General Meeting.
"For example, in a KGaA, many of the resolutions made require the consent of the general partners (section 285 
(2) AktG), including in particular the adoption of the Annual Financial Statements (section 286 (1) AktG)."
"Merck KGaA applies the German Corporate Governance Code analogously where these regulations are 
compatible with the legal form of a KGaA."
"All recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code 
in the version dated April 28, 2022, the intent and meaning of which are applied, have been complied with 
since the last Declaration of Conformity was submitted in February 2023."
"For a clearer understanding, the following gives a general explanation of the application of German company 
law at Merck KGaA with additional references to the Annual General Meeting and shareholder rights."

Merck KGaA  
The general partner E."
"Merck KG holds around 70% of the total capital of Merck KGaA (equity interest); the 
shareholders hold the remainder, which is divided into shares (share capital)."
"Merck KG is excluded from the 
management of business activities."
"The general partners with no equity interest (Executive Board) manage the 
business activities."
"Nevertheless, due to its substantial capital investment and unlimited personal liability, 
E."
"Merck KG has a strong interest in ensuring that the businesses of Merck KGaA operate efficiently in 
compliance with procedures."
Merck KGaA’s participation in the profit/loss of E.
"Merck KG in accordance with 
articles 26 et seq."
"of the Articles of Association further harmonizes the interests of the shareholders and of 
E."
Merck KG appoints and dismisses the Executive Board.
"Merck KG has created 
bodies – complementing the expertise and activities of the Supervisory Board – to monitor and advise the 
Executive Board."
This applies primarily to the Board of Partners of E.
"The 
investors, who bear the entrepreneurial risk, are protected as provided for by the German Corporate 
Governance Code."
"We take suggestions from the capital market on corporate governance seriously and hold 
discussions with investors and shareholder representatives."
"The General Meeting of Merck KGaA  
The 28th Annual General Meeting of Merck KGaA was held in Darmstadt, Germany, on April 28, 2023."
"In 2023, 
the Executive Board again decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to hold the 2023 Annual 
General Meeting in virtual form, i.e."
without the shareholders and their proxies attending in person.
"In doing so, 
it exercised the option that the legislation provided with the transitional provision of section 26n (1) of the 
Introductory Act to the German Stock Corporation Act (EGAktG) in relation to virtual annual general meetings 
in accordance with section 118a (AktG)."
"Shareholders and shareholder representatives participated in the 
Annual General Meeting virtually."
The meeting was broadcast audiovisually on the Internet in full.
"At 72.59%, 
the proportion of share capital represented at the meeting (including postal votes) was slightly higher than in 
the previous year."
"In 2022, the proportion of share capital represented was 70.34%."
"The Annual General 
Meeting service provider does not forward voting instructions to Merck in advance of the Annual General 
Meeting but keeps them in the system until the count takes place."
"The shareholders of Merck KGaA exercised their rights at the virtual Annual 
General Meeting using the Internet-based Annual General Meeting system and via video communication."
"In 
addition, the shareholders were again given the opportunity to submit statements on the agenda to the 
company prior to the Annual General Meeting."
"They were able to exercise their voting rights personally, 
through an authorized representative or a proxy appointed by the company, or by postal vote."
"The proxies were 
in attendance throughout the duration of the Annual General Meeting."
"All the documents and information 
concerning upcoming General Meetings (including a summary explanation of shareholder rights) are also posted 
on our website."
"The introductory speech by the Chair of the Executive Board was published in advance on the 
Internet on April 17, 2023, in order to make it available to interested shareholders and members of the public 
and thus satisfy the high transparency requirements of the Merck Group."
"Since the last Declaration of Conformity in February 2023, we have complied 
with all the recommendations of the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code in the 
version dated April 28, 2022, as published in the official section of the German Federal Gazette."
"For this reason, Merck 
uses a wide range of communication platforms to engage in a timely dialog with all interested parties about the 
company’s situation and business changes."
"Merck’s principles include providing factually correct, 
comprehensive, and fair information."
"Information subject to disclosure requirements, as well as information that is not, can be accessed worldwide 
on the Merck KGaA website (www.merckgroup.com), which is the company’s most important publication 
platform."
"In addition to a comprehensive financial calendar, quarterly statements and/or quarterly and half-
year financial reports covering at least the past five years are available there in German and English."
"In line 
with the legal requirements, ad hoc announcements are also published on the website."
"These contain 
information on circumstances and facts that could impact the Merck share price."
"Regular press conferences, investor meetings on the occasion of investor conferences, and roadshows offer 
another platform for dialog."
"The company presentations prepared for this purpose are also available on the 
Merck KGaA website."
"In addition, the Investor Relations team is available to private and institutional investors 
who wish to receive further information."
"To ensure the greatest possible transparency, all documents 
concerning the General Meeting are available on the company website."
"Additionally, at least some parts of the 
General Meeting are generally webcast live on the Internet."
"The Annual General Meeting on April 28, 2023, was 
again held virtually and hence was webcast live on the Internet in full."
"Dealing with insider information 
Dealing properly with insider information is very important to us."
"Our Insider Committee examines the 
existence of insider information, ensures compliance with legal obligations, and prepares any necessary 
measures."
"The members of the Insider Committee are appointed by the Executive Board; at least two members 
work in Group Legal & Compliance."
"The Insider Committee meets at regular intervals or when circumstances 
require."
"The Chief Financial Officer is vested with the authority to make the final decision on handling potential 
insider information."
"In order to ensure a high level of protection for insider information, the Executive Board issued internal insider 
guidelines applicable throughout the Merck Group worldwide."
"The guidelines inform employees about their 
responsibilities under insider trading laws and give clear instructions for compliant behavior."
"In addition, they 
describe the function of the Insider Committee in detail."
"Moreover, our Code of Conduct, which is binding for all 
employees, also contains an explicit, detailed reference to the ban on using insider information."
"Within the 
scope of obligatory training courses on the Code of Conduct as well as specific training courses on insider law, 
all employees are instructed on the key stipulations of insider trading."

cover the company’s early warning risk identification system."
"Moreover, the auditor is required to examine and 
evaluate the accounting-relevant internal control system as part of its audit insofar as this is necessary and 
appropriate for assessing the accuracy of financial reporting."
"Since 2023, Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, has been the auditing firm responsible for 
the statutory audit of the Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements of Merck KGaA."
"The auditor responsible for auditing the Consolidated Financial Statements changes regularly as required by

Daniel Weise is currently leading the audit engagement.
"Mr. Weise has been the auditor in charge of the 
engagement since fiscal 2023."
"The Supervisory Board has found no grounds to doubt the 
independence of Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich."
"Neither party identified any conflicts 
of interest."
"The Audit Committee reviews the quality of the audit, including the performance of the auditor in 
charge of the engagement, annually on the basis of objective indicators."
"It is included as a separate chapter of the Combined Management 
Report."
"An overview of the information contained in the combined non-financial declaration can be found at 
“Topics for the non-financial statement”."
"This will be available from April 11, 2024, as an online version on the 
company’s website at https://www.merckgroup.com/en/sustainability-report/2023."
"In addition, the 
remuneration report, which is also published on the company’s website, is included as a separate item of the 
disclosures on corporate governance."
"Values and compliance  
First and foremost, responsible entrepreneurship means acting in accordance with the law – also known as 
compliance."
"All our activities are required to adhere to the applicable laws, regulations, and international ethical 
standards around the world."
"Compliance violations would result not only in possible legal action but also could 
seriously compromise our reputation as an employer and business partner."
"Our Group Compliance function is responsible for the core topics: Merck’s Code of Conduct, anti-corruption and 
anti-bribery (including healthcare compliance, third-party due diligence, transparency reporting), anti-money 
laundering, and conflicts of interest."
"Group-wide and local policies, procedures, and processes are in place for 
these important compliance topics in order to ensure that our business activities are consistent with the 
relevant laws, regulations, and international ethical standards."
"The Compliance 
department adopts a specific brief in this respect."
A global framework for ethical and legally compliant business processes serves to minimize risk.
"We achieve 
this by identifying specific compliance risks and requirements."
"Suitable policies and effective controls are 
implemented in order to reduce risk."
Our goals also focus on our employees.
"We achieve this by informing 
employees about the applicable compliance rules and ethical standards and by giving them the responsibility for 
complying with these requirements."
"This serves to strengthen employees’ sense of responsibility and 
accountability."
"As compliance is the second line of defense against risks, it is important that we consistently 
safeguard what really matters."
"This is why we regularly monitor key indicators that allow us to assess risks and 
the effectiveness of controls."
"Compliance not only contributes to company growth but also creates targeted 
value added by allowing us to advise the business sectors and help them to navigate the respective compliance 
requirements."
Our advice takes into account and adapts to changing business requirements.
"The Code 
of Conduct applies to all Merck employees in all countries and at all levels of our organization."
"With its Code of Conduct, Merck has established a set of rules intended to help our employees to act 
responsibly and to make the right decisions in their daily work."
"The Code of Conduct explains the company principles for dealings with business associates, shareholders, 
colleagues, and employees, and within the scope of our responsibility for society."
"Therefore, it supports all 
employees in acting ethically – not only in their dealings with one another but also outside the company."
"Accordingly, the Code of Conduct is also the main set of rules for our Compliance Program."
"Merck has aligned 
the content of its Code of Conduct with the Merck values and integrated important topics such as data privacy, 
healthcare compliance, and bioethics."
"To Merck, compliance means observing legal and internal regulations and the basic ethical principles anchored 
in the company’s values."
"With the Code of Conduct and the various unit-specific ethical compliance rules, the 
values are integrated into daily work and business practice."
We also expect our business partners (e.g.
"Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance 
203 
 
customers, suppliers, distributors etc.) to comply with these principles or to have their own comparable 
principles."
"Our Business Partner Code of Conduct describes our expectations and requirements regarding 
human rights, health and safety, integrity, environmental protection, and continuous improvement."
"While 
supplier management ensures compliant behavior of suppliers, global business partner risk management 
encompasses the relations with sales-related business associates such as distributors, commercial agents, 
dealers and high-risk suppliers."
"The Compliance department monitors observance of the Code of Conduct with support from corresponding 
monitoring and training programs throughout the company."
"Suitable controls and tailored training programs 
across the company ensure monitoring of the Code of Conduct."
"All employees are called upon to report 
potential compliance violations, so that Merck can take the necessary and appropriate action."
"In cooperation 
with Group Internal Auditing, the Compliance Office regularly reviews the implementation of Group-wide 
compliance measures at the subsidiaries."
"The audits regularly focus on the local compliance structure, the 
compliance measures taken, and the existence of corresponding compliance guidelines and processes."
"The Group Compliance Officer is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and further development of 
our global Compliance Management System."
"Among other things, the Group Compliance Officer and its team, 
consisting of a global Compliance Center of Expertise and compliance officers, take appropriate measures to 
help lower the risk of serious compliance violations and implement the compliance program across Merck 
globally."
"Our Compliance Center of Expertise is a central body responsible for designing and structuring our 
compliance program in all business areas and Group functions."
"Our Group Compliance Officer reports on the status of our compliance activities, potential risks and serious 
compliance violations to the Executive Board and Audit Committee twice a year at a minimum."
"As part of our 
regular reporting processes, we compile a comprehensive compliance and data privacy report annually for the 
Executive Board."
"This includes the status of our compliance program, continuous improvement initiatives and 
key figures on compliance and data privacy cases."
"Additionally, we prepare a mid-year update to highlight 
ongoing developments and the status of relevant projects and initiatives."
"A further focus area of the Compliance Program is ensuring legally and ethically correct dealings with medical 
stakeholders and adhering to the transparency requirements."
"We, of course, also ensure compliance with 
the respectively valid data protection regulations."
"The importance of compliance is also reflected in the subsidiaries, which ensure via country representatives that 
compliance measures are implemented effectively in the countries."
"Compliance tasks in the countries are 
largely performed by full-time compliance officers."
"In terms of the functional structure, compliance officers in 
the countries report directly and indirectly to the Group Compliance Officer."
"A separate responsibility was 
created for Group functions."
"Regular regional and global compliance meetings are held to promote the 
exchange of information within the Compliance organization."
"This is supplemented by a global concept for local 
compliance forums and global compliance committees, at which relevant compliance-related topics are 
discussed with senior management."
"These constitute an important element of risk assessment and quality 
assurance."
Newcomer trainings are run for newly appointed compliance officers.
"These seminars serve to build up 
compliance expertise and strengthen cooperation within the Compliance organization."
"This Group-wide network 
is used to steer the global Compliance Program."
"The Compliance organization is also involved in the relevant 
due diligence processes for the incorporation of new business units as well as possible divestments and 
acquisitions, and the subsequent integration of companies."
"Within the scope of the global compliance program, 
a high degree of importance is given to regular compliance trainings of the Merck Compliance Training Plan, 
which are conducted as web-based training courses and classroom sessions."
"Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance

As described in various compliance training courses and the Code of Conduct, whistleblowers may choose from 
various reporting channels."
"The choice of reporting channel may depend on the reason for the report and the 
whistleblower’s preferences in the respective circumstances."
"Reports to the central reporting channels, 
including the Compliance hotline, are received directly by an independent and qualified team at Group 
Compliance and examined."
"The report may be forwarded to a different responsible function for further 
processing depending on the nature and content of the report."
"Employees and individuals from outside the 
company can report potential compliance violations to the Compliance hotline by telephone or via a web-based 
application in their respective language."
"The Compliance hotline is available 24 hours a day, free of charge."
"The 
system enables anonymous, two-way communication."
"If there is evidence of a compliance violation, 
corresponding corrective measures are taken based on concrete action plans."
"If necessary, disciplinary 
measures are taken which can range from a simple verbal warning up to the dismissal of the employee who 
violated a compliance rule."
Merck has set up a Compliance Case Committee to guide these processes.
"The 
Compliance Case Committee consists of senior members from various Group governance functions; they are 
involved in reviewing certain compliance violations and initiating appropriate and necessary measures."
"The joint 
work in the Compliance Case Committee enables processes between the various Group functions to be 
coordinated optimally and designed efficiently and potential risks to be addressed adequately."
"Data privacy 
Group Data Privacy at Merck is integrated into the Group’s Compliance organization."
"As required by law, this 
department operates independently and without being required to follow instructions."
"The department regularly 
prepares data privacy updates and produces a comprehensive data privacy report at regular intervals as part of 
our broader compliance reporting efforts."
"The Group Data Privacy Officer has a team of dedicated local data 
privacy officers working in countries that are particularly privacy-sensitive for Merck."
"Other individuals around 
the world also serve as local Data Privacy Officers alongside their core activity for Merck."
"The tasks of these two 
groups of local data privacy officers include implementing and applying the global data privacy policy in the 
countries, performing regular efficiency tests, and promoting awareness of data privacy."
"They also advise the 
company on relevant and critical matters relating to data privacy."
"A Center of Expertise also provides support in 
the form of structures and tools."
"Our data privacy management system encompasses various elements of our portfolio alongside the pillars of 
people and communication."
"The portfolio is composed as follows: 
Elements of our Data Privacy program 
 
 
 
 
Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance

The Data Privacy organization has put specific guidelines in place to ensure that Data Privacy processes comply 
with the relevant regulations."
"The Group Data Privacy Policy defines the standards according to which data is 
processed, stored, used, and transmitted at Merck."
"This enables us to provide a high level of privacy when it 
comes to processing the data of our employees, contract partners, customers, suppliers, patients, healthcare 
practitioners, and participants in clinical trials."
"Our 
understanding of data privacy throughout the Group is based on European legislation in particular, including the 
data privacy principles of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), which has been in force since 
May 2018."
"However, we also comply with and implement local data privacy regulations."
Corresponding training and awareness measures are a core element of any data privacy management system.
"The effective communication of relevant standards, procedures and other guidelines in the form of regular 
training is important, as are regular awareness measures in order to establish an appropriate culture of data 
privacy within our company."
"Our data privacy services comprise general awareness measures, such as e-
learning on data privacy that is mandatory for all Merck employees, and broad-based communication using 
various channels including e-mail and the company intranet, as well as targeted training, e.g."
"interactive 
training for certain subsets of employees and standardized training sets focusing on specific topics and tailored 
to corresponding groups of companies."
"Avoidance of conflicts of interest 
Within the framework of their work, all Executive Board and Supervisory Board members of Merck KGaA are 
exclusively committed to the interests of the company and neither pursue personal interests nor grant 
unjustified advantages to third parties."
"Before an Executive Board member takes on honorary offices, board positions, or other sideline activities, this 
must be approved by the Personnel Committee of the Board of Partners of E."
"The Chair of the 
Executive Board, Belén Garijo, the Chief Financial Officer until June 30, 2023, Marcus Kuhnert, and the Chief 
Financial Officer from July 1, 2023, Helene von Roeder, are also members of the Executive Board of 
E."
"This does not, however, create conflicts of interest."
"In its report to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board discloses any conflicts of interest involving its 
members and how they were dealt with."
"Consultancy agreements as well as other service and work contracts of 
a Supervisory Board member with Merck require the approval of the Supervisory Board."
"In fiscal 2023, there 
were neither conflicts of interest nor consultancy agreements or other service or work contracts with 
Merck KGaA involving Supervisory Board members."
"We have signed up to this charter and declared its principles to be binding 
throughout the Group in our Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy."
"We also adopt environmental safety and protection targets with the aim of permanently improving our 
environmental protection and safety:  
• 
We have set ourselves the goal of climate-neutral business operations along the entire value chain by 
2040."
"By 2030, we aim to reduce our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions by 50% compared 
with 2020."
"Our goal is to achieve this primarily by reducing process-related emissions and implementing 
energy efficiency measures."
"In terms of our Scope 3 emissions, we want to reduce emissions throughout 
the entire value chain by 52% (per € of value added) by 2030."
"These short-term targets for 2030 were 
approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in May 2022."
"The independent initiative assesses 
and approves companies’ targets based on its strict climate science criteria."
"By receiving this confirmation, 
we are helping limit global warming to 1.5 °C, meeting the requirements of the Paris Agreement."
"• 
In addition, we are aiming to source 80% of our purchased electricity from renewable energies by 2030."
"• 
We also intend to reduce the environmental impact of our waste, reduce water intensity, and improve the 
quality of our wastewater by 2030."
"Having achieved our short-term targets for waste and water 
consumption to 2025 ahead of schedule in 2023, we have adopted new ambitions for the period to 2030."
"By the end of the decade, we want to achieve a circularity rate of 70% in our waste flows and improve our 
water intensity (per euro of value added) by 50%."
"• 
To improve occupational safety, we aim to lower the lost time injury rate (LTIR) to below 1 by 2025."
"Merck has also rolled out BeHealthy, a global program aimed at maintaining and promoting employee health."
"The objective of the program is to strengthen the physical, mental, social and workplace-related health of all 
employees for the long term."
"The focal points of the content are healthy leadership, mindfulness, and delivering 
a diverse healthcare offering that is accessible globally."
"Based on the EHS Policy, many guidelines specify how the sites and employees of the Merck Group are to 
observe the principles in their daily work."
"The Group function Corporate Sustainability, Quality and Trade 
Compliance steers these global activities and ensures compliance with statutory requirements, internal 
standards, and business needs throughout the entire Group."
"In this way, Group-wide risks are minimized, and 
continuous improvement is promoted in the areas of environment, health, safety, security, and quality."

1 Internal board position."
2 Members delegated according to article 6 (5) of the Articles of Association.
The Supervisory Board performs a monitoring function.
"It supervises the Executive Board’s management of the 
company."
"In comparison with the supervisory board of a German stock corporation, the role of the supervisory 
board of a corporation with general partners (KGaA) is limited."
"This is due to the fact that the members of the 
Executive Board are personally liable partners and therefore are responsible for the management of the 
company."
"In particular, the Supervisory Board is not responsible for appointing and dismissing general partners 
or for regulating the terms and conditions of their contracts."
This is the responsibility of E.
"Similarly, 
the Supervisory Board does not have the authority to issue rules of procedure for the Executive Board or a 
catalog of business transactions requiring approval."
This is also the responsibility of E.
"Merck KG (article 13 (3) 
sentence 1 and (4) sentence 1 of the Articles of Association)."
"However, the fact that the Supervisory Board has no possibility of directly influencing the Executive Board 
restricts neither its information rights nor its audit duties."
"The Supervisory Board must monitor the legality, 
regularity, usefulness, and economic efficiency of the Executive Board."
"In particular, the Supervisory Board has 
the duty to examine the reports provided by the Executive Board."
"In particular, this 
also includes IT security and sustainability issues, which fall within the responsibility of the Audit Committee."
"The regular reports pertaining to Group Internal Auditing, risk management, the internal control system, and 
compliance are received by the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board."
"In addition, by means of 
consultation with the Executive Board, it creates the basis for supervision of the management of the company 
by the Supervisory Board in accordance with section 111 (1) AktG."
"The Supervisory Board and the Audit 
Committee examine the Annual Financial Statements as well as the Consolidated Financial Statements and the 
Combined Management Report, taking into account the auditor’s reports."
"The adoption of the Annual Financial Statements is 
not the responsibility of the Supervisory Board, but of the Annual General Meeting."
"The Supervisory Board and 
the Audit Committee normally meet four times a year."
"Further meetings may be convened if requested by a 
member of either the Supervisory Board or the Executive Board."
"As a rule, resolutions of the Supervisory Board 
are passed at meetings at the instruction of the Chair."
"In exceptional cases a resolution may be passed by 
other means, details of which are given in the rules of procedure."
The members of the Board of Partners of E.
"Merck KG and of the Supervisory Board may be convened to a joint 
meeting if so agreed by the chairpersons of the two boards."
"The Supervisory Board has adopted rules of procedure for its activities that are available on the company’s 
website at: https://www.merckgroup.com/company/who-we-are/management-and-company-
structure/supervisory-board/EN/Rules-of-Procedure-Supervisory-Board-EN.pdf."
The rules of procedure prescribe that the Supervisory Board may form committees.
"The Supervisory Board has 
formed a Nomination Committee and an Audit Committee."
The Nomination Committee comprises three shareholder representatives.
"Its members are Wolfgang Büchele 
(Chair), Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff, and Simon Thelen."
"The Nomination Committee is responsible for proposing 
to the Supervisory Board suitable candidates for its proposal to the Annual General Meeting."
"In addition to the 
legal requirements and the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, the objectives of the 
Supervisory Board with respect to its composition, the qualification matrix, and the diversity policy must be 
taken into consideration."
The Audit Committee comprises three shareholder representatives and three employee representatives.
"The 
members of the Audit Committee are Helene von Roeder (Chair) until April 17, 2023, and Barbara Lambert 
(Chair) since August 11, 2023, Wolfgang Büchele, Jürgen Glaser, Sascha Held, Christian Raabe, and Daniel 
Thelen."
Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance.
The Chair of the Audit Committee should have professional expertise in at least one of the two areas.
"As 
financial experts, Helene von Roeder and Barbara Lambert both have particular knowledge and experience of 
the application of reporting principles and internal control and risk management systems."
"They are also familiar 
with auditing and, in this context, with sustainability reporting."
"Helene von Roeder’s aforementioned knowledge 
is based, among other things, on her previous role as a member of the Management Board of Vonovia SE, to 
which she belonged first as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and later as Chief Technology Officer (CTO)."
"She was 
also the Chair of the Audit Committee of the company’s Supervisory Board and the Finance Committee of the 
Board of Partners of E."
"Merck KG (stepping down on April 17, 2023)."
"Helene von Roeder thus qualifies as a 
financial expert within the meaning of section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and 
Recommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"Barbara Lambert’s aforementioned 
knowledge is based, among other things, on her education and many years of activity as an auditor and a 
 
Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance 
211 
 
member of the Board of Directors of Banque Pictet & Cie SA until 2022."
"Among other things, she is also a 
member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the Audit Committee of Deutsche Börse AG and a member of the 
Board of Directors of UBS Switzerland AG."
"In these roles, she regularly participates in the training offered by 
the respective companies."
"Barbara Lambert thus qualifies as a financial expert within the meaning of 
section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Recommendation D.3 of the German 
Corporate Governance Code."
"Furthermore, the Vice Chair of the Audit Committee, Daniel Thelen, qualifies as a 
financial expert within the meaning of section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and 
Recommendation D.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"A fully qualified lawyer with a Master of 
Business Administration (MBA) and many years of experience as a member of the Audit Committee, he has 
particular knowledge and experience of the application of reporting principles and internal control and risk 
management systems."
"Finally, Wolfgang Büchele also has expertise in the area of accounting."
"His expertise 
results from his role as CEO of Exyte GmbH, his many years as a member of the executive boards of other 
companies, and his membership of other supervisory bodies."
"Wolfgang Büchele thus also qualifies as a financial 
expert within the meaning of section 100 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Recommendation 
D.3 of the German Corporate Governance Code."
"Defining the required knowledge in more detail, a further provision of the German Stock Corporation Act also 
states that the members of the Supervisory Board must be collectively familiar with the sector in which their 
company operates."
"This requirement is addressed in the Supervisory Board’s qualification matrix, which 
stipulates that the Supervisory Board should have at least four members who possess such knowledge of the 
sector."
"We currently meet this requirement (see also “Objectives of the Supervisory Board with Respect 
to Its Composition, Profile of Skills and Expertise, and Qualification Matrix”)."
"Information on the 
independence of the shareholder representatives can be found under “Objectives of the Supervisory Board 
with Respect to its Composition, Profile of Skills and Expertise, and Qualification Matrix”."
The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee conduct regular self-assessments every two years.
"These take 
the form of an internal efficiency review based on an extensive questionnaire."
"The questionnaire includes 
feedback on cooperation within the Supervisory Board, corporate governance, accounting, risk management, 
and the dialog with the Executive Board and the Audit Committee."
"The next self-assessment of the Supervisory 
Board is scheduled for 2024."
"Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance

Board of Partners of E."
"Merck KG 
Some of the responsibilities that lie with the supervisory board of a German stock corporation are fulfilled at 
Merck by E."
This applies primarily to the Board of Partners of E.
"Accordingly, the Board of 
Partners as well as the composition and procedures of its committees are described below."
The Board of Partners has nine members.
"It informs itself 
about the business matters of Merck KGaA and may inspect and examine the company’s accounts, other 
business documents, and assets for this purpose."
"According to article 13 (4) of the Articles of Association of 
Merck KGaA, the Executive Board requires the approval of E."
"Merck KG for transactions that are beyond the 
scope of the Group’s ordinary business activities."
"For such transactions, approval must first be obtained from 
the Board of Partners of E."
"The Board of Partners convenes as and when necessary; however, it 
 
Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance

normally meets four times a year."
"The members of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA are invited to all 
meetings of the Board of Partners, unless the Board of Partners resolves otherwise in individual cases."
"The 
members of the Board of Partners may convene a joint meeting with the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA if so 
agreed by the chairpersons of the two boards."
The Board of Partners may delegate the performance of individual duties to committees.
"Currently, the Board of 
Partners has three committees in place: the Personnel Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Research 
and Development Committee."
"Personnel Committee 
The Personnel Committee has four members: Johannes Baillou (Chair), Wolfgang Büchele, Michael Kleinemeier, 
and Frank Stangenberg-Haverkamp."
The Personnel Committee meets at least twice a year.
"Further meetings 
are convened as and when necessary."
"Meetings of the Personnel Committee are attended by the Chair of the 
Executive Board of Merck KGaA unless the Committee decides otherwise."
"The Personnel Committee passes its resolutions by a simple majority; in 
matters concerning the Chair of the Executive Board, unanimity is required."
"The Chair of the Committee 
regularly informs the Board of Partners of its activities."
"Finance Committee 
The Finance Committee has four members: Wolfgang Büchele (Chair) since May 9, 2023, and Helene von 
Roeder (Chair) until April 2, 2023, Johannes Baillou, Daniel Thelen, and Simon Thelen."
"The Finance Committee 
holds at least four meetings a year, some of which are joint meetings with the Audit Committee of the 
Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA."
At least one meeting is a joint meeting with the auditor of Merck KGaA.
Further meetings are convened as and when necessary.
"Meetings of the Finance Committee are attended by the 
Chief Financial Officer of Merck KGaA."
"Other members of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA may attend the 
meetings upon request of the Finance Committee."
"These meetings regularly include the Chair of the Executive 
Board."
"Among other things, the Finance Committee is responsible for analyzing and discussing the Annual 
Financial Statements, the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the respective reports of the auditor, as well 
as the half-year financial report and the quarterly statements."
"In addition, the Finance Committee addresses 
Merck’s net assets, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, as well as accounting issues."
"Upon 
request of the Board of Partners, the Finance Committee examines investment projects that must be approved 
by the Board of Partners and provides recommendations pertaining thereto."
"It passes its resolutions with a 
simple majority."
The Chair of the Committee regularly informs the Board of Partners of its activities.
"Research and Development Committee 
The Research and Development Committee has four members: Helga Rübsamen-Schaeff (Chair), Johannes 
Baillou, Katharina Kraft, and Simon Thelen."
"The Research and Development Committee is convened as and 
when necessary but holds at least two meetings a year."
"Meetings of the Research and Development Committee 
are attended by members of the Executive Board of Merck KGaA upon request of the Committee."
"These 
meetings regularly include the Chair of the Executive Board as well as the CEO Life Science, the CEO 
Healthcare, and the CEO Electronics."
"Among other things, the Research and Development Committee is 
responsible for reviewing and discussing the research activities of the Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics 
business sectors."
It passes its resolutions with a simple majority.
"The Chair of the Committee reports to the 
Board of Partners on the insights gained from the meetings."
"To 
this end, we pursue both voluntary and legally required objectives, and we work continuously and sustainably 
to achieve them."
"As a global company with correspondingly aligned global (leadership) structures, we are 
striving to increase the proportion of management positions held by women (managers, experts, and project 
managers in roles 4 and above)1 as a voluntary goal."
Our aim is to achieve gender parity by the end of 2030.
"In addition, Merck KGaA is subject to the statutory obligations under section 76 (4) AktG."
"• 
Second management level of Merck KGaA below the Executive Board: 31.8% of positions held by women, 
also corresponding to full headcounts at the date on which the targets were defined."
"The first management level comprises all managers of Merck KGaA with a direct reporting line to the Executive 
Board of Merck KGaA or who belong to the Global Executive Group."
"The second management level comprises all 
managers of Merck KGaA who report to managers with a direct reporting line to the Executive Board of 
Merck KGaA or the Global Executive Group."
"Rather, the Executive Board of Merck KGaA consists of personally liable general partners (see 
also the description of Supervisory Board procedures)."
"In line with its diversity policy, however, Merck also 
continues to pursue representation of both genders as an objective for the Executive Board."
"1 This group makes up around 7% of the total workforce; see the description under ""Diversity and management""."
"Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance

Diversity policy pursuant to section 289f (2) 
no."
"6 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 
Merck is pursuing a Group-wide, global diversity strategy."
"At Merck, diversity stands for a culture of inclusion, 
mutual esteem, and respect."
"To demonstrate this open and dynamic company culture, we promote diversity, 
equal opportunity, and inclusion throughout the Group – and do so at all levels, including the Executive Board 
and Supervisory Board."
"We believe that a diverse workforce boosts the innovative strength of the Merck Group and contributes 
materially to our business success."
"That is why Merck is furthering a culture of diversity independent of factors 
such as age, gender, disability, ethnic or cultural background, religion, industry experience, and educational 
background."
"In this context, it should be noted that, with 
respect to the Executive Board of Merck KGaA, many rules can only be applied correspondingly."
"This is because 
the Executive Board comprises personally liable general partners of Merck KGaA and is not a management 
board with employed members of a corporate body (for details, please also see the “Joint Report of the 
Executive Board and the Supervisory Board”)."
"The statements made therein form part of the 
diversity policy for the Supervisory Board presented here."
"Corporate Governance ___ Statement on Corporate Governance 
216 
 
Age 
Our boards are to have a balanced age structure."
"This permits future-oriented and consistent succession 
planning and is a key element of sustainable company management and monitoring."
"Maximum age limits apply 
to both boards."
"A maximum age of 70 applies to members of the Executive Board, while the standard age limit 
for Supervisory Board members is 75."
"Our diversity policy aims for an age range of at least ten years between 
the youngest and the oldest member of the respective board."
The current composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board satisfies this objective.
"The age 
range of the Supervisory Board is 35 years, while the age range of the Executive Board is currently ten years."

than 64,000 employees at locations in 66 countries, internationality and the associated global mindset is one of 
our key success factors."

leadership experience or national origin, relative to our key sales markets or those locations that are 
organizationally and culturally relevant to our employee development efforts."
"For both criteria, Europe, North 
America, and Asia-Pacific are currently the key regions."
"The Executive Board meets this objective with management experience in these regions, e.g."
"in the following 
countries: Denmark, United Kingdom, Malaysia, Singapore, Spain, and United States."
"In addition, 40% of the 
Executive Board members are not German citizens."
"Management experience 
The key prerequisites for high-performance leadership teams are the diversity of the individual competency 
profiles and a balance between an internal and external management perspective."
"In addition, it is 
important for the composition of the Executive Board to ensure a good balance of members from within and 
outside the company."
"Our diversity policy seeks to derive inspiration and innovation from outside the company 
and to identify the latest trends of relevance to the core businesses of the company, while ensuring 
sustainability and continuity in line with our corporate culture."
"The current Executive Board fulfills both of the aforementioned objectives: All required aspects of the 
competency profile are covered by at least one member of the Executive Board."
"Likewise, two members of the 
Executive Board possess multiple years of experience working within the Merck Group prior to their 
appointment to the Executive Board."

interdisciplinary aspect to a very high degree."

The Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA currently comprises 16 members, of whom eight represent the 
shareholders and a further eight represent the employees."
"The eight employee representative members are 
elected by employee delegates pursuant to the provisions of the German Co-determination Act (MitbestG)."
"These consist of six company employees, including a senior executive, as well as two union representatives."
"The Supervisory Board has no statutory right of proposal with respect to the election of delegates or employee 
representatives to the Supervisory Board."
"Two of the eight shareholder representatives are appointed under a 
delegation right of E."
"The Supervisory Board also has no statutory right of proposal 
with respect to the exercise of this delegation right."
"The other six shareholder representatives are elected by 
the Annual General Meeting."
"In accordance with section 124 (3) sentence 1 AktG, the Supervisory Board shall 
propose Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting for election."
"These proposals require a 
majority of the votes of the shareholder representative members of the Supervisory Board."
"The next scheduled 
election to the Supervisory Board will take place at the 2024 Annual General Meeting."
"The Annual General 
Meeting is not required to follow the election proposals."
"Accordingly, the appointment objectives and 
competency requirements set out by the Supervisory Board below do not constitute requirements to be met by 
those eligible to elect or delegate members."
"Instead, they are intended to express the objectives pursued by 
the Supervisory Board in office with regard to its advisory and monitoring functions."
"For the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA, professional qualifications and personal expertise are the two most 
important prerequisites for appointments to positions on the Supervisory Board."
"In accordance with the German 
Stock Corporation Act, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and expertise in 
the area of accounting, and at least one additional member of the Supervisory Board must have knowledge and 
expertise in the auditing of financial statements."
"Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and 
assurance."
"The Chair of the Audit Committee shall have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas 
and shall be independent."
"When proposing Supervisory Board candidates for election or delegation, the 
Supervisory Board will always give top priority to these prerequisites, which are essential for fulfilling its legal 
duties."
"Overall, the Supervisory Board’s policy is to optimally meet its monitoring and advisory duties by 
ensuring diversity among its members."
"In particular, diversity includes internationality as well as different 
experience backgrounds and career paths."
"The proportion of women on the Supervisory Board is also 
considered to be an aspect of diversity."
"Additionally, the Supervisory Board shall support the Executive Board in its efforts to 
increase diversity within the company."
"Internationality 
The Supervisory Board shall have at least three members with business experience in the main sales markets of 
Merck KGaA."
"Currently, the main sales markets of Merck KGaA are Europe, America, and Asia-Pacific."
"The 
present composition of the Supervisory Board satisfies this objective."
"More than three Supervisory Board 
members have entrepreneurial experience in a wide range of European countries."
"More than three Supervisory 
Board members have experience in management positions in companies that operate globally."
"Women on the Supervisory Board 
Six women are currently members of the Supervisory Board of Merck KGaA."
"This corresponds to a share of 
women of 37.5%."
"The Supervisory Board has undertaken to comply with the minimum quotas set out in 
section 96 (2) sentence 2 AktG separately for the shareholder and employee representatives."
"When nominating 
candidates for election to the Supervisory Board or making proposals for delegations, the Supervisory Board 
shall examine whether the percentage of women can be increased by suitable candidates."
"The Supervisory 
Board considers the 37.5% share of female members to be satisfactory at the present time."
"This is due to the 
percentage of women in leadership positions at Merck and in consideration of the composition of the 
Supervisory Boards of other companies of comparable size."
"Independence 
The Supervisory Board shall have an appropriate number of independent shareholder representatives as 
members."
"In any case, at least five of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board shall be 
independent."
"According to the Articles of Association of Merck KGaA, six members representing the 
shareholders are to be elected by the Annual General Meeting, and two members are to be delegated."
"Taking 
this and the special ownership structure of Merck KGaA into account, the shareholder representatives consider 
five shareholder representatives to be an appropriate number of independent members."
"In the opinion of the 
shareholder representatives, the objectives concerning independent members are met at the present time."
"In 
determining the independence of Wolfgang Büchele, the shareholder representatives took account of the fact 
that he has been a member of the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years, which the German Corporate 
Governance Code considers to be an indicator of a lack of independence."
"Exercising their own professional judgment, the shareholder representatives satisfied themselves that this 
indicator does not contradict their assessment that Wolfgang Büchele is, on the whole, independent of the 
company and its Executive Board."
"In his work on the Supervisory Board and its committees and in the exercise 
of his duties, Mr. Büchele continues to demonstrate the necessary critical distance from the company and its 
Executive Board, along with the capacity for objective judgment."
"Moreover, Mr. Büchele has confirmed in a 
personal statement that he considers himself to be independent of the company and its Executive Board."
"In addition, the shareholder representatives do not believe that membership of the Board of Partners of 
E."
Merck KG conflicts with independence.
"The Board of Partners exists to complement the skills and expertise of 
the Supervisory Board and its activities."
"Like the Supervisory Board, it supports the Executive Board in an 
independent advisory and control function."
"This is not expected to lead to material and not merely temporary 
conflicts of interest."
"It should also be taken into account that, due to its substantial capital investment and 
unlimited personal liability, E."
"Merck KG has a strong interest in the businesses of Merck KGaA operating 
efficiently and in compliance with procedures, thus counteracting from the outset any conflicts of interest 
between E."
"Merck KG and Merck KGaA and hence any corresponding conflicts of interest between the members 
of the respective corporate boards."
"No Supervisory 
Board member serves on a board of or advises a major competitor."
"Moreover, no Supervisory Board member 
performs a function that could lead to a lasting conflict of interest."
"Age limit 
As a rule, the members of the Supervisory Board shall not exceed the age of 75."
"This objective is met at the 
present time."
"Regular limit on the length of Supervisory Board membership 
The objective of the Supervisory Board regarding its composition is that, as a rule, all members shall belong to 
the board for an uninterrupted period of no more than twelve years."
"This objective is also met at the present 
time (with the exception of Wolfgang Büchele; see the discussion under “Independence” above)."
"The length of 
membership of the Supervisory Board members is set out in the “Procedures of the Executive Board, 
Supervisory Board, Board of Partners, and its Committees” section of the Statement on Corporate 
Governance."

"Shares in Merck KGaA are traded on the regulated market of the 
Frankfurt Stock Exchange and on other exchanges."

section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) was issued and can be viewed at

"The fiscal year is the

"These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros, the reporting currency."
The values presented in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded.
"This may lead to individual 
values not adding up to the totals presented."
"The Executive Board of Merck KGaA prepared these consolidated financial statements on February 14, 2024, 
and approved them to be forwarded to the Supervisory Board."
"The Supervisory Board is responsible for 
examining the consolidated financial statements and declaring whether it approves them."
"The accounting and measurement policies used in the consolidated financial statements are presented in the 
respective Notes and are indicated there."
"Although the 
tax rules apply to the ultimate parent company of the Group, E."
"Merck Kommanditgesellschaft, top-up taxes 
could be payable in a number of jurisdictions, and this could have an impact on the Merck Group."
"Allocation of taxing rights (Pillar I) 
The planned allocation of taxing rights between jurisdictions as part of the OECD rules is currently still being 
negotiated."
An analysis of the available drafts found that the rules are likely to apply to Merck.
"Due to the 
status of the negotiations and the lack of clarity concerning the participation of key nations, it is not currently 
possible to make a reliable statement about the expected impact."
"Ensuring global minimum taxation within the OECD (Pillar II) 
The legislation on global minimum taxation was published in the German Federal Law Gazette on December 27, 
2023, and came into force on January 1, 2024."
"The exception provided by IAS 12 for the recognition and 
disclosure of information about deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with income taxes relating to 
global minimum taxation was applied for fiscal 2023."
"Jurisdictions where Merck has material operating activities and where the nominal tax rate is below 15% are 
Ireland and Switzerland."
"Merck is currently taking action to ensure that it satisfies the reporting obligations and 
tax compliance requirements arising from the legislation."
"When it comes to determining the effective tax rate, 
the legislation provides for numerous specific adjustments that can lead to effective tax rates that differ from 
those calculated in accordance with IAS 12.86."
"For example, it is possible that the 
specific adjustments provided for the calculation of minimum taxation will not result in a tax burden for Merck 
even though the effective tax rate calculated in accordance with IAS 12.86 is lower than 15%."
"Conversely, 
minimum taxation may apply even if the effective tax rate is higher than 15%."
"Based on a preliminary calculation and taking account of the data available as of the reporting date, Merck 
anticipates an additional annual tax expense in a mid-double-digit million-euro amount."
"This resulted in a reclassification in the amount 
of € 158 million."
"The changes in provisions and other assets and liabilities in the operating cash flow were 
adjusted by € 166 million accordingly."
"For the same reason, liabilities in connection with wages and salaries have been reported in other non-financial 
liabilities rather than other financial liabilities since January 1, 2023."
"With regard to the comparative period 
(December 31, 2022), this resulted in the reclassification of € 127 million to other non-financial liabilities (of 
which € 121 million to other current non-financial liabilities)."
"Accounting and measurement policies  
Currency translation 
Functional currency 
The subsidiaries of Merck KGaA conduct their business largely in the respective local currency, which they use 
as their functional currency."
"However, some subsidiaries, particularly in the Electronics business sector, use the U.S."
"dollar as their 
functional currency rather than the local currency."
"Transactions in non-functional currency 
When the financial statements of consolidated companies are prepared, business transactions that are 
conducted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated using the exchange rate on the date 
of the transaction."
"Translation of financial statements into the reporting currency (Euro) 
The financial statements of consolidated companies not using the euro as their functional currency are 
translated into the reporting currency, the euro."
"Assets and liabilities are measured at the closing rate while 
income and expenses are translated at average monthly rates."
"Any currency translation differences arising 
during consolidation of Group companies are recognized in equity."
"In Argentina, 
Merck uses a combination of the wholesale index IPIM (Índice de precios internos al por mayor) and the 
consumer price index IPC (Índice de precios al consumidor)."

"The index applied stood at 1,859.4 as of the balance sheet date (December 31, 2022:

"In accordance with the requirements of IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in 
Foreign Exchange Rates” for financial statements in non-hyperinflationary reporting currencies, the prior-year 
amounts have not been restated."
"The respective loss from the net position of the monetary items is recognized within other operating expenses and 
reported separately as a loss from hyperinflation accounting (see Note (14) “Other operating expenses”)."
"After adjusting the amounts for inflation, the balance sheet items and income and expenses are translated into 
the reporting currency, the euro, at the closing rate in accordance with IAS 21.42."
"Exchange rates of most significant currencies

"The discretionary 
scope and estimation uncertainty are assessed on a company-specific basis."
"Discretion describes the need to 
make assumptions concerning recognition or measurement when applying accounting policies."
"Sources of 
estimation uncertainty affecting the selection of the valuation techniques to be applied relate in particular to the 
parameters used therein."
"The degree of estimation uncertainty may vary considerably depending on the 
availability and reliability of the input factors."
"Increased uncertainty due to the macroeconomic situation  
The continued dynamic development of the macroeconomic environment means that the degree of uncertainty 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements remains high."
"In particular, uncertainties included 
the sustained high level of inflation, the development of interest rates, geopolitical challenges, and efforts on 
the part of various nations to reduce international dependencies along with the related trade restrictions and 
sanctions."
This applies in particular to the recoverability of non-financial assets.
"Based on the information 
currently available, there is no evidence of significant impairment losses to date."
"Furthermore, as in previous 
years, there are no grounds to suggest that the going concern assumption should not have been applied in 
preparing the consolidated financial statements."
"Impact of inflation 
The high rate of inflation slowed in fiscal 2023."
"Procurement costs for materials and energy in particular, which 
were mainly reflected in the increased cost of sales, remained above the level seen in previous years."
"As in the 
previous year, the cost of purchasing natural gas and electricity came to a low triple-digit million-euro amount 
 
Consolidated Financial Statements ___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements___ General Disclosures

for the Group in fiscal 2023."
"As in the previous year, Merck was able to offset these increased procurement 
costs by passing on price rises to the market."
"The assumptions concerning the long-term salary and pension 
trends applied in calculating pension obligations were reviewed again in fiscal 2023 to reflect the development 
of inflation, as they had been in the previous year."
"Compared with the previous year, however, this resulted in 
an adjustment and an increase in defined benefit obligations in connection with the measurement of defined 
benefit pension plans only in certain countries (see Note (33) “Provisions for employee benefits”)."
"Impact of higher interest rates 
The sustained high level of interest rates in fiscal 2023 affected our customers’ refinancing costs, especially in 
the Life Science business sector, resulting in lower customer demand."
"Direct impact of armed conflicts 
The war in Ukraine has not had any material effects on the Merck Group’s net assets, financial position, or 
results of operations owing to its limited business volume in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and the Republic of 
Moldova."
"In fiscal 2023 and 2022 alike, the total share of Group net sales generated in the aforementioned 
countries amounted to less than 1.5%."
"Furthermore, the conflict in the Middle East did not have a material 
impact on the Merck Group’s net assets, financial position, and results of operations in the reporting period."
"In 
fiscal 2023 and 2022 alike, the share of Group net sales generated with customers in Israel was less than 1%."
"Impact of trade restrictions, sanctions, and supply chain bottlenecks 
In the past, inventories were increased in order to limit the risks in connection with supply chain disruption."
"Accordingly, there is a heightened risk of subsequent write-downs if it is not possible to process or sell these 
inventories."
"Furthermore, the impact of the trade restrictions concerning semiconductor materials that were 
imposed between the United States of America and China in the fourth quarter of 2022 has been examined 
since fiscal 2022."
No impairment losses have been recognized to date.
"However, there is considerable 
uncertainty with regard to future developments."
"Reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions 
Merck has set itself the goal of reducing its direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions 
by 50% in comparison with the 2020 base year in the period from 2020 to 2030."
"By 2030, 80% of its 
purchased electricity will come from renewable sources."
"Merck also plans to reduce the indirect emissions along 
the entire value chain (Scope 3) in terms of metric kilotons of CO2 equivalents per euro of gross profit by 52% 
by 2030 and to achieve climate-neutral business operations along the entire value chain (Scope 1-3) by 2040."
"In 2022, the Science Based Targets Initiative confirmed that the targets for 2030 and the necessary measures 
support its ambition and that of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C."
"switching to sea transportation), and  
• 
recognition of a shadow price for the CO2 emissions of major projects."
"Transition-related climate risks 
Transition-related climate risks describe the consequences for companies as a result of the transition to a more 
sustainable economic system."
"The most significant transition-related climate risks to the net assets, financial position, and results of 
operations are in the Electronics business sector, which is responsible for well in excess of half of the Group’s 
direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions."
"The majority of these greenhouse gas 
emissions take the form of process-related emissions resulting from the production of specialty gases for the 
semiconductor and electronics industries."
"In order to achieve the climate goals it has adopted, the Group 
intends to reduce the emissions in its business with these specialty gases by making technological 
improvements to the production process in particular."
"The recoverability of the assets recognized in connection 
with these products depends on the successful implementation of the technological improvements in 
production, as they could largely prevent the risk of long-term price rises due to the increased pricing of 
greenhouse gas emissions."
"Furthermore, based on the information currently available, the implementation of 
Merck’s sustainability strategy is not expected to result in a significant decline in net sales in this business."
"There have been no indications of impairment of the assets concerned to date, nor has it been necessary to 
adjust their remaining useful lives."
"There is significant estimation uncertainty due to the long-term nature of 
the underlying analyses and the high degree of uncertainty concerning future development."
"Merck has concluded several virtual purchase agreements for the purchase of electricity from renewable energy 
sources as an additional measure to mitigate climate risks, and it also intends to increasingly purchase such 
electricity physically."
"After signing two virtual power purchase agreements in 2022, renewable energy sources 
will account for 90% of the electricity consumed by Merck in the United States and 55% of its global electricity 
consumption in the future."
This will further increase the proportion of energy consumption covered by renewable energy sources.
"Merck participates in EU emissions trading and purchases emission certificates where the certificates allocated 
by the public authorities are not sufficient to cover Merck’s greenhouse gas emissions."
"The impact of this EU 
emissions trading is currently immaterial to Merck’s net assets, financial position, and results of operations."
"Physical climate risks 
Physical climate risks describe the risks that could result from longer-term changes in the general climatic 
conditions."
"All in all, the identified physical climate risks have not led to any material direct 
accounting impact."
"However, there is significant estimation uncertainty due to the long-term nature of the 
underlying analyses and the high degree of uncertainty concerning future development."
"The implementation of these measures will adversely impact profit before tax in a 
mid-double-digit million-euro amount in 2024."
"No other events of particular importance that could have a material impact on the net assets, financial position, 
or results of operations occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date."

subject to liquidation procedures, which were subsequently measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income."
"Overall, the impact of subsidiaries not consolidated due to immateriality on net sales, profit after tax, assets, 
and equity was less than 1% relative to the entire Merck Group."
"The two companies accounted for using the 
equity method are Syntropy Technologies LLC, United States, and MM Domain Holdco Limited, United Kingdom."
There is also one (2022: two) joint operation within the meaning of IFRS 11 (Resonac Versum Materials Co.
"LTD, Japan, formerly: Showa Denko Versum Materials 2 Co., Ltd., Japan)."
"This joint operation is immaterial to 
the presentation of the net assets, financial position, and results of operations."
"The effects of the existing 
contractual arrangements also have no potentially significant effect in these contexts."
"The list of shareholdings presents all of the companies included in the consolidated financial statements as well 
as all of the shareholdings of Merck KGaA (see Note (48) “List of shareholdings”)."
"As observable market prices 
are mostly not available for the acquired other intangible assets, Merck regularly relies on the expertise of 
external professionals when it comes to business combinations."
"Where management considers it to be appropriate, the optional concentration test set out in IFRS 3.B7B is 
applied in individual transactions in order to determine the presentation of the transaction in the consolidated 
financial statements."
"Divestments 
The assessment as to when a non-current asset, disposal group, or discontinued operation meets the 
prerequisites of IFRS 5 for classification as “held for sale” is subject to discretionary judgment."
"The transaction closed on 
February 22, 2022, after regulatory clearances and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions."
"The 
purchase price amounted to US$ 793 million (€ 702 million) in cash."
"The determination of the fair values for 
Exelead was completed by December 31, 2022."
"Exelead specializes in complex injectable formulations, including the lipid nanoparticles that are key 
components of mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) therapeutics for treating Covid-19 and other indications."
"The aim of the acquisition is to use Exelead’s capacities and expertise to expand the service range for mRNA 
contract development and manufacturing and to provide a fully integrated offering across the entire mRNA 
manufacturing process."
"The business was integrated into the Life Science Services business unit, which is part 
of the Life Science business sector."
Acquisition of the chemicals business of Mecaro Co.
"Ltd., Korea 
On December 30, 2022, Merck successfully completed the acquisition of the chemicals business of Mecaro Co."
"Ltd., Korea (Mecaro), trading as M Chemicals Inc., Korea (M Chemicals), after obtaining the necessary 
regulatory clearances; the acquisition had been announced on August 17, 2022."
"Mecaro is a Korea-based, 
publicly listed manufacturer of heater blocks and chemical precursors for semiconductors."
The acquisition forms part of the Level Up growth program of the Electronics business sector.
"M Chemicals 
primarily develops and produces precursors used in thin film deposition."
"The total purchase price involved 
payments totaling € 90 million, of which € 80 million and € 9 million were due and were paid in 2022 and 2023 
respectively."
"No preliminary purchase price allocation had taken place by the time the 2022 consolidated financial statements 
were prepared."
"The total difference between the purchase price and the net assets acquired, amounting to 
€ 46 million, was therefore recognized as goodwill on a preliminary basis at this date."
"The purchase price 
allocation was completed in 2023 and served to reduce goodwill by € 5 million, which mainly resulted in a 
reclassification to other intangible assets."
"Acquisition of Erbi Biosystems Inc., United States 
Merck acquired all the shares in Erbi Biosystems Inc., United States (Erbi), on December 1, 2022."
"The purchase 
price amounted to € 78 million in cash."
"Erbi is the developer of BreezTM, one of the few micro-scale, fully automated, functionally closed and continuous 
perfusion cell culture platform technologies on the market."
"By integrating BreezTM into its existing Mobius® 
portfolio, Merck can offer a full range of bioreactors, cell retention systems, and devices as well as cell culture 
media."
The business is allocated to the Process Solutions business unit in the Life Science business sector.
"No preliminary purchase price allocation had taken place by the time the 2022 consolidated financial statements 
were prepared."
"The total difference between the purchase price and the net assets acquired, amounting to 
€ 72 million, was therefore recognized as goodwill on a preliminary basis at this date."
"The purchase price 
allocation was completed in 2023 and served to reduce goodwill by € 21 million, which mainly resulted in a

"The company was acquired in full by Novartis AG, Switzerland, on January 8, 2024."
"The cumulative income recognized in other comprehensive income amounted 
to € 48 million."
"The granting of a license typically constitutes a distinct performance obligation that must 
usually be recognized at a point in time."
"Due to the uncertainty of development results and regulatory events, 
contingent consideration is typically recognized when the event in question has occurred."
"Sales-based and 
usage-based royalties are recognized when the contract partner makes the corresponding sales or uses the 
intellectual property."
"In-licensing agreements 
The accounting and measurement policies for the in-licensing of intellectual property are presented in Note 
(19) “Other intangible assets”."
"As the partner companies do not have customer characteristics, these collaboration agreements do not fall directly 
within the scope of IFRS 15, and any income from upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties is 
reported under other operating income."
"Reimbursements of research and development costs made between the 
collaboration partners are recognized on a net basis in research and development costs."
"Merck recognizes the 
consideration received in the course of collaboration agreements for bundled obligations arising from granting 
rights to intellectual property as well as other goods and services promised as income over the performance 
period in line with industry practice."
"Income is caught up cumulatively upon receipt of uncertain future milestone 
payments attributable to contractual obligations that have already been fulfilled."
"This refers in particular to 
milestone payments subsequent to regulatory approval."
"Under these circumstances, Merck 
recognizes the net sales from the commercialization of products to third-party customers, if Merck takes on the 
role of a principal within the meaning of IFRS 15."
"Expenses resulting from payments made to collaboration 
partners in connection with profit share agreements are reported under Note (14) “Other operating expenses”."
"Estimates are to be made, especially when it comes to determining the transaction price and progress on the 
performance obligation."
"From 2017, avelumab was approved for the 
treatment of several cancer indications under the trade name Bavencio®."
"The overriding objective of the 
strategic alliance was to share the development risks and to expand the two companies’ presence in immuno-
oncology."
The execution of the collaboration agreement was not structured through a separate vehicle.
"Upon 
entry into the agreement in 2014, Pfizer made an upfront cash payment of US$ 850 million (€ 678 million) to 
Merck, which was recognized in the income statement until the end of 2019."
"According to the collaboration agreement, each company bore one half of the development expenses during the 
development period."
"In the commercialization phase, Merck recognized the majority of net sales from the 
commercialization of Bavencio® while Merck and Pfizer evenly split the net amount of sales less defined 
expense components up until the termination of the agreement."
"The net sales recognized by Merck in 
connection with Bavencio® amounted to € 713 million in fiscal 2023 (fiscal 2022: € 611 million)."
"Merck 
recognized a high double-digit million-euro amount in research and development expenses in fiscal 2023, as in 
the previous year, in addition to profit transfer expenses of € 143 million up until the termination of the 
agreement (2022: € 255 million)."
"On March 27, 2023, Merck announced the termination of the alliance agreement with Pfizer on the co-
development and co-commercialization of Bavencio® with effect from June 30, 2023."
"Since the termination agreement came into force on June 30, 2023, Merck has held the exclusive global rights 
for development, manufacturing, and commercialization and has full control over Bavencio®."
"Pfizer’s previous 
even split of the net amount of sales less defined expense components was replaced by a 15% royalty on 
defined net sales of Bavencio® that is reported in the cost of sales (see Note (10) “Cost of sales”)."
"While 
Merck and Pfizer will continue to run their respective clinical studies on Bavencio®, Merck will control all future 
research and development activities."
"Merck will also have sole responsibility for manufacturing the product and 
serving the supply chain."
"Xevinapant is currently being investigated in a Phase III study for patients with untreated high-risk locally 
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy 
and standard fractionation intensity-modulated radiotherapy."
Merck made upfront payments of € 188 million in conjunction with the agreement.
"Moreover, Debiopharm 
received a right to future milestone payments of up to € 710 million in total, dependent on the achievement of 
certain development and sales milestones, plus royalties on future net sales."
"The transaction became effective 
in April 2021."
"The upfront cash payment resulted in the recognition of an intangible asset not yet available for 
use in the amount of € 118 million, an asset under other financial assets for claims for reimbursement in 
respect of Debiopharm, and a prepayment for future development activities."

"The three business sectors differ in terms of their products and services, 
their customers, their sales structures and processes, and the regulatory environment in which they operate."
"However, the activities that are bundled in each individual business sector are extremely similar in terms of 
these criteria."
"The central Group functions also encompass service activities that are the same for all business 
sectors, such as procurement and human resources, as well as other central Group functions that are not 
allocated to any of the business sectors."
"Resource allocation and the assessment of business development are 
performed at the level of the business sectors by the Executive Board of Merck KGaA as the chief operating 
decision-maker."
"In addition to the direct activities of the central Group functions, Corporate and Other includes income and 
expenses, assets, and liabilities, as well as cash flows that cannot be allocated to the reportable segments as 
they are managed at Group level in central Group functions."
"This relates in particular to expenses and income 
for the foreign currency hedging of transactions in operating business, financial expenses, and financial income, 
which include interest expenses and interest income, and income tax expenses and income."
"Financial liabilities, 
pension provisions and income tax assets and liabilities are also allocated to Corporate and Other."
"Moreover, 
the column serves as the reconciliation to the Group figures."
"Apart from net sales, the success of a segment is mainly determined by EBITDA pre (segment result)."
"EBITDA 
pre is a key figure that is not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)."
"However, it 
represents the most important variable used to steer the Merck Group."
"To permit a better understanding of 
operational performance, EBITDA pre excludes depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, and reversals 
of impairment losses in addition to specific adjustments presented below."
"The segment information is derived from the financial figures, which are based on the IFRSs applied in the 
Consolidated Financial Statements."
"Transfer prices for intragroup net sales were determined on an arm’s-length 
basis for all of the business sectors."
"Fixed assets are allocated to the segments on the basis of the degree of 
utilization."
Depreciation expenses are allocated on the same basis.
"Fixed assets are always recognized by the 
buyer at the amortized Group cost following intragroup transactions."
"Services performed by the Group functions

(9) Net sales 
 Accounting and measurement policies  
Nature and timing of revenue recognition 
Net sales are recognized when (or as) the customer obtains control of the asset."
"For sales of goods, the 
customer typically obtains control as soon as delivery is made, given that the customer is generally not able to 
obtain any benefits from the asset before that point in time."
"Input- and output-oriented methods are used to appropriately determine progress on a 
contract-specific basis."
"Although progress is ideally measured using input-oriented methods, output-oriented 
methods are always applied when the input cannot be reliably determined, for example."
"Specifically, the 
appropriate degree of progress is mainly calculated on the basis of milestones reached, time elapsed, units 
delivered, or costs incurred in proportion to the anticipated total costs."
"Licenses for intellectual property are granted to a limited extent in the Life Science and Healthcare business 
sectors."
"Net sales from contracts comprising several separate performance obligations are recognized on a pro rata 
basis when the respective performance obligation has been fulfilled."
"Multiple-element arrangements of this 
nature only exist to a very limited extent in the Life Science business sector."
"Determining the transaction price 
Merck grants customers various kinds of rebates and discounts."
"These, as well as anticipated customer refund 
claims, state compulsory charges, and rebates from health plans and programs, are deducted from sales."
"The 
most significant portion of these deductions from sales is attributable to the Healthcare business sector and, in 
particular, sales in the United States."
"Sales deductions provided on the invoice as price-reducing items, which will likely be applied by customers 
when making the respective payments, are recognized as reduction of trade accounts receivable."
"Expected 
refunds, such as bonus payments, reimbursements for rights of return or rebates from health plans and 
programs, are reported in the consolidated balance sheet under refund liabilities."
"The payment targets contractually agreed between Merck Group and its customers usually range 
between 30 and 60 days."
"Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  
Sales deductions 
The measurement of sales deductions and the corresponding refund liabilities requires extensive estimates."
"Uncertainties exist in particular concerning the extent to which past experience serves as a reliable basis for 
estimating the future development of expected refunds, such as bonus payments, reimbursements for rights of 
return, or rebates from health plans and programs."
"External information from distributors and industry services 
outside of Merck’s control, which are also subject to uncertainty, are used to determine sales deductions."
"Due to a lack of past experience, the estimation uncertainty referenced above is particularly relevant for 
product launches in the Healthcare business sector."
"Any changes in estimates of the parameters listed above have a cumulative impact on the net sales for the 
respective adjustment period."
"If the carrying amount of refund liabilities had been 10% higher as of the reporting date, this would have 
resulted in a € 88 million (2022: € 91 million) reduction in profit before tax."
"Around 5% of this figure 
was recognized over time (2023: € 1,119 million; 2022: € 933 million)."
"Based on past experience, 
around 13% of orders received are not expected to result in net sales until fiscal 2025 or later 
(December 31, 2022: around 10% in fiscal 2024 or later)."

(10) Cost of sales 
 Accounting and measurement policies  
Cost of sales 
The cost of sales primarily includes the cost of manufactured products sold and the merchandise sold."
"Cost comprises the following items: directly attributable costs, such as cost of materials; personnel and energy 
costs; depreciation and amortization; overheads attributable to the production process; and inventory 
impairment losses and their reversals."
"The cost of sales included amortization of intangible assets (excluding amortization of internally generated or 
separately acquired software) in the amount of € 173 million (2022: € 207 million)."
"Material costs amounted to 
€ 3,709 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: € 3,996 million) and were largely reported under cost of sales."
"For the first 
time, the cost of sales also included royalties of € 55 million for Bavencio® as a result of the agreement 
terminating the strategic alliance with Pfizer Inc., United States, which came into force on June 30, 2023 (see 
Note (7) “Collaboration and licensing agreements”)."
"Impairment losses on inventories amounted to € 424 million (2022: € 279 million) in the reporting period, while 
reversals of impairment losses amounted to € 237 million (2022: € 197 million)."
"(11) Marketing and selling expenses 
 Accounting and measurement policies   
Marketing and selling expenses 
Marketing and selling expenses within logistics costs also include expenses for transportation services 
performed on behalf of customers."
The corresponding income from these services is reported under net sales.
"Amortization of the intangible assets under marketing and selling expenses is mainly attributable to customer 
relationships, licenses and similar rights, brands, and trademarks."
"The reduction in logistics costs was due to lower freight rates in international goods transportation and the 
lower sales volume in the Life Science and Electronics business sectors."
"Savings also resulted in lower expenses 
for the internal and external sales force."
"Of the royalty and license expenses, € 51 million (2022: € 53 million) related to the commercialization of Erbitux®."
"For information on the capitalization of development costs and their separation from research and development 
services agreed in conjunction with in-licensing, see Note (19) “Other intangible assets”."
Cost reimbursements for research and development are offset against research and development costs.
"The net income from repayments of subsidies received and reimbursements recognized within research and 
development costs amounted to € 21 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: € 23 million)."
"(13) Other operating income 
 Accounting and measurement policies  
Other operating income 
Other operating income comprises all income that cannot be allocated to net sales or finance income on account 
of its character."
"Income from upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties 
Income from upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties comprises consideration received by Merck 
from contract partners that are not customers."
"This relates in particular to collaboration and out-licensing 
agreements in the Healthcare business sector (see Note (7) “Collaboration and licensing agreements”)."
"The increase in income from contingent consideration was due in particular to a revaluation following the 
achievement of milestones in connection with the biosimilars business that was sold to a subsidiary of 
Fresenius SE & Co."
"KGaA, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, in 2017."
"For information on income from the reversal of provisions for litigation, see Note (27) “Other provisions”."
Currency effects from operating activities in the previous year primarily resulted from cash flow hedges in U.S.
"The calculation is based on the 
company-specific tax rate applicable in the relevant tax year."
"Uncertain income tax assets and liabilities 
Factual assessments are made to calculate uncertain income tax assets and liabilities."
"Uncertain income tax 
matters are recognized depending on the likelihood that the responsible tax authorities will accept the 
respective income tax treatment."
"If recognition by the tax authorities is considered unlikely, the respective 
uncertain tax asset or uncertain tax liability is measured at the most likely amount."
"Uncertain income tax 
liabilities are reported within income tax liabilities."
"Expected income tax-related penalties and interest that do 
not fall within the scope of IAS 12 are treated as provisions in line with IAS 37."
"This corresponds to the recognition of 
deferred tax assets on unused tax credits and tax loss and interest carryforwards."
The recognition of deferred tax assets requires an estimate of the probability of future use.
"Deferred tax liabilities for planned dividend payments within the next twelve months of profits already 
generated are recognized."
"Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty   
Income taxes 
The calculation of the reported assets and liabilities from current and deferred income taxes requires extensive 
discretionary judgments, assumptions, and estimates."
"When assessing income tax assets and liabilities, the interpretation of tax provisions may be subject to 
particular uncertainty."
"The possibility that the relevant tax authorities will take a differing view concerning the 
application and interpretation of tax standards cannot be ruled out."
"Changes to the assumptions underlying the 
interpretation of tax standards, for example as a result of changes in legislation, are recognized in the balance 
sheet when the change comes into force."
"With regard to deferred tax items, there is uncertainty as to when an asset will be realized or a liability settled."
This applies in particular to deferred taxes recognized in the course of company acquisitions.
"Assessing the 
recoverability, particularly of tax credits and tax loss and interest carryforwards, requires assumptions and 
estimates concerning the future taxable income of the respective Group company."
"Furthermore, the extent to 
which a subsidiary’s planned dividend distribution is probable within the next twelve months is discretionary."
"The theoretical income tax expense is determined by 
applying the statutory tax rate of a corporation headquartered in Darmstadt of 31.7% (2022: 31.7%)."
"Income taxes relating to previous periods recognized in fiscal 2023 resulted in 
particular from completed tax audits, changes in income tax liabilities for risks from tax audits, and tax 
assessments for previous years."
dollars to the reporting currency (euro).
"Furthermore, a non-recurring deferred tax income on intangible assets impacted in the amount of € 95 million."
"No deferred tax assets were recognized in the balance sheet for deductible temporary differences and other 
interest carryforwards in the amount of € 13,220 million (December 31, 2022: € 71 million)."
"The increase in 
deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets were recognized in the balance sheet is due to 
the change in the exercise of different tax-related options abroad compared with the previous year."
"The majority 
of these differences can only be utilized until 2029."
"Their utilization for tax purposes is not expected during this 
period."
"Deferred tax liabilities from outside basis differences for planned dividend payouts were recognized in the amount 
of € 157 million (December 31, 2022: € 79 million)."
"Retained earnings of subsidiaries for which no deferred taxes 
were recognized amounted to € 10,627 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 10,249 million)."
"The resulting temporary differences that will be taxable in future periods in the event of dividend payments would 
amount to € 603 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 582 million)."
"Changes in tax loss carryforwards 
Tax loss carryforwards were structured as follows: 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Dec."
The majority of the tax loss carryforwards either had no expiry date or can be utilized for up to 20 years.
"This 
also applies to losses for which no deferred taxes were recognized."
"Deferred tax assets resulting from tax loss carryforwards that exceed deferred tax liabilities relating to the 
same taxation authority and the same taxable entity are not recognized if it is not considered probable that 
taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized."
"As of December 31, 2023, income tax liabilities including liabilities for uncertain tax obligations totaled 
1,473 million € (December 31, 2022: 1,522 million €)."
"• 
The option to recognize interest received and interest payments made is exercised to the extent that such 
transactions are recognized in cash flow from operating activities."
"• 
Tax payments are reported in operating cash flow."
"Only significant transactions where the associated tax 
payments can be practically calculated are recognized in the relevant item of the consolidated cash flow 
statement."
"Tax payments made totaled € 1,053 million in fiscal 2023 (2022: € 1,344 million)."
"Tax refunds received 
amounted to € 38 million (2022: € 145 million)."
Interest paid totaled € 181 million (2022: € 185 million).
"Interest received amounted to € 77 million  
(2022: € 25 million)."
"The item “Neutralization of gains/losses on disposal of fixed assets” included the effects recognized in income 
of the disposal of a non-strategic brand in the Healthcare business sector and a portfolio of licenses and patents 
in the Electronics business sector."
"The corresponding cash inflows are recognized in the cash flow from 
investing activities."
"The change in other non-cash income and expenses contained the neutralization of revaluations of contingent 
consideration recognized in income (see Note (36) “Other financial assets”)."
"The corresponding cash inflows 
are also recognized in the cash flow from investing activities."
"(17) Earnings per share 
 Accounting and measurement policies  
Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after taxes attributable to the shareholders of 
Merck KGaA (net income) by the weighted average number of theoretical shares outstanding."
"The calculation of 
the theoretical number of shares is based on the fact that the general partner’s equity is not represented by 
shares."
"Corresponding to the division of the subscribed capital of € 168 million into 129,242,252 shares (see 
Note (34) “Equity”), the general partner’s equity of € 397 million equates to 305,535,626 theoretical shares."
"Overall, equity capital amounted to € 565 million or 434,777,878 theoretical shares outstanding."
"As in the previous year, equity capital remained unchanged in fiscal 2023."
"The weighted average (basic) 
number of shares was 434,777,878 and thus corresponded to the number of theoretical shares outstanding."
"In 
fiscal 2023 and 2022, there were no shares with a potential diluting effect; as a result, the diluted earnings per 
share were equivalent to basic earnings per share."
"The option to measure 
non-controlling interests at fair value on the date of their acquisition (full goodwill method) is not utilized."
"The purpose of impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 is to ensure that the carrying amount of assets in 
the balance sheet is not higher than their recoverable amount."
"The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair 
value less costs of disposal and the value in use."
"Method for impairment testing 
Impairment testing for goodwill takes place at the level of the Life Science, Healthcare, and Electronics business 
sectors."
"These groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) are the lowest level at which goodwill at Merck is 
monitored for internal management purposes."
"Impairment testing is performed on a scheduled basis in the third quarter of every year and on an ad hoc basis 
where there are indications of impairment."
"The existence of indications of impairment is monitored using 
various factors such as changes in medium-term planning, analyst forecasts, validation multiples, and Merck’s 
average market capitalization compared to its balance sheet equity."
"In the 2023 reporting year, the recoverable amount for all CGUs was primarily determined on the basis of the 
fair value less costs of disposal (2022: Life Science and Electronics on the basis of the fair value less costs of 
disposal; Healthcare on the basis of the value in use)."
"For both fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, the recoverable amount is calculated in accordance 
with the discounted cash flow method (Level 3 in the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy)."
"In calculating the fair value, the expected post-tax cash flows are derived from the medium-term plans 
prepared by the business sectors."
"In the Healthcare CGU, the transition to the terminal value takes place after four years 
starting from the following year."
"Sales planning was based on internal past experience and largely non-
observable input factors in the market, such as future market shares, selling prices and volumes, and new 
products from the development pipeline and expansion investments."
"Profit margins are based on past 
experience adjusted for expected profitability developments."
"In calculating the value in use in the previous year, the most recent medium-term plan approved by the 
Executive Board, with a detailed planning period of four years starting from the following year, served as the 
basis for planning."
"Sales planning was based on past experience and assumptions regarding future market 
shares, selling prices, and volumes."
"Expected cash inflows and outflows from new products from the Healthcare 
development pipeline and expansion investments were not included in the calculation of value in use."
"Profit 
margins were based on past experience adjusted for expected profitability developments."
"Significant measurement assumptions 
In the Life Science CGU, the expected average sales growth in the period until the transition to the terminal 
value was a higher single-digit percentage (2022: higher single-digit percentage)."
"The sales expectation for the 
Life Science CGU is supported primarily by the anticipated long-term positive development in the 
Process Solutions and Life Science Services business units, based on ongoing high market growth and the 
continuing expansion of the portfolio and production capacities."
"Taking into account Group costs allocated on a 
pro rata basis, the EBITDA pre margin applied in the period until the transition to the terminal value was 
around 31% (2022: around 34%)."
"The expected average sales growth in the Healthcare CGU in connection with the calculation of fair value less 
costs of disposal amounted to a mid-single-digit percentage rate in the detailed planning period (2022: mid-
single-digit percentage rate)."
"The sales performance reflected the probability of regulatory approval of drug 
candidates in the existing research and development programs."
"Taking into account Group costs allocated on a 
pro rata basis, the EBITDA pre margin for fair value less costs of disposal applied in the period until the 
transition to the terminal value in the impairment test for fiscal 2023 was around 30%."
"The calculation of the recoverable amount of the Electronics CGU included the expected average sales growth in 
the period until the transition to the terminal value at a higher single-digit percentage (2022: higher single-digit 
percentage)."
"The sales expectation for the Electronics CGU is primarily based on the long-term growth trend in 
the market for semiconductor materials and positive sales contributions from the Level Up growth program with 
an initial investment volume exceeding € 3 billion by the end of 2025."
"Taking into account Group costs allocated 
on a pro rata basis, the EBITDA pre margin applied in the period until the transition to the terminal value in the 
impairment test for fiscal 2023 was around 29% (2022: around 30%)."
"The additional significant value-relevant assumptions underlying the goodwill impairment tests are quantified 
below."
Net cash flows were discounted using the cost of capital after taxes.
"For the calculation of the value in use, 
which was applied in the Healthcare business sector in the previous year, the cost of capital before taxes as 
shown below the table was derived iteratively."
"Assumptions regarding the amount of net cash flows, long-term growth rates, and discount factors are 
considered a material source of estimation uncertainty due to their inherent uncertainty."
"Although Merck 
assumes that the assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount are appropriate, changes to these 
assumptions could result in goodwill impairment with an adverse impact on the net assets, financial position, 
and results of operations."
"In the Electronics CGU in particular, there is a high degree of dependence on the 
assumptions concerning the long-term growth trend in the market for semiconductor materials."
"As in the previous year, the recoverable amount in impairment testing in fiscal 2023 was well above the 
carrying amount of the respective CGU – more than 15% higher, in fact."
"Regardless of this, the results of the 
valuation were checked for plausibility against externally available “sum of the parts” calculations and validated 
using multiples based on peer group information."
"In addition, sensitivity analyses of the key assumptions were performed as part of the scheduled impairment 
tests."
"The following table presents the minimum amount by which individual key assumptions could have 
changed when viewed in isolation before the impairment test triggered the recognition of an impairment loss."

"Goodwill impairment testing did not give rise to the need to recognize any impairment losses in either fiscal 
2022 or fiscal 2023."
"The additions in fiscal 2022 resulted in particular from the acquisition of Exelead Inc., United States (see Note 
(6) “Acquisitions and divestments”)."
"If research and development services to be performed by the seller are also agreed in 
conjunction with the transaction, the related share of consideration is separated and recognized in research and 
development expenses in line with the service performance."
"Contingent consideration linked to milestone payments in connection with the purchase of intangible assets 
arising outside a business combination is recognized as an intangible asset and as a financial liability once the 
milestone is reached."
Contingent consideration in the form of sales-based royalties is expensed when incurred.
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date.
"Costs incurred after regulatory approval are insignificant and are therefore 
not recognized as intangible assets."
"In the Life Science and Electronics business sectors, development expenses 
are capitalized as soon as all the recognition criteria are met and can be verified accordingly."
"This also includes 
expenses that are required for REACH registration."
"Furthermore, development expenses for internal software 
projects and the enhancement of purchased ERP programs are capitalized providing that the relevant criteria 
have been fulfilled."
"Subsequent measurement 
Subsequent measurement is at amortized cost."
"Purchased and internally generated intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized using the straight-
line method over their useful lives."
"The useful lives of customer relationships, brand names, and trademarks, as 
well as marketing authorizations, acquired patents, licenses and similar rights, and software, are usually 
between three and 24 years."
"In determining these useful lives, Merck considers factors including the typical 
product life cycles for each asset and publicly available information about the estimated useful lives of similar 
assets."
"The amortization expense is allocated to the respective functional costs or, if this is not possible, 
recognized under other operating expenses."
"The identification of indications of impairment takes place with the involvement of the responsible departments, 
taking external and internal information sources into consideration."
"Merck examines the existence of indications 
of impairment using various factors, particularly deviations from sales forecasts and the analysis of changes in 
medium-term planning."
An impairment test is performed if there are indications of impairment.
"In the event of 
impairment, an impairment loss is recognized under other operating expenses."
"Impairment losses are reversed 
up to amortized cost and reported in other operating income if the original reasons for impairment no longer 
apply."
"Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and purchased, as well as internally generated intangible assets not 
yet available for use, are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment when a triggering event arises or at 
least once a year."
"Determination of amortization 
Significant assumptions and estimates are required to determine the appropriate amount of amortization of 
other intangible assets."
This relates in particular to the determination of the underlying useful life.
"Identification of a need to recognize impairment loss and reverse impairment loss 
Discretionary decisions are required in assessing substantial evidence of impairment as well as in identifying the 
need to reverse the impairment of other intangible assets."
"Significant valuation-related assumptions and 
estimates are also required to calculate the appropriate write-down amount in impairment testing."

"Right-of-use assets under leases are reported in the balance sheet item “Property, plant, and 
equipment” (see Note (20) “Property, plant, and equipment”)."
"Where the provision of company cars to employees qualifies as an employee benefit within the meaning of 
IAS 19, IFRS 16 is not applied."
"In this case, its balance-sheet treatment is governed solely by IAS 19."
"Separation of lease and non-lease components 
Leases for land, land rights, and buildings are separated into lease and non-lease components."
"Merck otherwise 
elects to exercise the option not to separate non-lease components from lease components."
"Depreciation of the right-of-use assets arising from leases 
Basically, right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term."
"Determining the incremental borrowing rate 
If the interest rate for the lease cannot be reliably determined, the incremental borrowing rate is applied in 
measuring the lease liability."
"At Merck, the incremental borrowing rate is determined on the basis of the risk-
free interest rate of the respective Group company over a similar term and in the same currency."
"This interest 
rate is adjusted using a risk surcharge specific to Merck."
"Merck applies the repayment model to determine the 
current portion of the lease."
"The current portion of the lease corresponds to the repayment share of the next 12 
months."
"Determining the lease term 
Where renewal or termination options are available, their exercise is assessed on a case-by-case basis, 
considering factors such as location strategies, leasehold improvements, and the degree of specificity."
"Merck classifies rights of substitution as not substantive if the facts 
and circumstances of the case do not support a different assessment."
"Determining the lease term 
When determining the lease term, existing renewal and termination options must be evaluated to determine the 
probability that such options will be exercised."
"The assessment of the probability of exercise may be 
discretionary even though it relies on existing and material information on the general economic context, such 
as location strategies, leasehold improvements, or the degree of specificity."
"If the available information does 
not allow a reliable assessment, Merck uses historical experience for comparable situations."
The largest 30 leases accounted for around 50% of total lease liabilities in fiscal 2023 and 2022.
"They are 
essentially for right-of-use assets for office, warehouse, and laboratory buildings."
"If options to renew these 
leases were exercised in future, which is not yet considered likely, this would result in additional potential 
undiscounted cash outflows of up to € 235 million (2022: € 219 million)."
"Where individual contracts include termination options, it was considered unlikely that these would be exercised 
so that additional lease payments were already considered in the corresponding lease liability."
"Determining the incremental borrowing rate 
Determining the risk-free interest rate and determining the risk surcharge are both discretionary."
"In measuring right-of-use assets under leases, Merck is subject to estimation uncertainty regarding any 
demolition obligations and their resulting payments."

"Payments from the disposal of intangible assets in fiscal 2023 primarily resulted from the disposal of the rights 
to a non-strategic brand in the Healthcare business sector and a portfolio of licenses and patents in the 
Electronics business sector."
"Payments for acquisitions less acquired cash and cash equivalents in the previous year were primarily 
attributable to the acquisition of Exelead Inc., United States; M Chemicals Inc., Korea; and Erbi Biosystems 
Inc., United States (see Note (6) “Acquisitions and divestments”)."
"Net cash outflows for investments in financial assets mainly resulted from short-term investments in securities 
and term deposits that did not meet the requirements for classification as cash and cash equivalents."
"Net cash inflows from the disposal of other financial assets primarily resulted from repayments of short-term 
investments in securities and term deposits as well as from contingent consideration (see Note (36) “Other 
financial assets”)."
"The payments made for and received from the acquisition and the disposal of non-financial assets resulted from 
the short-term investment of available funds in marketable greenhouse gas emissions certificates."
Goods for resale are recognized at cost.
"The “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) method is used to determine the 
amortized cost of manufactured, finished, and unfinished materials, raw materials, and merchandise."
"The 
weighted average cost formula is applied for items such as supplies."
Inventories are tested for impairment using a business-sector-specific method.
"Under this method, cost is 
compared to the net realizable values."
"If the net realizable value is lower than the amortized cost, the asset is 
written down by a corresponding amount, which is recognized as an expense in the cost of sales."
"Impairments may be due to factors relating to the sales market, qualitative reasons, a lack of usability of the 
items, or their limited remaining shelf life."
"If the reason for impairment no longer applies, the carrying amount 
is adjusted to the lower of cost or the new net realizable value."
"Since inventories are, for the most part, not manufactured within the scope of long-term production processes, 
borrowing costs are not included."
Inventory prepayments are reported under other non-financial assets.
"Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  
Identification of impairments or reversal of impairments 
Discretionary decisions are required in the identification of impairment as well as in identifying the need to 
reverse impairment of inventories."
"There are estimation uncertainties with respect to the calculation of the net 
realizable value."
"In particular, changes in selling prices and expected costs of completion are considered in 
calculating this value."

Impairment losses included in the cost of sales are shown in Note (10) “Cost of sales”.
"For 
additions to trade accounts receivable, loss allowances are recognized to allow for expected credit losses."
"At initial recognition, other receivables are measured at fair value plus the direct transaction costs incurred 
upon acquisition of the asset."
"Trade accounts receivable that are potentially designated to be sold on account of a factoring agreement are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income."
"The measurement policies applied in determining loss allowances for trade and other receivables are shown in 
Note (42) “Management of financial risks” in the “Credit risks” section."
"Loss allowances and reversals of loss allowances are reported under “Impairment losses and reversals of 
impairment losses on financial assets (net)” in the consolidated income statement if the asset is used in 
ordinary activities and hence has an operative nature."
"If the asset is not used in ordinary activities and hence 
can be characterized as financial, it is recognized in financial income or financial expenses."
"Further information on the accounting and measurement policies governing financial assets can be found in 
Note (36) “Other financial assets”."
"Significant discretion and sources of estimation uncertainty   
Trade and other receivables 
Information on the significant discretion and estimation uncertainty concerning trade and other receivables can

"In 2023, trade accounts receivable in Italy with a nominal value of € 69 million (2022: € 68 million) were sold for

"Assessing the need for recognizing provisions for litigation is based on the likelihood of possible outcomes for 
proceedings."
"In particular, the factors influencing this likelihood are: 
• 
the validity of the arguments brought forward by the opposing party, and 
• 
the legal situation and current court rulings in comparable proceedings in the jurisdiction(s) in question."
"Provisions for environmental protection 
To assess a recognition obligation in relation to provisions for environmental protection and to quantify future 
outflows of resources, Merck draws on appraisals by independent external experts and the knowledge of in-
house specialists."
"Provisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes 
Objective assessments are performed to determine the need to recognize provisions for interest and penalties 
related to income taxes not covered by IAS 12."
"The uncertainties relate, in particular, to the 
assessment of the likelihood and the amount of the outflow of resources."
"Provisions for restructuring 
Estimation uncertainty about the provisions for restructuring primarily relates to determining the amount of the 
expected outflow of resources."
"This is largely influenced by the assumptions made concerning the change in or 
termination of the employment relationships of the affected employees and the planned implementation date of 
the restructuring plan."
"Provisions for environmental protection 
The assessment of a recognition obligation and the measurement of the provisions for environmental protection 
are subject to discretionary decisions and estimation uncertainties to a particular degree."
"The estimation uncertainties relate in particular to the assessment of the timing and likelihood of a future 
outflow of resources and the extent of necessary remediation measures as well as the related calculation of the 
amount of the liability."
"Provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations 
Estimation uncertainty regarding the provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations primarily relates to 
determining the amount of the expected outflow of resources."
"Provisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes 
Estimation uncertainty concerning the provisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes mainly 
relates to the interpretation of tax codes and the effects of amended case law."
"The European Commission 
imposed a fine in June 2013."
Appeals against the decision were unsuccessful.
"Following the payment of the fine 
of around € 18 million, British health authorities brought legal claims for damages against Merck and other 
companies in a mid-triple-digit million-euro amount in fiscal 2023 due to alleged infringements of competition 
law."
"In addition, there were further claimants from various other jurisdictions who have not yet quantified their 
claims."
"In response to the latest developments in the proceedings, the provision was adjusted as of 
December 31, 2023, and is now recognized in a high-single-digit million-euro amount."
"A cash outflow within the 
next 12 months is considered possible."
"A program to continuously improve processes and align the Group functions more closely with the businesses was 
launched in 2023."
The implementation of this program will take until at least the end of fiscal 2024.
"Provisions in a 
mid-double-digit million-euro amount were recognized for the program in the current fiscal year."
"Furthermore, 
additional programs to improve efficiency and increase customer focus in the Electronics and Healthcare business 
sectors were initiated during the current fiscal year."
"This resulted in the recognition of provisions in a mid-double-
digit million-euro amount that are largely expected to be utilized within the next two years."
"Environmental protection 
Provisions for environmental protection resulted in particular from obligations for soil remediation and 
groundwater protection in connection with the crop protection business in Germany and Latin America that was 
discontinued in 1987."
"Acceptance and follow-on obligations 
Provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations primarily related to costs in connection with discontinued 
development projects in the Healthcare business sector as well as obligation surpluses from onerous contracts."
"A significant proportion of the provisions for acceptance and follow-on obligations are attributable to the results 
of the two Phase III clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of evobrutinib."
"This resulted in the 
recognition of a provision for follow-on obligations in a high-double-digit million-euro amount in 2023."
"The 
outflow of resources is predominantly expected within the next 12 months."
"Part of the provision is also attributable to the discontinuation of development projects under the strategic 
alliance with GlaxoSmithKline, United Kingdom (GSK), and relates to the winding up of clinical trials."
"On 
February 5, 2019, Merck entered into a global agreement in the field of immuno-oncology with a subsidiary of 
GSK to co-develop and co-commercialize the drug candidate bintrafusp alfa."
"In the third quarter of 2021, it was 
amicably decided with GSK that the agreement on bintrafusp alfa would end effective September 30, 2021."
"The 
provisions recognized in a mid-double-digit million-euro amount included expected expenses for follow-on 
obligations."
The outflow of resources is mainly expected within the next 12 months.
"Interest and penalties related to income taxes 
Provisions for interest and penalties related to income taxes mainly included penalties arising from tax audits as 
well as interest payables associated with or resulting from tax payables."
"Miscellaneous other provisions 
Miscellaneous other provisions included provisions for asset retirement obligations, other tax risks not 
constituting income tax in accordance with IAS 12, risks in connection with employee participation programs 
and warranty obligations."
"The key factors in the identification of contingent liabilities are: 
• 
the validity of the arguments brought forward by the opposing party or the tax authority, and 
• 
the legal situation and current court rulings in comparable proceedings in the jurisdiction in question."
"The amount of the contingent liability is based on the best-possible estimate, which in turn is based on the 
likelihood of possible outcomes of proceedings and on the applicable license rate in patent disputes."
"Significant discretionary decisions and sources of estimation uncertainty  
Contingent liabilities 
The identification and the measurement of contingent liabilities are both subject to considerable uncertainty."
This applies with regard to assessing the likelihood of an outflow of resources as well as determining its amount.
"Contingent liabilities in the amount of € 204 million (December 31, 2022 (adjusted): € 231 million) related 
almost exclusively to litigation and tax matters."
Contingent liabilities from litigation mainly related to obligations under labor law and tort law.
"The contingent 
liabilities from tax matters primarily related to the determination of earnings under tax law, customs 
regulations, and excise tax matters."
"In this context, Merck has sued MSD in various countries and has 
been sued by MSD in the United States."
"An outflow of resources – except costs for legal defense – was not 
deemed sufficiently probable as of the balance sheet date to justify the recognition of a provision."
"Since the 
contingent liability from these legal disputes could not be reliably quantified as of the balance sheet date, this 
matter was not included in the total figure for contingent liabilities."
Contract liabilities include payments received by Merck prior to completion of contractual performance.
"Other non-financial liabilities comprises the following: 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Dec."
"The reduction in accruals for personnel expenses is due in particular to lower accruals for annual bonus 
payments for the past fiscal year and for the tranche of the Merck Long-Term Incentive Plan that is payable in 
the months following the reporting date."

"Provisions for other employee benefits included provisions for share-based payments, which are discussed in 
greater detail in the section on share-based payments in this note."
"The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by expert third parties according to the 
actuarial projected unit credit method."
"The discount rates for defined benefit pension plans are generally determined by reference to discount rates for 
similar durations and currencies calculated by external actuaries."
"This was based on bonds with ratings of at 
least “AA” or a comparable rating from at least one of the leading rating agencies as of the reporting date."
"The other actuarial assumptions used as the basis for calculating the defined benefit obligation, such as rates of 
salary increases and pension trends, were determined on a country-by-country basis in line with the economic 
conditions prevailing in each country."
"The latest country-specific mortality tables are also applied (Germany: 
Heubeck 2018G; Switzerland: BVG 2020G; United Kingdom: S3PA)."
These were average values weighted by the present value of the respective defined benefit obligation.
Both the benefit obligations and the plan assets are subject to fluctuations over time.
"The reasons for such 
fluctuations could include changes in market interest rates and thus the discount rate, as well as adjustments 
to other actuarial assumptions (such as life expectancy or expected future increases in pension)."
"This could lead 
to – or cause an increase in – underfunding."
"Depending on statutory regulations, it may become necessary in 
some countries to reduce underfunding and provide additional funding."
"In order to minimize fluctuations of the net defined benefit liability, Merck, in managing its plan assets, also 
pays attention to potential fluctuations in liabilities."
"The portfolio is structured in such a way that, in the ideal 
scenario, the impact of exogenous factors on the plan assets and the defined benefit obligations offset each 
other."
"Depending on the legal, economic, and fiscal circumstances prevailing in each country, different retirement 
benefit systems are provided for employees."
"Newly hired employees are only offered plans whose benefits are 
based on contributions and the return on their investments."
"Some of these plans require the employer to 
guarantee a minimum return on investment."
"Other plans are generally based on the employee’s years of 
service and salary."
"Pension obligations comprise both obligations from current pensions and accrued benefits 
for pensions payable in the future."
"The value recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for pensions and other post-employment benefits was 
derived as follows: 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
€ million 
 
Dec."
"The defined benefit obligations were based on the following types of benefits provided by the respective plan: 
 
 
 
Dec."
"These obligations were based on benefit rules comprising 
benefit commitments dependent on years of service and final salary, as well as two different direct 
commitments for employees newly hired since January 1, 2005, that are not based on final salary."
"The benefit 
entitlement for new members from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020, resulted from the cumulative total 
of annually determined pension components calculated on the basis of a defined benefit expense and an age-
based annuity table."
"The benefit entitlement for new members from January 1, 2021, resulted from the 
performance of salary-based employer contributions and voluntary employee contributions, topped up by the 
employer, to an external fund."
A minimum return on contributions has been guaranteed by Merck.
"There were 
no statutory minimum funding obligations in Germany."
"Pension obligations in Switzerland mainly comprised retirement, disability, and surviving-dependent benefits 
regulated by law."
The employer and the employees made contributions to the plans.
"Statutory minimum 
funding obligations existed."
"Consolidated Financial Statements___ Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements___ Employees

"The agreed benefits 
comprised retirement, disability, and surviving-dependent benefits."
"The employer and the employees made 
contributions to the plans."
Statutory minimum funding obligations existed.
"Covering the benefit obligations with financial assets represents a means of providing for future cash outflows,

Share-based payments 
Provisions are recognized for the share-based compensation program with cash settlement at Merck (“Merck 
Long-Term Incentive Plan”) and reported in other employee benefit provisions."
"The fair value of the obligations is calculated by an external expert using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the 
balance sheet date."
"The main parameters in the measurement of the share-based compensation programs with 
cash settlement are long-term indicators of company performance and the price movement of Merck shares in 
relation to the DAX®."
"A sustainability factor is also included in the valuation parameters for tranches issued 
from fiscal 2022 onward."
"The expected volatilities are based on the implicit volatility of Merck shares and the DAX® in accordance with 
the remaining term of the respective tranche."
"The dividend payments incorporated into the valuation model are 
based on medium-term dividend expectations."
"Changes to the intrinsic value of share-based compensation programs are allocated to the respective functional 
costs according to the causation principle."

costs."

"The 2021 tranche will not be subject to any value 
fluctuations between December 31, 2023, and the payout date, and was therefore excluded from the sensitivity 
analysis (December 31, 2022: exclusion of 2020 tranche)."
"These share-based compensation programs with cash settlement in place at Merck are aligned with target 
achievement based on key performance indicators as well as the long-term performance of Merck shares."
"Certain employees are eligible to receive a certain number of virtual shares – Merck share units (MSUs) – at the 
end of a three-year performance cycle."
"The number of MSUs that could be received depends on the individual 
grant defined for the respective person and the average closing price of Merck shares in Xetra® trading during 
the last 60 trading days prior to January 1 of the respective performance cycle (reference price)."
"When the 
three-year performance cycle ends, the number of MSUs to then be granted is determined based on the 
development of defined financial key performance indicators (KPIs)."
"In addition to the financial KPIs, a 
sustainability factor is included in performance measurement for tranches issued from fiscal 2022 onward."
"Depending on the development of these 
financial KPIs, at the end of the respective performance cycle the eligible participants are granted between 0% 
and 150% of the MSUs they could be eligible to receive."
"This means that, depending on the result of the financial 
KPIs (0% to -150%) and the sustainability factor, the eligible participants are granted between 0% and 180% 
of the MSUs they could be eligible to receive at the end of the respective performance cycle."
A cash payment is made based on the MSUs granted after the three-year performance cycle has ended.
"The 
value of a granted MSU, which is relevant for payment, corresponds to the average closing price of Merck 
shares in Xetra® trading during the last 60 trading days prior to the end of the performance cycle."
"The payout 
amounts of the respective tranches are limited to two and a half times the individual grant."

"Merck KG’s share of net profit 
E."
Merck KG and Merck KGaA engage in reciprocal net profit transfers.
This makes it possible for E.
"Merck KG, 
the general partner of Merck KGaA, and the shareholders to participate in the net profit/loss of Merck KGaA in 
accordance with the ratio of the general partner’s equity interest and the subscribed capital (70.274% or 
29.726% of the equity capital)."
The allocation of net profit/loss is based on the net income of both E.
"Merck KG and Merck KGaA, determined in 
accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code."
"These figures are adjusted for trade tax 
and/or corporation tax and create the basis for the allocation of net profit/loss."
"The adjustment for corporation 
tax is made to compensate for the difference in the tax treatment between the general partner and the limited 
liability shareholders."
"Corporation tax is only calculated on the income received by the limited liability 
shareholders."
Its equivalent is the income tax applicable to the partners of E.
"Merck KG which must be paid by 
them directly."
"The adjustment thus ensures that the share in net profit corresponds to the respective interests 
held by the two shareholder groups."
The reciprocal net profit/loss transfer between E.

"Merck KG adjusted for trade tax, on which the appropriation of profits is based, amounted to

"This resulted in a profit/loss transfer to Merck KGaA of € -4 million  
(2022: € 7 million)."
"Merck KGaA’s net income adjusted for corporation tax, on which the appropriation of its

"Merck KGaA transferred a profit of 
€ 692 million to E."
Merck KG (2022: € 684 million).
"In addition, an expense from corporation tax charges was 
reported in the amount of € 4 million (2022: expense of € 54 million)."
"Appropriation of profits 
The profit distribution to be resolved by shareholders also defines the amount of that portion of net profit/loss 
freely available to E."
"If the shareholders resolve to carry forward or to allocate to retained earnings a 
portion of Merck KGaA’s net retained profit to which they are entitled, E."
"Merck KG shall be obliged to allocate 
to the profit carried forward/retained earnings of Merck KGaA a comparable sum determined according to the 
ratio of subscribed capital to general partner’s equity."
"This ensures that the retained earnings and the profit 
carried forward by Merck KGaA correspond to the ownership ratios of the shareholders on the one hand and 
E."
Merck KG on the other hand.
"Consequently, for distributions to E."
"Merck KG, the available amount is the 
amount that results from netting the profit transfer of Merck KGaA with the amount either allocated or 
withdrawn by E."

This mainly related to cash and cash equivalents at subsidiaries that are subject to capital controls.
The maximum default risk was equivalent to the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents.
"They 
are presented separately in Note (39) “Derivative financial instruments”."
"Recognition and initial measurement 
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value and recognized as of the settlement date."
"For financial 
assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss in subsequent periods, initial 
measurement also includes directly attributable transaction costs."
"Any difference between the fair value of a 
financial instrument on initial recognition (Level 2 and 3) and the transaction price is recognized in income 
using the straight-line method over the duration."
"Detailed information on the measurement methods for financial assets measured at fair value are presented in 
Note (43) “Information on fair value measurement”."
This classification is based on the business model and the structure of contractual payment flows.
"Financial 
assets subsequently measured at amortized cost are accounted for using the effective interest method and 
considering any impairment losses."
"The procedure for calculating impairment losses is described in Note 
(42) “Management of financial risks”."
"Financial assets of this class are held in order to collect their 
contractual cash flows, which are exclusively principal repayments and interest payments on the outstanding 
capital amount."
"In particular, this includes contingent consideration that was contractually agreed with the 
acquirer within the context of the disposal of businesses within the meaning of IFRS 3 (see Note 
(43) “Information on fair value measurement”)."
"Merck does not utilize the option of the subsequent 
measurement of debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss."
"Equity instruments not subject to mandatory subsequent measurement at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in subsequent periods and if they are intended to 
be held for the longer term."
"Further details on the measurement of equity instruments at fair value are 
presented in Note (43) “Information on fair value measurement”."
"Financial assets are only reclassified in the rare event of Merck changing its business model with regard to the 
management of financial assets."
"Debt instruments with subsequent measurement at fair value through other 
comprehensive income increased in the year under review due to the purchase of commercial papers."
"As in the previous year, contingent consideration primarily included claims arising from the sale of the 
biosimilars business to Fresenius SE & Co."

1.9%)."
"Non-current liabilities to related parties in the amount of € 990 million (December 31, 2022: € 660 million) 
consisted of liabilities to E."
Information on liabilities to related parties can be found in Note (45) “Related party disclosures”.
"Capital management 
The objective of capital management is to ensure the necessary financial flexibility in order to maintain long-
term business operations and realize strategic options."
"Maintaining a stable investment grade rating, ensuring 
liquidity, limiting financial risks, as well as optimizing the cost of capital are the objectives of our financial policy 
and set important framework conditions for capital management."
"In this context, net financial debt as well as 
gearing, calculated as the ratio of EBITDA pre to net financial debt, are important capital management 
indicators at Merck."
"Traditionally, the capital market represents a major source of financing for Merck, for instance via bond issues."
"As of December 31, 2023, there were liabilities of € 3.9 billion from a debt issuance program most recently 
renewed in fiscal 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 4.5 billion)."
"In addition, Merck had access to a commercial paper 
program to meet short-term capital requirements with a volume of € 2.5 billion (December 31, 2022: 
€ 2 billion), none of which was utilized as of December 31, 2023, or the prior-year reporting date."
Loan agreements represent another major source of financing for Merck.
"On the balance sheet date, the 
financing commitments from banks in respect of Merck were as follows:

The liabilities to related parties primarily consist of liabilities to E.
"(39) Derivative financial instruments 
 Accounting and measurement policies   
Derivative financial instruments 
The IFRS 9 provisions are applied for hedge accounting."
"Hedging transactions are entered into for highly 
probable forecast transactions in foreign currencies and for hedging fair values of assets on the balance sheet."
"Cash flow hedge accounting for forecast transactions in foreign currency means the hedged item is recognized 
at a fixed exchange rate on a net basis instead of being recognized at the spot exchange rate at the transaction 
date."
"As a result of hedging fair values of assets on the balance sheet, the compensating changes in value of 
the corresponding hedged item and hedging instrument offset each other."
Merck only uses derivatives as hedging instruments.
"Merck uses the dollar offset method as well as regression 
analyses to measure hedge effectiveness."
Hedging ineffectiveness may occur in the timing of forecast cash flows or if hedged items are dissolved.
"Where options are used as hedging instruments, only their intrinsic value is designated as the hedging 
instrument."
"Changes in the fair value of the time value component of options that are used for hedge 
accounting are recognized in other comprehensive income and in the reserve for the cost of cash flow hedging 
within equity."
The subsequent accounting of these amounts depends on the type of hedged transaction.
"Where forward contracts are used as hedging instruments, only the spot element is designated as the hedging 
instrument."
"Changes in the fair value of the forward element in forward contracts are recognized in other 
comprehensive income in the reserve for the cost of cash flow hedging within equity."

"As no physical electricity is purchased, the own use exemption that allows certain 
derivative financial instruments to be treated as executory contracts does not apply."

"(42) Management of financial risks 
Market fluctuations with respect to foreign exchange and interest rates represent significant profit and cash flow 
risks for the Group."
"Merck aggregates these Group-wide risks and steers them centrally, partly by using 
derivative financial instruments."
"To estimate existing risks of foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, 
Merck uses scenario analyses."
"Merck is not subject to any material risk concentration from financial 
transactions."
"Merck uses marketable forward exchange contracts, options and interest swaps as hedging instruments."
"The 
strategy to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations arising from forecast transactions and 
transactions already recognized in the balance sheet is set by a risk committee, which meets on a regular basis."
"The use of derivatives is regulated by extensive guidelines and subject to ongoing risk controls by Group 
Treasury."
Speculation is prohibited.
"The strict separation of functions between trading, settlement and control 
functions is ensured."
Derivatives are only entered into with banks that have a good credit rating.
"Related 
default risks are continuously monitored."
"The Report on Risks and Opportunities included in the combined management report provides further 
information on the management of financial risks."
"Foreign exchange risks 
Owing to the international nature of its business, Merck is exposed to transactional foreign exchange risks 
within the scope of both its business activities and financing activities."
"Foreign exchange risks are continuously 
analyzed, and different hedging strategies used to limit or eliminate these risks."
"The entire foreign exchange exposure is divided into several defined subsets with different risk profiles and 
systematically hedged using suitable hedging instruments."
"Hedging is performed based on a regularly reviewed 
basket of currencies."
The maximum time horizon for hedging is 12 months.
"Foreign exchange risks from the following transactions are economically hedged through the use of foreign 
exchange contracts and currency options:  
• 
intragroup financing in non-functional currency, and 
• 
receivables from and liabilities to third parties in non-functional currency."

In this presentation, effects of cash flow hedges are taken into consideration in the equity of the Group."
"The net 
exposure of each of the above currencies consisted of the following components: 
• 
planned cash flows in the next 12 months in the respective currency, less 
• 
the nominal values of hedging instruments of these planned cash flows."
"The planned cash flows in the next 12 months are analyzed and divided into subsets in accordance with the risk 
management strategy."
"In the first subset, 25% of a regularly reviewed basket of currencies is hedged."
"The 
second subset hedges a more flexible basket of currencies selected on the basis of hedging costs and 
correlation with the euro."
"The hedging strategy achieves an economic hedge ratio of at least 40% across all 
hedging subsets."
"Depending on scenario analyses, this can be increased to up to 90% using a rule-based 
approach."
"As in the previous year, balance sheet items in the above currencies were economically hedged by 
derivatives in full if they did not correspond to the functional currency of the respective Group company."
"Accordingly, they do not affect the net exposure presented above."
"In addition to the transactional foreign exchange risks described previously, currency translation risks resulted 
from the fact that many of Merck’s subsidiaries are located outside the euro area and have functional currencies 
other than the reporting currency."
"Exchange differences resulting from translation of the assets and liabilities of 
these companies into euro, the reporting currency, are recognized in equity."
"Interest rate risks 
The Merck Group's net exposure to interest rate changes comprised the following: 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
€ million 
 
Dec."
"At the reporting date, agreements were in place with wind and solar farm 
operators in the United States and Spain."
"With the exception of a wind farm in the United States, the other wind 
and solar farms in Spain and the United States were still under construction."
"The fundamental structure of all of 
the agreements was identical, involving a fixed exercise price for Merck and the assumption of the exposure from 
variable spot energy prices in the respective market regions."
"Merck receives green electricity certificates for the 
volumes of electricity produced and attributed to Merck."
Merck uses the certificates it receives solely for itself.
"The 
agreements have remaining terms of between 10 and 17 years as of the reporting date."
"In financial terms, the most important agreement is the one concluded between Merck and a wind energy 
project developer in the United States for an installed capacity attributable to Merck of 68 megawatts."
"The wind 
farm was commissioned in fiscal 2022."
"The fair value of the agreement was € 44 million as of the end of the 
reporting period (2022: € 50 million)."
"The electricity price of around 40% of the expected production volume 
under this virtual power purchase agreement is hedged by a separate hedging instrument."
"Consequently, the 
net effect of the fixed price for the virtual power purchase agreement is zero for this quantity."
"The accounting 
provisions on hedge accounting were not applicable."
"In total, the agreements including the hedging instrument resulted in a net gain on fair value measurement of 
€ 3 million (2022: € 16 million) that was recognized in other operating income."
"Information on issued bonds 
and other sources of financing can be found in Note (37) “Financial debt/Capital management”."
Liquidity risks are monitored and reported to management on a regular basis.
"2 Previous year has been adjusted, please refer to Note (2) ""Reporting Principles""."
"Merck is exposed to credit risks mainly due to existing trade accounts 
receivable, other receivables, other debt instruments, derivatives and contract assets."
Credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis.
"The risks arising from extending credit to customers and in the 
course of other business relationships are also managed."
"Merck analyzes all trade accounts receivable that are more than 90 days past due in order to establish whether 
default exists."
"In addition, all other financial instruments that are more than 30 days past due are examined in 
order to establish whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk."
"Both methods are used to 
examine whether there is objective evidence of an impairment requiring the recognition of additional loss 
allowances."
"In order to 
measure expected credit losses, the assets are grouped based on the existing credit risk structure and the 
respective maturity structure."
"The customer groups with comparable default risks to be considered are determined according to the specific 
business sector and the place of business of the respective customers."
"The expected credit loss rates used in the simplified impairment model are derived on the basis of past default 
rates and current macroeconomic expectations."
"These country ratings are aggregated into three separate rating 
groups."
"Under the impairment model, past default rates and country ratings are used as an approximation of 
the defaults to be expected in the future."
"When a country’s rating changes, the historical default rates of the rating group to which the respective country 
has been reallocated have to be applied accordingly, rather than the historical default rates of the previous 
rating group."
"If there is objective evidence that certain trade accounts receivable or contract assets are fully or partially 
impaired, additional loss allowances are recognized to account for expected credit losses."
A default generally exists when the debtor cannot fully meet its liabilities.
"A debtor’s creditworthiness is assumed to be impaired if there are objective indications that the debtor is in 
financial difficulties, such as the disappearance of an active market for its products or impending insolvency."
"The nominal amounts of trade accounts receivable considered as originated credit-impaired financial assets are 
recognized using the risk-adjusted effective interest rate, which reflects the expected credit losses over the 
original lifetime."
"The individual credit rating of the contract partner is used to determine the impairment loss of 
other receivables."
"If there is considered to be a substantially increased risk of default, the expected credit loss 
is calculated over the entire lifetime."
"Individual cases are also analyzed to ascertain whether objective findings suggest that the value of other 
receivables is impaired."
"Such suggestions may include, for example, economic difficulties of the debtor, 
contractual breaches, or the renegotiation of contractual payment obligations."
"For financial assets with only a minimal default risk, the rules concerning the mandatory recognition of a risk 
provision for the lifetime expected credit loss are not applied at initial recognition or during subsequent 
measurement."
"Therefore, no assessment of whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk is 
carried out for such assets."
"Merck does not presume an increased credit risk as of the balance sheet date if the 
contract partner has an investment grade rating."
"If there are indications that the debtor’s creditworthiness has worsened but that this is not yet reflected in its 
existing credit rating, the credit risk assessment is adjusted and the impairment allowances recognized for 
expected credit losses are increased."
"In all other cases, there are no new risk assessments as of the balance 
sheet date and the risk profile initially assumed is maintained."
"Wherever a considerable increase in the default risk is assumed, the lifetime expected credit loss of the 
financial asset is considered."
"On the balance sheet date, the theoretical maximum default risk for all items referenced above corresponds to 
the net carrying amounts less any compensation from credit insurance."
"Impairment of other financial assets 
Discretionary judgment is applied in determining individual impairment allowances."
"The increase in loss allowances for trade accounts 
receivable was mainly attributable to a distribution partner in the Healthcare business sector in a mid-double-
digit million-euro amount."
"Credit risks from trade accounts receivable 
The credit risk from trade accounts receivable is largely impacted by the specific circumstances of individual 
customers."
"Merck also considers additional factors such as the general default risk in the respective industry 
and country in which the customer operates."
The credit risk of customers is assessed using established credit management processes.
"This is done in 
particular by analyzing the aging structure of trade accounts receivable."
"Merck continuously reviews and monitors the open positions of all its customers in the corresponding countries 
and takes steps to mitigate credit risks if necessary."
Other guarantees generally were not demanded.
"The scope of credit-insured receivables was immaterial for 
Merck."
"In addition, non-current leasing liabilities amounting to € 3 million (December 31, 2022: € 2 million) 
were allocated to Level 2 of the simplified impairment model."
"The next table shows the impairment losses 
recognized for other receivables."
"Credit risks from other financial assets 
Merck limits credit risks from other financial assets by entering into contracts almost exclusively with contract 
partners whose creditworthiness is good."
"The credit risk from financial contracts is monitored daily on the basis 
of market information on credit default swap rates and regularly on the basis of rating information."

"Changes in the expected credit loss rates used in the simplified impairment model did not result in any 
significant changes in the additions to and reversals of impairment losses in Level 2."
"In 
the case of non-derivative financial instruments, such as other liabilities or interest-bearing securities, this is 
reflected using risk premiums on the discount rate, while discounts on market value (credit valuation 
adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) are used for derivatives."
"Transfers between the individual 
hierarchy levels at fair value are made at the end of the month in which the triggering event – for example an 
initial public offering – took place."
"The 
main parameters when determining contingent considerations are: 
• 
the estimated probability of reaching the individual milestone events, 
• 
the underlying sales planning used to derive royalties, and 
• 
the discount factor used."
"To determine the 
sales plan, internal sales plans and sales plans of external industry services are used."
"The discount rate (after 
tax) of 6.6% as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: 6.3% to 7.3%) was calculated using the weighted 
average cost of capital."

"KGaA, Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany, on August 31, 2017."
It was calculated by an external valuation expert on initial recognition in 2017 and continued on this basis.

"In addition, we have audited the

Darmstadt, Germany, for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"Moreover, we have not audited 
the content of the disclosures described as extraneous to the combined management report."
"In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated 
financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the 
opportunities and risks of future development."
"Our audit opinion on the combined management report does 
not cover the content of the above-mentioned statements and disclosures extraneous to the combined 
management report."
"Pursuant to section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating 
to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."

Basis for the Audit Opinions 
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in 
accordance with section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No."
"537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU 
Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits 
promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW)."
"Our responsibilities under those requirements and 
principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s report."
"We are 
independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial 
and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements."
"In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we 
declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation."
"We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report."
"Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2023."
"These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in 
forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters."
"In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 
1."
"Recoverability of goodwill in the Electronics business sector 
2."
"Completeness and measurement of income tax liabilities 
Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: 
a) 
description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) 
b) 
auditor’s response 
1."
"The 
Electronics business sector represents a cash-generating unit."
"Recoverability of goodwill of the cash-generating unit Electronics was a key matter in our audit because we 
identified an increased impairment risk for this business sector as part of our risk assessment."
"The impairment 
test for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is based on a valuation of the Electronics 
business sector that involves discounting the planned future cash flows for this business sector at weighted 
average cost of capital using a discounted cash flow model."
"The planned cash flows are derived from the 
medium-term planning for the business sector approved by the executive directors, which is extrapolated based 
on assumed long-term growth rates."
"The result of this valuation highly depends on the executive directors’ judgmental determination of future cash 
flows and the discount rate for the business sector and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainties."
"Therefore, and as a result of our risk assessment, this matter was of particular significance in our audit."
"Other Information__ Reproduction of the Independent Auditor's Report 
352 
 
The disclosures of the executive directors on goodwill can be found in note 18 in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements."
"b) 
Among others, in our audit we obtained an understanding of the accounting-relevant controls included in 
the process and reproduced the methodological approach to performing the impairment tests."
"Where identified 
controls were relevant for our audit, we had their design and implementation tested."
"Where estimates were 
made by the executive directors, we assessed whether the methods applied, assumptions made and data used 
were acceptable."
"Regarding the projection of future cash flows, we firstly evaluated the planning reliability by 
reviewing the past adherence to planning, walked through the underlying planning process and conducted a 
critical assessment."
"We obtained a deep understanding of the parameters applied in determining the discount rate 
used, evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the calculation scheme and had them compared with general 
and industry-specific market expectations."
"Furthermore, due to the material significance of goodwill, we 
performed an additional own sensitivity analysis for the cash-generating unit (comparison of carrying amount 
with recoverable amount)."
"As part of our audit, we were supported by internal valuation experts."
"Using their 
help, we reproduced the methodological approach to impairment testing, the arithmetical correctness of the 
valuation model as well as the determination of the used discount rate."
"Completeness and measurement of income tax liabilities 
a) 
As at December 31, 2023, the amount recognized for income tax liabilities including liabilities for 
uncertain tax obligations is mEUR 1,473."
The Group operates in different jurisdictions with different legal systems.
"The application of local tax regulations 
and tax incentives as well as transfer pricing rules is complex."
"The recognition and measurement of income tax 
liabilities require the executive directors to exercise judgment in assessing tax matters and to make estimates 
regarding uncertain tax positions."
"In order to reinforce and validate their own risk assessment, the executive 
directors engaged external experts as deemed necessary."
"There is a risk for the consolidated financial 
statements that income tax liabilities are not fully recognized or not appropriately measured."
"For these reasons, 
this matter was of particular significance in our audit."
"The disclosures of the executive directors on recognition and measurement of income tax liabilities can be 
found in note 15 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements."
"Where identified controls were relevant for 
our audit, we had their design and implementation tested."
We obtained an understanding of existing tax risks through inquiry of employees in the tax department.
"We 
assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the external experts and evaluated their expert 
opinions."
"Furthermore, we analyzed correspondence with the competent tax authorities and assessed the assumptions 
underlying the determination of income tax liabilities based on our knowledge and experience of how the 
relevant legal requirements are currently applied by the tax authorities and courts."
"We used a risk-based audit 
approach to audit the accuracy of the calculation of the income tax liabilities."

Other Information 
The executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information."
The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board.
"The executive directors and the 
supervisory board are responsible for the statement according to section 161 AktG concerning the German 
Corporate Governance Code, which is part of the corporate governance statement, and for the remuneration 
report pursuant to section 162 AktG."
"Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for the other 
information."
"Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not 
cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of 
assurance conclusion thereon."
"In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have 
determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e."
fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.
"In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern."
"They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, 
matters related to going concern."
"In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going 
concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there 
is no realistic alternative but to do so."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation 
of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report."
"Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, 
individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users 
taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report."
"Other Information__ Reproduction of the Independent Auditor's Report 
355 
 
We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit."
"The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the 
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, 
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls."
"• 
evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness 
of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures."
"If we 
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the 
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if 
such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions."
"Our conclusions are based on the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report."
"However, future events or conditions may 
cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern."
"• 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business 
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the 
combined management report."
"We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit."
We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.
"• 
evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, 
its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides."
"• 
perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined 
management report."
"On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the 
significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and 
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions."
"We do not express a 
separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis."
"There is a 
substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information."
"We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we 
identify during our audit."
"From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore 
the key audit matters."
"We describe these matters in the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter."
"Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the “Group Auditor’s Responsibilities 
for the Audit of the ESEF Documents” section."
"Our audit firm has applied the requirements set forth in the 
IDW Quality Management Standards."
"1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to 
section 328 (1) sentence 4 no."
"The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of 
the financial reporting process."
"We exercise 
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit."
"• 
obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls."
"• 
evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e."
"whether the file containing the ESEF documents 
meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance 
sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file."
"• 
evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited 
consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report."
"Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation 
We were elected as Group auditor by the general meeting on April 22, 2022."
"We were engaged by the 
supervisory board on April 28, 2023."
"We have been the auditor of Merck Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien, 
Darmstadt/Germany, since the financial year 2023."
"We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor’s report are consistent with the additional report to 
the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report)."
"Other Matter – Use of the Auditor’s Report 
Our auditor’s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the 
audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents."
"In 
particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the 
audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form."

German Public Auditor Responsible for the 
Engagement 
The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Daniel Weise."
"Moreover, our assurance engagement did not consider any disclosures relating to prior periods."
"This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and 
making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial information of the Group that are reasonable 
in the circumstances."
"Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as the 
executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial reporting that is free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e."
fraudulent non-financial reporting) or error.
"The EU Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereunder contain wording and terms that are 
still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published 
in every case."
"Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy 
Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereunder in the section “Reporting in accordance with the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation” of the non-financial reporting."
"They are responsible for the defensibility of this 
interpretation."
"Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the 
legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties."
"The preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the non-financial reporting is subject to 
inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from 
assumptions made."

Independence and Quality Assurance of the Audit Firm 
We have complied with the German professional requirements on independence as well as other professional 
conduct requirements."
"Responsibility of the Independent Practitioner 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the non-financial reporting based on our 
assurance engagement."
"We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical 
Financial Information” issued by the IAASB."
The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner’s professional judgment.
"Other Information__ Reproduction of the Independent Auditor's Report 
361 
 
In determining the information in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive 
directors are required to interpret indeterminate legal terms."
"Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal 
terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our 
assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties."
"Our assurance engagement did not cover any external sources of documentation, expert opinions or references 
to external websites listed in the combined non-financial statement."
"We draw 
attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company’s purposes and that the 
report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement."
"Consequently, 
it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned."
"Accordingly, the report is not intended to 
be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it."
Our responsibility is to the Company alone.
We do not accept any responsibility to third parties.
"Our conclusion 
is not modified in this respect."
